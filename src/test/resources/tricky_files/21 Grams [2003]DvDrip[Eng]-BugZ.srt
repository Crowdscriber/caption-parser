{1595}{1655}No.
{1684}{1773}Until I ended up|flatlining at the hospital.
{1773}{1842}But I survived.|And instead of|letting that scare me,
{1842}{1924}I kept on going.
{1926}{1972}Until...
{1974}{2053}my first daughter|was born.
{2055}{2156}And now,|I look at my girls...
{2158}{2233}and my husband,
{2235}{2357}who has been standing|by me for so long.

{2689}{2746}Come on.
{2940}{2985}Well, you're not thinkin'.
{2988}{3048}Stealing might get you money,
{3050}{3100}you can tap|some cheerleader's ass,
{3103}{3163}you can show off riding|in some pickle-colored Thunderbird,
{3201}{3292}but tell me what's gonna happen|if you shoot a pregnant woman|or an old man, huh?
{3381}{3448}You know what'll happen?
{3448}{3518}The guilt will suck you|down to the bone.
{3810}{3858}Stealing ain't worth it.
{3858}{3925}Going to church,|reading the Bible...
{3925}{4021}and believing in Jesus, brother,|that's your ticket.
{4064}{4129}[Snickers]|Yeah.

{4692}{4752}No shit.|No shit.|You know what?
{4754}{4841}It wasn't luck.|It was Jesus who wanted me|to have that truck.
{4843}{4925}That's bullshit.|I bet you stole it.
{4925}{5004}Jesus gave me that truck.
{5037}{5133}And as He who gives|and He who takes away.

{5373}{5442}Take off the hat.
{5442}{5495}Take off that hat.
{5548}{5641}God even knows|when a single hair|moves on your head.
{5704}{5761}You're wrong, Nick.
{6391}{6502}So, this is death's waiting room.
{6504}{6576}These ridiculous tubes.
{6629}{6706}These needles swelling my arms.
{6832}{6916}What am I doing|in this pre-corpse club?
{6945}{7005}What do I have to|do with them?
{7106}{7189}{Y:i}I don't know when|anything began anymore...

{8899}{8978}{Y:i}It, uh, looks like you had|some kind of an infection...
{8980}{9076}{Y:i}that, uh, wasn't taken|care of properly.
{9079}{9143}We can try surgery,|but I have to tell you,|I think, uh,
{9146}{9229}the probabilities|are pretty slim.
{9231}{9286}Look.
{9289}{9385}Excuse me for asking this,|but it's important|that you tell me the truth.
{9409}{9464}{Y:i}Have you ever|had an abortion?
{9625}{9699}{Y:i}Yes.|Any reason?
{9735}{9836}I had already separated|from my husband|when I got pregnant,
{9836}{9903}and l...|No. I meant|a medical reason.
{9982}{10065}{Y:i}My husband's dying.|I'm sorry?
{10068}{10118}Paul, my husband,|he's dying,
{10121}{10176}and I want to have his baby.
{10205}{10324}{Y:i}We can operate then|and hope you get pregnant|within three or four months.

{10593}{10658}How'd it go?|Not good, Reverend.

{22189}{22287}No, Jack,|that's not the problem.|What's the problem?
{22289}{22366}The problem is some members|have started complaining|about your tattoos.

{22450}{22503}You can't see it.|Is gonna cover that one|on your neck right there.

{23148}{23227}Look, I cut you|a hefty severance check,
{23229}{23292}and you can pick it up|on the way to the cashier's.

{26798}{26862}Amen.|Amen.
{27040}{27093}I got fired|from the club today.
{27206}{27253}'Cause of your|good pal Brown, right?

{27321}{27390}{Y:i}- Believe that, Jack?|- Yes, I do.

{29825}{29881}I fired her.
{29883}{29955}What, you fired her?|Why?
{29985}{30043}She made me feel|like a cripple.
{30045}{30108}Oh, goddamn it, Paul.
{30110}{30161}So, now who's going|to cook for you?
{30163}{30233}Who's going to clean up after you?|Who's going to take care of you?
{30235}{30281}{Y:i}Who?|I can do it for myself.

{45673}{45719}{Y:i}Yeah.|Whose heart do I have?
{45721}{45829}{Y:i}Uh, I can't tell you.|It's hospital regulations.
{45832}{45899}Just like the donor's family|doesn't know your name either.
{45901}{46001}- But you know.|Yes.
{46001}{46092}This is your heart now.|That's all that should|matter to you.
{46092}{46140}{Y:i}- I wanna know who saved my life.|- If you want, you can write..
{46143}{46205}an anonymous letter to the family|through the donor's association.
{46207}{46289}Personally, I think it's better|that you don't know.
{46625}{46704}Mrs. Peck?|I'm Dr. Jones.
{46706}{46775}What happened|to my family?|Please, sit down.
{46775}{46842}No, l-I'm okay.|What happened?
{46845}{46905}Well, your husband|and your daughters|were hit by a car,
{46907}{46984}and we had to perform|emergency surgery on your husband.
{46984}{47054}{Y:i}Your husband suffered|multiple skull fractures,
{47056}{47140}{Y:i}and we had to remove blood clots|from around the brain.
{47140}{47241}He's in critical condition,|and we're concerned that|he's showing low brain activity.
{47243}{47349}What?|Is he gonna be all right?
{47377}{47423}We're doing the best we can.
{47425}{47495}{Y:i}And what about|my daughters?
{47633}{47734}Your youngest daughter|was brought in with severe bleeding.
{47737}{47820}She just wasn't able|to get here in time.
{47823}{47928}I'm very sorry.|They... They both died|in the accident.
{48010}{48070}{Y:i}No.
{48072}{48171}No. Oh, my...|Oh! Oh! Oh!
{48212}{48262}Oh, my God!
{48305}{48374}No! Oh, my God!
{48376}{48439}Do... Oh!
{48501}{48547}{Y:i}Wh</i>... Where are they?
{48592}{48667}Where... Where are they?
{48695}{48789}{Y:i}Mrs. Peck, your girls are here,|and you can see them|if you like, but
{48791}{48873}{Y:i}I wanna see them.|Mrs. Peck,|I wouldn't recommend it.
{48875}{48974}Oh, God, Daddy.|Oh, Daddy!
{48976}{49039}{Y:i}I'm very sorry.|If you'll excuse us,
{49041}{49103}{Y:i}we have to get back|to Mr. Peck.
{49103}{49174}{Y:i}Uh, I'm very sorry.
{49297}{49371}Oh, God! Oh!
{49460}{49503}We want dinner!
{49506}{49570}Marianne, we'd like|some dinner in here!
{49630}{49736}{Y:i}Tell Reverend John to stay.|Make sure no one notices|and get everyone to leave.
{49738}{49805}{Y:i}What happened?|Trish, just do|what I tell ya!
{49841}{49906}Okay, baby.|It's gonna be okay.
{49933}{50006}It's gonna be okay.|Yeah.
{50009}{50071}Come on.|Start the truck up.
{50073}{50155}Start the truck up.|Pull it in.|Come on, baby.
{51061}{51111}{Y:i}Hey, Jack.
{51143}{51195}What are you|doing here, man?
{51222}{51284}Just came to pick up|my things, Brown.
{51538}{51583}Why don't you let me|buy you a couple of beers?
{51586}{51627}I don't drink, Brown.
{51627}{51679}How about a Diet Coke?
{51682}{51770}You know, I've been talking|to a buddy of mine about|hooking you up with a job.
{51770}{51830}Been telling him|all about you.
{51883}{51965}So, what do you say, huh?|I've been feeling shitty|about what went down.
{51967}{52037}Come on.|I understand.
{52039}{52085}So, what do you say?
{52087}{52195}As you know, the doctors|did everything they could|to save your husband's life,
{52197}{52293}but he has shown|no brain activity.
{52296}{52403}We're here to help you|with some of the final decisions|that need to be made.
{52403}{52458}We have a patient...
{52461}{52533}who is gravely ill.
{52535}{52621}I'm here to give you|some information|on organ donation.
{52645}{52722}Are you willing|for your husband|to donate his heart?
{52722}{52780}- Can we discuss this another time?|- I'm afraid not.
{52782}{52880}I can give you time to discuss it,|but this is a decision|that needs to be made soon.
{52883}{52928}{Y:i}Paul?
{52960}{53008}{Y:i}Paul, the beeper.
{53199}{53249}It's the hospital.
{53252}{53300}I think they've|got a heart.
{53443}{53568}Hello? Yes,|I'm calling on behalf|of Mr. Paul Rivers.
{53571}{53621}Yes.
{53647}{53710}Okay.|Yes, I understand.
{53712}{53760}Where do I|have to take him?
{54467}{54515}Good luck, my love.
{56164}{56219}Hello.
{56260}{56320}Hello.
{56351}{56408}Does your shoulder|bother you?
{56408}{56461}Why?|Because I was watching you|swim before,
{56461}{56521}and you have a wide stroke.
{56521}{56593}If you bring it in tighter,|you get a better glide.
{56655}{56727}Thanks for the advice.
{56857}{56893}Do you mind|if I join you?
{56893}{56996}- Actually, I was just leaving.|- Here you go.
{57087}{57144}Maybe just until you finish?
{57146}{57213}No. Maybe next time.
{57410}{57504}Did you know that eating alone|can cause kidney damage?|And that's bad.
{57638}{57708}Well...|Okay, sorry.
{58410}{58494} Hello?
{58494}{58542}Hello, is Ana there?
{58544}{58590}What?
{58592}{58647}Is Ana there?|Hang on a sec.
{58647}{58712}Ana. Ana!
{58715}{58759}Telephone.
{58786}{58858}{Y:i}Hello.
{58894}{58939}Hello?
{58999}{59047}Who was that?
{59294}{59374}Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.|If you need me to pick up anything|along the way, let me know.
{59376}{59441}{Y:i}Look, Daddy, a pigeon!|Girls, no, don't touch!
{59441}{59520}Laura, stop it.|Gimme a call on my cell.
{59522}{59577}I'll see you in a bit.|Bye.
{60251}{60304}Did you go?
{60416}{60476}Are they dead?
{60656}{60713}I'm gonna turn myself in.
{60713}{60788}{Y:i}John says nobody saw you.|Nobody.
{60790}{60871}They don't know the license plate|or what kind of car. Some asshole|even swears it was a cab.
{60871}{60958}Marianne, what would you do|if these were our children?|Tell me.
{60960}{61030}But they're not.|It didn't happen to us.
{61107}{61171}No, it didn't happen to us.
{61173}{61231}It happened to me.
{61586}{61672}What the fuck do you gain|by turning yourself in?
{61674}{61720}It's my duty, Marianne.
{61722}{61802}No, Jack, your duty|is here with us.
{61804}{61850}With your family.
{61902}{61950}My duty's to God.
{61950}{62043}Please.|Marianne,
{62046}{62098}get outta my way.
{62132}{62177}{Y:i}Jack.
{63503}{63579}Oh, buddy,|right there!|Yes!
{63579}{63651}My turn.
{63651}{63733}I think I better|go back to the hospital.
{63817}{63891}{Y:i}Hey, he deserves it.|I thought your doctor said|you're not supposed to eat that.
{63891}{63944}I'm making up|for lost time.
{63947}{63999}{Y:i}Lost time, not lost pounds.
{64002}{64052}{Y:i}We're gonna have to|send you back for liposuction.
{64054}{64186}{Y:i}Well, here's to all those|who didn't think I was going to die.
{64189}{64242}{Y:i}Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!
{64242}{64302}{Y:i}To the first day|of my new life.|Congratulations.
{64304}{64342}Cheers.|It's good|to have you home, man.
{64342}{64430}{Y:i}I knew you'd make it.</i>|I told you.
{64433}{64488}I also have|an announcement to make.
{64490}{64601}I wanted to tell you|that Paul and I|are going to be parents.
{64601}{64685}{Y:i}That's great.|There's a scary thought|Paul being a parent.
{64711}{64790}- You kept this real quiet.|- Have you told your parents yet?
{64790}{64857}We're going to be parents.|We just don't know when yet.
{64860}{64980}I'm going to have an operation,|and then we're going to try|artificial insemination.
{64982}{65069}{Y:i}Terrific. Terrific.|Artificial insemination, huh?
{65071}{65157}{Y:i}Professor, do your female students know|you no longer have lead in your pencil?</i>
{65157}{65209}{Y:i}Hey!|Come on!
{65257}{65322}{Y:i}Play nice!
{65325}{65387}{Y:i}Let's have more cake.|Let's pass the cake around.
{65879}{65926}Mr. Donneaud?|Mr. Rivers?
{65928}{65998}Yeah.|Thanks for coming.
{66000}{66094}Sorry I couldn't cancel|this appointment, but the way|I'm bowling today, probably should have.
{66094}{66166}Have a seat here.|Park it right there.
{67125}{67180}Can I bring you|something to eat?
{67182}{67242}I'm not hungry.|Honey, you need|to eat something.
{67245}{67317}I'm fine, Dad.
{67369}{67463}When your mother died,|I thought I wasn't going to make it.
{67489}{67609}I felt the world was falling|on me and that I was never|going to get up.
{67611}{67724}But, sweetie,|life goes on.
{67808}{67877}You know what I thought|when Mom died?
{67937}{68067}I couldn't understand|how you could talk to people again.
{68093}{68199}How you could laugh... again.
{68235}{68313}I couldn't understand|how you could play with us.
{68368}{68471}And no...|no, that's a lie.
{68507}{68584}Life does not just go on.
{68824}{68894}Louise is getting fat,|don't you think?
{68894}{68990}She's done nothing but eat|since Robert left her.
{68990}{69076}What?|She looks okay to you?
{69078}{69152}Why did you tell everybody|we're having a baby?
{69154}{69224}I wanted to share|our plans with them.
{69226}{69322}Oh. That's what I mean,|they're our plans.
{69325}{69399}Why does everyone have to|know our private life?
{69399}{69454}Why the fuss?|They're our best friends.
{69457}{69541}Yeah, but we haven't|even talked about it.
{69543}{69615}Oh, we haven't?|I thought this was|more than settled.
{69618}{69675}Things change, Mary.
{69711}{69759}Something we have to|think about.
{69761}{69807}I don't have anything|to think about.
{69809}{69867}I've already|made my decision.
{69991}{70041}Would you help me|with the glasses?
{70236}{70289}{Y:i}So young.
{70322}{70370}{Y:i}You want me to stay|with you tonight?
{70370}{70432}I'm okay. Thanks.
{70521}{70584}I just wanna be alone.
{70823}{70871}Cris,
{70938}{70991}the police called.
{71024}{71120}They said you need to|go and press charges.
{71123}{71178}I'll go with you|if you want.
{71180}{71243}I'm not going to do anything.
{71303}{71399}Y... This guy was...|was some ex-con.
{71401}{71449}Are you really gonna let him|just walk the streets?
{71449}{71497}What do you want me to do?
{71497}{71561}Well, he ran over|Michael and your daughters.
{71563}{71623}Nothing I can do|is going to bring them back.
{71626}{71681}{Y:i}Do you get that?
{71935}{71990}Hey, how you doin'?
{71993}{72074}You found it okay?|Yeah, I did.
{72077}{72163}The donor's name|was Michael Peck.|He was 37 years old.
{72165}{72223}An architect|and married.
{72223}{72330}This is the authorization|for transplant signed by|his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.
{72330}{72407}I have a copy|of the medical report|if you care to see it.
{72409}{72505}And I also have the widow's|phone number and address|just in case you're interested.
{72508}{72585}How did Michael Peck die?
{72623}{72712}You might have seen it|in the newspaper.
{72714}{72810}This guy named JackJordan|ran over Mr. Peck|and his two little girls...
{72813}{72880}{Y:i}October 10|at 6.;50 p.m.
{72882}{72995}This JackJordan's a piece of work.|He's been in and out of jail|since he was 16.
{72997}{73048}Car thief,|small-time crook, drugs,
{73050}{73116}bad checks, alcoholism.
{73152}{73205}Last time he was in jail|has only been a few years ago.
{73328}{73383}You feeling okay, Mr. Rivers?
{73433}{73505}This is what you wanted,|isn't it?
{73507}{73582}Okay, I just, um...|You want some water?
{73649}{73716}He was, uh, an architect.
{73719}{73783}What's the point|in getting involved?
{73834}{73896}Mary, I wanna know|who I am now.
{73922}{73991}I don't think|that's the way to do it.
{74020}{74066}What is then?
{74130}{74193}{Y:i}Look for it with me.
{74226}{74298}Let's look ahead together,|not behind.
{74620}{74687}Damn it, Jack, it's your birthday|and you didn't even have|one drink with me.
{74687}{74734}Why don't you come over to my place?|I'm having a party.
{74734}{74782}Yeah, I bet they're all|as boring as you are.|[Laughs]
{74782}{74852}You'd be surprised.|No, man, I'll pass.
{74852}{74900}Listen, I'll call you later|about that job, okay?
{74902}{74948}All right, man.|All right.
{74950}{75001}Thank you.
{75075}{75125}Hey, Brown, you should.
{75128}{75173}I will.
{75957}{76036}{Y:i}Okay, now, we can schedule|the surgery, um,
{76039}{76108}I could get you in|as early as Monday.
{76142}{76221}{Y:i}Yeah.|9.;00 a.m.?
{76223}{76288}What's the percentage chance|that Mary will get pregnant?
{76291}{76343}{Y:i}Well, I can't offer you|a real number on that.
{76343}{76412}Um, you know,|there's the damage|from the abortion...
{76415}{76460}{Y:i}that wasn't handled properly.|the blockage
{76463}{76518}{Y:i}What abortion?
{76544}{76590}{Y:i}What abortion, Mary?
{76616}{76688}I can explain.|Explain what?
{76690}{76746}There is an explanation.|Uh-huh.
{76748}{76813}All that drama|about artificial insemination.
{76815}{76866}Kids' names.
{76868}{76942}You got pictures|of our friends' babies|all over the place.
{76945}{76990}Why?
{76990}{77050}So you can flush it|down the fuckin' toilet?
{77105}{77184}We've been a fraud|for a long time, Mary.
{77186}{77265}Oh, yeah?|Why didn't you tell me that|when you were sick, huh?
{77265}{77335}Or did you expect|one of your girlfriends|to come and take care of you?
{77337}{77412}You came back|because you wanted to.|Don't blame me for that.
{77414}{77474}I came back to take care of you|because I love you.
{77474}{77541}Or because|you were feeling lonely.
{77880}{77987}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{77987}{78088}I can't keep going like this.
{78090}{78145}The insemination,|the child.
{78148}{78251}It's like we're trying to|put a Band-Aid on something|that's just been bled dry.
{78287}{78342}It's finished.
{78344}{78488}But it... it isn't finished|if we give it a chance|and have this baby.
{78491}{78536}When we could have,|you didn't want to.
{78539}{78618}We were separated, goddamn it!|It's different now!
{78620}{78703}Yes, it's different.
{78706}{78804}We gonna go?|You only know how|to think about yourself.
{78982}{79039}{Y:i}Close six!
{79150}{79200}Well, thanks|for finally seeing me.
{79272}{79332}They tell me|you don't want to eat.
{79356}{79414}I'm not hungry.
{79440}{79559}Jack, Jesus didn't come|to free us from pain.
{79562}{79624}He came to give us|the strength to bear it.
{79626}{79686}Maybe He wanted|this pain for me.
{79689}{79746}{Y:i}No, He had nothing|to do with this.|It was an accident.
{79749}{79797}No, it wasn't an accident.
{79797}{79864}Jesus chose me for this.
{79890}{79948}Jack,
{79948}{80008}ask for the mercy|ofJesus Christ.
{80049}{80097}If it was an accident,
{80099}{80166}why do I have to ask|for His mercy?
{80169}{80229}"I will have mercy|on whom I will have mercy.
{80229}{80291}"I will have compassion|on whom I will have compassion.
{80293}{80360}- Don't be so prideful. That's a sin.|- "And the fearful and unbelieving.
{80362}{80434}{Y:i}"And the abominable,|the murderers, the warmongers,|Jack, listen to me.
{80436}{80494}"The sorcerers and the idolaters|and all liars...
{80496}{80559}{Y:i}Jesus came to save us,|not to damn us.|"Shall have their part...
{80561}{80612}in the lake which burneth|with fire and brimstone."
{80614}{80676}{Y:i}Revelation 21:8.|Jesus, loves you.
{80679}{80744}But He also knows how to punish|arrogant sinners like you.
{80746}{80832}"As many as I love,|I rebuke and chaste."|Revelation 3:19.
{80835}{80928}{Y:i}- Jesus betrayed me.|- Stop this shit, or you're|going straight to hell!
{80931}{80986}Hell?
{80988}{81051}This is hell.|Right here!
{81053}{81105}{Y:i}You're damning your soul!|You shut up now...
{81107}{81158}{Y:i}and ask Christ|to forgive you!|Hey! Forgive me?
{81160}{81247}I did everything|He asked me to do!|I changed!
{81249}{81335}{Y:i}I gave Him my life,|and He betrayed me.
{81338}{81417}He put that fucking truck in my hand|so I could carry out His will.
{81419}{81465}Made me kill that man|and those girls.
{81467}{81532}But hey, He didn't|give me the strength|to stay and save them.
{81532}{81621}Don't blaspheme, you bastard!|Christ had nothing to do with this!
{81681}{81765}God even knows|when a single hair|moves on your head.
{81803}{81856}And you taught me that.
{81918}{81990}{Y:i}We're gonna pray|for you, Jack.

{129389}{129439}You understand what I'm saying?
{129439}{129559}It was transplanted into me|at St. Francis Hospital|on October 11.
{129559}{129607}No. No.
{129607}{129691}I tried to tell you.|I just didn't know|how to tell you.
{129696}{129787}How dare you.|How dare you!|Cristina...
{129787}{129849}How fucking dare you!|I'm here for a reason.
{129854}{129907}Get out of my house!
{129907}{129969}Cristina...|Don't touch me!
{129969}{130029}Get out of my house now!|You make me sick!
{130033}{130081}I had a reason.|Can't you see that?
{130084}{130163}You get out of my fucking...|Get the fuck out of my house!|Okay.
{130168}{130216}You make me sick!
{130216}{130269}Get out!
{131872}{131920}Good morning.
{132145}{132193}Why did you look for me?
{132297}{132349}Because I needed to.
{132378}{132445}I don't want your fucking pity.
{132488}{132536}That wasn't it.
{132716}{132783}I was sick, Cristina.|I was very sick.
{132862}{132958}I was dying when Michael|gave me his heart.
{133054}{133102}He saved my life.
{133240}{133343}I tried in every way that|I knew how to find out...
{133343}{133411}who had given me this heart.
{133411}{133507}And that's how I found out how|he and your daughters had died.
{133646}{133725}And it's very painful for me|to know how I got this heart.
{133754}{133809}And I couldn't sleep.
{133840}{133929}I just... I wanted to thank you.|I wanted to help in some way.
{133929}{134000}I just want to|thank you for...
{134115}{134168}But I couldn't find you.
{134266}{134343}And then I saw you...
{134343}{134394}that day.
{134485}{134538}And now I can't|be away from you.
{134633}{134681}I can't.
{134868}{134918}{Y:i}You don't have to be afraid.
{134988}{135038}I've got a good heart.
{135441}{135492}I'm scared too.
{138123}{138195}Why did you leave us, Jack? Why?|I am where I have to be.
{138197}{138286}Gina got really sick because|of the hamster. Jack, we need you...|The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.
{138317}{138444}Back when I was mean,|about the decisions I make,
{138449}{138504}that's my mirror.|Just come back, please.
{138504}{138571}That's my mirror.|Jack, it doesn't matter.
{138571}{138672}And I have to live with them|alone. Alone.|Just come back to us, Jack.
{138675}{138779}And I can't erase it.|No one can erase it.|Your family needs you.
{138779}{138842}Jack...
{139017}{139089}{Y:i}We need to stabilize him before|we can get him to the hospital.
{139094}{139197}But right now what we really need|are units of B-positive blood.
{139197}{139252}L-I'm O-positive.|Will that work?
{139252}{139324}Okay, open and close your fist|several times.
{141874}{141927}{Y:i}Unit 35, go ahead.
{142010}{142113}{Y:i}Okay, pal, you're free to go|for lack of evidence
{142181}{142272}Your story doesn't check out|and contradicts our investigation...
{142272}{142375}and the statements made by|Mrs. Peck and Mr. Rivers.
{142380}{142440}I just need you to sign here.
{142445}{142512}{Y:i}What if I really am guilty?
{142512}{142572}Yeah, well, it happens.
{142572}{142646}Won't be the first time,|won't be the last.
{144163}{144214}What are you doing?
{144218}{144322}You've been lost for too many days,|don't you think, you prick?
{144326}{144417}Mary, I don't want to fight.|I want this to end well.
{144417}{144513}Oh, you think ending well means|disappearing for a few days?
{144513}{144597}You just waited till you got better|to tell me to fuck off.
{144599}{144671}I'm going back to London.|We can't keep doing this.
{144671}{144724}Really?
{144724}{144815}I'll have surgery and I'll be|inseminated with your child,|with or without you.
{144820}{144901}Mary, what for? Why?|Because I want to.
{144942}{144997}Well, I won't authorize that.|No.|Oh, no?
{145002}{145045}Well, you already have.
{145050}{145113}{Y:i}I have a signed copy|of your authorization|to use your semen.
{145117}{145201}Would you excuse me?|I get what I want.|What do you gain? What do you gain?
{145201}{145265}You decide if you come|looking for me or not.
{147955}{148003}{Y:i}Hi, honey.|I'm on my way home.
{148003}{148094}{Y:i}If you need me to pick up anything|along the way, let me|Girls, no! Don't touch!
{148094}{148185}Laura, stop, it.|Gimme a call on my cell.

{148571}{148674}Gimme a call on my cell.|I'll see you in a bit. Bye.
{150764}{150814}{Y:i}I'm grilling some chicken.|You want anything to eat?
{150819}{150879}No. Thanks.
{150883}{150970}{Y:i}I can make you a sandwich if you|No. No, no, no! No!

{152279}{152332}Katie could have lived.
{152374}{152422}What?
{152446}{152530}She'd be alive right now,|but that bastard left her there...
{152585}{152657}lying in the street.
{152662}{152765}He left the three of them|like animals. He didn't care.
{152864}{152916}At least she could|be here with me.
{152948}{153063}That son of a bitch is walking|the streets, and I can't even|go into their room.
{153068}{153111}What do you mean|he's walking the street?
{153194}{153247}I want to kill him.
{153247}{153302}You want to kill him?
{153302}{153393}I'm gonna killJackJordan.|I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
{153393}{153453}Slow down. Wait.|Just-Just slow down.
{153453}{153563}Slow down? Slow down|while I what? Huh?|While I what?
{153568}{153616}Take it easy.|Take it easy?
{153616}{153729}My husband and my little girls|are dead and I'm supposed to|take it fucking easy?
{153731}{153820}I can't just go on|with my life!
{153820}{153955}I am paralyzed here!|I am a fucking amputee,|do you see that?
{153955}{154019}Who are you?
{154019}{154110}{Y:i}You owe it to Michael.|No, you've got his heart.
{154114}{154208}{Y:i}You're in his house fucking his wife|and sitting in his chair!
{154208}{154273}We have to kill him!|No, we...|Not like this. Not like this.
{154278}{154333}Then how?|Tell me how!
{154793}{154925}Katie died|with red shoelaces on.
{154953}{155025}She hated red shoelaces.
{155025}{155160}And she kept asking me|to get her some blue ones,
{155160}{155215}and I never got her|the blue ones.
{155261}{155364}She was wearing those fucking|red shoelaces when she was killed.
{155737}{155792}Oh, God.
{155792}{155924}You shouldn't have done it!|Close your... Close your goddamn eyes!
{156056}{156104}{Y:i}Oh.
{156152}{156222}You... murderer.
{156227}{156291}You just let them|lie there on the street.
{156291}{156365}Those two little girls,|you just let them die like dogs.
{156370}{156418}I should have killed you.
{156456}{156576}Now you disappear.|Don't even go back to the motel|and get your things.
{156576}{156641}Just disappear.
{157588}{157672}Mrs. Peck.|How is he?
{157674}{157758}We weren't able to use|your blood for his transfusion.
{157763}{157895}We found very high levels|of illegal substances in your blood.|You're taking very high risks here.
{157897}{158024}Well, that's my problem.|In your state, I suggest|you stop using these substances.
{158028}{158117}What are you talking about?|You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck.
{158244}{158355}You sure?|You really need to start|taking care of yourself, Mrs. Peck.
