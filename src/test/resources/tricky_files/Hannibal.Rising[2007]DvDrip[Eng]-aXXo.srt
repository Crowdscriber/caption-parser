1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:10,427


2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,106
Hide! Quickly!
Run away.

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,909
Back. This way.

4
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,209
Quick, this way.

5
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,005
Quickly, come on.

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,600
Down to the lake.

7
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,880
- M for Mischa.
- Mischa.

8
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,887
Come on! Come on, let's go!

9
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,021
Come on, Lothar.

10
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,108
- Hurry now. Give me the bathtub.
- Yes, sir.

11
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,613
Hannibal, Mischa,
where have you been?

12
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,407
Hurry now. Quickly!

13
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,078
Hannibal! Come here.

14
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,879
Come on...

15
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,592
Darling, the cart is packed.
Everything is ready.

16
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,888
Hurry up. Come on, come on.

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,599
Come on, old boy. Come on.

18
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,729
Hey... Colonel Timka says the fighting
will be close to the roads.

19
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,315
It can't last more than a few days.

20
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,567
We'll be safe at the Lodge.

21
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,779
Come on, we're almost there.

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,703
No, no, no, no, no.
The bath has to be for the dirty clothes.

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,621
Yes, Madam.

24
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,914
In you come.

25
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,290
Let's see if our toys are still there.

26
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,501
- Hand me the bath.
- I'll take care of that, sir.

27
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,420
No, no, it's fine. But let's hurry.

28
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,588
Cook will have finished packing
the kitchen

29
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,006
by the time you get back.

30
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,806
Mischa.

31
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,603
Hannibal, give them here.
Mama's pearls.

32
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,191
Blow.

33
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,321
Pearls before swine?

34
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,494
Mischa, blow.

35
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,692
Shut up! Shut up!
The Major's here.

36
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,531
You are a Jew.

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,702
How could I eat your cooking?
Dispose of him.

38
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,416
How do you deal with locals,
being locals yourself?

39
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,504
You say you want to be SS,
let's see you earn it.

40
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,719
Kill the Jew.
Bring me the peasant.

41
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,807
Move! Move!

42
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,520
Move, you fat fucking Jew.
Move! Move!

43
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,320
- Are you a gypsy?
- No, sir.

44
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,913
Are you a Jew?

45
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,791
No, sir.

46
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,086
Good job!

47
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,799
Why don't you show us your dick?

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,222
Major! Russian tanks moving west!

49
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,225
Put all their food on the trucks.
Move it!

50
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,067
What's that?

51
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,202
- It's a tank, a Russian tank.
- Get away from the window!

52
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,496
Lothar! Russians!

53
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,218
Everybody out of the house!

54
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,400
We only want water.

55
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,694
The children can stay in the warm.

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,199
- Get them inside.
- Go, Hannibal. Look after Mischa.

57
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,617
Start the pump.

58
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,632
Wait here.

59
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,595
Mama! Mama!

60
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,600
- How much longer with the pump?
- A few minutes.

61
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:41,318
- Stuka! Stuka!
- Shoot! Shoot!

62
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,906
Stay down!

63
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,794
Papa! Papa!

64
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,291
Mischa!

65
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,087
Hannibal!

66
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,007
Mama!

67
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,937
Mama!

68
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,899
Mama!

69
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,984
Hannibal!

70
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,696
No! No

71
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,409
Mischa! Mischa!
Mischa, go back.

72
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,912
- Go back, Mischa!
- Mama!

73
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,997
No, Mischa, go back!

74
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,499
Hurry! Hurry!

75
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,514
Come on, Grentz.

76
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,684
Kolnas, come on. Hurry!

77
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,608
Come on!

78
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,486
Get in the back.
Put it in the back.

79
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,906
Start the engine.
Start the engine.

80
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,325
I told you, Grutas,
we're going to die.

81
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,911
Relax. We're getting rich.

82
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,498
In. In, in, in. Go.

83
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,710
Grutas, isn't that the SS Major?

84
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,885
Major. Kill a few gypsies, you said.

85
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,888
Kill a few Jews,
and we'll make you SS.

86
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,808
If you had kept your word...

87
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,978
I would be saying
'yes, sir' to you now.

88
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,692
But now, I am in business for myself.

89
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,619
- Russians!
- The Russians. Move!

90
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,586
Go, go, go, go. Hurry!

91
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,010
<i>The Commissar has ordered that</i>
<i>all soldiers found looting are to be executed.</i>

92
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,720
They're shooting looters.

93
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,890
Stop and black out.

94
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,509
Come on!

95
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,011
- Put it down.
- Drop it now, you little fuck.

96
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,304
Put it down!

97
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,431
Or we shoot her.

98
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,685
- Give me that.
- Get the radio, Kolnas.

99
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,314
- Milko, check the kitchen.
- Fuck you!

100
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,608
I want Mama.

101
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,908
We're lucky, only kids.

102
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,911
If a patrol comes by...

103
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,414
...we saved them...

104
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,002
...and their family's stuff.

105
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,629
Grentz, check the door...

106
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,298
Pot Watcher...

107
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,341
Check upstairs.

108
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,968
Find some food.

109
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,184
...only rotten potatoes.

110
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:16,820
- <i>Find something... try the Germans...</i>
- <i>It's breaking up.</i>

111
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,405
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

112
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,584
<i>I need information, you idiot!</i>
<i>It's not a fucking toy!</i>

113
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,587
Wait! I have found some
thing under Russian frequency.

114
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,388
Road blocks.

115
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,184
Every five kilometers
from here to Vilnius.

116
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,314
So... we are stuck for now.

117
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,419
- Did you get something?
- It's freezing out there.

118
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,587
Open it.

119
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,592
You think these are peppercorns?

120
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,928
These are frozen maggots.

121
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,597
This was rotten before it froze.

122
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,401
I'll put this in your head.

123
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,570
Stop it, Grutas.

124
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,299
The boy is Hannibal Lecter.

125
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,305
And the little girl is Mischa.

126
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,132
We eat or die.

127
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,735
Let's hear you, Little Master.

128
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,114
- He's mute.
- He's not mute at night.

129
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,075
He can scream well enough
and he'll sing.

130
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:55,497
This is not your father's house any more.
It's the People's Orphanage.

131
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,584
...and you're just one more orphan.

132
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,006
Lecter! I'll see you in my office.

133
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:19,938
Hannibal, you do not
honor the human pecking order.

134
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,815
You're always hurting the bullies.

135
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,488
I know.
This was your Mother's room.

136
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,201
It must be difficult for you to live
in this house.

137
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,496
Go to bed.

138
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,626
Go to bed!

139
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,137
Everything all right?

140
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,280
Mischa!

141
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,412
Mischa!

142
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,624
Get up!

143
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,424
Now scream all you please.

144
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,685
Every day, you'll pay for this

145
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:44,314
Every day for the rest of your short
and nasty life.

146
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,933
Lecter!

147
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,770
He's not here.

148
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,398
<i>This way!</i>

149
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:43,887
Who's there?

150
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,099
Some help you are.
Shoo! Go!

151
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,731
- What is it, Serge?
- A boy, Madame.

152
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,192
He has pictures of you
and your husband.

153
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,398
Your Uncle would have
loved to see you, Hannibal.

154
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,776
It has been almost a year
since he died.

155
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,915
Only you and I are left now.

156
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,181
Mischa! Mischa!

157
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:13,977
Mischa!

158
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:21,443
Mischa!

159
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,323
Mischa! Mischa.

160
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,034
Mischa! Mischa.

161
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,327
Hannibal!

162
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:31,662
Mischa!

163
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,331
Hannibal, Hannibal! Wake up!

164
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,376
It's all right. It's all right.

165
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,383
When you sleep do you remember?

166
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,095
Do you remember
what happened to Mischa?

167
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,206
You look like your uncle, Hannibal.

168
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,588
Would you like to try?

169
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,798
Use this.

170
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,275
Hannibal!

171
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,398
Speak to me.

172
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,281
Thank you.

173
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:33,802
Hannibal!

174
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:51,528
Here is where I pray to my ancestors
for strength, for courage.

175
00:26:55,949 --> 00:27:00,412
I have the honor
only on my ancestor's birthday...

176
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,791
...to polish his armor
with oil of cloves.

177
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,810
This is after the fight
for Osaka Castle.

178
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,905
The samurai display the heads
of their enemies.

179
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,410
There are more suitable parchments
that will interest you.

180
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:46,708
Be gentle, Hannibal...
and be brave

181
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,087
...like your father.

182
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,299
And like him.

183
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,187
You must be ready for anything.

184
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,313
Come!

185
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:13,902
Again.

186
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:18,991
Again.

187
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,915
Good... again!

188
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,088
Hey, Japonese.

189
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,508
Hey, Japonese.

190
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,302
Monsieur... please.

191
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,805
- Is that all Madame?
- Yes.

192
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,518
Hey, Japonese, tell me the truth...

193
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,187
...does your pussy run crossways?

194
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:34,107
With a puff of straight hairs
like a little explosion?

195
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,402
Hannibal!

196
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,994
Don't move.

197
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,810
If you've pissed in my fuel tank,
I'll twist your head off.

198
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,814
Paul Momund, the butcher.

199
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:23,026
You owe a certain lady an apology.

200
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,320
Apologize to La Japonaise?

201
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,408
Boy, you must be crazy to come here,
I'll throw you in the river...

202
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:33,412
...or maybe I'll slit your pants
and give you something you don't want

203
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,289
...where you don't want it.

204
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:39,877
You inquired about her... pussy.

205
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,797
You speculated it ran which way?

206
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,008
Jap pussy runs crossways...

207
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,094
You should fuck that little Jap
and see for yourself, huh?

208
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,014
Crossways like that?

209
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,281
Or more tangential to the spine?

210
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,300
Do you see how your mouth
stains the air?

211
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,636
I should add that to my drawing.

212
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,805
Would you like to see it?

213
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:18,308
Yum!

214
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:25,899
Wait for me.

215
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,614
This wound was made
with a single blow.

216
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,618
Ah, Inspector Popil,
I'm very happy you could come.

217
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,328
You won't remember me but
I was with the...

218
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,206
Of course,
you delivered De Rais to Nuremberg...

219
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:44,376
- ...and sat behind him.
- I saw you bring the evidence.

220
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,171
It's an honor, sir.

221
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,301
- What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or most of him.

222
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:53,886
You have his dossier.

223
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,890
Yes. Fat and ugly.

224
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,809
He shipped Jews from Marseille.

225
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:03,896
He fought recently.

226
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,105
And often.

227
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,817
Last Saturday night in a bar fight.
He had many enemies.

228
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:11,904
A list, please.
His recent opponents.

229
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:16,575
- You've done nothing to this body?
- Oh, no, no, no, Monsieur.

230
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,369
- The Chief specifically...
- The odor it er...

231
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,413
it's not of anything you use here?

232
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,416
It smells like that toothache remedy.

233
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,210
Yes, oil of cloves.

234
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,795
Let's see the pharmacist.

235
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,508
Look.

236
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:36,887
The most exquisite bits of the fish
are the cheeks.

237
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,223
This is true for many creatures.

238
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:42,518
When carving at the table
you give one cheek to Madame...

239
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,312
- the other to the guest of honor.
- Did you hear?

240
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,106
They haven't found
the butcher's damned ugly head yet.

241
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,112
Good evening, my lady.

242
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,494
I hope you don't mind.

243
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:30,083
I would have used a butcher's knife,
but the sword seemed so appropriate.

244
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,681
Not a nick in the blade,
I promise you.

245
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,603
The butcher was like butter.

246
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:15,879
You didn't need to do this for me.

247
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,715
Rudeness is epidemic, my Lady.

248
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:27,516
Police.

249
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,023
They will call it murder.

250
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,485
At worst, a crime of passion.

251
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,994
Wash your hands, quickly. Go!

252
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:55,794
- Inspector Pop-il?
- Popil, Madame.

253
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:00,424
Hannibal Lecter?

254
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,510
Good evening.

255
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:07,222
You fought with the butcher
Paul Momund in the market.

256
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,184
Now he is dead.

257
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,604
I must ask you to come
along with me.

258
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,484
Is your name Hannibal Lecter?

259
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:21,987
Yes.

260
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:28,702
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

261
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,999
- Guilty knowledge?
- Limit your responses to yes or no.

262
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
No.

263
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,885
It's vanilla.

264
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:47,888
He reacts to nothing.

265
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,309
It's monstrous.

266
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:59,525
The butcher had been fishing.

267
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,403
There was blood and scales on his knife,
but no fish.

268
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,697
The tape tells you all that?

269
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,617
Remarkable.

270
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,703
No.

271
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:17,084
The Chef told me
you bought a splendid fish in for dinner.

272
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:21,380
- Where did you get that fish?
- By fishing, Inspector.

273
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,883
We keep a baited line
in the water behind the boathouse.

274
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:27,177
I'll show you if you like.

275
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,097
My speciality is war crimes.

276
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,393
And I know they do not end
with the war.

277
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:40,023
You lost your entire family.
So did I.

278
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:44,820
But for you, your beautiful Aunt came
and made up for it all.

279
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:49,116
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp.

280
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:53,370
So, when Paul the butcher
spewed filth at her...

281
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,706
I can understand if you killed him.

282
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,375
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

283
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,296
Together we could show a court...

284
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:06,717
The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp?

285
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,389
Do you compose verse, Inspector
and keep it under your pillow?

286
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:37,581
Now tell me, Inspector.
Did you choose war crimes...

287
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:41,627
- because you lost family in the war?
- Yes.

288
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:43,712
How?

289
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,509
Some in combat,
some were shipped east.

290
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,219
Did you catch who did it?

291
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:51,637
No.

292
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,307
But they were Vichy,
men like the butcher?

293
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:56,475
Yes.

294
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:01,188
Then we are both suspects.

295
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,608
I can say you were fishing with me,
if you like?

296
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,905
Inspector, you should see this.

297
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,910
I told you, lead these people away.

298
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,920
- That is the butcher?
- Yes, sir.

299
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:28,131
- How long?
- Ten minutes, no longer.

300
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,804
Father... Mother...

301
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:21,393
I'm the youngest student they've ever
admitted into Medical School.

302
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:24,521
It's a work scholarship.

303
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:27,399
I think you would be pleased.

304
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:32,404
<i>Death duties on my Uncle's estate...</i>

305
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:35,407
<i>have finally forced the sale</i>
<i>of the Chateau.</i>

306
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:39,203
<i>Lady Murasaki will leave</i>
<i>for Paris with me.</i>

307
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:43,207
<i>Her residency in France</i>
<i>is now under threat.</i>

308
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,297
<i>This work scholarship</i>

309
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,216
<i>means I must spend</i>
<i>much of my spare time...</i>

310
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:55,219
<i>preparing bodies</i>
<i>for the anatomy class.</i>

311
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:03,227
<i>My studies are fascinating</i>
<i>and absorb me completely.</i>

312
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,276
<i>Yet I still find myself</i>
<i>thinking about my sister.</i>

313
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:13,487
<i>and the men who took her from me.</i>

314
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,113
<i>Hannibal!</i>

315
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:23,413
Do you suppose
God intended to eat Isaac?

316
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,417
That's why he told Abraham to kill him.

317
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:31,713
Eat him?
Of course not.

318
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:35,092
The Angel intervenes in time.

319
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,596
Not always.

320
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,605
I have to know about Mischa.

321
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:54,903
I can see their faces in my dreams...

322
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,780
but I can't remember
what they called each other

323
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:58,782
with their bloody mouths.

324
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,996
I would give anything to remember.

325
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,293
Hannibal...

326
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:14,423
memory is a knife, it can hurt you.

327
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:40,991
I want to stay here with you.

328
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:45,204
No. You must stay at school.

329
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:08,018
Louis, I need you to remember...

330
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:11,897
Who told the Nazis
where the children were hidden?

331
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:14,525
You must remember.

332
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:19,196
I can't bear to think about it.

333
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:22,407
This will help you remember.

334
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:26,203
Hannibal Lecter?

335
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:28,413
What are you doing here?

336
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:33,377
The body.
I'm a medical student now.

337
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:36,588
Yes, I know.
I followed your progress.

338
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,882
You repeat nothing you hear
in this room.

339
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,513
Please, Louis.

340
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:48,016
Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auschwitz.

341
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,310
Who told him
where the children were hidden?

342
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:51,603
Did you tell him?

343
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:59,194
When they broke my fingers
I gave them Pardou.

344
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:04,700
Pardou knew
where the children were hidden.

345
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:11,498
He's Mayor of Belleville now.

346
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:17,296
- Thank you, Louis.
- Inspector?

347
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:21,008
Where were the police?

348
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:41,403
No, no, no. No, no, please, please.

349
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,133
You knew at once
what Louis wanted, didn't you?

350
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:06,678
His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.

351
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:10,599
He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.

352
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:15,979
Where were the police when the Nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

353
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:53,785
<i>Hannibal!</i>

354
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:11,720
Come and play.

355
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:18,685
One little cheek... two little cheeks.

356
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:20,979
Cough.

357
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,317
She has pneumonia.

358
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:26,610
Let's take her.

359
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:30,113
She's going to die, anyway.

360
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,004
Hannibal!

361
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:01,603
Come on!

362
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:05,315
- Get out!
- Grutas, wait!

363
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:07,693
The dog tags.

364
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,320
Come on!

365
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:13,198
Pot Watcher, hurry!

366
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:23,996
Passport.

367
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,679
- Student?
- Yes.

368
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,310
You need a new photograph.

369
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:12,794
Night report.

370
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:16,381
Entry visas for Kaunas.

371
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:39,112
Lecter...

372
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,069
The Lodge.

373
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:50,137
Kolnas.

374
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,141
Grutas.

375
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,621
Mischa.

376
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,517
Herr Dortlich.

377
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:42,022
On behalf of myself
and my late family...

378
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,608
I thank you for coming.

379
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:49,321
Do you remember the bathtub
bubbling on the stove?

380
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:52,741
She was dead anyway,
I swear it, she was.

381
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:07,339
So much mayonnaise, Herr Dortlich.

382
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,737
Where are the others?

383
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:33,448
I don't know.

384
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:56,013
Yes, I know where one of them is.
Grentz, I know Grentz.

385
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:57,931
- Grentz?
- In Canada.

386
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:00,350
He got out on the refugee boat
from Bremerhaven.

387
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:03,145
- What did he look like?
- Swarthy.

388
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:06,356
They wouldn't have let him
in the SS.

389
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:09,359
Oh yes, of course.

390
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:12,446
He was the one that
always provided the bowl.

391
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:14,239
What about Milko?

392
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:18,702
All dead. They're all dead
in the war.

393
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:21,121
I remember his singing.

394
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:27,544
And now your leader, Grutas?

395
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:31,840
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know. I don't know.

396
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:37,262
Please, please let me go
and I will testify against Grentz.

397
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:52,027
Do you remember
'Das Mannlein im Walde', Herr Dortlich?

398
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,035
Mischa loved that song.

399
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,747
Let's sing for Mischa.

400
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:19,429
You're not singing.

401
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:22,432
Sing for slack, Herr Dortlich.

402
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:39,032
It's Kolnas!
Kolnas deals with him!

403
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,454
Kolnas deals with him.

404
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,218
And where is Kolnas?

405
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:02,514
Fontainebleau!

406
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:35,714
'Purpurroten Mantelein', indeed.

407
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:47,035
He picked some wild mushrooms...
and made a brochette.

408
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,749
Mushrooms and cheeks.

409
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:44,009
Where have you been?

410
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:54,019
You smell of smoke
and blood.

411
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:12,329
Where did you go?

412
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:16,542
I found them.

413
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:20,921
The men who killed Mischa.

414
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,633
I have their names.

415
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,054
They're here in France.

416
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,349
Where?

417
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,019
Fontainebleau.

418
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:57,916
Ortolans.

419
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:04,923
He nets them on their way to Africa
and serves them for lunch.

420
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,050
They're like us.

421
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:10,637
They smell the others cooking
and still they try to sing.

422
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:25,736
Kolnas is using the name of 'Kleber'.
It's on the license.

423
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:30,115
Monsieur Kleber residing
Rue Juliana.

424
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:36,038
Good Morning, how are you?

425
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:41,543
Oh, look... here he is.

426
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,838
Come by on his way to church
to check the till.

427
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,135
How neat he is
and plump, this...

428
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:53,347
...war criminal.

429
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:39,726
Do you know that song?

430
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:51,154
Where is Natalya?
Where is she?

431
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:54,741
Always wandering off.

432
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:58,161
Natalya, come, come.

433
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:00,831
We have to go to church.

434
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:05,335
Hannibal, he has children.

435
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,630
She's wearing
Mischa's bracelet.

436
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:15,012
Choose your offering
for the Church.

437
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:18,724
Good, put it in your pocket.

438
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:25,230
Ah, the shiny one.
Put it safe in...

439
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,155
What is it?

440
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,246
- Good evening.
- They're waiting for you, down below.

441
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:24,456
I called my Soviet friends.

442
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:29,461
Dortlich's dog tag was
in his mouth.

443
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:32,548
That means that
he has all of our dog tags...

444
01:09:32,673 --> 01:09:35,342
- ...and the pot watcher's inventory.
- No, no, no.

445
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:40,055
Dortlich searched
those ruins before.

446
01:09:40,973 --> 01:09:43,308
Grutas told him to do it.

447
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,145
Poked around with his picnic fork,
the lazy bastard.

448
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:48,939
Where is he? Where is he?

449
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:53,610
This poison little boy
who killed Dortlich?

450
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:56,154
He's a Paris schoolboy.

451
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,241
They say that there is
a passport photograph

452
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:00,742
but they don't have it yet.

453
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,244
What's his name?

454
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,623
Hannibal Lecter.

455
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,131
You know him?

456
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,426
So do you.

457
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,636
We...

458
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:23,932
...we had dinner with him
during the war.

459
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:29,146
Go back to
your restaurant, Kolnas.

460
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:36,236
Hey!

461
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:39,031
Bring me a covered dish
next time.

462
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,955
Where the hell is Dieter?

463
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:49,833
Dieter!

464
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,711
You bruise their face,

465
01:10:52,878 --> 01:10:54,922
you split their lip,
the money goes down.

466
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:56,215
Come here.

467
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:02,846
And that one.
That one is mine for now.

468
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:07,726
Milko, I want you to go to Paris.

469
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:11,730
Kolnas found me a Bosendorfer piano.
The best.

470
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:15,442
Oh, and... find the boy.

471
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:19,530
Lecter...
you know what to do with him.

472
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:34,837
Thanks.

473
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:09,037
Inspector Popil...
please come in.

474
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:12,624
This is not a social call.

475
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:23,135
- Where is he?
- I don't know. At medical school, I think.

476
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:25,762
Did you ever see this man?

477
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:33,729
No.

478
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:39,651
His name is Dortlich.
He's a War Criminal.

479
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:43,530
He was found near
the castle Hannibal came from.

480
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:49,328
Dortlich had some ugly friends,
I want to know where they are.

481
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:52,247
Hannibal may know.

482
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:14,228
Don't cut yourself.

483
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:27,449
I know about you...
I know you lost your family...

484
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:31,036
...everything,
when the bomb fell on Hiroshima.

485
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:38,627
Yes.

486
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:42,214
And you protect Hannibal
because he lost everything too?

487
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:45,717
That is your bond with him?

488
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:52,224
Do you see your family,
in your dreams, Inspector?

489
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:55,727
Yes.

490
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,523
So do I...

491
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,651
so does he.

492
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:17,124
If your pet snake strikes in France...
I will have to seize him.

493
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,335
He will die under the guillotine.

494
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:11,525
Sorry.

495
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:31,170
It was who sent you to kill me.

496
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:32,963
No, not to kill you.

497
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:37,134
To give you money.

498
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,429
Let me give it to you.

499
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:51,523
No!

500
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:54,318
No!

501
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:56,486
No!

502
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:20,928
You killed so many, Milko.
Many more than these.

503
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:25,349
Do you feel them
in the tank around you?

504
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:32,564
We ate her...

505
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,652
We ate her to live.

506
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:43,534
Grutas was very quick,
she felt nothing.

507
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:47,621
So, Grutas has a house?

508
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,331
Where?

509
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,844
I have difficulty hearing you.

510
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:03,929
He has a house?

511
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:12,646
Alright. alright...

512
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:15,440
Milly-la-Foret.

513
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:21,822
No! No!

514
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:24,616
She felt nothing!

515
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,121
No! No!

516
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,828
No! Please.

517
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:24,426
Oh! Inspector Popil.
What a surprise.

518
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:32,142
Found in your room.

519
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:36,813
If you kill in France...

520
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:39,858
I will see your head in a bucket.

521
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:44,655
Do you mind
if I work while we talk?

522
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:51,328
You killed Dortlich in the woods
where your family died.

523
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,541
His face had been eaten.

524
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:57,709
I would suspect the ravens.

525
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,504
Ravens who made
a shish kebab?

526
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:03,924
Cannibalism.

527
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,428
It happened on the Eastern Front.

528
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:11,431
But you know that, don't you?
You were there.

529
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,730
This is not the face of your subject.

530
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:23,569
This is the face of Vladis Grutas,
like the pictures in your room.

531
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:25,153
Did you kill him too?

532
01:22:27,698 --> 01:22:30,909
- No, I didn't.
- Have you found him?

533
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:34,329
If I found him...

534
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:37,207
I give you my word,
I would bring him to your attention.

535
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:39,042
Don't fool with me.

536
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:43,922
Did you know he sawed off
the head of the Rabbi at Kaunas?

537
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,842
He shot gypsy children
in the woods.

538
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,218
He walked free at
Nuremburg because

539
01:22:48,385 --> 01:22:51,346
a witness got acid
poured down her throat.

540
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:58,353
I will need your deposition.
Come with me.

541
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:09,239
Let's begin.

542
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,248
Put it down...

543
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:20,918
...or I'll shoot her.

544
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:24,421
<i>Grutas has the eyes of</i>
<i>an arctic wolf.</i>

545
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:28,467
<i>He knew at once to threaten Mischa</i>
<i>to make me put down the spear.</i>

546
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:35,557
<i>At first they needed us for cover</i>
<i>in case troops found them.</i>

547
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:40,437
<i>Later... they crowded around...</i>

548
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:44,149
<i>feeling our cheeks and arms.</i>

549
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,823
Hold it still.
Hold it still.

550
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,116
Mischa!

551
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,827
- Hold it still.
- Not in here, boss.

552
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:57,246
Not in here.

553
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:06,463
Hannibal!

554
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:37,953
I promised Mischa.

555
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:39,955
Promised to make them
pay a pound of flesh?

556
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:42,958
To pay skin for skin?

557
01:24:46,044 --> 01:24:49,423
If they'd killed you,
who would punish them then?

558
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:53,719
The answer is me. I will.

559
01:24:58,265 --> 01:25:00,851
If you swear to share
what you know with me,

560
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:02,436
then I will let you go.

561
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:05,355
I swear.

562
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,026
Jacques?

563
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:19,036
He knows something.

564
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:24,416
He'll lead us to Grutas
then we'll arrest him.

565
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,546
The court has to
declare him insane...

566
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:31,632
...and in an asylum
the doctors can study him

567
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:33,258
and find out what he is.

568
01:25:34,468 --> 01:25:38,138
<i>The little boy, Hannibal,</i>
<i>died in 1944 out in that snow.</i>

569
01:25:41,892 --> 01:25:43,852
<i>His heart died with Mischa.</i>

570
01:25:45,604 --> 01:25:50,234
What he is now...
there is no word for it...

571
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:54,404
...except monster.

572
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:36,321
Give these men to the police.

573
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:40,033
It's Kolnas's children, isn't it?

574
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:42,744
No.

575
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:00,929
Promise me.

576
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:10,314
<i>Hannibal!</i>

577
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:12,941
I can't.

578
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:19,865
I can't,
I already promised Mischa.

579
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:43,240
- No word from Milko?
- No.

580
01:28:49,788 --> 01:28:51,623
Come on, close the gate.

581
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:28,744
Don't worry,
I won't hit you again.

582
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:32,331
I like you now.

583
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,049
Maybe I'll fix your teeth.

584
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:57,648
I want to steam.

585
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:00,234
Turn it up.

586
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:32,432
I am glad you're here.

587
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:36,228
I always felt
I owed you something.

588
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:46,530
I thought you would be bigger.

589
01:30:48,073 --> 01:30:51,034
I put your face on
every bully I ever hurt.

590
01:31:00,878 --> 01:31:02,129
Kill him!

591
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:32,910
Answer me this.

592
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:35,913
Would you have fed me
to your little sister

593
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:38,040
because you loved her?

594
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,542
Yes.

595
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:45,422
There- there you have it...

596
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:47,549
Love.

597
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,847
I love myself that much
and I would never apologize to you.

598
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:56,808
Cut him!

599
01:31:57,976 --> 01:32:01,104
Wait! Look at me!

600
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:04,942
And it won't hurt so much.

601
01:32:18,163 --> 01:32:19,248
Bitch!

602
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:29,716
Get him! Go!

603
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:35,013
- Call Kolnas!
- Okay.

604
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:14,428
<i>To continue our conversation...</i>

605
01:33:15,554 --> 01:33:21,226
Do you wish to see
Lady Murasaki alive?

606
01:33:22,978 --> 01:33:24,146
Yes.

607
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:35,949
Listen to her.

608
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,327
Speak to your little fuck boy!

609
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:43,832
Listen, listen carefully...

610
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:46,919
<i>I offer you a life for a life.</i>

611
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,337
<i>Bring me everything you have.</i>

612
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:50,839
The dog tags,
Pot Watcher's little inventory,

613
01:33:50,964 --> 01:33:52,424
every fucking thing.

614
01:33:52,591 --> 01:33:54,635
- Where?
- <i>Kilometer 36...</i>

615
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,555
...on the way to Trilbardou
there is a telephone kiosk.

616
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,058
Be there at sunrise
and wait for a call.

617
01:34:01,183 --> 01:34:02,726
<i>If you are not there...</i>

618
01:34:02,893 --> 01:34:06,355
I will send her cheeks
in the mail.

619
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,857
A life for a life.

620
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,848
- Ready to sail, sir.
- Come on!

621
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:59,825
I'm sorry your room
isn't quite ready yet.

622
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:03,453
I'll contact room service.
Please.

623
01:35:04,663 --> 01:35:05,831
Eva!

624
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,626
Clean up the treatment room.

625
01:35:10,169 --> 01:35:12,171
Our old guests are leaving.

626
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:14,840
We have a new one checking in.

627
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:18,635
Get out!

628
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,715
Good evening, Herr Kolnas.

629
01:35:57,758 --> 01:36:00,010
You drink better wine
than you serve.

630
01:36:01,178 --> 01:36:02,554
I'm calling the police.

631
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:05,724
May I get them for you?

632
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:10,437
What did I do to you?

633
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:13,941
Aside from eating my sister?
Nothing.

634
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:17,569
Are you wearing your dog tag,
Herr Kolnas?

635
01:36:17,694 --> 01:36:21,657
Many people look like me.
Are you sure you have the right person?

636
01:36:22,407 --> 01:36:25,035
I was slave labor
for the Nazis in the war.

637
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:28,121
I lost family too, I understand.

638
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:32,835
Well, to improve your understanding,
I went by your home...

639
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,628
...on the Rue Juliana.

640
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:38,423
<i>I went into the children's room...</i>

641
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:41,552
<i>...with the sleeping child.</i>

642
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:58,235
And... I picked up something
for your offal.

643
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:10,414
It's a beef roast, Kolnas.
Do you see how it feels?

644
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:21,425
Where is she?

645
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:45,115
Where is my daughter?
What did you do to her?

646
01:37:50,662 --> 01:37:52,956
Your daughter is safe, Herr Kolnas.

647
01:37:54,374 --> 01:37:57,753
I will give her back to you
when you give me Lady Murasaki.

648
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:03,717
If I do that,
I am a dead man.

649
01:38:03,842 --> 01:38:07,513
No. Grutas will be arrested.

650
01:38:08,347 --> 01:38:10,349
I won't remember your face.

651
01:38:12,476 --> 01:38:17,523
Help me...
or I'll leave the child to starve.

652
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:22,027
Where is Lady Murasaki?

653
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:24,821
Grutas has a house boat.

654
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:28,325
A canal boat.
He moves around.

655
01:38:28,492 --> 01:38:29,743
Where is the boat?

656
01:38:34,706 --> 01:38:38,544
In the canal l'Ourcq,
west of Meaux.

657
01:38:41,547 --> 01:38:43,215
Where is my child?

658
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:10,909
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

659
01:39:11,076 --> 01:39:13,036
- Hello, Astrid?
- <i>Yes?</i>

660
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:15,914
Look at the children.

661
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:18,250
<i>Look at the children.</i>

662
01:39:18,584 --> 01:39:20,544
- <i>Why?</i>
- Just do it!

663
01:39:29,678 --> 01:39:31,138
The children are fine.

664
01:39:31,263 --> 01:39:32,764
<i>They're sleeping.</i>

665
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:38,353
<i>Petras...</i>
<i>Hello? Petras?</i>

666
01:39:39,605 --> 01:39:43,066
- You tricked me.
- No.

667
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:44,610
I kept my word.

668
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:49,323
I will spare your life
for the sake of your children.

669
01:40:58,183 --> 01:40:59,726
Your boyfriend...

670
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:04,147
ate Dortlich's face

671
01:41:53,572 --> 01:41:56,700
Jean, tie her up.
I'll go astern.

672
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:34,905
Help!

673
01:42:35,948 --> 01:42:38,242
- Jean?
- Help me!

674
01:42:43,288 --> 01:42:46,542
Grab it... grab it!

675
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:04,643
Hold it.

676
01:43:07,062 --> 01:43:09,940
No! Help!

677
01:43:10,065 --> 01:43:13,110
No!

678
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:46,935
No!

679
01:43:47,269 --> 01:43:48,437
Hannibal.

680
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:01,450
Shot in the spine,
my little Mannlein.

681
01:44:12,961 --> 01:44:15,839
Can't feel your legs?
Too bad.

682
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:18,842
You won't feel it
when I cut off your balls.

683
01:44:21,178 --> 01:44:24,640
A present for you.
A velvet bag.

684
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:28,143
Can you see?

685
01:44:29,269 --> 01:44:30,521
Good.

686
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:33,649
Look at this.

687
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:36,360
I can put some color
in her cheeks.

688
01:44:45,077 --> 01:44:46,328
Come on.

689
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:54,605
Where is Grentz?

690
01:45:56,565 --> 01:46:01,028
If I tell you...
will you kill me quickly?

691
01:46:01,486 --> 01:46:02,738
Yes.

692
01:46:04,656 --> 01:46:06,825
A village in Canada...

693
01:46:09,286 --> 01:46:10,954
...near Saskatoon.

694
01:46:14,499 --> 01:46:15,834
Stop Hannibal.

695
01:46:17,503 --> 01:46:19,254
Give him to Popil.

696
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:22,049
He ate my sister.

697
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:27,721
So did you...

698
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:30,724
you ate her too.

699
01:46:31,683 --> 01:46:34,228
So why don't you kill yourself?

700
01:46:37,689 --> 01:46:41,443
- No.
- Pot Watcher fed her to you in a broth.

701
01:46:41,777 --> 01:46:45,531
- Liar.
- You have to kill...

702
01:46:46,281 --> 01:46:48,659
...everyone who
knows it don't you?

703
01:46:49,576 --> 01:46:51,245
You ate her...

704
01:46:52,371 --> 01:46:54,248
<i>...half conscious.</i>

705
01:46:55,499 --> 01:46:59,711
<i>Your little lips</i>
<i>greedy around the spoon.</i>

706
01:47:33,453 --> 01:47:37,541
No! Hannibal, stop.

707
01:47:48,468 --> 01:47:50,554
M for Mischa.

708
01:48:46,276 --> 01:48:49,655
Stop. Stop now.

709
01:48:50,572 --> 01:48:52,115
Forgive them.

710
01:49:00,082 --> 01:49:01,333
Never.

711
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:14,930
I love you.

712
01:49:25,566 --> 01:49:28,527
What is left in you to love?

713
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:18,035
Find me the Captain.
I came as soon as I heard.

714
01:50:25,375 --> 01:50:26,835
Where is Hannibal?

715
01:50:29,379 --> 01:50:30,547
Come on.

716
01:50:37,179 --> 01:50:38,430
Hannibal!

717
01:50:51,068 --> 01:50:53,028
- Call the fire brigade!
- Yes, Inspector.

718
01:50:57,783 --> 01:50:59,409
Take some men, get down there.

719
01:51:29,356 --> 01:51:30,524
Hannibal.

720
01:51:56,842 --> 01:51:58,010
Coming.

721
01:52:24,203 --> 01:52:25,329
Yes?

722
01:52:28,498 --> 01:52:30,417
I came to collect a head.
