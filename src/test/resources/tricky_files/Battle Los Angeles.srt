1
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:12,635
There an unprecedented meteor shower
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

2
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:16,595
The entire city is mesmerised
by this incredible sight.

3
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:18,955
Two hours after the first contact...

4
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,035
...an unidentified enemy
has reached our coastlines...

5
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:25,236
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

6
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:31,795
Right now, one thing is
clear: The world is at war.

7
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:47,954
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...

8
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,755
...12 different locations
across the globe were breached...

9
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:54,274
...in a coordinated
attack by an unknown enemy.

10
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,954
All breaches were along the coastline...

11
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:00,554
...in what is a campaign
of rapid dominance.

12
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,354
This is a textbook military invasion.

13
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,273
There are massive
casualties in New York.

14
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:09,553
Defensive lines are
being set up in Boston.

15
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:13,273
And at 13:15 Zulu time,
we lost communications...

16
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,634
...with San Francisco and San Diego.

17
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:16,994
Their status is unknown.

18
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:23,073
What we know is that we are the last
offensive force on the West Coast.

19
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:26,073
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

20
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:33,353
We have five birds down two
klicks west of CP Victory.

21
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,712
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten
your asses, we're going down!

22
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,513
Command and control is down.

23
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,873
Civilians in need of
support two klicks northeast.

24
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:43,313
Cables inbound. Engage
your sectors of fire, over.

25
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:46,392
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

26
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:18,152
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider
Foundation Morning Surf Report.

27
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:22,352
Surfers, hard northeast
conditions blowing out there...

28
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:26,872
...the ocean slopping and chopping.
There is some size starting to build....

29
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,151
Come on. Come on.

30
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:50,031
-Morning, staff sergeant.
-Morning, sergeant.

31
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,710
Morning, staff sergeant.

32
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:54,031
-Morning, sergeant.
-Morning, staff sergeant.

33
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,990
Morning, staff sergeant.

34
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,430
Morning, you little prick.

35
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,830
You know what they say. You're only
as old as you feel, staff sergeant.

36
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:26,629
That's what I'm worried about.
I can't feel a damn thing.

37
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:35,469
-
-to the Pacific for our next report, where a cluster of meteors...

38
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:40,949
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere
in the early hours tomorrow morning.

39
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,149
Go ahead.

40
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,189
They're expected to strike miles
from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.

41
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,509
-John.
-Oh, God.

42
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,149
What's up, Mike?

43
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:56,149
Hey. What happened to that picture
of us in Iraq with that camel?

44
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,989
I mean, your girlfriend.

45
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,069
Hey, is this for real?

46
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,989
It's got your signature. l said, "That's
gotta be a mistake. He can't write."

47
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,949
No mistake, John. l did my
20. I know when to get out.

48
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:11,388
Come on. You got the box full of
medals, a file full of commendations.

49
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:14,109
You can have them. Seems
you like interior decorating.

50
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:17,908
A Marine's got a shelf life,
you know? After that....

51
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,347
What? He spoils?

52
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,068
Something like that.

53
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,788
I'll finish my training
assignment with these Marines.

54
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,509
Get them combat ready.

55
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:28,068
And then I'll be on my merry way.

56
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,228
You know, we could always use
another lean, mean typing machine.

57
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,148
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

58
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,388
Ugly, slow, soft.

59
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,668
God.

60
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,827
You had to make some
tough calls there, Mike.

61
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,027
Especially that last one.

62
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,907
We all wish your men made it home.

63
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:55,667
Here we go.

64
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,507
You're expired.

65
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,107
Clear the shelf...

66
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,586
...staff sergeant.

67
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,186
Everything I know is in here, John.

68
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:44,506
What typically would have been
detected months, if not years, before...

69
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,745
...surfaced in less than four hours.

70
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,666
These images giving some idea of the
rate these meteors are travelling.

71
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:54,545
Scientists are abuzz, scrambling
to try and understand it.

72
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:56,946
There's something just
extremely uncomfortable...

73
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:59,346
...about a man your
size sniffing a flower.

74
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:01,385
What you want is some hydrangeas.

75
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,145
Popular wedding flower,
come in green, blue.

76
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,625
What colour is the bridesmaids' dresses?

77
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:11,626
-Good question.
-You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.

78
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,225
Yes, pretty girl?

79
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:17,945
For 300 more, she said we
could have sprays of lilies.

80
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:21,265
Now, l know it's a lot, but it'd
be so beautiful. What do you think?

81
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,985
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.

82
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:26,944
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting
married once. Worry about 300 bucks?

83
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,985
-Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.
-Yeah, no worries.

84
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:35,185
You know what? lt's your
day. Do whatever you want.

85
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,344
I'm gonna hit you with
something. What are you doing?

86
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:40,544
Busting your balls.

87
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,184
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

88
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:44,144
And l can't wait.

89
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,464
I love cake.

90
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,144
Yo, Doc. What you doing?

91
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,343
Skyping back home.

92
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,303
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.

93
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,183
Doc. My boy.

94
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,423
That's my sister.

95
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,063
Goddamn.

96
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:20,103
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively
here, you know what I'm saying?

97
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:22,143
All right, no, stop playing!

98
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:25,103
May I take a message?

99
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,503
Doc, is it all right if
l have one of those first?

100
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:31,782
You eat it at your own risk.

101
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,023
They're very old.

102
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:38,983
So do you feel that
you're making progress?

103
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,702
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,422
I'm sleeping a lot better.

105
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:48,142
And then also around the
firing range and everything...

106
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:50,742
...when I first came back
and hear the pop, pop, pop...

107
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:54,421
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with
me a bit and a little bit of a setback.

108
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,581
But now it, you know...

109
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,222
...doesn't bother me.

110
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,102
So l think that's progress.

111
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,542
So, what's the story
with my status, doc?

112
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:07,501
I mean, are you gonna clear
me for combat? Because....

113
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,501
Yeah, l feel good.

114
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:14,261
Let's meet again next week...

115
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,222
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?

116
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:23,341
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much, doc.

117
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:33,861
Harris' girl is making the dude
organise his entire wedding...

118
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,420
...two weeks before we deploy.

119
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:40,141
I say the chick's busting his
balls like nobody's business.

120
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,661
But he got two weeks to get
it done because we're out.

121
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:48,180
So l just came by to visit you
one last time before we leave.

122
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:52,621
And l brought Dad's five iron with
me. And you know what that means.

123
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,501
Me and the boys are gonna go out
tonight, continue the tradition.

124
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,339
Have a good time, you know?

125
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,860
I'll see you soon, bro.

126
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:09,661
See you soon.

127
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,779
Motown, give me boots. I'm going skiing.

128
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,460
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

129
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,499
Here they come.

130
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,539
Don't mess this up, man. They
cannot know that you a virgin.

131
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,219
How do you know l--
Who says I'm a virgin?

132
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,979
We know you are. Look at your face.

133
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,460
What are you telling
her? Telling her what?

134
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,180
Oh, come on, you guys.
You're killing me.

135
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,059
That dog gonna hunt! Damn,
Daktari, you can play, man.

136
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,419
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

137
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:45,419
Shit. How am l supposed to know,
man? It's an American game, right?

138
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,859
Adukwu's our Navy
corpsman. He's like a medic.

139
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,138
No, not like a medic. Medic is
the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.

140
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,178
Well, sailor, yes.

141
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,818
I came here to become a doctor.

142
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,979
Slow down.

143
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,578
That's like number five.

144
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,059
How many have you had?

145
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,538
No, I'm good.

146
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,859
-Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan...
-Hey.

147
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,699
...his mom signed so
he could join up at 17.

148
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,418
And l look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

149
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,698
-Not on my truck, dude!
-Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

150
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,938
-Oh, yeah!
-Not on my truck.

151
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,057
-Toast. To Lenihan.
-To Lenihan!

152
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,778
Good luck, rookie.

153
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,138
Retreat, hell!

154
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:36,418
-
-emergency developing throughout NASA and the space community.

155
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:40,537
We now know that meteors will land off
the coasts of eight different cities...

156
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,537
...and that number could keep rising.

157
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:45,497
Evacuations now under way
in Southern California...

158
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:47,897
...moving the population
back from the coastline.

159
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:51,098
But a lot of curious people
are clamouring for views.

160
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:56,417
-What are you doing up so early?
-Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.

161
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,577
This thing right?

162
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,737
-Here. You want me to do it?
-lt's tricky.

163
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:08,456
They gotta be parallel to the deck.
That's the whole thing with these bars.

164
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:10,816
-Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay?
-Okay.

165
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,657
-Call me later.
-I'll call you later.

166
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,976
That's my baby. All right.

167
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,615
Let's go! Move!

168
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,975
Quick time! March!

169
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:53,855
Marines! lnto the trucks and
report to your company! Let's go!

170
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,335
Move it! Let's move!

171
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:56,935
Move it!

172
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,575
-Load them up!
-Move it!

173
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,815
What's going on, first sergeant?

174
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,455
Meteors hitting off California now...

175
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,616
...but they got the whole
goddamn base being mobilised.

176
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:13,054
I'm bringing you back to the
company, Mike. They need you.

177
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,175
First sergeant.

178
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:19,415
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

179
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,895
-You heard we might be mobilising?
-Yes, sir.

180
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,454
Moving you up to squad leader.

181
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,814
It's a big responsibility,
but you can handle it.

182
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,294
Thank you, sir.

183
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,894
Staff Sergeant Beck is being
replaced by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

184
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,694
What do you know about him?

185
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,854
He's a very dedicated Marine.

186
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,294
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

187
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,014
What'd you hear about his last tour?

188
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:49,734
Just the grimy details that
everybody else already knows.

189
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,573
But at the end of the day,
you're our lieutenant...

190
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:54,974
...and we take our orders from you, sir.

191
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:02,093
You're assigned to 1st Platoon
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

192
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:06,973
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

193
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,653
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant
right up here, 1 o'clock.

194
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,173
He's a kid, Mike.

195
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,492
Right out of officer training school.

196
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,212
He's only been with us a
month, but I think he's sharp.

197
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,413
It's just an evacuation,
buddy. He's in charge.

198
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:24,054
Just keep an eye on him, huh?

199
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,853
Just don't lose my paperwork.

200
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,772
-Lieutenant.
-Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

201
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,692
-Happy to meet you.
-Thank you, sir.

202
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:37,693
We're being called in to help with
an evacuation? For these meteors?

203
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:39,291
I assume so.

204
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:42,092
Whatever it is, I'm happy to
finally get out in the field.

205
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,572
At approximately 4:42 am
Pacific Standard Time...

206
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,092
...the meteors impacted....

207
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:48,932
Who the hell took my
tortellini? You got tortellini?

208
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:50,213
This some kind of drill?

209
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:53,691
Get ready, man. Get
ready. It's serious. Okay?

210
00:13:56,693 --> 00:14:00,972
Meteors continue to fall off the coast
of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....

211
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,172
Corporal. Corporal.

212
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,852
-Corporal. Corporal.
-Yeah?

213
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,811
It's probably just a training exercise.

214
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,051
No, man. They're shifting Nantz
into our unit. Something's going on.

215
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:12,211
The guy wants out of the Marine
Corps and now we're stuck with him.

216
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:14,092
-Stavs!
-You got tortellini?

217
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,010
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

218
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:19,771
He went into that compound
alone and killed 10 insurgents.

219
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:22,571
-That's what you heard, Lenihan?
-Chill out.

220
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:25,171
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot
told me that he was going on--

221
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,572
Don't worry about it.

222
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:29,371
-Let's go, this is serious.
-What the hell did l do?

223
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,611
Nantz got a couple guys
killed on his last tour.

224
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,810
What?

225
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,091
That's the story.
Lockett's brother was one.

226
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,411
So l know you didn't know, but just
don't-- No, don't worry about it.

227
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,011
Looks like we're getting
into some heavy shit.

228
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:45,771
It's been my experience, lieutenant,
heavy shit is highly overrated.

229
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,211
Look, staff sergeant,
let's just be clear.

230
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,450
I know your rep, know what you've done.

231
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,971
This is my platoon. These are my men.

232
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:57,290
-Not gonna have a problem, are we?
-No problem, sir. She's all yours.

233
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,570
It appears our initial
assumptions were wrong.

234
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:04,890
Listen up! Once you get your weapon...

235
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:08,569
...get your gear, get your
munitions, move outside!

236
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,850
We got white chocolate rap from my
man. That should finish the new mix?

237
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:17,330
National Guard troops have flown
in to evacuate beach areas...

238
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:21,209
...and we have word the
military is now deploying.

239
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,249
That's us. That's us! That's us!

240
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,689
-Calling military for a meteor shower?
-l don't know why they're happy.

241
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,449
-
-a meteor that just hit the ocean.

242
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,449
Large plumes of smoke are coming up.
Visibility is getting worse as we....

243
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,769
These objects were
completely undetected...

244
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,649
...until they entered our atmosphere.

245
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,089
NASA estimates that they are not
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

246
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,809
They're slowing down before impact.

247
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:50,649
These objects are falling into the
ocean in tightly packed clusters...

248
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,568
...10 miles outside of
a major population centre.

249
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,689
Thermal imaging from
the Hubble shows us...

250
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,528
...that within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

251
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:02,728
Now, these central objects are
all the same geometric shape.

252
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,168
They appear mechanical in nature.

253
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,848
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

254
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,888
We are in Threatcon Delta. That's right.

255
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,247
Come on. All units, gear up.

256
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:15,927
Be ready to move.

257
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:17,928
Combat situation.

258
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,128
It's what I've been training for.

259
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:26,007
l am told that one of the Coast
Guard cutters has issued a mayday.

260
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,567
lt is difficult to
see, and-- Oh, my gosh!

261
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,168
There is just another meteor
that just hit the ocean...

262
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:35,008
...and it's the closest one
yet, right behind those cutters.

263
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,446
Two or three meteors just impacted.

264
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:39,527
Shit.

265
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:42,927
Do you have any more information
in the studio? Oh, my God.

266
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:46,967
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?

267
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,767
-Shut up, shut up, shut up!
-Kate, are you still hearing us?

268
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:56,287
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone,
move out. Get out of the way.

269
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,607
What is that? What is that in the water?

270
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:01,767
I can't really get a good look,
but it appears there's something--

271
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:05,686
I'm looking through the people, trying
to determine exactly what this is.

272
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:09,566
I don't even know. It's
like shadowy figures.

273
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:13,447
Maybe five, six, seven. I can
make out maybe eight figures.

274
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,766
-What the hell is that?
-Holy shit!

275
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,686
-Look at that!
-Stavs, you see that?

276
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,406
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone
needs to get out of here right now.

277
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:33,005
I think that we've gotta leave,
Jean. I'm gonna head back now.

278
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,165
Oh, my God!

279
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,965
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

280
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:44,045
Corporal Grayston and Corporal
lmlay are both expert marksmen...

281
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,165
...as well as strong fire team leaders.

282
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,126
We also have PFC Lenihan, who
is our second best marksman...

283
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:53,326
-...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.
-What's your take on this, Specs?

284
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,884
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?

285
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,084
-Do you mean like from space?
-No, Imlay.

286
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,485
-From Canada.
-Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

287
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:03,245
All right, first squad, line
it up. Bring it in. Let's go!

288
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,324
As you may have heard...

289
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:09,644
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

290
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,765
We're lucky to have him aboard.

291
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:15,924
All right. Here's the situation,
Marines. We're facing an unknown enemy.

292
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,804
We don't know how strong their
force is or what they're capable of.

293
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:23,444
But one thing we do know is that
we're fighting for our land...

294
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,964
...our families, our home
and our country, goddamn it!

295
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:30,364
Whatever those things are, let's show
them how Marines fight. Retreat....

296
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,524
-Hell!
-Two-Five!

297
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,603
-Retreat, hell!
-Let's form it up, let's go!

298
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,043
First in, last out, Marines!

299
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,643
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe.
Your training will kick in.

300
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,683
Thank you, staff sergeant!

301
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:57,124
-Got something to get off your chest?
-No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

302
00:18:57,323 --> 00:19:00,243
You got a silver star, my brother
came home in a box. I get it.

303
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,963
All stations, this
net. Standby for sitrep.

304
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:08,363
Enemy elements have
advanced beyond the beach.

305
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,243
Aliens? That's not possible, right?

306
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:14,923
We'll know soon enough, brother.

307
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:19,483
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.
Company beyond the defensive line....

308
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:23,482
It's in case his head gets blown
off, so they can identify his body.

309
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,682
Be advised, enemy have
heavy assault weapons.

310
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:30,443
Firepower equal to
high-explosive rounds.

311
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,961
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me
you won't let me be taken alive...

312
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:40,562
...by some godless predator from
another world, staff sergeant?

313
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:44,162
No promises in combat.

314
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,603
Stop screwing around
and keep your head in it!

315
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:53,522
These units are falling tactically.
Their strategies are coordinated.

316
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:56,682
Do not underestimate
enemy combat intelligence.

317
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,441
We are not evacuating
civilians fast enough.

318
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:07,922
I say again, we are not
evacuating fast enough.

319
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:13,242
All units be advised, there are
friendlies behind enemy lines.

320
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,160
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.

321
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,480
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

322
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,239
Boys, hold on to something.
Things are about to get rough.

323
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,319
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!

324
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,478
Move, move, move!

325
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,918
Form it up!

326
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,918
-What do we got, sir?
-All right, situation is as follows:

327
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,478
Most of Santa Monica's
been cleared of civilians.

328
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,118
We got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

329
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,598
Air Force has got
Warthogs and B-52s on deck.

330
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,918
At 1930 hours, they will pound the
entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.

331
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,878
Shit.

332
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,597
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

333
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,957
We got an infestation
of God knows what...

334
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:27,997
...not of this Earth and we
gotta hit them with everything...

335
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:31,317
...and we gotta hit them hard.
They are a ground-force enemy only.

336
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:34,676
They have no aircraft, so the Air
Force will tear them a new asshole...

337
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:36,557
...and we will rule the air.

338
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,717
-You said "most civilians," sir?
-Affirmed.

339
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:41,116
Getting distress calls,
sending squads out.

340
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,157
Golf, you take Santa Monica to Olympic.

341
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:46,437
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

342
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:48,716
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

343
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:51,357
Lieutenant Martinez, I want
you to break off a squad...

344
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:52,676
...and a machine gun team.

345
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:56,636
Proceed west from Lincoln to
a police station located here...

346
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:58,917
-...at Venice and Amarosa.
-Venice and Amarosa.

347
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:00,436
Police were overrun.

348
00:23:00,637 --> 00:23:04,916
Got a distress call that civilians are
still there. We don't know how many.

349
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,076
Just gather survivors,
then you radio in.

350
00:23:07,277 --> 00:23:10,037
We'll have helicopters in
the area to evacuate you out.

351
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:13,915
Now, be advised, you got exactly
three hours before our bombs drop.

352
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:17,075
And make no mistake, they
will drop, with or without you.

353
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:19,515
Get those civilians, get
the hell out of there...

354
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:22,876
...and you kill anything
that is not human.

355
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:25,115
Let's go! Let's get it done!

356
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:28,595
Captain, this is not a drill. You
hold that line, you understand me?

357
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:29,796
Yes, sir.

358
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,755
-
-from the coastline into suburbs. Golf company is overrun.

359
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:44,196
Lima company requesting
immediate air support.

360
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:47,315
Civilians are being
stranded behind enemy lines.

361
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:48,795
Hang on, One!

362
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:50,395
Fire in the hole!

363
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,794
Troops are amassing in every
coast, along every major coastline.

364
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:09,835
The UN has called an
emergency sitting...

365
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:12,754
...in an attempt to establish
a means for sharing resources...

366
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:14,794
...and intelligence across the globe.

367
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,554
Watch out, go!

368
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,154
This way? Where are we supposed to go?

369
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:23,874
Jesus Christ.

370
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:38,513
Marines, anything beyond this
point, consider to be hostile.

371
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:40,274
All right, nice and easy.

372
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,234
Clear.

373
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:55,913
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.

374
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,353
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

375
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:02,273
Lieutenant. How many civilians we
gotta get out of that police station?

376
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,353
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

377
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,792
-What the hell's that? What is that?
-This is insane.

378
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:15,432
Yo, eyes open.

379
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:18,353
An unidentified enemy has
breached our coastlines...

380
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:21,072
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

381
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:24,192
At this point, there are many
more questions than answers.

382
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:28,553
Right now, one thing is
clear: The world is at war.

383
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,032
Eyes open.

384
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:35,232
You see something, Simmons?

385
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:37,592
Can't see shit.

386
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,392
-Kerns, you see a cross street?
-Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

387
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,871
Police station's about one
klick northwest of here.

388
00:26:18,472 --> 00:26:20,751
-Twelve o'clock!
-Hundred metres front.

389
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:23,750
-This is Echo 6, we need
immediate-- -Turn your radios down.

390
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,991
-lt's just a dog.
-Just a little doggy. Come here.

391
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,269
-lt's just a dog.
-Dog.

392
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,550
-Dog.
-Dog.

393
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,750
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."

394
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:43,150
Kidding me. Who's the idiot
naming dogs these days?

395
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,150
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

396
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,190
Watch out!

397
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,830
-Where's it coming from?
-l don't know.

398
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,470
Lenihan, watch your head!

399
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:58,790
On the roof!

400
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,989
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!

401
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,870
-They're on the roof! On the roof!
-Cover him!

402
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,909
Twenty-five metres!
Twenty-five metres!

403
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,028
-Lieutenant!
-Left flank, on the roof!

404
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,068
Covering, covering!

405
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,549
-We gotta move now!
-Lockett!

406
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,789
-Yes?
-Get me an exit down that alley!

407
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,669
Yes, sergeant! Kerns, Motown, let's go!

408
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:33,629
Get up! Come on!

409
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:35,148
Falling back!

410
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,709
Let's go, come on!

411
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,909
Enemy fire! Watch your head!

412
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,228
-Where'd they come from?
-Fall back!

413
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,388
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

414
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:44,869
It's all over the damn place!

415
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,109
What do you see?

416
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:47,948
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.

417
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,509
How do we get out of here?

418
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,908
-Lieutenant, where's the exit?
-I'm working on it!

419
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,988
-Shit, we're boxed in!
-I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!

420
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:56,908
-Move out!
-Ambush!

421
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:00,387
I don't have him!

422
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:01,828
I'm hit!

423
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:04,428
Cover me, Lockett!

424
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,628
-Man down, man down!
-lt burns!

425
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:22,267
Shit!

426
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:24,508
I got you, Guerrero!

427
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:33,227
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

428
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:39,627
I've got you covered!

429
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,387
We have an exit! Everybody,
move out! Move out!

430
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,587
Move, move!

431
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:47,667
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come
on, we're going! Come on, let's go!

432
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:56,346
Fall back, fall back!

433
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,187
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!

434
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:10,306
Lorenzo!

435
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:11,666
Move, move, move!

436
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,025
Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving!

437
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,106
I can't see shit!

438
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:22,985
Shit, shit, shit! Imlay!

439
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:25,105
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

440
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:27,785
U.S. Marines, coming in!

441
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,985
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

442
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,585
Kitchen's clear! The
kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

443
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,864
Get on that window! Are we clear?

444
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,344
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

445
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:39,625
Kerns, Lockett, secure
the back of this house.

446
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:42,145
-Yes, staff sergeant.
-Staff sergeant, we're on it!

447
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:47,105
Doc, how long till they're able to move?

448
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,584
Ten minutes. Ten minutes,
staff sergeant. Ten minutes.

449
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:52,464
You want me? Come get
some! I'm right here!

450
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,064
What do we got, lmlay?

451
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,385
I got nothing. I can't
see a goddamn thing.

452
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,825
-With this smoke, it's zero visibility.
-You're dead!

453
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:00,225
Stow that shit, Simmons!

454
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,744
You'll get shot before you're
able to kill any of them.

455
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:03,944
Your orders, sir?

456
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,704
I led us right into that ambush.

457
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,905
-Mottola, anyone on command?
-No, sir.

458
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:15,264
-We need to find answers to get out.
-You're in charge, sir. Your orders?

459
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,464
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

460
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,744
Civilians or no, we gotta
get these wounded out.

461
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,183
-Roger that.
-Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan?

462
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,383
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?

463
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:29,583
-Lenihan?
-Lenihan?

464
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,143
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

465
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:33,384
-Lenihan!
-I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

466
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,544
Imlay, Harris, on me. Let's
get this shit out of here.

467
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:38,943
I'll package the wounded.
Rally on 10th Street.

468
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,382
Be prepared to move.
We're moving out soon.

469
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:44,063
Shit.

470
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,663
Mottorola.

471
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:55,822
Mottorola?

472
00:30:57,744 --> 00:31:00,263
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?

473
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:01,663
Lenihan, where are you?

474
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,223
Staff sergeant?

475
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,982
Jesus Christ. l had to turn my radio
off. These things are everywhere.

476
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,183
We're coming for you.
What's your location?

477
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:12,503
I'm in the laundry room
of some apartment complex.

478
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,383
It's like
three storeys--

479
00:31:23,303 --> 00:31:27,422
What colour is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?

480
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,541
Shit.

481
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:53,902
Lenihan.

482
00:31:58,222 --> 00:31:59,661
Shit.

483
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,501
So smooth....

484
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,661
Smooth is fast.

485
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:15,620
Shit.

486
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:23,940
Oh, shit.

487
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,779
-Lenihan!
-Lenihan, lower that weapon!

488
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,339
What the
hell--?

489
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,898
Keep on firing!

490
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:33,138
Jesus Christ! What
the hell is that thing?

491
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,619
It's not dead. They don't die. I've
hit it a hundred times. They don't die.

492
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,898
Get separated from the unit again,
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

493
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:42,578
Imlay, drop a grenade
in that pool. Let's move!

494
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,698
Come on, l got you. l got you.

495
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,138
Frag out.

496
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,418
Street's clear.

497
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,217
Get down, get down, get down.

498
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:07,097
-What's happening? What's going on?
-All right, we're good. Come on.

499
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,178
-lt's Lenihan.
-Yo, Lockett.

500
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:18,457
You owe me $5. l told you, a virgin
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

501
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:20,256
Move to the police station?

502
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,577
-All right, let's move. Let's move.
-Move it. Move it out.

503
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:38,297
-Where'd that come from?
-Door's open at the bank!

504
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:39,736
Take care of him.

505
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:41,176
Where'd the shot come from?

506
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:44,056
-Kerns!
-Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

507
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,816
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!

508
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:51,136
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou,
cover front. Harris, cover front!

509
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,656
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

510
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:55,016
I got it. I got it covered.

511
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:57,616
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

512
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,816
Imlay, get eyes up on
that roof, all right?

513
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,215
-Cover the roof!
-Roof's clear, roof's clear!

514
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,576
Lockett, on me!

515
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:05,777
Did anybody even see
where that came from?

516
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:08,376
Doc, how serious?

517
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:11,256
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and his face, sir.

518
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,136
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

519
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:15,815
Shit.

520
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,695
-Hostiles, 12 o'clock!
-Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

521
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:23,895
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

522
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,175
Prepare to fire!

523
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:28,536
Hold it, hold it!

524
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,215
Friendlies, sir.

525
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:34,854
-Shit.
-Friendlies. Let's get them in.

526
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:38,895
Get over here.

527
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:45,414
Move. Move to the back.
Let's go. Come on, get.

528
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:49,254
-What's your unit?
-40th, lD.

529
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:51,015
Where's the rest of your unit?

530
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,495
Everyone else is either dead or missing.

531
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:56,175
I picked up Air Force here.

532
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,453
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos, Air Force.

533
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:02,654
61st Wing, intel,
surveillance, recon division.

534
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,934
Tech sergeant? What the
hell are you doing here?

535
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:08,575
We were tracking enemy transmissions
about 12 klicks south of here.

536
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,093
They ambushed us like they
knew our freaking address.

537
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:13,453
I'm the only one left.

538
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:17,373
I found these guys on the way to the
safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

539
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,134
You ready to use that
weapon, tech sergeant?

540
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:24,333
With all due respect, staff sergeant, I
didn't get this far off of my good looks.

541
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,333
-I'm ready for payback.
-Outstanding.

542
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:30,413
Lieutenant, bird
inbound, 25 minutes, sir.

543
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:33,494
Roger that. Let's get
to that police station.

544
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,172
All right, let's get
Simmons and move. Let's go!

545
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:43,453
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!
To the right, in that building!

546
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:44,693
Watch your feet!

547
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:46,133
There's the police station.

548
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:49,013
Let's get those civilians
and get back to the F.O.B.!

549
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:53,212
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

550
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:00,013
Come on, come on, come on.

551
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:02,892
I'll stay with our wounded,
wait for the medevac.

552
00:37:03,093 --> 00:37:05,612
I'll go for civilians.
Kerns, Dever, on me.

553
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,692
-Mags, mags. I need mags.
-All right.

554
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:12,493
Santos, when that bird arrives, I'll
need your help on this stretcher.

555
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:15,011
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

556
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,052
Door. The door.

557
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,932
-Elevator right.
-Clear!

558
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:21,572
Elevator right.

559
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:24,692
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.

560
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:27,531
Door left.

561
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,212
It's locked.

562
00:37:29,412 --> 00:37:30,651
-What's your name?
-Harper.

563
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:33,572
-I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.
-Bird incoming, sir!

564
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:36,412
Roger that. lmlay, pop smoke!

565
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,411
-Door locked.
-Door left.

566
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,531
Radios off.

567
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:57,890
Move.

568
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,210
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

569
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:31,009
-How many of you?
-Five of us, three kids.

570
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:32,690
Kerns, kids!

571
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:36,569
-Let's move!
-Let's go, let's go!

572
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:39,570
All right, let's get ready
to move! Let's get it up!

573
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,729
-Here we go! Let's move!
-Aye, sir!

574
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,609
We got room for four and
that is it! That is it.

575
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,049
-Get your wounded on! Move it!
-Oh, yeah, baby.

576
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,330
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

577
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,130
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

578
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,488
I'll work on that mix for you!

579
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,969
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

580
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,649
Give them hell!

581
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,249
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, man.

582
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,529
You just had to get out of the shit.

583
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,448
-You take care of yourself!
-l will.

584
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,408
I'll see you soon, partner.

585
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,248
-That's it.
-We have civilians coming out!

586
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,649
-We can't take them, we got no room!
-Make room!

587
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:19,729
We can't! Now, get back, sir!

588
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,928
Fall back. Move back,
move back, move back!

589
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:29,528
Wait! Kids, kids!

590
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:45,488
Get back to the police station!

591
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,648
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!

592
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:04,927
They have air power. Again, enemy
has air support. We have a bird down.

593
00:40:05,128 --> 00:40:06,367
Damn it!

594
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:08,288
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

595
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:11,288
We've disengaged back into a
police station. We have civilians.

596
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:13,647
I say again, we have civilians.

597
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:17,047
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.
Nothing gets in, you understand?

598
00:40:20,368 --> 00:40:23,887
We got a body. Do you think you could
get rid of it so the kids don't see it?

599
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,766
What do you want? Where should we go?

600
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:26,966
Dever.

601
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,806
Set up back there, okay?

602
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,606
Come on, you guys. Take the back.

603
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:35,766
Stay away from the window, all right?

604
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,126
Are there gonna be more choppers?
Did you guys call any in?

605
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:44,286
I'm sure they're gonna come
for us. They know where we are.

606
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,966
Shit. You okay? You all right?

607
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:50,527
-I'm good. Yeah.
-You sure?

608
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:54,125
-You didn't get hit or nothing?
-No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

609
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,806
Man, they're gone. They're gone.

610
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,366
Everybody's gone. Lenihan,
Guerrero, Grayston.

611
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:02,526
Grayston. Grayston had kids.

612
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,485
Didn't deserve that.
Didn't deserve that!

613
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:06,325
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

614
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:10,286
Neither do you! You hear me?
You're gonna make it through this!

615
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:14,685
All right? You're gonna get out of
here. You're gonna marry Cherise.

616
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,644
And you're gonna be her problem...

617
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:20,205
...because I'm done taking care
of your sorry ass, you got that?

618
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:25,685
All stations, this
net. Sitrep as follow:

619
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:28,765
Enemy aircraft number
four fleets at this time.

620
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:32,164
Be advised, more entering battle
space Los Angeles from ocean...

621
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,604
...on bearing
2-niner-7-5-0.

622
00:41:34,806 --> 00:41:36,965
They got air support too.

623
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,405
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

624
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:43,324
So much for ruling the air.

625
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,924
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

626
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,884
Those bombs are gonna drop.

627
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:51,764
And we're in the blast radius.

628
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:55,283
Top of my goddamn class.

629
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:59,844
And l get out in combat in the
middle of that shit? Goddamn it!

630
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:02,484
I already lost four of my goddamn men!

631
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:04,284
Four good men.

632
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:06,524
Who would go to hell
and back for you, sir.

633
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:12,684
-Have you?
-Yes.

634
00:42:12,884 --> 00:42:15,723
You're not the first to lose
men. You won't be the last.

635
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,164
Now, put that away. You understand me?

636
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:20,803
Right now your men are awaiting orders.

637
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:24,883
Now, you can go left, you can
go right. I don't give a damn.

638
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:27,364
Just make a decision.

639
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:30,443
Lieutenant.

640
00:42:30,844 --> 00:42:33,243
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

641
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:35,243
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

642
00:42:35,444 --> 00:42:37,643
Command says it's like
nothing they ever seen.

643
00:42:37,844 --> 00:42:39,523
We gotta find a way out.

644
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,843
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

645
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:44,803
You're right. We gotta move.

646
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:47,962
Let's get these people
safe. Lockett, Kerns!

647
00:42:48,163 --> 00:42:50,643
I need you to set up an
observation post on the roof.

648
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,082
We're gonna move by foot,
so we gotta move fast.

649
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:55,802
Scan for hostiles, find
the best route out of here.

650
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,402
All right, sir.

651
00:42:58,843 --> 00:42:59,842
Lieutenant.

652
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:08,802
Officials are now saying any civilian
within 10 miles of the coast...

653
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,523
...should try to make their way...

654
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:12,521
...to a military forward
operating base, F.O.B.

655
00:43:14,162 --> 00:43:16,522
This is the safest place
that you could be right now.

656
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:20,482
Now, the military has set up a line
of defence to try to protect civilians.

657
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:24,601
Take a look at you, make sure
you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.

658
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:28,281
Just look at this. There you go.

659
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:31,321
-Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.
-Okay, thank you.

660
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:32,762
-No problem.
-Thank you.

661
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,361
-Joe Rincon.
-Staff Sergeant Nantz.

662
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:39,681
This is my son, Hector.

663
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:43,401
We all wanted to thank
you for coming to get us.

664
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,481
Yeah.

665
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:48,321
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.

666
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,401
So you here when the police got overrun?

667
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:57,321
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.

668
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,481
Hey, you all right, man?

669
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:02,760
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

670
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:04,280
Okay.

671
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,881
If you-- lf you need
him to do anything...

672
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,200
-...you know.
-I'll let you know.

673
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:15,319
Aye-aye, sir.

674
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,040
Aye.

675
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:19,320
Thank you.

676
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,121
We got two dozen hostiles
about 300 metres out.

677
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:29,759
Lieutenant, we got two dozen
hostiles 300 metres north, over.

678
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,480
It's like those things are
on overwatch, just like us.

679
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:38,920
That one out front looks like the
leader. Now they got leadership.

680
00:44:39,081 --> 00:44:40,879
So do ants, Kerns.

681
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,679
You think those things get scared too?

682
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,719
Probably just like us. They're probably
just grunts that get told to go fight.

683
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,758
Come on. Find us a way out of here,
Marine, because we're sitting ducks.

684
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,399
They dragged them out of
the house, into the street...

685
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,799
...put them in perfect
order before they shot them.

686
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,479
They shot them right in the head.

687
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,999
Chief, do we have any
idea why this is happening?

688
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,439
Well, it's clear there has been no
attempt at any kind of communication.

689
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,718
No demands, nothing like that.

690
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:11,398
So, obviously, they are
here for our resources.

691
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,958
When you invade a place for resources...

692
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,959
...you wipe out the
indigenous population.

693
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,077
Those are the rules of any colonisation.

694
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,718
And, right now, we are being colonised.

695
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:24,838
Brave kids.

696
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,038
They're my nieces. My sister and
her husband are away on vacation.

697
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,038
Thing is, they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year.

698
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:39,118
And now I may be all they have left.

699
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:42,318
-You have kids?
-No.

700
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:44,317
Neither do I.

701
00:45:45,398 --> 00:45:48,678
I used to regret that, but
maybe it was for the best.

702
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:51,398
Of course, our planet's
surface is 70 percent water.

703
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:54,118
So again, and l have to stress
this, without certainty...

704
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,557
...the leading hypothesis remains
that their objective, their target...

705
00:45:57,757 --> 00:45:58,757
...is our water.

706
00:45:59,478 --> 00:46:02,557
-Shit.
-There ain't gonna be nothing left.

707
00:46:03,558 --> 00:46:05,958
-l think l got a way out of here.
-What'd you say?

708
00:46:06,118 --> 00:46:07,957
Right here, look. 200 metres out.

709
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,197
-What's right behind that backside?
-Bus.

710
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:13,037
-Lieutenant, we got a bus.
-Roger that.

711
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:16,396
So the men on the roof saw a bus.
They think it could be operational.

712
00:46:16,598 --> 00:46:19,276
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

713
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,316
It's miles to the operating base...

714
00:46:22,557 --> 00:46:24,756
...and those bombs are
gonna drop in an hour.

715
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:25,956
We gotta move fast.

716
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:28,676
Bus is a big target.

717
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:30,036
I made the call.

718
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,837
It's my responsibility.

719
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,636
Stavrou, Harris.

720
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:37,675
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
If it runs, get it back here.

721
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:41,676
-You know how to hotwire a bus?
-Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.

722
00:46:42,157 --> 00:46:43,196
Ladies first.

723
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:47,995
Two hundred metres.

724
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:50,916
Go down, there's the cars burnt
out, there's a pickup truck.

725
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:52,515
Right back behind there.

726
00:46:54,237 --> 00:46:57,155
We have a situation.
Y'all need to follow me.

727
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:01,955
Harris found it out here.
Y'all gotta see this thing.

728
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,795
Weapon looks like it's
been surgically attached.

729
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:16,035
Talk about commitment to cause.

730
00:47:22,156 --> 00:47:23,715
Shit.

731
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,354
-You gotta be kidding!
-Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

732
00:47:29,155 --> 00:47:31,915
Let me shoot this thing, staff
sergeant. That weapon's hot.

733
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:33,155
Let me just shoot it.

734
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:34,474
-Doc.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

735
00:47:35,555 --> 00:47:36,715
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

736
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:40,394
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing...

737
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:42,274
...so we don't waste all our ammo.

738
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:45,674
Maybe I can help.

739
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:47,314
I'm a veterinarian.

740
00:47:59,635 --> 00:48:01,194
Sure you wanna do this?

741
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:04,034
I was more sure when I
was standing over there.

742
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,793
We gotta figure out how
to kill these things.

743
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:10,074
Otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, okay?

744
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,433
Let's peel this back.

745
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:19,873
-Look at this, we got a organ here.
-Jesus Christ, look at that.

746
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:21,953
-I got another one.
-Me too.

747
00:48:22,114 --> 00:48:25,033
Does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

748
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:28,073
There's no frontal lobe, no
temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

749
00:48:28,315 --> 00:48:29,953
The cranial vault is unlike anything.

750
00:48:30,153 --> 00:48:31,552
-Oh, shit.
-What?

751
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:33,233
-You see what I'm seeing?
-What?

752
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:35,592
The ones that were just
on the roof aren't on it.

753
00:48:35,753 --> 00:48:37,713
There's about two dozen
coming out the door.

754
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:39,712
They're on the street heading this way.

755
00:48:39,874 --> 00:48:42,273
-Lieutenant, we got movement up here.
-Roger that.

756
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:44,912
We have contact 300 metres
out. We gotta cut quick.

757
00:48:52,154 --> 00:48:53,953
Lieutenant, we gotta
move! What do we do?

758
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:56,512
-Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move.
-Staff sergeant.

759
00:48:56,712 --> 00:48:58,832
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

760
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,752
Goddamn it, Stavs.

761
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:11,072
-I lost them.
-You lost them?

762
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:14,752
Lieutenant, they're gone.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

763
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:18,632
-We got a breach.
-Got a breach on the north entrance!

764
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:19,872
They're inside.

765
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:22,350
I'm gonna gather everyone by
the doors on the south side.

766
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:24,031
We're right behind you.

767
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:25,671
What was that?

768
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:28,191
-Adukwu, you go with her.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

769
00:49:28,513 --> 00:49:31,431
-Imlay, got an HE grenade round?
-Never leave home without it.

770
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:33,910
You cover that hall to
the rear. Buy me some time.

771
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:36,711
They start coming, you
blast the hell out of them.

772
00:49:37,071 --> 00:49:39,230
Hey, Harris. Where's that goddamn bus?

773
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:42,191
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy
scout. Come on, let's go.

774
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:47,750
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby! Newark! Represent!

775
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,070
Lieutenant, we've got
the bus, heading back.

776
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:52,471
Okay, guys, the bus is
en route! Bus is en route!

777
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:54,551
Thirty seconds till we move out!

778
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:03,230
Imlay, give me a sitrep. I
need an update on the breach.

779
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,230
Report back, over.

780
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,189
We're running out of time.

781
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:23,110
Move!

782
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,589
Contact!

783
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,030
They've breached.

784
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,269
This is our last shot.

785
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,509
Got it.

786
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,589
Right here.

787
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,789
That's gotta be it. It's dying.

788
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:58,429
That's how we kill this thing, to
the right of where the heart would be.

789
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,909
-Got it.
-I got three more!

790
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:05,788
Let's get out of here.

791
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,508
Get them on the bus! Get them
on that bus! Let's go, let's go!

792
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,747
-Get on.
-Get underneath.

793
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:21,868
You okay?

794
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:29,507
Heads up. Cover your
sectors of fire. Heads up!

795
00:51:32,948 --> 00:51:37,027
Marines, concentrate firepower to
the right of where the heart would be.

796
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:38,547
Yes, staff sergeant.

797
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,867
That's how we kill these things.

798
00:51:42,748 --> 00:51:44,307
All right, remember your training.

799
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,468
We got a hostile warbird,
thousand metres out.

800
00:51:46,628 --> 00:51:47,907
Everybody keep your eyes up.

801
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,787
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

802
00:51:57,988 --> 00:51:59,347
Roger that.

803
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:02,547
It should be about
six miles to the F.O.B.

804
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:04,547
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

805
00:52:04,908 --> 00:52:06,666
If we stay on these side streets.

806
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:09,507
Air Force is gonna level
this area in 40 minutes.

807
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:18,707
Get us to the forward
operating base. Fast.

808
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,345
What the hell is that?

809
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:36,346
Stavrou, stop the bus.

810
00:52:51,826 --> 00:52:52,905
Everyone, get down.

811
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:10,824
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

812
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:12,985
Go ahead,
Foxtrot-Two-November.

813
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:15,345
Enemy aircraft. They're
lighting up the sky...

814
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:18,065
...heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

815
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,344
Copy that.

816
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:23,304
They're tracking our signals.

817
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:29,424
Mottola, turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals!

818
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,785
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!

819
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,185
Give me your radio.

820
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,664
Mottola. Give me your radio.

821
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:45,024
Where you going?

822
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:47,264
-Staff sergeant!
-Where the hell is he going?

823
00:53:55,505 --> 00:54:00,024
-We gotta get off this bus, all right?
-Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

824
00:54:00,225 --> 00:54:03,223
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

825
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:06,423
It's getting closer.
Hey, it's on my six!

826
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:14,943
A hundred metres!

827
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:23,183
Oh, my God.

828
00:54:25,824 --> 00:54:27,542
Everybody, get down!

829
00:54:40,783 --> 00:54:42,622
Holy shit.

830
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:22,301
-What was that?
-Is he all right?

831
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:24,861
-Did he make it out?
-Staff sergeant?

832
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:43,301
-There he is.
-Staff sergeant's alive!

833
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:45,540
-Yeah, he's alive!
-There he is!

834
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,820
That aircraft was unmanned, Iieutenant.

835
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:23,059
Drone.

836
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,979
That was some real John
Wayne shit, staff sergeant.

837
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,219
Hey.

838
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,260
I can't afford to lose you.
Neither can these men, all right?

839
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,659
Yeah. They're your men.

840
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,939
All right, staff sergeant!

841
00:56:57,139 --> 00:56:58,659
That's how you do it!

842
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,938
-That's retreat, hell!
-That's right.

843
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:03,698
Who the hell's John Wayne?

844
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:15,497
Everybody, eyes open!

845
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:17,297
Stay alert!

846
00:57:18,258 --> 00:57:20,058
Thank you for that.

847
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:25,777
It's nothing.

848
00:57:27,058 --> 00:57:28,857
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?

849
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:37,098
During World War I, an officer from
our regiment was ordered to retreat.

850
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:41,816
He said, "Retreat,
hell. We just got here."

851
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:48,057
You should have the
doc take a look at that.

852
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:50,217
I thought you were a doctor.

853
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:53,256
Animals and aliens only.

854
00:57:53,897 --> 00:57:55,976
I'll put it on my to-do list.

855
00:57:56,657 --> 00:57:57,897
Thank you.

856
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:10,656
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did
you say that was an unmanned drone?

857
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,176
Correct.

858
00:58:13,178 --> 00:58:15,937
They must have one hell of
a command-and-control system.

859
00:58:16,617 --> 00:58:19,056
If NORTHCOM didn't agree
with you, I wouldn't be here.

860
00:58:19,256 --> 00:58:20,616
Why?

861
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:25,656
My mission was to provide
AIS with a strike package.

862
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:27,337
A strike package?

863
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:31,095
Yeah, coordinates for a missile
strike on a command-and-control centre.

864
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:35,055
But the asset fell off
the grid and we lost them.

865
00:58:44,576 --> 00:58:47,896
All side streets are blocked. Our
only choice is to take the freeway.

866
00:58:48,936 --> 00:58:51,176
All right. Well, it's your call.

867
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:53,015
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

868
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:57,855
We don't wanna be in this area
when these bombs start to fall.

869
00:59:20,495 --> 00:59:22,654
Try to miss at least
one of the cars, Stavrou.

870
00:59:24,455 --> 00:59:25,974
Just keep driving.

871
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:28,414
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

872
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:36,053
Jesus.

873
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:38,734
Look out.

874
00:59:44,575 --> 00:59:47,893
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

875
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,014
All right, Robertson
exit, half a click away.

876
00:59:57,734 --> 00:59:59,372
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!

877
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:10,013
-You okay?
-Harper!

878
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:19,812
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

879
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:22,173
I'll suppress the fire,
you take the civilians!

880
01:00:22,374 --> 01:00:24,292
Secure this exit, Imlay!

881
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:30,213
Imlay, get me a defensive
line on that vehicle!

882
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:36,412
-Move, move, move!
-Let's go! Come on.

883
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:39,052
-Let's go!
-Come on, stay down, stay down!

884
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:46,933
Just keep everybody calm.
We'll be right back, all right?

885
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:48,772
All right. Safety first, buddy.

886
01:00:51,892 --> 01:00:56,532
Martinez, if we get the civilians to
that helo, they take cover, rappel down.

887
01:00:56,732 --> 01:00:59,372
I got a dozen up on the
bridge. They're moving down.

888
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:02,811
Lieutenant! Tank's out!
Nothing's stopping them now!

889
01:01:05,612 --> 01:01:09,292
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make
it to that helo without cover fire.

890
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,251
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

891
01:01:12,453 --> 01:01:14,571
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

892
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:20,611
Get the civilians down, all right? Move!

893
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:27,091
Come on!

894
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:31,850
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.

895
01:01:32,052 --> 01:01:36,330
Get behind the bus! Now,
now, now! Get behind it!

896
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:39,571
Kids first! Around the body,
bring them down one at a time.

897
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:41,090
Roger that.

898
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:44,170
Imlay!

899
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:46,850
Get your team up on that garbage truck!

900
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:50,530
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!
Stavs, you're with me! On me now!

901
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,890
We're gonna run behind that helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, all right?

902
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,329
The girls will be first.

903
01:01:57,491 --> 01:02:00,370
I promise you nothing's
gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!

904
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,170
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles, maybe more!

905
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:07,769
Four hundred metres and closing fast!

906
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,570
Cover, cover! What
the hell are you doing?

907
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,289
You guys need another gun.

908
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,089
Three o'clock. Up on the
bridge, Santos. Up on the bridge.

909
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:18,009
Incoming!

910
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,729
Ten o'clock!

911
01:02:31,609 --> 01:02:33,688
-Reloading!
-Aim for the leader!

912
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,849
Hell, you can take
all the room you want.

913
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,209
Mottola, move, move, move!

914
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:46,848
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's
go! Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!

915
01:02:47,049 --> 01:02:50,489
Keep running! Don't
stop, run! Run, run, run!

916
01:02:57,089 --> 01:02:59,248
-Get in there!
-Cover me!

917
01:03:01,088 --> 01:03:03,888
-I'm going for the .50 cal!
-Hurry up!

918
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:11,167
Get some, Lockett.

919
01:03:22,129 --> 01:03:24,247
-Shit.
-What the hell is that thing?

920
01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:25,927
I'm engaging!

921
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:32,927
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay.
Listen to me. You're going to be okay.

922
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:35,967
I got you. I will not let
anything happen to you, all right?

923
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:43,247
Shit!

924
01:03:44,848 --> 01:03:46,607
Man down!

925
01:03:47,009 --> 01:03:50,007
You're gonna be okay. Hold on,
hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

926
01:03:50,487 --> 01:03:52,126
Keep looking up!

927
01:03:59,448 --> 01:04:00,886
Oh, God!

928
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:02,846
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,806
Get the ant that's
controlling that thing!

930
01:04:09,127 --> 01:04:10,447
Lockett, get off your ass!

931
01:04:16,406 --> 01:04:17,605
It's turning this way!

932
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:20,606
It's about to hit the fan,
guys. Get out now! Move!

933
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:22,366
Santos, come on!

934
01:04:23,207 --> 01:04:24,686
-Come on!
-I'm stuck.

935
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:26,126
Go!

936
01:04:27,286 --> 01:04:29,045
-What are you doing?
-Go!

937
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,005
Imlay!

938
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,125
Where's Stavrou?

939
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,285
Mottorola! How many down?

940
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:54,325
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!

941
01:04:54,525 --> 01:04:56,844
Look at me, look at me.
Look, look. Be good, okay?

942
01:04:57,046 --> 01:05:00,685
-It's gonna be fine, okay?
You ready? -Lieutenant, C-4!

943
01:05:02,926 --> 01:05:04,484
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

944
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,884
Let's do it.

945
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,244
Kerns!

946
01:05:15,566 --> 01:05:17,085
Covering!

947
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:29,764
All right, dough is good to go!

948
01:05:29,964 --> 01:05:31,683
-Go!
-Covering!

949
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:39,203
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.

950
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:43,243
-You all right?
-Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

951
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:51,364
-Mottorola!
-Dad!

952
01:05:51,805 --> 01:05:53,603
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.

953
01:05:53,764 --> 01:05:55,123
Hold on!

954
01:05:58,484 --> 01:06:01,282
-I need bandages from the first aid kit.
-Sir! Sir!

955
01:06:01,484 --> 01:06:02,843
It's okay!

956
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,362
Oh, my God!

957
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:13,202
All right.

958
01:06:28,043 --> 01:06:29,923
We gotta get you to a medevac.

959
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:31,563
Doc!

960
01:06:35,562 --> 01:06:36,561
Oh, shit, man!

961
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:38,402
-We need some cover!
-Damn it, I'm out!

962
01:06:38,563 --> 01:06:40,762
-Got another mag, Lockett?
-They kicking our ass!

963
01:06:40,922 --> 01:06:43,162
You're getting pinned
down, staff sergeant!

964
01:06:43,363 --> 01:06:45,563
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

965
01:06:46,323 --> 01:06:48,721
-We're not leaving you.
-Staff sergeant, get them out!

966
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,882
-Lieutenant, I am not
leav-- -Get them out!

967
01:06:51,082 --> 01:06:53,041
-No, I'm not leaving you!
-Get them out!

968
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,241
No! Not again!

969
01:06:57,283 --> 01:06:59,840
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

970
01:07:00,762 --> 01:07:02,721
Give this to my wife...

971
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:05,521
...and get them off
this goddamn freeway.

972
01:07:09,162 --> 01:07:10,601
That's an order.

973
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:15,200
Yes, sir.

974
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:19,801
Right behind you.

975
01:07:27,721 --> 01:07:28,920
Cover the lieutenant!

976
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:33,121
Hey, I'm out!

977
01:07:38,961 --> 01:07:40,559
They're closing in!

978
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:45,240
Here we go.

979
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,239
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...

980
01:07:53,441 --> 01:07:56,800
...Echo Company, 2nd
Battalion, 5th Marines. Hoorah!

981
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,638
We're still half a klick
inside the bombing zone.

982
01:09:03,959 --> 01:09:05,998
Move to live, Marines.

983
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:13,197
Did he just leave the
lieutenant back there to die?

984
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,998
Sure looked that way.

985
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,677
And this is the guy in charge of us now?

986
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,757
Let's move.

987
01:09:22,678 --> 01:09:26,797
Hey, those are our jets.
We're still in the fight.

988
01:09:28,358 --> 01:09:30,918
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.

989
01:09:31,398 --> 01:09:32,916
Let's tighten this place down.

990
01:09:33,118 --> 01:09:34,716
Bombs drop in six minutes.

991
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:36,797
Santos, Kerns, on me.

992
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:40,597
Let's see if there are any
comms. All right? Hardwire only.

993
01:09:59,117 --> 01:10:01,076
-Corporal Harris, we clear?
-We're clear!

994
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:04,156
-Do you have a hard line in here?
-Over there.

995
01:10:08,277 --> 01:10:09,877
Now, my son's an optimist.

996
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:14,995
When this first happened, he said,
"Why don't we go try to talk to them?

997
01:10:16,277 --> 01:10:18,236
Maybe they wanna be friends."

998
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:22,956
Hector? Hey.

999
01:10:23,157 --> 01:10:26,155
We're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, okay?

1000
01:10:26,796 --> 01:10:28,235
It's okay.

1001
01:10:29,156 --> 01:10:30,475
And what'd you tell him?

1002
01:10:30,676 --> 01:10:32,155
I said:

1003
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:35,116
"You know, if they're
chasing and shooting us...

1004
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:37,595
...they're probably not good friends."

1005
01:10:40,996 --> 01:10:43,915
I should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

1006
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:47,435
I should've never stayed at the
police station, but I was scared, man.

1007
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:51,555
I made all the wrong decisions.

1008
01:10:51,755 --> 01:10:53,915
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1009
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:56,875
You made a call.

1010
01:10:57,036 --> 01:10:59,714
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

1011
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:08,674
-I had a situation my last tour.
-Yeah?

1012
01:11:09,835 --> 01:11:13,075
There was no right call. You went
left or you go right, it didn't matter.

1013
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,834
But you're alive.

1014
01:11:18,035 --> 01:11:19,794
Yeah, I survived.

1015
01:11:21,995 --> 01:11:23,634
But I wasn't supposed to.

1016
01:11:26,035 --> 01:11:27,873
Staff Sergeant Nantz....

1017
01:11:36,395 --> 01:11:38,513
You promise to save my son?

1018
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,634
Staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!

1019
01:11:51,034 --> 01:11:53,912
Doc, keep him warm. Sun is going down.

1020
01:11:54,873 --> 01:11:56,553
This will keep you warm.

1021
01:11:56,954 --> 01:12:01,073
We're estimating that 20 cities in 17
countries are now under full attack.

1022
01:12:01,394 --> 01:12:04,953
It's obvious the enemy is attempting
to cut us off from one another.

1023
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,233
Is there any more information
at this time, Professor Stavert?

1024
01:12:08,433 --> 01:12:11,113
New data shows that they're
using our water as their fuel...

1025
01:12:11,273 --> 01:12:13,352
...and our ocean levels
are already decreasing.

1026
01:12:13,554 --> 01:12:16,352
They are using it to power
their ships, their machinery...

1027
01:12:16,554 --> 01:12:20,352
...possibly their own bodies. It's the
composition of our water that's unique.

1028
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:23,792
It's in a liquid state. No other
locations in our known universe...

1029
01:12:23,993 --> 01:12:26,512
...have liquid H2O
anywhere near their surface.

1030
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:30,193
I just saw a field report that said
they will use our sewage systems...

1031
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:33,631
-...to follow our water to their ships.
-How'd you get that to work?

1032
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:37,672
These things are everywhere. There's
one off the coast of 20 countries.

1033
01:12:37,873 --> 01:12:40,392
They're calling it the
command-and-control centre.

1034
01:12:41,473 --> 01:12:44,111
-That's the thing you were tracking?
-Yeah.

1035
01:12:44,312 --> 01:12:47,951
So you're saying that's the thing
that's controlling the drones?

1036
01:12:48,153 --> 01:12:52,591
Yeah. And if we wipe it out,
we take out their air power.

1037
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:56,871
These bombs better work.

1038
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,231
-Let's move it.
-Bring him through here.

1039
01:12:59,512 --> 01:13:02,351
-Set him down.
-How much time we got?

1040
01:13:03,111 --> 01:13:04,151
One minute.

1041
01:13:07,192 --> 01:13:10,430
Air Force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.

1042
01:13:13,392 --> 01:13:15,510
-All right, Two-Five,
retreat.... -Hell!

1043
01:13:15,712 --> 01:13:17,550
-Retreat....
-Hell!

1044
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:19,990
Here we go.

1045
01:13:20,152 --> 01:13:22,510
Come on. Let's fry
these sons of bitches.

1046
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:25,150
We get to the F.O.B. after
these bombs drop, get ammo.

1047
01:13:25,311 --> 01:13:28,430
And some goddamn reinforcements.
Some goddamn tanks.

1048
01:13:33,311 --> 01:13:35,150
-Ten.
-Gotta be strong, okay?

1049
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,749
Nine.

1050
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:38,550
Eight.

1051
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:39,990
Seven.

1052
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:41,670
Six.

1053
01:13:41,871 --> 01:13:43,190
Five.

1054
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:45,110
Four.

1055
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:47,429
Three....

1056
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,390
Shit. Everybody, brace!

1057
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,389
-They should've dropped.
-What the hell?

1058
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:16,108
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if
they'd dropped? We would've felt them.

1059
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:18,428
Would've felt it in
Nevada with that ordnance.

1060
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,068
That clock right?

1061
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,469
That's what I got.

1062
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:24,829
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we
turned the tide. That's a good thing.

1063
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:27,309
You damn straight, Imlay.
We was kicking some ass.

1064
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:30,068
Could they have taken
out the whole Air Force?

1065
01:14:30,269 --> 01:14:31,908
This isn't happening.

1066
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:33,189
Let's move.

1067
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:35,389
Everybody, up, up. Let's move. Come on.

1068
01:14:35,589 --> 01:14:38,307
We're in the home stretch,
everybody. We in the home stretch.

1069
01:14:55,549 --> 01:14:58,067
Now we know why those bombs didn't drop.

1070
01:14:58,629 --> 01:15:01,828
They wiped our forward
operating base right off the map.

1071
01:15:03,509 --> 01:15:05,627
All clear, staff sergeant!

1072
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,467
All right, let's bring him back here.

1073
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,508
Hang in there, buddy.

1074
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:16,187
Million-and-one odds we'd
get here in the first place...

1075
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:20,467
...we get here and there ain't nothing.
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

1076
01:15:22,428 --> 01:15:26,267
-There were thousands of Marines here.
-Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

1077
01:15:27,948 --> 01:15:30,146
You remind me of my older brother.

1078
01:15:30,907 --> 01:15:32,626
How's that?

1079
01:15:33,268 --> 01:15:35,547
He never smiles either.

1080
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,347
Secure the front with Harris.

1081
01:15:42,267 --> 01:15:43,706
Imlay, anything?

1082
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,866
Nothing. We only got
maps of Santa Monica.

1083
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:48,546
We need something farther
east. They're all burned.

1084
01:15:48,747 --> 01:15:49,786
Follow me, Imlay.

1085
01:15:54,547 --> 01:15:57,266
All right, here's the
battalion commander's hooch.

1086
01:15:57,426 --> 01:15:59,745
Looking for maps, anything
with an extraction point.

1087
01:15:59,906 --> 01:16:01,626
Staff sergeant.

1088
01:16:10,547 --> 01:16:12,265
I'll be right back.

1089
01:16:18,347 --> 01:16:20,345
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

1090
01:16:20,506 --> 01:16:22,825
Shows where all the units were deployed.

1091
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:26,346
-What the hell are all these red marks?
-Means they're gone.

1092
01:16:26,546 --> 01:16:29,465
-You mean the units got moved?
-Wiped out.

1093
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:32,385
-All of them?
-All of them.

1094
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:33,784
Oh, shit.

1095
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:37,945
All right. One alternate extraction
site is still operational.

1096
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:40,305
That's eight klicks.

1097
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:44,145
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.

1098
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:47,704
Adukwu, plenty of weapons
around. Find yourself an M-16.

1099
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:49,385
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1100
01:17:13,065 --> 01:17:14,623
Wake up, Dad.

1101
01:17:22,545 --> 01:17:25,103
Please help me right now.

1102
01:17:26,944 --> 01:17:28,623
Don't leave me.

1103
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:36,224
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1104
01:17:40,143 --> 01:17:41,543
I'm sorry.

1105
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:43,663
No.

1106
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:47,503
Your dad tried so hard to stay with you.

1107
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:51,102
-I'm sorr-- -I
don't wanna be here.

1108
01:17:57,784 --> 01:17:59,383
It's okay, bud.

1109
01:18:06,263 --> 01:18:09,022
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

1110
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:22,262
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.

1111
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,462
It's okay to cry.

1112
01:18:29,502 --> 01:18:31,662
He loved you very much.

1113
01:18:32,702 --> 01:18:34,542
Listen to me, Hector.

1114
01:18:36,142 --> 01:18:40,022
I need you to be brave for me. I
need you to be my little Marine.

1115
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:44,341
Okay?

1116
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,422
We gotta be brave for the others.

1117
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,701
Do you know why?

1118
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:56,020
Why?

1119
01:18:58,982 --> 01:19:01,421
Because Marines don't quit.

1120
01:19:03,502 --> 01:19:04,901
Do you believe that?

1121
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,500
Say it for me.

1122
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:14,940
-Marines don't quit.
-Good.

1123
01:19:15,461 --> 01:19:19,299
I'm gonna get you out of
here, Hector. I promise.

1124
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:25,420
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.

1125
01:19:42,661 --> 01:19:45,939
We are not losing one more of
those civilians. Understand?

1126
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,859
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?

1127
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,579
Or are we expendable?

1128
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,659
All right, Lockett.

1129
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,619
You wanna go there, let's go there.

1130
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:15,339
I commanded men and men died.

1131
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:20,058
Kids. 19 years old.
The best men I ever led.

1132
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:25,418
Do you think for one second I
wouldn't rather trade places with them?

1133
01:20:31,419 --> 01:20:34,058
I know you think I got my men killed.

1134
01:20:36,818 --> 01:20:38,258
They're dead.

1135
01:20:39,818 --> 01:20:41,258
I'm here.

1136
01:20:42,059 --> 01:20:44,458
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

1137
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:46,538
You think I like that?

1138
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:50,017
Do you think a minute goes by that
those faces aren't right here...

1139
01:20:50,218 --> 01:20:52,297
...seared into my brain?

1140
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:59,817
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

1141
01:20:59,978 --> 01:21:05,417
Ambruster, William R.
Private. 8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

1142
01:21:06,098 --> 01:21:08,537
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

1143
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:13,577
Lance Corporal.
8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

1144
01:21:17,338 --> 01:21:18,817
Lockett...

1145
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:24,537
...Duane G.

1146
01:21:26,138 --> 01:21:27,696
Corporal.

1147
01:21:29,257 --> 01:21:33,736

1-5-6-8-7-0-9....

1148
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:35,776
Five-five.

1149
01:21:37,778 --> 01:21:40,415
Your brother was an outstanding Marine.

1150
01:21:42,977 --> 01:21:44,096
He was my friend.

1151
01:21:45,177 --> 01:21:49,857
And I miss him every day.

1152
01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:54,216
And you remind me of him.

1153
01:22:03,176 --> 01:22:05,255
None of that matters right now.

1154
01:22:07,016 --> 01:22:10,775
Because our duty is to keep
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

1155
01:22:11,896 --> 01:22:13,536
That's how we honour your brother...

1156
01:22:14,136 --> 01:22:15,815
...and Lieutenant Martinez...

1157
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,974
...Corporal Stavrou...

1158
01:22:18,176 --> 01:22:20,095
...Lance Corporal Mottola...

1159
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,015
...Hector's father...

1160
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:26,055
...who picked up a rifle and did
what needed to be done. A civilian.

1161
01:22:26,256 --> 01:22:28,535
So we better damn well step it up.

1162
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,695
Discard any lingering doubt.

1163
01:22:31,256 --> 01:22:33,735
Work fast, work as a
unit, and we will prevail.

1164
01:22:33,976 --> 01:22:36,134
Let's figure out how we're
gonna get out of this.

1165
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:38,375
Imlay, you come with
me. Get to higher ground.

1166
01:22:38,616 --> 01:22:41,055
The rest of you, find some
ammo and some vehicles.

1167
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:44,614
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured
Humvees still operational.

1168
01:22:45,455 --> 01:22:48,535
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

1169
01:22:51,816 --> 01:22:54,015
You went down fighting.

1170
01:23:00,135 --> 01:23:01,534
Holy shit.

1171
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,654
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

1172
01:23:05,255 --> 01:23:06,854
That don't look good.

1173
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:08,295
Reinforcements.

1174
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:14,454
Holy shit.

1175
01:23:16,134 --> 01:23:18,294
They already set up a beachhead.

1176
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:20,414
All right.

1177
01:23:21,974 --> 01:23:25,973
If that evac site is still operational,
I think we can get behind the line.

1178
01:23:26,174 --> 01:23:27,973
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.

1179
01:23:28,214 --> 01:23:30,053
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.

1180
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:33,693
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!

1181
01:23:33,894 --> 01:23:36,292
Any station, this net. This
is Foxtrot-Two-November.

1182
01:23:36,453 --> 01:23:37,573
We have 11 passengers.

1183
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:41,893
Requesting evacuation at
alternate extraction point Charlie.

1184
01:23:42,094 --> 01:23:44,013
Are there any birds in the air? Over.

1185
01:23:44,214 --> 01:23:47,852
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is
Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.

1186
01:23:48,053 --> 01:23:51,972
Get to extraction point Charlie
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.

1187
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:55,013
Roger that. 0300, not
a minute more. Out.

1188
01:23:57,013 --> 01:23:59,293
Imlay, ever see what a
Bushmaster chain gun can do?

1189
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:01,852
-Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
-Get on it, son.

1190
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:03,972
Let's do this!

1191
01:24:07,814 --> 01:24:09,252
-No lights, Kerns.
-Roger that.

1192
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:11,773
Let's move.

1193
01:24:14,852 --> 01:24:16,412
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

1194
01:24:16,612 --> 01:24:17,812
Give them hell.

1195
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:19,452
Damn right.

1196
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,612
Two minutes till that helo drops.

1197
01:24:35,172 --> 01:24:36,852
Everybody okay?

1198
01:24:39,732 --> 01:24:42,691
All right, Kerns, take a left.

1199
01:24:42,852 --> 01:24:45,971
I want you to go over three blocks,
then you go about five blocks...

1200
01:24:46,172 --> 01:24:47,971
...hang a right, and straight.

1201
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:50,930
-That should get us to the evac site.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

1202
01:24:52,932 --> 01:24:56,611
-I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!
-Copy that!

1203
01:24:58,372 --> 01:25:00,131
-We got hostiles.
-What's going on?

1204
01:25:00,332 --> 01:25:03,170
-Let's not wait around and find out.
-It's gonna be okay.

1205
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:06,050
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.

1206
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:15,490
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

1207
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:17,410
-Speed up!
-Damn straight!

1208
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,370
-Come on!
-Y'all hold on!

1209
01:25:24,571 --> 01:25:27,010
We're gonna have to
go right through them!

1210
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,850
-You saw that?
-They're going down like bowling pins!

1211
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,769
Kick it out!

1212
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,649
Run that sucker over, man!

1213
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:05,969
Santos, you okay?

1214
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,528
I got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!

1215
01:26:11,969 --> 01:26:15,648
-It's not funny.
-You let him do you on the first date.

1216
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:31,488
-Everyone okay?
-Yes!

1217
01:26:32,808 --> 01:26:33,968
Let's get us home.

1218
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:42,048
Cease fire!

1219
01:26:46,488 --> 01:26:48,767
-Stay close, stay close!
-What are we doing?

1220
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:55,567
Load them up! Our flight path
won't be clear much longer!

1221
01:26:55,769 --> 01:26:57,647
You're in the middle
of the shit, sergeant!

1222
01:26:57,809 --> 01:26:59,207
What happened to all our air?

1223
01:26:59,407 --> 01:27:02,607
Pulled back to save our assets!
They were blowing us out!

1224
01:27:02,808 --> 01:27:04,407
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1225
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:15,767
Let's go, Imlay!

1226
01:27:16,088 --> 01:27:17,727
Son, you okay?

1227
01:27:19,528 --> 01:27:20,847
All right.

1228
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:24,526
Let's move! Move, move!

1229
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,606
Come on, Harris, let's go!

1230
01:28:07,886 --> 01:28:09,285
Hold on!

1231
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:13,686
-You all right?
-Everybody all good?

1232
01:28:13,886 --> 01:28:16,044
-Girls?
-Everybody okay?

1233
01:28:16,245 --> 01:28:17,805
Hold on tight!

1234
01:28:19,566 --> 01:28:20,724
What happened?

1235
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:24,045
Pilot said something was
playing hell with our power!

1236
01:28:24,246 --> 01:28:27,484
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!

1237
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:36,204
Santos, you said you were
tracking massive RF signals?

1238
01:28:36,405 --> 01:28:38,885
Could a concentration
of them knock out power?

1239
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:42,804
Yes, definitely! Why?

1240
01:28:43,165 --> 01:28:45,444
Could be their
command-and-control centre!

1241
01:28:48,645 --> 01:28:50,084
Get me down there!

1242
01:28:50,285 --> 01:28:51,644
What?

1243
01:28:52,724 --> 01:28:54,924
I gotta recon that area!

1244
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,323
No way! It's a suicide!

1245
01:28:57,525 --> 01:29:01,124
Damn it, we're the only ones left!
All the other forces have fallen back!

1246
01:29:01,324 --> 01:29:05,723
We can't land! May not have
power to take off again!

1247
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:15,084
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

1248
01:29:16,404 --> 01:29:17,884
Will you get it to her?

1249
01:29:21,084 --> 01:29:22,403
Yeah.

1250
01:29:27,564 --> 01:29:30,123
Hover at 40 feet!

1251
01:29:30,604 --> 01:29:31,962
-Twenty seconds!
-Roger that!

1252
01:29:36,323 --> 01:29:38,683
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

1253
01:29:38,883 --> 01:29:41,003
Staff sergeant, what
the hell are you doing?

1254
01:29:41,204 --> 01:29:44,082
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

1255
01:29:44,283 --> 01:29:46,282
You're in charge now!

1256
01:29:47,123 --> 01:29:49,683
You get these civilians home safe!

1257
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:56,083
You're the bravest Marine
I ever seen, Hector!

1258
01:29:57,442 --> 01:29:58,921
No!

1259
01:30:41,082 --> 01:30:43,041
Everybody, take cover.

1260
01:30:45,962 --> 01:30:47,401
I told you to stay in that helo.

1261
01:30:47,601 --> 01:30:50,960
Civilians are free and clear.
We were worried about your ass.

1262
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:53,441
I think the command-and-control
asset is nearby.

1263
01:30:54,002 --> 01:30:56,041
Kerns, how many klicks to that blackout?

1264
01:30:56,482 --> 01:30:58,601
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

1265
01:30:58,802 --> 01:31:00,200
Five klicks. All right.

1266
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,800
We're gonna use this overpass for cover.

1267
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,400
If we take out those drones...

1268
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:08,961
...our military might have a
chance to get back into this fight.

1269
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:10,881
Santos...

1270
01:31:11,282 --> 01:31:14,799
...where would you put a command and
control asset if you wanted to protect it?

1271
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:17,720
-Underground.
-Let's go.

1272
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:22,320
Everybody, let's move.
Come on. Move, move, move.

1273
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,759
Move.

1274
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:42,597
They must've gone back up.
Just leads up to the street.

1275
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:45,757
I thought they were leading us
to the command-and-control centre.

1276
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:47,597
Damn it.

1277
01:32:51,758 --> 01:32:53,838
Let's go. Back.

1278
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:04,357
Holy shit!

1279
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:06,957
Santos!

1280
01:33:21,717 --> 01:33:23,515
They know we're here now.

1281
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:35,836
That's their
command-and-control.

1282
01:33:41,117 --> 01:33:43,796
Everybody out now! Move,
move, move! Follow me!

1283
01:33:44,277 --> 01:33:47,835
Up here! Up that ladder, go!
Move, move, move! Up that ladder!

1284
01:33:48,636 --> 01:33:50,835
Let's go! Move it up!
Blow that grate, Imlay!

1285
01:33:52,196 --> 01:33:53,356
Move, move, move!

1286
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:01,555
We're right over their command asset.

1287
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:06,595
That's it, all right. Let's move the
concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.

1288
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:09,875
Fire in the hole!

1289
01:34:10,076 --> 01:34:12,315
That should give us a couple minutes.

1290
01:34:27,956 --> 01:34:30,914
Laser target, staff sergeant? We
don't have any more jets, though.

1291
01:34:31,116 --> 01:34:34,115
They can fire ground-to-ground
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1292
01:34:34,275 --> 01:34:36,675
We radio in a strike, paint
the target with the laser.

1293
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:38,474
-Aye-aye, staff
sergeant. -Hoorah.

1294
01:34:38,674 --> 01:34:41,594
Our best chance at radio reception
is on top of that building...

1295
01:34:41,755 --> 01:34:43,114
...but it's the most exposed.

1296
01:34:43,315 --> 01:34:45,674
I'll do it, staff sergeant.
I'll make the call.

1297
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:47,274
Santos, you got those codes?

1298
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:49,434
Air Force strike package coming up.

1299
01:34:50,954 --> 01:34:54,033
You get to high ground. Once you
radio in, they'll track that signal.

1300
01:34:54,234 --> 01:34:55,713
Things are gonna get real hot.

1301
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:59,113
So once you make that call, you get
the hell out of there, all right?

1302
01:34:59,635 --> 01:35:00,753
You know what that means?

1303
01:35:00,955 --> 01:35:03,993
We're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.

1304
01:35:04,194 --> 01:35:06,113
Bingo. Marines...

1305
01:35:07,514 --> 01:35:11,554
...we make our stand here. Let those
bastards know who they're fucking with.

1306
01:35:11,754 --> 01:35:12,753
-Retreat....
-Hell!

1307
01:35:12,954 --> 01:35:14,353
Two-Five.

1308
01:35:24,754 --> 01:35:26,993
-Right of the heart, right?
-Right of the heart.

1309
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:29,673
They're gonna be coming
up from there. Take two.

1310
01:35:29,873 --> 01:35:32,152
Plant one there and the
other one on the other side.

1311
01:35:32,353 --> 01:35:34,873
-Keep your head down, get it done.
-Doc, watch your back!

1312
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:37,112
Watch your head! Watch it!

1313
01:35:44,753 --> 01:35:53,152
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

1314
01:35:53,353 --> 01:35:55,511
Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Yankee-Tango, over.

1315
01:35:55,713 --> 01:35:59,072
We have a priority fire mission. We've
located an enemy command centre...

1316
01:35:59,312 --> 01:36:02,632
...under grid 885-342.

1317
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:05,632
We will be
lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1318
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:08,151
I say again, we will
be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1319
01:36:08,352 --> 01:36:10,792
Copy that. Time to
target, three minutes.

1320
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:13,711
Staff sergeant!

1321
01:36:14,473 --> 01:36:17,632
We got three minutes! It's
coming in three minutes!

1322
01:36:17,832 --> 01:36:20,551
All right. Let's paint this target.

1323
01:36:31,831 --> 01:36:34,111
Hell of a shot, Kerns!
Get your ass out of there!

1324
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:38,191
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.

1325
01:36:42,032 --> 01:36:43,911
-Shit!
-Kerns!

1326
01:36:46,751 --> 01:36:49,110
Shit! Shit!

1327
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:55,911
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now! Move, move!

1328
01:36:56,111 --> 01:36:57,629
Shit.

1329
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:02,310
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

1330
01:37:03,191 --> 01:37:04,910
Covering up front!

1331
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:07,030
-Go, go, go!
-Go on, get in there!

1332
01:37:08,711 --> 01:37:10,429
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!

1333
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:13,030
Right there, right there!

1334
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:19,710
Got it!

1335
01:37:20,551 --> 01:37:22,310
Sixty seconds left.

1336
01:37:31,711 --> 01:37:34,109
-Lockett!
-Shit!

1337
01:37:37,549 --> 01:37:38,909
Let's go!

1338
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:48,229
Back in the fight, Santos!

1339
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:50,748
-Need a little help!
-Covering!

1340
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,908
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

1341
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:55,188
-I got it, Doc!
-Covering!

1342
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:05,588
Where's that goddamn
artillery? Should've hit by now.

1343
01:38:07,029 --> 01:38:08,708
Doc, let's go!

1344
01:38:12,109 --> 01:38:14,427
-Doc?
-Imlay! Imlay!

1345
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:24,468
Incoming!

1346
01:38:29,628 --> 01:38:30,907
Yes!

1347
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:34,267
Santos, we got it! We got it!

1348
01:38:36,068 --> 01:38:38,988
Direct hit! Direct hit!

1349
01:38:39,149 --> 01:38:40,387
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1350
01:38:43,788 --> 01:38:45,027
Yes, we got it!

1351
01:38:45,508 --> 01:38:47,907
The strike package. It went through?

1352
01:38:48,508 --> 01:38:50,787
-It came through?
-Yeah! All right, Kerns!

1353
01:38:51,908 --> 01:38:53,266
It's over.

1354
01:39:09,667 --> 01:39:11,226
It's coming up. It's coming up.

1355
01:39:22,947 --> 01:39:25,306
They're trying to get away.

1356
01:39:30,107 --> 01:39:33,305
The goddamn thing can fly,
staff sergeant. It's flying now!

1357
01:39:33,507 --> 01:39:34,625
I'll get you out!

1358
01:39:42,467 --> 01:39:44,945
We gotta protect the
laser. Come on. Come on!

1359
01:39:46,786 --> 01:39:48,265
Santos!

1360
01:39:58,146 --> 01:39:59,584
Son of a bitch!

1361
01:40:02,026 --> 01:40:04,865
-That hurt!
-Cover me, Lockett!

1362
01:40:10,025 --> 01:40:13,265
The drones are pulling it
away! We gotta take it out now!

1363
01:40:16,745 --> 01:40:18,944
Incoming Copperhead!

1364
01:40:23,465 --> 01:40:26,184
They're using the drone
to protect the ship!

1365
01:40:29,586 --> 01:40:31,264
I'm running low on ammo!

1366
01:40:31,465 --> 01:40:32,824
Santos!

1367
01:40:36,945 --> 01:40:39,864
-How is he?
-He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!

1368
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:42,104
Crazy bastard. You
should've left me there.

1369
01:40:46,585 --> 01:40:48,023
Covering!

1370
01:40:48,904 --> 01:40:50,063
Grenade!

1371
01:40:56,585 --> 01:40:58,983
-Staff sergeant!
-We are not dying here, Lockett!

1372
01:40:59,224 --> 01:41:01,183
You damn right we're not dying!

1373
01:41:02,624 --> 01:41:04,783
It's getting out of range!
I gotta take it down!

1374
01:41:04,983 --> 01:41:06,903
Doesn't have enough
punch! Save that shot!

1375
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:17,823
Staff sergeant!

1376
01:41:18,023 --> 01:41:19,262
Lockett, you okay?

1377
01:41:19,464 --> 01:41:21,343
Harris, you're gonna be okay.

1378
01:41:44,743 --> 01:41:46,982
There's the last Copperhead.

1379
01:41:50,662 --> 01:41:53,181
Santos, take out that drone!

1380
01:41:55,462 --> 01:41:57,141
Firing!

1381
01:42:13,383 --> 01:42:14,862
-Yeah!
-We did it!

1382
01:42:16,981 --> 01:42:20,741
We did it!

1383
01:42:25,862 --> 01:42:28,622
I can't believe it worked!

1384
01:42:34,502 --> 01:42:36,141
Yeah!

1385
01:42:36,341 --> 01:42:37,901
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1386
01:42:40,102 --> 01:42:42,980
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore!

1387
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:51,060
Marines, on me!

1388
01:43:03,021 --> 01:43:05,420
They're retreating. Advance!

1389
01:44:13,178 --> 01:44:14,977
You guys saved our lives out there!

1390
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:16,977
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

1391
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:20,458
-All right, Two-Five!
-Retreat, hell!

1392
01:44:20,659 --> 01:44:23,218
You kicked ass, staff
sarge! Welcome home!

1393
01:44:24,098 --> 01:44:27,217
-Move! Move! Move!
-Good work, Marines! Outstanding.

1394
01:44:27,778 --> 01:44:29,578
Your civilians are safe.

1395
01:44:29,778 --> 01:44:32,257
Word of how you brought
their ship down...

1396
01:44:32,418 --> 01:44:35,018
...is going out to
every army in every city.

1397
01:44:35,218 --> 01:44:39,056
We're mustering up whatever troops
we can get and going back in.

1398
01:44:39,298 --> 01:44:41,256
So get out of that gear.

1399
01:44:41,817 --> 01:44:42,977
Get some chow in you.

1400
01:44:43,418 --> 01:44:45,217
There's breakfast in the tent.

1401
01:44:45,418 --> 01:44:48,697
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.

1402
01:45:35,176 --> 01:45:36,616
-Get some smoke, Imlay.
-Got you.

1403
01:45:36,816 --> 01:45:38,936
Got grenades over here. Anybody need?

1404
01:45:39,136 --> 01:45:43,175
-Got frag rounds coming down.
-Imlay, I think you could use this.

1405
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:46,175
-Got it. HE rounds.
-I need a couple more magazines.

1406
01:45:46,376 --> 01:45:48,535
-Very nice, very nice.
-Everybody got ammo?

1407
01:45:48,736 --> 01:45:50,135
Yes, staff sergeant.

1408
01:45:50,536 --> 01:45:52,935
What do you think you're
doing, staff sergeant?

1409
01:45:53,695 --> 01:45:55,854
We already had breakfast, sir.

1410
01:46:04,576 --> 01:46:06,334
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

1411
01:46:06,575 --> 01:46:07,934
Carry on.

1412
01:46:09,016 --> 01:46:10,974
-Retreat, hell!
-Hoorah!

1413
01:46:12,095 --> 01:46:14,014
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?

1414
01:46:14,255 --> 01:46:16,415
Morning, Bullpen. Dog
Pound 2-1, on your left.

1415
01:46:16,575 --> 01:46:18,534
Good to hear a friendly
voice, Dog Pound 2-1.

1416
01:46:18,695 --> 01:46:20,574
Liberty 1-1, Snake
Eyes joining the fight.

1417
01:46:20,735 --> 01:46:22,414
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,
we're on your six.

1418
01:46:22,575 --> 01:46:24,574
-Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.
-Eagle on your right.

1419
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:28,854
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.
Let's take back Los Angeles.
