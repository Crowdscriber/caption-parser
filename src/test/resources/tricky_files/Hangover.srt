  myself.

24
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,917
In what way?

25
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,990

27
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,305

28
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:21,085
"Words with Friends".

29
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:24,732
- What friends, Alan?
- you can set it all random .

30
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,406
Alan ... Beside from the fact 
that you shut down 
a freeway

31
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:33,815
- You murdered a wild animal.
It's National news.

32
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:37,550

 I had to write to fix this 

33
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:41,590
- oh ! Please We are Rich .
- We are not anything , Alan.

34
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:45,515

You're bluffing.
When's dinner?

38
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:00,569

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,562

I can not believe
my daddy is dead

44
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:32,822
I can think of so many people 
I would rather have died first 

45
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,193
like My mother 

46
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:41,877
As many of you know,
my father and I were extremely close.

47
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:45,949
He was my life partner.

48
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:49,796
He would often tell me almost
on a daily basis

49
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,469
- that I was his favorite child.

50
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:56,373
I will always remember the last words 
he said to me.

51
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:01,548
"I'm proud of you, Alan.
 Never change . "

52
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,389
Well ,I heard you loud and clear,
 Daddy.

53
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,045
I will never change.

54
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,051
Never ever.

55
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:17,901
Go Ahead chief

56
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:27,254

58
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,784
Not great. Her mother is totally
 on the edgeand if all this were not 
enough 

59
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,491
- Appearently alan has been off his meds
for almost six months.

60

62
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:52,461

but alan has been stopping by my office lately .

64
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,620
- you're kidding me ? What for ?
- I do not know.

65
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:04,023
He just sits in the waiting room
and reads highlights magazine.

66
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,040
He fills in the puzzels , whatever he can
and then leaves !

67
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,022
Check it out .

68
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,849

69
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,515
 actually I would like to talk
to you about that.

70
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:21,976
- Linda really wants to stage an intervention for him 
- An intervention?

71
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:25,312
- Really?
- I think that sounds like a great idea.

72
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:29,635
yup , The thing is  she is pretty convinced
that he wouldn't agree to it 

73
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:33,415
-unless all of us were there
I mean you know how he is 

74
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,894
I do not know ...
It seems a little extreme to me.

75
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:39,754
Oh, God!
 look at him now .

76
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,625
Okay, I'm in.

77
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:54,054

that the treatment facility that she found was very nice .

78
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:57,538
It's beautiful. I checked it out online 
Great reputation.

00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:05,437

send him to a fat camp.
Phil !!

82
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:09,925
why ??! He should lose some weight and find a woman.
That's what he needs. the dude is lonely.

83
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:12,933
well If he's so lonely,
why don't the two of you spend some more time together

84
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,898
- No trust me , you don't want that.
- No, we will difinitely do not want that.

85
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:20,284

00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,582
It was a nightmare.

- Speaking of which, you've ever got tested?
- Excuse me?!

91
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,075
you know because of the ink 

92
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,729
"The one inside you."

93
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,581

171
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:33,535
and whether you know it or not  
We all have something in common

00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:38,856
and It all started
four years ago, when this moron 

173
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,639
- Sold the wrong drugs
to this dumb fuck.

that ere set in motion that night

175
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,091
- In a parking lot of
 of the fucking liquor store.

176
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:14,085
- What up, nigger?
- Excuse me?!

177
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:17,397
Chill out. I'm not a cop.

183

185
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,569
You're not here because of that .

00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:46,816
You're here because some china man,

188
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,537
- Mr. Chow?
- Yes!

189
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:55,078
Yes, Mr. Leslie-fucking-Chow.

190
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:57,730
you introduced the virus into my life.

191
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,658
- Oh, God! What did he do?
- He fucked me in the ass.

192
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:03,250
Well, he does that from time to time .

193
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,810
Not literlly.

194
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,068
Jesus!

195
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:12,716
A few weeks after your bull-shit 

196
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,574
- I get word this sheikh is
coming in  from Abu Dhabi.

197
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,143
<i> He was looking to make some less 
than legal investments. </ i>

198
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:28,666
<i> He brought his two wives
and 42 million dollars in gold bars . </ i>

199
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,722
- It was a lay up.
- Down , Get down !

200
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,187
<i> We took it all. </ i>

201
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:43,362
<i> Two vans, each one 
with $ 21 million in gold. </ i>

202
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:45,973
<i> My guys splet up. </ i>

203
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:50,197
<i> one of them made it back - </ i>

204
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,126
<i> - One of them didn't . </ i>

205
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:07,329
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Not anymore, motherfucker.

206
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:13,598
Leslie Chow stole
$ 21 million from me.

207
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,568
On a Tuesday.
Oh GOD !

208
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:21,336
I looked everywhere for him .
He was gone , No one can find him

209
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:25,876
 until the little cockroach
got him self pinshed in Bangkok.

210
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:31,161
So I paid him a visit.

211
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,597
<i> I offered him a truce. </ i>

212
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:40,190
<i> I will not touch a hair on his head, I just
wanted him to tell me where my gold is. </ i>

213
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,982
<i> and refuses to talk. </ i>

214
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:54,432
Not only he does refuse to talk to me.

215
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:58,916
He has no communication
with anyone form the outside 

216
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,073
- Except you!

217
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,160
Hey ,It's unfair!

218
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:06,520
- Alan , You've been talking to chow?
- They were writing litters .

219
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:09,081
- It is private!
- "Dear Leslie."

220
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:11,637
"OMG! the McRib' is back!"

221
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,630
- "Why was it ever gone?"
- Exactly!

222
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:18,818
"Dear Alan. I threw urine on prison gaurd
 today balmed it on sell mate. "

223
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:21,709
- "I wish you were here."
- Yeah, I wish I could have seen that.

224
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:27,804
Letter after letter of  totall,
except for common thread.

225
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,925
You guys.

226
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,022
- "Wolf pack".
- Jeusu Chrised. Alan!

227
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,664
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped
from a maximum-security Detention.

228
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,223
Oh , Fuck.

229
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:42,328
He stored aboared chipping  freighter
bound for the West Coast.

230
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,577
- Where is he?
- I do not know.

231
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:52,568
Alan, if you know where he is,
you tell this man right now.

232
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:56,398
Phil ,I dunno .
I swear I haven't talked to him in monthes .

233
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:04,621
We Gotta do it 
the hard way.

234
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,296
- What the fuck !!
- Wait. No! What the fuck?!

235
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:13,461
- What are you doing?
- Doug is my insurance. he stays with me.

236
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,854
you don't give me chow,
I blow his brains out .

237
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:19,651
You go the the Cops,
I blow his brains out.

238
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:24,130
- That's insane , We don't  even know where the fuck he is!
- No one does.

239
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:28,261
But I figured the wolf pack,
has the best chance of finding him.

240
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,806
You have three days.
Get to work.

241
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:37,592
- Can not take Stu instead?
- Fuck you, Alan.

242
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:50,977
- Alan?
- Yes, Phil?

243
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:55,289
- I need you to roll over here and chew
 off these hand ties  .
- Okay.

244
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,686
- there's a little too much steam.
- Get off me .

245
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,057
Let me just, shive me down.

246
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,440
Hold still!

247
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:12,736
Help! Help!

248
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,175
Holy Shit !

249
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:25,514
- What are we gonna do, Stu?
- We Gotta go the the Police.

250
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:28,907
Oh no , we're fucking not!
Did you hear that guy?

251
00:24:28,957 --> 00:24:31,291
He will kill Doug .
 period!

252
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:35,365
Chow is a cancerous , he has been
 a cancer  since the first day we met him .
253
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,151
So, we're gonna hand him over to this
guy Marshall and then it's done .

254
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,090
 Alan, Not now,but I need you, Stu.
I can't do this alone.

255
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:45,437
Do what alone?
We have no idea where he even is!

256
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:49,866
what alan ? I got an email the other day,
and I was not sure what it meant -

257
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:52,192
- But now  I think that it might be from Chow.

258
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:59,505
"Fatty. It feels good to be out.
I'm close by. tell no one I'll be in touch. "

259
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,412
"Chow."

260
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:06,128
This says "Chow". How did you not know
this was from chow?

261
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:08,591
at the time I thought it was "Chow" like "goodbye" -

262
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:13,075
- you know Like "Ciao!" or "Arrivederci".
- I'm writing back to him.

263
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:15,283
What ? Wait wait , just hold on !

264
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:19,580
- I've been telling him that you're happy 
he's out and you'd love to see him .
- ooooh, I would love to see him.

265
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:24,305
- Do you even know what's going on?
- Yes, I do.

266
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:26,597
Phil is doing all the work,
I'm his assistant -

267
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:29,945
- And you standing there looking like an idiot.
- I'm gonna arrange a meeting.

268
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:33,691
- We're gonna take him out.
- take him out 

269
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:36,814
who says that ?
How do we take someone out?

270
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:41,128
We use Drugs.
Prescription drugs.

271
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,830
you know the kind  
a dentist has access to.

272
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,359
Good luck finding a dentist,
who will write fake prescriptions.

273
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:52,070
Oh mI know one. his name is Stuart Price.
Let us go find fucking a pharmacy.

274
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:55,725
yoooh , you just got schooled!,son

275
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:59,607
- Are you coming or not ?
- I do not like this plan.

276
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,726
Okay, then.
Chow.

277
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:11,663
I got a pretty dumb sense of humor, bro.
278
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:17,212
Prescriptions

279
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:23,301
- Everything Okay ?
- well, It's just a strange request.

280
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:26,252
This drug and this amount  
and a pack of sringes ...

281
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:28,672
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

282
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:31,726
It's just a kind of an emergency
 so ...

283
00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:35,590
You see , that right there and you're
acting all figgity plus you look like shit  

284
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,870
- In our buisness
these are all red flags.

285
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:40,198
I need to call a priscriping doctor,
and make sure everything is okay.

286
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:44,595
aha ,you're in luck
because I actually am a priscriping doctor.

287
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,024
Oh, another red flag


288
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:54,102
- It says here  you're a dentist.
- Yeah.

289
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:56,300
Doctor of dental science.

290
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:58,997
This is fucked up.

291
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:02,913
Hey dad , I think we got 
a live one .

292
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:11,610
- How did we do ?
- We did good, I got Demerol,a pack of sringes

293
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,527
- And I almost suspended my dental license

294
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:17,103
- What about chow , anything?
- No.

295
00:27:17,148 --> 00:27:20,211
Oh, look at this
He emailed me like 20 mins ago 

296
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,566

297
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:27,926
- What does it say?

305
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:56,811
Alright need a plan. They're
meeting at a bus bensh in a puplic place.

306
00:27:56,822 --> 00:28:00,351
So Alan needs to convince Chow to go
some place more private.

307
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:03,893
Some place where we can sneak up
on him , Drug him.

308
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:07,476
- Like where ?
- I dunno like an alley?

309
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,405
What about a movie Theater?

310
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:12,720
Fuck that's actually a great idea.
the lights go down.

311
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:17,168
We take the seat behind him,
we jap him and it's Fucking Done .

312
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:20,237
I'll Jap him if you want.
I've druged people before.

313
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:23,937
- Yeah, us.
- No offense Alan, but we're not gonna
 let you handle any drugs.

314
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,382
- you'll kill someone.
- Oh Pleas, I'm an expert.

315
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:30,299
-  Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?
- Yeah.

316
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:33,657
I made so you can eat at least three
before hitting a fatal dose.

317
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,959
Wait 

318
00:28:37,204 --> 00:28:41,067
So you're saying I would have died,
if I'd had four?

319
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,393
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu!

320
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:46,266
That's insane theory is
the only reason I'm still alive?

321
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,891
Yes! and you're welcome BTW.

322
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,473
Do not say "you're welcome"
for almost killing me.

323
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,984
- Fine -Thank you.
- You're welcome. - God Damn it !

324
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,362
- Oh God !

325
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,459
You know you were right.

326
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:39,069
- About what?
- that place in Arizona.

327
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:41,395
It's  not gonna help him.

328
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:44,668
there's no facility that can fix this guy.

329
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:51,305
We're gonna spend the rest of our life  
dealing with him because we're all he has now.

330
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:55,328

00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,838
He says that you took his gold. and He's
Doug and he's gonna kill him unless we
 bring you back.

386
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:23,732
It's true!
I swear to god it's true !

387
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,627
So, Chow that's the truth.

388
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:32,235
God Damn it!

389
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:36,695

391
00:34:39,215 --> 00:34:42,120
I'm Sorry, Chow.

392
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:45,764
- We're sorry, we don't know what else to do .
- Next time don't lie to Chow.

393
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,328
You are right, you're so right 
and we made a huge mistake.

394
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,338
- So, What do we do now?
- It depends  ...

395
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,459
Can I trust you .

396
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:08,342
- What is this place, Chow?
- My house.

397
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:11,134
Chow used to be in top of the world.

398
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:14,273
I had three beautiful home
in three different countries 

399
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:18,409
- But this one,
my Mexican villa 

400
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,895
- This Was my favorite.

401
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:23,821
then everything got fucked .

402
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:27,080
Chow went to prison.
All my properties seized.

403
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:29,146
My homes ...

404
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:31,961
All were auctioned to the highest bidders.

405
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:35,103
But I know something
no one else knows.

406
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:38,768
this house,
is where I stashed the gold.

407
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:40,992
- Marshall's gold?
- Yep.

408
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,602
I hid it inside the basement wall.

409
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,291
No one knows it's there.

410
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,293
We gonna go get it.

411
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:52,595
Wait .
you mean break in ?

412
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:56,204
Look .
Marshall wants his gold 

413
00:35:56,227 --> 00:36:01,038
- And he's gonna hunt me down until he gets it.
If we showed up without it, he will kill me.

414
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:04,650
- We're  not breaking in anywhere.
- Not anywhere as Stu.

415
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:08,169
my house.
It's piece of cake.

416
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,882
I know every square inch of this place


417
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:16,888
The best part , the guy we're stealing from
doesn't know it's there

418
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:19,592
- So he will never 
know it's gone .

419
00:36:23,745 --> 00:36:25,980
you guys know what's 
 going on, right?

420
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:29,075
- What do you mean?
- Well , please correct me if I'm wrong

421
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:31,743
- We're not breaking it to 
this house.

422
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,910
This house it too small.
We're break into another house .

423
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:37,236
This's just a Model 
right, Chow?

424
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:41,103
What ? Oh No My chickens!

425
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:48,424
- Chow , what the fuck ?!
- They're trained to kill!

426
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:50,546
The beak is too sharp!

427
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:57,151
- stay still! I'm trying to help!
- Don't!

428
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,993
Get it off!

429
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:03,406
- hhhha fucking Bulls-eye!
- Are you out of your mind?!

430
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,351
Chow! Chow! chow!

431
00:37:08,737 --> 00:37:10,741

433
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:24,416
shsh struggle.
Let go.

434
00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:30,779
You won alot of
fights, Wallace -

435
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:34,161
- not this time.

436
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,470
- What the fuck was wrong with these chickens?
- They're Angry.

437
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,649
All I feed them is cocaine ...

438
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:51,125
... And chicken.

439
00:37:56,935 --> 00:38:00,116
- It's some house , Chow.
- It was my Shangri-La.

440
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:02,329
Now it's gone.

441
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:07,560
Could you not spit 
inside my minivan please? Jusus !

442
00:38:07,924 --> 00:38:12,051
- Who lives there now?
- some .com millionaire. He's never here.

443
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:15,853
This is her vacation home.
he does not show up on Sundays.

444
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,611
No one there but
guard dogs. Stu?

445
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:22,312
We toss these burgers over the gate and wait
for the  Demerol to kick in.

446
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:24,774
Make sure you put it enough
to kill them.

447
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,889
We are not gonna kill the dogs, Chow.

-the place will be
crolling with cops 

456

 triggering the alarm?

00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:46,774
Masturbating on a city bus.
Yup, that was me.

541
00:47:46,805 --> 00:47:50,789
Look, we've been here for five hours.
We already told your guys everything we know.

542
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:54,840
No. you told them a story
about a little  Chinese man ...

543
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:57,788
Leslie Chow. He is an international criminal.
Look it up !

544
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:00,759
A little Chinese man that no
one in the town has seen or heard of.

545
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:03,250
And the hotel you're saying he's staying,
there's no one there.

546
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:05,571
probably because he left town.

547
00:48:05,896 --> 00:48:09,686
That's one theory.
Another theory is you're lying.

Why would Mr. Chow do this?

553
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,562
Because he's a greedy piece of shit,

00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,328

605
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:53,160
What are we gonna do?
We have no idea where Chow is.

606
00:52:53,483 --> 00:52:55,257
I do not know ...

607
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:59,571
He took your minivan. maybe we could report 
 it stolen and then they can track him down ?

608
00:53:00,474 --> 00:53:02,272
It's worth the shot.

609
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:07,698
Oh, dammit!
I left my phone in the minivan.

610
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,780
If you lost your phone fella 
I've that find my phone app.

611
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,060
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.

612
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:15,867
No, wait.
If the phone is in your minivan ...

613
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:18,663
... And Chow have your minivan
then your phone with Chow.

614
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:21,690
You heard him.
We have bigger problems than that, Stu.

615
00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:23,612

618
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:29,515

619
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:31,749
- What?
- That is my password. "Hey, Phil."

620
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,114
It is it.

621
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,368
Phil gets it.

622
00:53:38,368 --> 00:53:41,200
 Nothing worse,
than losing your phone.

623
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,414
You just saw a man get murdered,
Your brother in law is kidnapped 

624
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,309
- Are you sure there
 is nothing worse?

625
00:53:47,313 --> 00:53:51,838
You do not get it, Stu.
you just don't get it!

626
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:55,477
Do you ?!
I have over 60 apps on that phone!

627
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,661
What if I lost my phone?

628
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:01,438
Do you have any idea how much time
and man hours that I woud take 

629
00:54:01,473 --> 00:54:03,908
- To redownload those apps ?

630
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:07,638
You are right. I had not thought of that.
Thank you.

633
00:54:16,509 --> 00:54:18,887
What ? Where is he?

634
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:23,666
- He's in fucking Vegas!
- shot gun.

635
00:54:27,646 --> 00:54:29,280
Oh, no!

636
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:31,623
Hey, Stu?

637
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:37,469
I don't enjoy 
talking to you that way.

638
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:41,441
I do not know why you insist on
making me blow my top.

639
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:43,873
We have been on alot of advintures together.

640
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:46,253
But it seems
that you have not learned anything.

641
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:48,294
anything !

642
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:53,283
you think on it.
I'll be in the limo.

643
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:57,768
He's okay.

644
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:39,695
Someone needs to burn
this place to the ground.

645
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:45,089
I told myself
I'd never come back.

646
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:49,565
Do not worry.
It all ends tonight.

647
00:55:57,641 --> 00:56:00,537
It says 200 yard up
 on the right.

648
00:56:01,899 --> 00:56:05,319
And there it's .
Amazing 

649
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:18,671
looks like he ditched it.

650
00:56:21,347 --> 00:56:23,447
- It is open.
- No shit.

651
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:26,916
Look around .
See if he left anything in here .

652
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:32,727

- Good. keep it we gonna need it.

653
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:36,419

654
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:39,638
- Alan , Anything ?
- No, not even the gold.

655
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:45,479
- Why the fuck would chow come here?
- I do not know. right ?!

656
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:48,000
Why here?

657
00:56:48,748 --> 00:56:53,967

658
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:58,057
Wow , Nice !

659
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:04,521
Excuse me. have you happened
to see the driver of that minivan 
that's parked out front?

660
00:57:04,565 --> 00:57:07,230
- short Asian guy.
- They are all short.

661
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,839
It is so true!

662
00:57:09,866 --> 00:57:14,065
right , but may have bee 
trying to pawn some gold.

663
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:16,949
that would be my business,
would not it?

664
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:19,274
I like your T-shirt.

665
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:27,409
I saw that show at the Forum.
He played "Captain Jack".

666
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:30,372

667
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:33,544

00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:35,701

Mom , I'm with a customer

671
00:57:46,602 --> 00:57:49,157

- If you do not reverse that right now ...

672
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,400
... there gonna be hell to pay.

673
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,666

674
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,168

00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,998
You're smart.

677
00:58:15,999 --> 00:58:20,383
The Chinese guy came in here earlier.
He was pretty wierd .

678
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:23,087
He pawed a gold brick.

679
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,385
- 400,000. He took 18,000.
- Did he you see where he was going?

680
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,111
I'm sorry, was I talking to you ?

681
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:39,682
He said he wanted three things .
he wanted some girls and some 
guys and some bath salt.

682
00:58:40,206 --> 00:58:43,369
I gave him a card for an escort service,
and  he fuck off .

683

688
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:46,568
Look  how happy this fucking guy is.

689
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,347
Have you ever witnessed a moment with 
much heat?

690
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,829

He has a thick Asian accent.

693
01:01:01,936 --> 01:01:06,002
I totaly get it, but this's a highly 
unusual circumstance and ....

694
01:01:07,495 --> 01:01:10,034
Okay, alright !.

695
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:13,985
- It is an escort service .
- They're not gonna tell us shit.

696
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:20,744
maybe an escort would

697
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:26,892
- Do you still have her number?
- Yes, but 

698
01:01:27,496 --> 01:01:31,333
- It would be pretty awkward.
- That's we got.

699
01:01:31,997 --> 01:01:35,500
She's smiling at me again.
From inside the shop.

700
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:39,838

It's gone ... I blew the
first 20 million in Bangkok.

913
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:24,249
- that's why I had to get the other half.
- enough Chow. It's over!

914
01:20:24,257 --> 01:20:28,969
you motha fukka! When I get out of this,
I'm gonna web out your fucking lungs !

915
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:32,815
Do you hear me? You are dead.
You are dead!

916
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,916
I didn't mean that.
Chow loses temper sometimes.

917
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:44,234
please ... I need help.
I know that...

918
01:20:46,404 --> 01:20:48,119
it's right there.

919
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:10,147
 they are here.

920
01:21:12,437 --> 01:21:16,725
- Alan they're coming grap the last bag.
- please alan.

921
01:21:42,475 --> 01:21:45,250
- Doug!
- That boy for the bags!

922
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:46,892
Let's go!

923
01:21:51,432 --> 01:21:53,296
Are we good ?!
It's all there. I promise.

924
01:21:53,312 --> 01:21:56,811
Not exactly.
I'm is still missing the original half.

925
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:58,412
But, no ...

926
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:02,383
that's all we have Chow said he 
blew the secondother half in Bangkok.

927
01:22:03,193 --> 01:22:07,167
- Where is he?
- He's in the trunk.

928
01:22:09,278 --> 01:22:10,799
A deal for deal.

929
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:14,363
- Doug! Shit!
- Give me the keys.

930
01:22:19,289 --> 01:22:22,941
- What are you gonna do with Chow?
- I just wanna talk to him.

931
01:22:23,784 --> 01:22:25,419
Move .

932
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:28,326
are alright ?.

933
01:22:33,057 --> 01:22:35,265
What the fuck?!

934
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:37,808
 the of conversation.

935
01:22:38,603 --> 01:22:40,835
Why would you do that?!

936
01:22:40,865 --> 01:22:43,790
Leslie Chow's madness.

937
01:22:44,162 --> 01:22:46,168
You do not talk to madness.

938
01:22:46,196 --> 01:22:50,491
If you are lucky, you trap it in the trunk
of your limo, and kill it .

939
01:22:51,694 --> 01:22:56,037
you've have done a great thing tonight.
You should feel good about this.

940
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:05,026
What the fuck?! Do you think this's 
a fucking game?

941
01:23:05,042 --> 01:23:06,559
- No, no!
- No!

942
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:11,296
todelo, motha fukers!

943
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:24,661
Chow 

944
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:27,449
Chow.
chow , wait.

945
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:31,877
Now you wanna talk , blue eyes?
No more silent treatment?

946
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:33,964
Leslie ...

947
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:37,116
Stay out of this, Fatty.

948
01:23:38,248 --> 01:23:40,493
No Leslie

949 
01:23:45,836 --> 01:23:48,427
If  shoot Phil,
you gonna go through me.

950
01:23:48,451 --> 01:23:50,810
What?

951
01:23:57,228 --> 01:24:00,818
- Alan 
- Quiet. I'm gonna stare off.

952
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:14,709
Today you all live.
Because one of you was a friend.

953
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:23,329
- Alan , what did you do?
- I unlocked the lotch between the 
back seat and the trunk.

954
01:24:25,374 --> 01:24:30,307
- and left him his gun ?
- yeah ,I didn't think all the way through

955
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:33,413
He gave chow fighting chance ?.

956
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:36,948
That's all I ever needed.

957
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,981
Fat fuck.

958
01:24:46,651 --> 01:24:50,445
It's never easy, is it?
No one wants to see that.

959
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,979
except for me.
But I was born bad.

960
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:55,504
Hold on .
I have something for you.

961
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,406
For your loyalty.

962
01:25:04,822 --> 01:25:08,199
- Oh no ,I don't want this, Mr. Chow.
- okay give it back then come on.

963
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:11,037
Quick! Before Stu smells it.

964
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:16,305
 - I don't want it either, Chow.
-Oh please Like a squirrel doesn't wanna a nut !

965
01:25:17,656 --> 01:25:20,675
It's funny because he's jewish.

966
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:25,262
Don't you get it?

967
01:25:32,516 --> 01:25:34,463
God damn it.

968
01:25:36,205 --> 01:25:39,488
Okay, go on , go out of here all of you 

969
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:48,086
Hey chowsta, I'll call you in a week.
 we'll get together .

970
01:25:51,516 --> 01:25:55,210
No, Leslie.
We can not be friends anymore.

971
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:57,229
What?

972
01:25:57,617 --> 01:26:00,053
You're not good for me.
It's not healthy.

973
01:26:00,312 --> 01:26:03,414
Alan, you're not thinking straight

974
01:26:04,109 --> 01:26:06,274
Let's just talk tomorrow.

975
01:26:06,519 --> 01:26:10,071
Leslie ,You're one of the coolest and nicest
guys I've ever met.

976
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:13,335
And you're smart, funny and everybody loves you.

977
01:26:13,355 --> 01:26:15,635
Alan,What is this ?

978
01:26:16,644 --> 01:26:20,413
It's just when we get together 
bad things happen, people get hurt

979
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:23,233
yeah, that's the point
That's funny.

980
01:26:23,969 --> 01:26:27,684
I'm gonna  make some changes
in my life, this is one of them.

981
01:26:29,447 --> 01:26:31,225
I'm sorry.

982
01:26:35,282 --> 01:26:37,693
farewell, Leslie Chow.

983
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:53,799
You're cold as ice!

984
01:26:55,268 --> 01:26:57,381
shot gun.

985
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:00,943
Everybody okay?

986
01:28:02,445 --> 01:28:04,065
Yeah.

987
01:28:04,378 --> 01:28:06,338
Alan , you're okay?

988
01:28:07,362 --> 01:28:09,053
Yeah.

989
01:28:12,131 --> 01:28:14,857
Good! let's go home.

990
01:28:32,072 --> 01:28:33,875
jesus christ.

991
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,535
You know what, guys?

992
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:47,050
you can go ahead without me.
there's something I need to do

993
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:50,902
Do you even know
how to get home?

994
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:56,502
Of course I do. I am a grown man.
I'll ask a stranger.

995
01:29:00,426 --> 01:29:02,725
Good luck, Alan.

996
01:29:03,815 --> 01:29:06,387
we'll see you soon.

997
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:44,167
Did you know that just a couple blocks from,
here, there is a place that looks 
like Paris,France?

998
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,540
I can't remember what it's called,
but it supposed to be magnificent.

999
01:29:49,029 --> 01:29:51,941
It's called Paris Hotel and Casino,
and it is magnificent.

1000
01:29:51,965 --> 01:29:56,207
Yeah, that's it. well,I would like to
dinner there tonight

1001
01:29:56,807 --> 01:29:59,599
Oh Sorry, No can do.

1002
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:05,352
I'm banned from the casino for life.
Plus ten years.

1003
01:30:05,794 --> 01:30:08,984
We took mom there for her birthday 
played a little Blackjack.

1004
01:30:09,008 --> 01:30:14,240
She split tens. I may have overreacted
 They said it was abusive and elderly.

1005
01:30:15,018 --> 01:30:18,307
- I've done that.
- right ?!

1006
01:30:18,648 --> 01:30:20,737
I can't go back there.

1007
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:25,253
But 

1008
01:30:25,428 --> 01:30:29,543
Golden Nugget has the best
prime rib in town.

1009
01:30:32,557 --> 01:30:35,227
Oh , that sounds a glorious.

1010
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,890
I'll send for you at 8:00 o'clock.

1011
01:30:43,867 --> 01:30:45,839
is that it ?

1012
01:31:22,568 --> 01:31:25,363
I saw it once.
In a pornography.

1013
01:31:27,022 --> 01:31:30,616
it's a nice gesture,
but maybe we should wait.

1014
01:31:30,822 --> 01:31:32,516
Oh okay , yeah

1015
01:31:38,909 --> 01:31:41,339
I'll See you at 8:00.

1016
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,406
6 MONTHS LATER

1017
01:32:05,517 --> 01:32:07,848
You look great, Alan.

1018
01:32:08,484 --> 01:32:10,694
What do you think?
Hat or no hat?

1019
01:32:12,464 --> 01:32:14,881
- ahh ,Hat.
- Yeah, okay.

1020
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:19,615
Wow, who is this guy ? the vest and the cain

1021
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:22,821
- I love it.
- Thank you. Cassie picked it out for me.

1022
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:27,327
- You look like Mr. Peanut.
- Yeah, I know right? that's what I was going for.

1023
01:32:27,758 --> 01:32:33,160
- maybe we just lose it.
- hey alan , I was just talking to cassie 
 she's an amazing woman.

1024
01:32:33,194 --> 01:32:37,945
Oh ,Thank you for saying that , she is an amazing 
woman I find her much better than your wives

1025
01:32:38,047 --> 01:32:41,232
- Oh , that's sweet
- Which reminds me 

1026
01:32:41,304 --> 01:32:43,488
- We need to talk 

1027
01:32:45,231 --> 01:32:48,331
Listen, Fellas.
Now that I'm getting married 

1028
01:32:48,351 --> 01:32:51,937
- I'm spend alot more time with Cassandra.
- Of course.

1029
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:54,979
- It's the way it should be.
- No you slow your roll Phil okay ?!

1030
01:32:55,391 --> 01:32:58,097
There is more.
you're not gonna like this part

1031
01:33:00,535 --> 01:33:03,810
I must resign from
 the wolf pack.

1032
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:10,262
Wow that's a big step , Alan.

1033
01:33:10,678 --> 01:33:13,724
I know,
but she is my soul mate.

1034
01:33:14,216 --> 01:33:16,333
And my new best friend.

1035
01:33:16,868 --> 01:33:19,555
plus, so  lets
me mount her 

1036
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:22,490
- Which relaxes me.
- Oh my God!

1037
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:25,865
Oh Alan ,maybe never say that 
part again.

1038
01:33:25,891 --> 01:33:28,160
Chillax, Doug!
We're all adults here.

1039
01:33:28,176 --> 01:33:31,167
I know you mount my sister.
I've seen it many times.

1040
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:34,057
- What?
- Alan , you're the best.

1041
01:33:34,103 --> 01:33:37,127
The point is 
you need to let me go

1042
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:40,644
you in particular. I can't be
your hero anymore.

1043
01:33:42,012 --> 01:33:44,643
Okay,sure.

1044
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:54,256
Having said all that, I still like
to get together on tuesdays for bowling 

1045
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:57,678
- And on alternating Sundays for
general horse play.

1046
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,984
- How about we play all that by year 
- Alan , it's time

1047
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:03,664
- Here we go.
- ready?

1048
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:12,807
I'm ready.

1049
01:34:51,421 --> 01:34:59,430
