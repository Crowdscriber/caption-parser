hasn't presented itself.

South Carolina's premiere
military college.

00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:21,624
They taught me the values
of honor, duty, and respect.

23
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,543
They also hazed me,
tried to break me,

24
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,378
and, senior year,
nearly expelled me

25
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,338
when I volunteered
for a Senate Race

26
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,006
and my studies suffered.

27
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,884
But that didn't stop them
from soliciting a hefty sum

28
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,095
for their new library
30 years later.

Drunk, passed out
in the gutter,

35
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:48,443
so I can steal your wife.

36
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:51,279
Did you get the email
about the riflemen?

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,322
- What email?
- From my office about the invitations.

38
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,532
I was hoping
they would be here.

I'll check the list,

40

but I don't remember any email.

41
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,328
Oh, not a problem.
I was just wondering.

42
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,829
Well, shit, Frank, I'm sorry.

for a second.

56
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,505
she turned down their donation.

57
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,714
I can imagine.

58
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,299
And they're also concerned

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,677
about Peter Russo
running for Governor.

60
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:58,638
Now, how do you know
about that?

If I can't find out
who's running for governor,

64
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,103
I don't deserve a dime
of what they're paying me.

This watershed bill

66
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:09,816

00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,076

didn't pay for your library

I would start to drone on

had another four years,

That's why I came up to Philly.

There's a community

I'm going to talk

about a plan

00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,760
You want to see some pictures
of Kevin and Sarah?

164
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,386
Too dark to look at pictures.

165
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,221
No, no, no. It's on my phone.
You don't need any...

166
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,849
get it away from me.
I hate those things.

167
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,517
Brain cancer.

168
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,703
I'm a crafter,
and I have a hot glue gun,

169
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:34,121
and I can very well
do this my...

170
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,456
[man] It wasn't
just up the stairs.

171
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,458
It was up three
flights of stairs,

172
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,293
in the science building.

173
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,419
[Loud laughter]

174
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,005
And Guckenheimer, what he did...

175
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,674
"well, you look lovely
today, Mrs. Governor."

176
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,175
And the thing took a dump.

177
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,970
Right. And they
couldn't get it back...

178
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,680
you can get a cow up
three flights of stairs,

179
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,557
but you can't get it down.

180
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,476
And that's why Andy said...

181
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,645
"who wants steak for dinner?"

182
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:58,938
[Laughter]

183
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,355
How are you boys doing?
- We're good.

184
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,066
- You think I'm fat?
- Take the Fifth.

185
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,610
Seriously, Phil, here,
thinks I got fat with old age.

186
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,488
Ah, you're a big man
with an even bigger heart.

187
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:08,489
There you go.

188
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,240
She said you're chubby.

189
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,993
Frank, I'm going to go
back to the hotel.

190
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,368
Okay? Have fun.

191
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,079
- I love this woman.
- Yeah, she...

192
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,747
don't let him get
into too much trouble.

193
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,624
They'll have grounds
for impeachment

194
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,667
when we're done with him.

195
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:21,085
[Laughter]

196
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,670
Better get another drink
before they close up.

197
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,005
You're coming with me
to help carry them.

198
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:25,506
You're gonna be
a waiter tonight.

199
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:28,425
Lazy-ass cadet. Lazy-ass cadet.

200
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:33,180
Yeah, hold on
a second there, partner.

201
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,306
[Grunt]

202
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:37,935
You had no idea we were coming?

203
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:38,978
Complete surprise.

204
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,021
I thought Higgins might have...

205
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,396
no, he played it perfectly.

206
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,273
Made me think
you weren't coming at all.

207
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:45,442
Are you kidding? We wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

208
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:48,403
On the library, are they going
to put "Frank" or "Francis"?

209
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:51,365
Francis. It's the same
as the name above the door

210
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,825
in my office in the Capitol.

211
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,702
"Francis"
is better for libraries.

212
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,328
"Frank" is better
for bumper stickers.

213
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,122
I got a few of those.

214
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:00,124
Does anybody ever
actually call you Francis?

215
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,583
Claire does.
She's the only one.

216
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,794
She seems like a real prize.

217
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,796
She is.

218
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:09,717
Bar was already shut down,
but look what I scored.

219
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,110
[Doorbell rings]

220
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,579
Hi, Caroline.

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,663
What do you want?

222
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:40,789
Is Paul around?

223
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:46,712
Paul?

224
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,130
Did you invite this man?

225
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,757
Answer me. Did you invite him?

226
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:52,634
[Arguing]

227
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,178
What are you talking about?

228
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,055
[Angry chatter]

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,893
[Paul] Caroline, stop!

230
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,394
No, you're not
going to stop me.

231
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,021
[Angry chatter continues]

232
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:13,072
Paul? You got a minute to talk?

233
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,448
There's nothing to talk about.

234
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,492
I want to apologize

235
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,161
for when I saw you
last time in Washington,

236
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,370
how I treated you.

237
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:22,581
Is that it?

238
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,461
And I want to talk
about the shipyard.

239
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,255
I got a plan to fix it.

240
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,926
You don't want everything
going into the roth ira.

241
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,469
5, 10 grand a year.

242
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,180
I'll set you up with a nice,
diversified package.

243
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,224
Low-risk, high-yield.

244
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,184
I think Claire and I
have things

245
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,894
pretty well under control.

246
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:46,772
If I brought a senior U.S.
congressman into the fund,

247
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,900
hoo hoo hoo, that would really
up my stock in the company.

248
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,526
What are you all
gabbing about back there?

249
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,403
We're talking about
the old library.

250
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:54,738
Yeah, what's happening to it?

251
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:55,906
They gonna tear it down?

252
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,365
I don't know.
They could gut it.

253
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,660
They could turn it
into a student center.

254
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:02,496
Hey. We should sneak in there.

255
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:03,914
Like we used to.

256
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:05,874
- I'm game.
- Do it.

257
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,793
- [Laughs]
- Hell, why not?

258
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:11,130
[Chatter]

259
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,092
That's it. There you go.
That's it.

260
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:17,552
[Chatter]

261
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,973
[Grunting, chatter]

262
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,477
Shh. It's a library.

263
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,729
This... this...
the... the Sentinel...

264
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,190
[laughing]

265
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:32,026
[Chatter]

266
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,580
The association
had about 3 million

267
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,249
saved up in reserve
for emergencies.

268
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,375
Split that up between
12,000 members,

269
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:51,461
it's nothing.

270
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:54,006
A couple of weeks' groceries.

271
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,257
There's a bill I'm working on.

272
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,092
Major federal funds

273
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:00,721
going towards public parks,
green commercial spaces,

274
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:01,805
cleaning up waste sites.

275
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,349
That's construction jobs,

276
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,599
park management, retail...

277
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,352
- how many?
- 5,000 jobs.

278
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,353
That's not even half.

279
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,562
It's a start.

280
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,231
- How soon?
- A year, maybe two.

281
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:11,523
Two fucking years?

282
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,483
What are we supposed
to do until then?

283
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,527
- Listen, there's a
community meeting tomorrow.

284
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,569
- I heard.

285
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,321
I'm gonna go over
everything in detail.

286
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:19,031
- You gonna be there?
- Wasn't planning on it.

287
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,449
I'd like you to be there.
Everybody respects you.

288
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,993
Want me to vouch for you?

289
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,829
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you something

290
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,789
that only a handful
of people know.

291
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:30,667
I'm running for Governor.

292
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:32,836
I announce soon.

293
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,171
But I need
the association behind me

294
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,589
before I do that.

295
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,007
Now, I know I let you down
with the shipyard.

296
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,550
But if I win a governor's race,

297
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,219
I can get everything
back on track.

298
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,096
You show up on my doorstep
asking for my forgiveness.

299
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:43,805
Now you want me
to be your lapdog

300
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,724
after I lost my fucking job?

301
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,393
This watershed bill
is just the beginning.

302
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,061
If I'm governor,
there's so much I can do.

303
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,064
It's bullshit.
You just want to use me.

304
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,232
It's not like that.

305
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,900
Yeah. It's exactly like that.

306
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,610
Jesus Christ, Pete.

307
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:59,238
You fucking politicians.

308
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,406
Paul.

309
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,546
Claire.

310
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:19,925
I didn't realize you
and Frank were staying here.

311
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,970
We always stay here
when we're in Charleston.

312
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:24,388
You know that, Remy.

313
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:26,598
The '08 campaign.

314
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,142
I promise it was a coincidence

315
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:30,102
my assistant booked it.

316
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,813
Is, uh, Frank around?

317
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:35,649
He's not. He's off cavorting
with old classmates.

318
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,942
Hmm.

319
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,278
You want to sit down
and have a drink?

320
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,906
They booked me
the Bridal Suite.

321
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:44,908
There's champagne on ice.

322
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:46,785
My, my, you've grown
very confident

323
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,120
since you worked for Francis.

324

replace it with something else.

00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,792
I'll take you out
on the Arkansas river.

814
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:42,170
- I should do that.
- Any time you want.

815
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:48,050
Yep.

816
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:50,094
All right.

817
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:14,243
Francis?

818
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:15,786
Edward has the car ready.

819
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:18,623
I'll be right there.

820
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:20,291
Take your time.

821
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:50,238
You hear from Peter?

822
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:52,323
Looks like the shipbuilders
are on board.

823
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:54,742
Tomorrow morning we start
working on his draft

824
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:56,661
- for his announcement speech.
- Got it.

825
00:43:56,662 --> 00:43:58,496
And I want the brief
on the mock-up

826
00:43:58,497 --> 00:43:59,622
for the watershed bill.

827
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:00,915
I got that with me.

828
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,333
Ride with me to the airport.

829
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:04,960
We'll go through it in the car.

830
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:09,061
