1
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,237
Well?

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,551
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,954
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

4
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,714
I just sent it. You should have it.

5
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,076
- Yes. Thank you.
- Hey, are you sure this is legal?

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,516
(woman) We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

7
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,956
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,996
- To you?
- We have all we need.

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,395
We're ready.

10
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,314
(gunfire/screaming)

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,836
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

12
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,156
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I didn't touch it.

13
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,073
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

14
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,912
(machines powering down)

15
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,237
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

16
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,118
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

17
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,873
but they definitely cracked our door.

18
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,151
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

19
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,074
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

20
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,029
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. With the
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

21
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,954
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it just happened to us. Do it.

22
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,508
Sir, it's the middle of the night.
They're scattered all over the country.

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,397
Get local law enforcement help.

24
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,474
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,549
( "Rock & Roll Queen" by The Subways
on car stereo)

26
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,629
- Jim! I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

27
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,708
- Get out!
- What?!

28
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,916
- Get out of the car now!
- Don't touch me.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,797
- No means no.
- What are you doin'?

30
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,190
- John, stop it!
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you call me that.

31
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,794
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

32
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,474
Dad! Stop it. I mean it.

33
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,472
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

34
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,192
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

35
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,033
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

36
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,270
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,396
- No.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,072
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

39
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,918
What are you doing here?

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,675
- You don't answer your phone, you don't return my calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

41
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,276
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,911
How about stuff like this: you spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,911
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not!

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,878
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

45
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,069
You are such an asshole.

46
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,429
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

47
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,994
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

48
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,355
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,034
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,510
- Damn right you're going to bed alone.
- (sighs)

51
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,430
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

52
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,318
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,631
if l wanna talk to you -

54
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,111
I'll call you.

55
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,351
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy!

56
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,989
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

57
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,431
Chicks, right?

58
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,876
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

59
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,271
(sighs wearily)

60
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,072
(beeping)

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,230
(man) John?

62
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,629
John? It's Sclavino.

63
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,955
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

64
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,350
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

65
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,638
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

66
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,837
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,195
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,512
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

69
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,592
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

70
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,433
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

71
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,796
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,713
Send a jughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,112
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,589
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

75
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,195
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

76
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,989
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

77
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,957
Great!

78
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,989
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

79
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,798
You owe me one, Jack.

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,515
What?

82
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,477
Aw, come on.

83
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,038
Goddammit.

84
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,156

85
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,832
(insistent banging)

86
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,675
(banging continues)

87
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,553
- Who is it?
- (McClane) NYPD. Open the door, please.

88
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,469
- Hi.
- NYPD?

89
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,156
OK. Oh, I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

90
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,869
Hey, I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

91
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,111
No. He, uh... actually
does not live here any more.

92
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,670
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

93
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,039
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

94
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,795
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

95
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,231
Oh, "Detective"!

96
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,869
Yeah, that looks real!
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

97
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,476
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That... actually looks pretty good.

98
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,316
Mmm.

99
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,632
Farrell! Sully just PDL-ed the new copy of
the Kill Zone Nine. Wanna check it out?

100
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,998
No! Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

101
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,075
Open the door.

102
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,513
Shit.

103
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,989
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

104
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,197
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

105
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,158
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

106
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,518
- Feds, huh?
- Yeah. The feds.

107
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,198
I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

108
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,998
Such a pain in the ass.

109
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,389
- You play with dolls?
- Huh?

110
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,755
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a Gl Joe?

111
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,115
No, it's not. It's a limited edition...

112
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,633
- Ooh.
-..and...

113
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,235
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

114
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,074
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

115
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,310
I got some other cool shit you can break.

116
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,075
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

117
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,070
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?

118
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,190
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

119
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,113
- (gunshot)
- Ow! Jesus, don't shoot!

120
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,553
Get down!

121
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,955
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

122
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,715
(Matt whimpers)

123
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,030
Go!

124
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,192
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low! Stay down!

125
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,396
- Agh!
- Come on.

126
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,595
(whispers) It's all right.
Stay low, all right? Stay down.

127
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,956
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

128
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,358
OK.

129
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,511
That's gonna wake the neighbors.

130
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,477
Get down! Get inside!

131
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,158
They're back in the room!
They're back in the room!

132
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,711
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now!

133
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,358
- I'm trying to...
- Now!

134
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,879
Get back in there!

135
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,195
Aaargh! Argh!

136
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,831
Get ready to run.

137
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,190
(car alarms/barking)

138
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,955
(Matt sputters and groans)

139
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,877
- What the hell was that?
- What?

140
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,838
- Did you do that?
- No.

141
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,753
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

142
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,197
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

143
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,077
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit!

144
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,476
Come on.

145
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,471
Watch it. Slow it down.

146
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,155
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

147
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,470
Hey, let's go. Come on.

148
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,110
Come on, come on. Stay close.

149
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,640
Stay with me. Stay with me.

150
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,716
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

151
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,268
Get in the car. Go, go.

152
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,790
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

153
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,075
- Can you reload a gun?!
- l...

154
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,157
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now!

155
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,989
Grab the gun from the back seat!

156
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,473
You OK?

157
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,315
Get your head down.

158
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,995
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

159
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,674
Whoa!

160
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,915
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

161
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,876
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

162
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,313
Go ahead.

163
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,109
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

164
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,633
Stand by.

165
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,952
- (man) This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

166
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,238
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in your jurisdiction.

167
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,151
(phone rings)

168
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,030
- Yeah?
- (woman) What's the status?

169
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,993
Wait one.

170
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,200
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

171
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,789
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

172
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,110
I did send five of you, is that right?

173
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,630
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

174
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,197
- (Matt) Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

175
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,556
I am breathing! I'm-I'm...
I can't stop shaking.

176
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,393
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

177
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,473
Yeah, I'm scared!
Weren't you scared, back there?

178
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,632
Yeah. I was scared.

179
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,236
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, 'cause you seem really calm.

180
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,470
Have you done stuff like that before?

181
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,075
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

182
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,110
Yeah. But not for a long time.

183
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,152
So who were those guys, huh?
Why were they trying to kill you?

184
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,516
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?!

185
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,433
They were there to kill you.

186
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,469
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

187
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,749
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

188
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,389
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,917
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

190
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,752
On it.

191
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,075
What's with all the guns?

192
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,755
Operational prudence.

193
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,199
Think of them as hardware to your software.

194
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,996
(DJ) Good morning, DC! It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

195
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,710
If you've got any big plans, get started
early, 'cause the traffic is ramping up.

196
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,315
So here 's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

197
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,311
( "Fortunate Son "
by Creedence Clearwater Revival)

198
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,994
What? What... What...

199
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,275
What are you doing? What is that?

200
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,237
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

201
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,313
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

202
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,517
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

203
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,433
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

204
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,557
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

205
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,315
- (turns up volume)
- OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

206
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,277
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

207
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,957
(man) We're at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

208
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,839
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

209
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,478
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

210
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,516
Begin stage one.

211
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,829
(general consternation)

212
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,832
What? Nothing.

213
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,478
(snatches of radio talk shows)

214
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,638
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

215
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,633
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

216
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,553
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

217
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,471
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'?

218
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,680
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

219
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,035
Hold on. You listen to the news?

220
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,078
You got a problem with the news now?

221
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,072
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

222
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,709
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

223
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,872
Everything you hear, every single day,

224
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,909
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: to keep you living in fear.

225
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,797
- Oh, fear?
- Total fear.

226
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,839
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

227
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,559
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

228
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,519
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

229
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,238
- Hey.
- I'll drop a bomb on you...

230
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,309
- Hey!
- What?

231
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,678
- Shut up.
- That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

232
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,758
(car horns and tires screeching)

233
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,236
(sirens)

234
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,874
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right!

235
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,398
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

236
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,556
Hey, man. Hey.

237
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,158
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

238
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,151
OK.

239
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,873
Jesus Christ.

240
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,474
(sirens and alarms)

241
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,674
- All the lights are green.
- Huh?

242
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,320
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

243
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,392
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

244
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,079
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

245
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,390
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

246
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,232
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

247
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,469
What are we doing?

248
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,997
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

249
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,919
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the L train network.

250
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,470
(beeping)

251
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,552
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

252
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,713
FAA just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

253
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,711
We're under attack.

254
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,999
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

255
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,914
(alarm sounds)

256
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,756
That's the anthrax alarm.

257
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,358
All right, everyone out. Now! Now!

258
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,912
Taylor, move! Go! Move!

259
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,794
(alarm continues to sound)

260
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,154
(PA) All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

261
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,151
This is not a drill.

262
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,997
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

263
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,953
We need you inside, sir.

264
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,439
(siren)

265
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,351
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

266
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,033
We gotta know what's there.

267
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,396
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to lD the point of origin.

268
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,271
Begin stage two.

269
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,112
Hey, what's going on?

270
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,270
(shouts of "Sell! Sell!")

271
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,428
They're already starting to panic.

272
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,396
Of course they are.

273
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,914
They think that someone's
taking their money.

274
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,595
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

275
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,592
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

276
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,476
Prep the video package.

277
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,469
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

278
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,156
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

279
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,472
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

280
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,231
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

281
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,279
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

282
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,352
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

283
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,589
I'm Bowman.

284
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,993
Video package is ready for upload.

285
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,555
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

286
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,518
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

287
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,593
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

288
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,069
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

289
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,355
- Sir?
- No?

290
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,595
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

291
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,638
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

292
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,518
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

293
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,831
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

294
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,912
Oh, man, that is all bad.

295
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,993
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

296
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,637
- These your suspects?
- Were.

297
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,234
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

298
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,469
Recognise any of these people?

299
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,194
No.

300
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,998
Not one?

301
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,878
Sir, we got a system error.

302
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,913
( "Hail to the Chief" plays,
then breaks down)

303
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,355
- My fellow Americans...
-..it is time to...

304
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,432
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

305
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,829
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

306
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,798
..what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

307
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,553
- The answer is...
-..nothing whatsoever.

308
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,996
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

309
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,308
..useless.

310
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,798
Read my lips.

311
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,035
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

312
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
has come to... an end.

313
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,753
All the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

314
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,799
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

315
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,792
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

316
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,518
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

317
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,956
We will not tire, we will not falter,

318
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,758
and we will not fail.

319
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,479
I don't know how they're getting in.

320
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,390
Thank you.

321
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,153
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

322
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,512
That was creepy.

323
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,397
I tried to find more Nixon.

324
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,997
Think they bought it?

325
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,036
Absolutely.

326
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,672
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

327
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,433
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

328
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,032
It's a fire sale.

329
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,395
Hey. We don't know that yet.

330
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,597
- It's a myth, anyway. It can't be done.
- It's a myth? Really?

331
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,114
Please tell me
she's not in charge of anything.

332
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,077
What's a fire sale?

333
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,438
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

334
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,718
Step one: take out transportation.
Step two: the financial base and telecoms.

335
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,554
Step three: get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water, electric, nuclear...

336
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,918
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everything.

337
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,958
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everything must go.

338
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,429
Hey, listen... What's your name? Farrell?

339
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,513
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

340
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,479
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

341
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,790
No, man. I'm just saying...

342
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,394
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

343
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,313
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

344
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,198
Nothing. I said I understand.

345
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,317
Hey. They didn't send the girl scouts out
to get this kid.

346
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,234
They sent professional guys, full
tactical gear. They blew the whole joint up.

347
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,916
Now, I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

348
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,150
but somebody wants this kid dead,

349
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,279
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

350
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,670
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

351
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,558
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

352
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,794
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

353
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,838
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

354
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,749
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

355
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,310
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

356
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,712
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

357
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,157
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

358
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,439
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

359
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,991
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

360
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,153
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

361
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,794
How long till we get to DHS?

362
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,476
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

363
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,358
DC Metro, this is the FBl
requesting you to clear a route...

364
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,034
(scrambled noise)

365
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,196
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

366
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,235
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

367
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,993
- Close that loop, now.
- lsolate the frequency.

368
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,392
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

369
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,472
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.

370
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,314
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

371
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,470
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

372
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,632
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

373
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,393
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

374
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,755
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

375
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,115
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

376
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,714
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

377
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,872
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

378
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,194
OK. OK, OK.

379
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,352
They were my competition.

380
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,029
Make the next right onto Concord.

381
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,317
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

382
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,709
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

383
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,110
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

384
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,711
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

385
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,713
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

386
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,237
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

387
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,675
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

388
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,959
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

389
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,909
an accessory to Armageddon.

390
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,391
Take the next left at Lexington.

391
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,473
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

392
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,152
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

393
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,232
Clear a route for two FBl vehicles
approaching on Concord.

394
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,548
Copy, dispatch.

395
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,039
That's her.

396
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,076
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

397
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,315
- It's them.
- You're saying it's them them?

398
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,154
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

399
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,512
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

400
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,068
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

401
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,392
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587s, huh?

402
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,358
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

403
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,439
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

404
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,830
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

405
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,191
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

406
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,474
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

407
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,554
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

408
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,837
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

409
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,956
Your address in Brooklyn,

410
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,511
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

411
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,272
And how's Holly?

412
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,433
Oh, that's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

413
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,480
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

414
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,313
Oh, and it gets worse.

415
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,478
Your 401k no longer exists.

416
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,792
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

417
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,838
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

418
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,514
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

419
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,958
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

420
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,476
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

421
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,552
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

422
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,672
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

423
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,512
You're gonna lose.

424
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,309
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

425
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,836
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that?

426
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,115
Hold your position.

427
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,272
- He's not responding.
- (helicopter engine)

428
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,674
Get down! Get right down!

429
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,998
Just stay down!

430
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,235
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down!

431
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,795
Come on, come on, get out! Let's go!

432
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,792
Goddammit! Just stay down!

433
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,275
Get down! Just hang on!

434
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,794
Base, we've got a squad car under fire!
We need backup!

435
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,440
This is base. We're sending backup.

436
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,955
(McClane) Just brace yourself.

437
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,629
Hang on.

438
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,199
Hang on.

439
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,118
Oh, yeah!

440
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,952
- (pilot) We lost the tail.
- Stay with them.

441
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,712
- They're back.
- I know.

442
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,273
Take the tunnel. Left!

443
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,038
God, what are you... Oh, God!

444
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,556
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

445
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,119
The tunnel!

446
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,590
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

447
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,712
(cars honking)

448
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,351
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

449
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,394
- Now open the other side.
- What?

450
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,708
Move!

451
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,119
Hang onto something.

452
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,551
(cars honking)

453
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,791
Hey! Don't get out of the car!
Hey! Don't...

454
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,430
Just stay there! Stand still!

455
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,315
Run. Run!

456
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,115
Oh, God!

457
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,152
Don't hesitate like that again.

458
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,992
(man) Can you help me get my wife...

459
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,435
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

460
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,399
- (man #2) You OK?
- (man #3) I can't move my arms!

461
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,552
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?!

462
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,200
"lt can't be a uniform, John. No."

463
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,629
Get over to the wall, sir!
"Feds called in a favor."

464
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,637
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

465
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,156
"How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

466
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,631
- (siren wails, then dies)
- "No, gotta be a senior detective."

467
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,673
Think a traffic jam, throwing a car
at me's gonna stop me? Huh?

468
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,796
Rand, get in there and get it done.

469
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,550
This is not a good idea.

470
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,952
(chuckles)

471
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,031
(groans with pain)

472
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,959
(chuckles)

473
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,913
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

474
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,116
Are you OK? Oh, my God!

475
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,760
(explosions continue)

476
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,389
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh, yeah, lucky. That was...

477
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,630
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

478
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,711
I was out of bullets.

479
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,439
(both chuckle)

480
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,354
- How you doin'?
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

481
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,759
(laughs)

482
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,073
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

483
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,271
(Thomas) Rand, check in.

484
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,354
What about Farrell and McClane?

485
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,789
Come back in.

486
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,916
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

487
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,310
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

488
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,598
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

489
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,156
ID, sir.

490
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,910
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

491
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,275
Man the gate. You're with me.

492
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,351
(alarms sound)

493
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,431
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

494
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,513
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

495
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,718
(groans)

496
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,829
(man) Go again. Rodriguez! I didn't copy.

497
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,758
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

498
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,155
OK, we are in.

499
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,749
This is insane.

500
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,673
Hey! Hey, this is absurd.

501
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,880
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

502
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,391
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

503
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,391
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No!

504
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,708
Come on.

505
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,234
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

506
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,715
He's in.

507
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,473
Get outta the way!
Make a hole, please. Come on.

508
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,917
Watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Come on.

509
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,958
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

510
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,191
(panicked voices)

511
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,998
Excuse me. Thanks.

512
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,389
NYPD. NYPD.

513
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,471
Coming through.

514
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,709
Sergeant?

515
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,678
Sergeant! I need to speak to you.

516
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,470
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

517
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,835
Just give me a minute.

518
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,115
Sergeant!

519
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,431
(confusion of voices)

520
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,431
Oh, my God.

521
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,548
Let's get outta here.

522
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,358
Perfetto.
La sequenza due. Pronto...

523
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,476
(phone rings)

524
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,510
Siamo pronti.

525
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,471
We're a go.

526
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,551
Launch the downloads.

527
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,479
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

528
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,796
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

529
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,995
See? There you go.

530
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,518
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

531
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,918
- I need you to please remain calm.
- (commotion/sirens)

532
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,431
Excuse me.

533
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,433
- Excuse me! Thank you.
- Holy shit.

534
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,670
- Kid? Kid, hey!
- Yeah, yeah.

535
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,194
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

536
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,191
Come on. Let's go.

537
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,592
And here you go, Agent... Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

538
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,517
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

539
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,558
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

540
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,555
(TV reporter) Due to recent activity, law
enforcement agencies are being cautious.

541
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,918
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

542
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,834
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

543
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,230
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

544
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,595
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

545
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,989
- FAA just grounded all flights.
- Good.

546
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:37,393
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

547
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,596
- Hey, excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

548
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,275
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

549
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,114
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

550
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,751
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

551
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,868
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and... liaise.

552
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,032
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

553
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,433
- Wait! No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

554
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,069
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

555
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,878
- You sure?
- Yes.

556
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,077
Or... smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

557
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,799
- Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
- Hey!

558
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,792
He'll call you right back.

559
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,519
Here, right in here. Come here.

560
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,318
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

561
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,799
(ringing)

562
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,917
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

563
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,195
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

564
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,630
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

565
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,393
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

566
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,633
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

567
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,711
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

568
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,791
Yeah, I'll hold on.

569
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,758
Another day in paradise.

570
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,789
They just swarmed into everything - the
telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

571
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,111
( "America the Beautiful"
starts up on TV)

572
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,831
(same song on all channels)

573
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,153
-  Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies...
- They're blanketing every station.

574
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,553
For amber waves of grain

575
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,672
For purple mountain majesties

576
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,471
Above the fruited plain!

577
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:54,317
America! America!

578
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,391
God shed His grace...

579
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,439
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

580
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,878
- Been this way for a few minutes now.
-  And crown thy good with brotherhood

581
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,273
From sea to shining sea...

582
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,956
(shocked gasps)

583
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,077
Oh, my God.

584
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,318
McClane!

585
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,269
Look out.

586
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,873
Look out!

587
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,559
Look out.

588
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,190
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

589
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,510
Bowman, it's a fake.

590
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,072
I see it.

591
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,831
Thank God.

592
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,992
Oh, shit.

593
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,798
- McClane?
- Bowman!

594
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,711
(call cuts off)

595
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,550
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

596
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,397
(sirens blaring)

597
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,473
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

598
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,596
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

599
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,274
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

600
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,194
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

601
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,832
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

602
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,196
Hey, it's not a system. It's a country.

603
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,431
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

604
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,910
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

605
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,996
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

606
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,914
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

607
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,595
Come on. If this were your fire sale,
what would be your next move?

608
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,232
OK, uh, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

609
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,110
But not everything is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

610
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,909
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

611
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,993
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

612
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,832
And, uh...

613
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,154
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

614
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,598
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

615
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,071
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

616
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,832
How do you know all this stuff?

617
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,072
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

618
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,799
OK. National power grid.

619
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,270
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

620
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,794
each with a primary hub.

621
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,871
Here it is.

622
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,673
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

623
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,039
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

624
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,475
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

625
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,315
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

626
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,234
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane!

627
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,515
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Oh, shit.

628
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,037
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

629
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,112
I don't care how, you find me a line.

630
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,351
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

631
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,911
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

632
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,197
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

633
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,840
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

634
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,558
OK, let's open it up!

635
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,840
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

636
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,275
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

637
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,752
Hey. Hey, don't do that!
You're gonna disable it.

638
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,359
Jesus Christ!

639
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,597
That was crazy. Did you see that?

640
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,753
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

641
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,196
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

642
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,198
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

643
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,111
Sorry.

644
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,112
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

645
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,919
I mean, I've read about it.

646
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,912
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

647
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,357
Yes... Please, we just hit a tree
and my... my dad is having a heart attack.

648
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,795
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

649
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,553
Hold while we contact emergency services.

650
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,509
No, no! He's dying! I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

651
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,435
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

652
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,034
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

653
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,832
My name is... Frank,

654
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,436
and my dad's name is, um... is...

655
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,837
(hesitant) Dvorak... Tsajanski.

656
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,795
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

657
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,996
Emergency services are on their way.

658
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,753
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

659
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,478
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

660
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,677
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

661
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,990
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

662
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,914
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

663
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,073
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

664
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,355
So please start the goddamn car!

665
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,908
(engine starts)

666
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,398
Thank you, Dolores.

667
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,835
(Matt) Pass the PDA.
I gotta call the Warlock.

668
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,356
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

669
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,309
-Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBl. We suspect a security breach.

670
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,073
You can't land here without authorisa...

671
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,439
That was pretty good back there, kid.

672
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,999
Thanks.

673
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,629
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

674
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,109
No. I'm just...

675
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,716
- Well, what? What's the matter you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

676
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,234
What's that mean? Like what?

677
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,871
I'm not, like, heroic and everything.
I'm not brave like you are.

678
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,554
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

679
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,154
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

680
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,312
Just doing my job, that's all.

681
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,476
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

682
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,473
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

683
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,150
You get divorced.

684
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,198
A wife that can't remember your last name.

685
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,589
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

686
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,837
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

687
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,356
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

688
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,668
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Because there's nobody else to do it right now.

689
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,718
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

690
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,633
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

691
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,395
Ah.

692
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,675
And that's what makes you that guy.

693
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,111
Thing's flying now.

694
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,998
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

695
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,949
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

696
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,994
Stay here.

697
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,711
All right, come on.

698
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,313
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

699
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,516
Guess you were right, kid.

700
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,717
OK, that's... awful.

701
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,078
We got company.

702
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,909
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

703
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,959
- Come on.
- Uh... Central control room. OK...

704
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,512
- Uh, fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

705
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,314
You take the right.

706
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,913
- (door opens and closes)
- Oh, shit.

707
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,558
Shh.

708
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,351
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

709
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,477
I am! I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

710
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,836
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

711
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,354
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

712
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,714
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

713
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,553
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

714
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,949
With the amount of hardware they're running,

715
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,511
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

716
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,194
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

717
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,034
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

718
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,318
Play time's over, sweetheart.

719
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,515
Don't.

720
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,989
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

721
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,711
Stand up.

722
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,909
Go on. Now!

723
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,639
Let's go, kid. You're up.

724
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,312
OK...

725
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,398
As fast as you can.

726
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,389
Jesus!

727
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,511
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

728
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,832
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

729
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,671
Still awake, huh?

730
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,910
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'.
- OK.

731
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,434
- How much time do you need?
- Um... Not much.

732
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,239
Whoo.

733
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,748
- Are you done?
- l, uh...

734
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,671
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

735
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,638
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

736
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,230
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their APl and booting the host.

737
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,551
- What?!
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

738
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,915
Not the easiest thing to do when...

739
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,752
OK...

740
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,756
Undo everything you just did. Now!

741
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,956
OK. OK, OK.

742
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,719
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

743
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,999
I'm a righty.

744
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,793
One last door to open.

745
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,714
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realize what this'll do to the country?

746
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,713
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

747
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,190
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

748
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,153
You do? I'm glad you know.

749
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,237
How you doin'?

750
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,472
Hang on.

751
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,712
(screams)

752
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,718
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

753
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,032
How you doin'?
That's not too tight, is it?

754
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,797
Damn it!

755
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,636
Smile pretty!

756
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,475
(creaking)

757
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,109
McClane!

758
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,038
Shit.

759
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,108
McClane, get out of there!

760
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,390
Come on, man! Come on!

761
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,274
Come on, man.

762
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,158
Did you see that?

763
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,277
(triumphant laugh and yell)

764
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,871
(McClane) So you stopped it, right?

765
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,191
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

766
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,556
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

767
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,596
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

768
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,513
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

769
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:58,398
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

770
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:02,029
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

771
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,995
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

772
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,676
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

773
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,118
It's an e-bomb.

774
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,949
(phone rings)

775
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,198
Hey...

776
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,313
All right, wait, wait.

777
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,394
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

778
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,199
Oh, yeah - little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

779
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,989
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

780
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,279
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

781
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,032
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

782
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,510
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

783
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,558
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

784
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:07,510
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

785
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,160
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

786
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,869
I will focus all my attention... on you.

787
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,793
You wanna make things personal, fine.

788
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,273
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

789
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,277
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

790
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,475
Do it.

791
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,357
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

792
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,717
Please, no.

793
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,517
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

794
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,277
- (McClane) You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

795
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,750
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

796
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,719
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

797
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,759
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

798
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,398
You think so?

799
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,552
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

800
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,679
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

801
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,069
- (beeping)
- We got a pretty serious problem.

802
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,230
Hold on one minute.
What?

803
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,199
I think we need to get out of here right now.

804
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,670
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

805
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,352
Christ.

806
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:42,355
Oh... all of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

807
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,830
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

808
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,196
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

809
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,589
McClane? McClane?

810
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,910
Let's go. Finish this up.

811
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,113
(rumbling)

812
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,511
Right now. Finish it up, come on! Let's go!

813
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,353
Get in there!

814
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,199
You OK?

815
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,636
(coughing and sputtering)

816
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,679
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

817
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,955
Hey, knock that off, come on.

818
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:24,398
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

819
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,075
Win? When do we start winning? Huh?

820
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,312
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

821
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,789
We just got the shit kicked out of us!

822
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,871
You think I'm holding out on you?

823
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,794
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you!
I would happily tell you!

824
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,158
Jesus.

825
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,798
The Warlock. The Warlock.

826
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,792
Oh, great. Ah! There goes the cellphone.

827
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,350
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

828
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,158
- We should go see him.
- Who?

829
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,913
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

830
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,629
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- Hey! This is me helping you.

831
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,874
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

832
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,919
- How do you feel about flying?
- Uh, about what? Like, with a pilot?

833
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,799
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

834
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,553
Here, put these on.

835
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,108
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

836
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,034
- You OK?
- Uh, yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

837
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,475
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

838
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,870
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

839
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,793
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

840
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,399
(engine starts up)

841
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,313
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

842
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,192
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.

843
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,759
Really? I heard...

844
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,152
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha! You did? Really?

845
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,472
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

846
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,996
- Oh, God.
- Hey-hey, here we go! We're up.

847
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,877
Oh, God.

848
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,753
That's good. That's pretty good.

849
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,958
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

850
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,195
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

851
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,352
Um, it's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

852
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:17,034
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

853
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,476
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

854
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,949
How the hell are they getting past us?

855
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,556
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

856
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,278
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

857
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,878
What? Are we gonna land down there?

858
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,558
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK. Ohhh!

859
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,272
Fence. Fence. Fence!

860
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,232
- Fence. Fence!
- I see it.

861
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,233
Watch...

862
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,277
Ow! Ohhh!

863
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,759
(Matt whoops with relief)

864
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,591
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

865
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,990
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
"Taking off's the hardest part."

866
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,990
Let's go.

867
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:16,750
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

868
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,991
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

869
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,350
(clears throat)

870
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,271
Shit.

871
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,555
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

872
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,232
Um, is Freddy home?

873
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,032
I'm Matt Farrell and this is, uh...

874
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,838
Billy.

875
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,630
We're friends from... Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

876
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,957
Freddy!

877
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,600
- Freddy?
- You got company!

878
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,837
Frederick! Didn't you hear me?

879
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,876
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

880
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,032
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the...?

881
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,519
Come on, Ma! How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

882
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,355
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight!

883
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,557
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

884
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,111
Dude, what are you doin' here? 'Cause of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

885
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:29,309
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

886
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,198
And hey, don't touch that, all right?

887
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,955
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

888
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,510
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

889
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,956
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

890
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,156
whether they be zombies or not.

891
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:49,313
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

892
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,470
Nice poster.

893
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,672
- Oh, what? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.

894
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,954
- Star Wars guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...

895
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,349
Hey, dump truck. I'm not his dad.

896
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,319
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- Oh. A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.

897
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,630
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command center?

898
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,757
(laughs) Command center! It's a basement.

899
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,149
- It's a command center!
- I can explain.

900
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,949
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

901
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,031
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

902
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,350
Get out! I want you outta here, right now.

903
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,557
Hey, calm down. Just calm down, big boy!

904
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,949
You calm down! It's my house!

905
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,556
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

906
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,598
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

907
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,716
First day on the job, tells his bosses

908
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:57,236
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

909
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:02,314
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up 'cause he is committed.

910
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,198
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

911
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,990
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defense network.

912
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,277
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

913
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,353
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

914
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,079
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

915
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,197
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

916
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,396
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

917
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,756
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

918
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:34,233
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

919
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,517
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

920
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,229
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

921
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,357
The only security system in the country
that I can find

922
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,718
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

923
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,954
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

924
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:57,032
- Whoa. What the hell? God!
- I know, right?

925
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,669
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

926
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,309
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- (Matt) Why are there chilling towers?

927
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,719
Hello.

928
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,189
What's a chilling tower?

929
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,589
See what I've been dealing with?

930
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,116
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

931
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,553
But why there?

932
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:20,270
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

933
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:30,509
I got a red flag over here!
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

934
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,392
Honing in on the host server right now.

935
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,150
"Frederick Kaludis."

936
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,310
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

937
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,439
McClane.

938
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,752
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

939
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,353
You'll love this.

940
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,954
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

941
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,469
(powering up)

942
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,397
- (Gabriel) Freddy?
- What?

943
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,916
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

944
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,838
McClane?

945
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,751
I thought I killed you already.

946
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,751
I get that sometimes.

947
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,150
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

948
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:36,075
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

949
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:43,236
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

950
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,835
but, hey, I'm still alive, ain't l?

951
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:52,993
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right? Huh?

952
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,471
Gabriel?

953
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,231
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

954
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,916
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

955
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,275
And I bet you're still on hold with,

956
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,673
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?" Huh?

957
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:20,517
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

958
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,751
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

959
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,355
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

960
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,192
Yeah?

961
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,791
Is this one of them?

962
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,833
- (Lucy) Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

963
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,672
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

964
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,309
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

965
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,119
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone!

966
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,193
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

967
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,077
Everything is gonna be all right.

968
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:58,631
- Lucy, hang up the phone!
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

969
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,158
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

970
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,674
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

971
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,912
- Even if I have to come down there myself.
- Thank you.

972
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,436
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

973
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,158
Yeah.

974
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,070
My dad.

975
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,709
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

976
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:29,310
We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'll get to you... very soon.

977
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,751
Thank you.

978
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,390
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

979
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,308
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

980
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,391
Come on, John.

981
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,994
Make a joke.

982
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,992
Say somethin' funny.

983
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,515
(low whistle)

984
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,030
Where...?
(whispers) Where you goin'?

985
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:02,831
Hey! McClane! Hold on.
Where you goin'? What are you gonna do?

986
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,959
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

987
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,953
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

988
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,476
- I think l...
- Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

989
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,869
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

990
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,871
I'll take it from here.

991
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,269
Thanks for your help.

992
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,594
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

993
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,311
Buckle up.

994
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,355
FBl, ma'am. Jersey field office.

995
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,351
Mind if I see your lD?

996
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,431
Not at all.

997
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,395
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

998
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:21,350
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

999
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,870
Kid, can you get Bowman?

1000
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,951
Uh, yeah.

1001
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,111
It's completely dead.

1002
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,670
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

1003
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,109
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1004
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,710
About all of it.

1005
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,519
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

1006
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,238
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

1007
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,151
(bell)

1008
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,998
- Let go of me, you bastard!
- This bitch is a handful.

1009
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,035
Are you gonna be all right?

1010
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,472
Hey! Behave or I will hurt you.

1011
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,429
Oh, yeah? Let's step outside,
just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.

1012
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,470
You really are his daughter.

1013
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,152
Tie her wrists.

1014
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,270
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

1015
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,794
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

1016
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,359
OK.

1017
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,919
I'll be back in a second.

1018
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,391
No, no, no, please!

1019
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,474
- (alarm)
- We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

1020
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,869
Go take a look.

1021
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,550
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

1022
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:06,269
Hey, McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

1023
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,316
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1024
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:12,109
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

1025
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,151
Come on.

1026
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:23,156
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

1027
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,431
I think mine's locked.

1028
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,669
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

1029
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,871
Uh...

1030
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:52,274
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

1031
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,111
If I can just hack in...

1032
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,479
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

1033
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,151
(alarm)

1034
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,318
Someone set off the alarms.

1035
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:13,359
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

1036
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,316
What have you got?

1037
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,676
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1038
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,751
It's gotta be him.

1039
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,956
And what's Woodlawn?

1040
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,833
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

1041
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:41,471
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

1042
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:46,350
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

1043
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:51,309
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

1044
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,075
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

1045
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,469
All in one location?

1046
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,152
What could Gabriel do with it?

1047
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:04,028
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

1048
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:09,752
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

1049
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,353
We couldn't trace it.

1050
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:17,117
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

1051
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:22,354
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

1052
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,431
My pay grade?

1053
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:32,038
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

1054
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,036
He designed it.

1055
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,238
It was his program.

1056
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:44,394
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

1057
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,993
That's brilliant.

1058
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,789
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

1059
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,431
(alarm sounds)

1060
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,435
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

1061
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,837
Don't move!

1062
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,354
You, get away from the bag. Now!

1063
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,998
OK, OK.

1064
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,230
We've been waiting for you.

1065
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,191
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

1066
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,588
(loud whir of machinery)

1067
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,152
McClane!

1068
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,873
McClane!

1069
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,719
Kid?

1070
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,189
Matt?

1071
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,349
Kid!

1072
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,316
(Gabriel) Emerson.

1073
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,509
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

1074
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,919
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

1075
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,274
Find out what's going on.

1076
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,510
Arrivo subito. OK.

1077
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,069
Sir?

1078
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,754
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

1079
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,513
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1080
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,352
Then get us some helicopters.

1081
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,273
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1082
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,194
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

1083
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,638
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

1084
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,553
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

1085
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,631
Let's go.

1086
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,516
(man grunts)

1087
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,311
Where's my daughter?

1088
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,709
(Gabriel) Russo, check in.

1089
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,475
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1090
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,791
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

1091
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,873
- It's McClane! He's on the third floor!
- (gunshot)

1092
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,477
Get all that? That's right.

1093
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,030
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

1094
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,589
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

1095
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,108
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1096
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,392
Je vous rejoins.

1097
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,357
My algorithm.

1098
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,199
(footsteps)

1099
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,594
OK, please, God.

1100
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,996
Oh, please, God...

1101
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:13,030
Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.

1102
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,398
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1103
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,596
Yep, that's my plan.

1104
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,911
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

1105
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,151
- 'Cause you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1106
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,991
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

1107
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,319
Stop there! Hands up.

1108
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,755
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1109
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,479
Eccoti qui, piccolo stronzo.

1110
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,710
Move away. Move!

1111
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,553
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

1112
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,076
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

1113
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,833
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

1114
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,276
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1115
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,796
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

1116
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,555
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

1117
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,111
- I am doing the country a favor.
- (chuckles) By tearing it apart.

1118
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:44,115
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

1119
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,760
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1120
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:52,836
Everything I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

1121
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,071
Ah, bullshit.
It's always been about the money.

1122
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:00,199
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1123
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:03,795
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a check for you.

1124
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:11,356
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

1125
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,429
Dad?

1126
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:17,276
Hi, baby.

1127
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:20,511
Now there are only five of them.

1128
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,468
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'.

1129
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,231
(sighs)

1130
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,750
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1131
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:41,077
We have a problem.

1132
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:45,634
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

1133
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,151
This is a mess.

1134
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,039
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

1135
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:00,193
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1136
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:03,317
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1137
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,472
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1138
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,949
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

1139
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:11,039
Matt Farrell.

1140
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,070
Lucy McClane.

1141
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,470
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

1142
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,278
Not today.

1143
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:23,148
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1144
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,390
That's encouraging.

1145
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,195
Take them with us.

1146
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,316
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1147
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,439
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1148
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,511
Keep an eye on it.

1149
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,232
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

1150
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,669
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1151
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,594
Christ. Goddamn hamster!

1152
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,593
There you go.

1153
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,035
Stay still, spider-boy!

1154
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,598
That's right.

1155
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,232
Goddammit!

1156
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,155
Oh, no!

1157
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,798
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

1158
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,112
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, 'cause you're gonna need 'em.

1159
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:16,069
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

1160
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,235
Sir.

1161
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,117
ETA 15 minutes.

1162
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,189
There we go.

1163
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,912
Fix it.

1164
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,197
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

1165
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,232
Oh, shit.

1166
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,029
I'm not gonna do it.

1167
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,235
- Oh, no, no, no! Shit!
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1168
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,390
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

1169
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,436
Robinson is coming too fast.

1170
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,517
It's not Robinson.

1171
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,511
That would be my dad.

1172
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,436
Freddy?

1173
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,038
Freddy?

1174
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,598
It's John McClane.

1175
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,070
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

1176
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,799
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

1177
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,590
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

1178
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,671
Hacker jerk-off!

1179
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,516
Warlock...

1180
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,628
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBl.

1181
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,631
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1182
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:11,188
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

1183
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,714
You want me to intentionally
open up a com line

1184
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,429
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

1185
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,069
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter!

1186
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,475
I can do that. Hold on.

1187
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,631
Thank you.

1188
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,791
(woman) This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

1189
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:43,118
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

1190
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,355
Go.

1191
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,795
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1192
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:51,589
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

1193
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:55,468
Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

1194
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,632
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

1195
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:03,711
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

1196
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,916
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1197
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,390
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

1198
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,516
Golf... Tango...

1199
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,959
five... niner... two... November.

1200
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,554
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

1201
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,119
He's with them.

1202
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,393
Listen to me.

1203
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:27,758
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

1204
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:32,197
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

1205
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,350
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

1206
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,716
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

1207
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,235
Yeah, you have it.

1208
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,038
McClane out.

1209
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,155
There's the F-35.

1210
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:56,875
Did you get the "go" codes?

1211
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,269
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

1212
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,874
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1213
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,757
Uh...

1214
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,229
Isolating his radio.

1215
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,514
Sending him the "go" codes.

1216
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,634
AV-81.

1217
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:39,840
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

1218
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,435
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

1219
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,638
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

1220
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,359
You are authorized to engage and destroy.

1221
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,795
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1222
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,829
What?

1223
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,437
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1224
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,237
You're shooting at the wrong guy!

1225
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:27,150
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1226
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,270
Hey! Jackass!

1227
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,390
Is that it? Huh?

1228
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:34,959
Is that your best shot?

1229
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,599
Come on!

1230
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,028
Damn!

1231
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,478
Come on!

1232
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,355
(beeping)

1233
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,431
Yaaarrhh...

1234
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,918
Whoo!

1235
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,997
Let's go. Come on!

1236
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:17,071
That way. It's that way. Go!

1237
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:28,280
We are leaving in three minutes.

1238
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,630
You have one.

1239
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:37,076
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

1240
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:39,790
- Aaargh! Aaargh!
- (Lucy squeals)

1241
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,228
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Matthew?

1242
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,514
Matthew!

1243
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,319
I really need you to pay attention.

1244
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:50,995
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

1245
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:53,355
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

1246
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,237
Nine.

1247
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,833
I can't.

1248
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,831
Eight.

1249
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,638
I can't.

1250
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,753
Oh, God.

1251
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,474
(shot fired)

1252
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:08,472
- OK!
- (Lucy cries)

1253
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:09,959
OK, OK, OK!

1254
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:11,553
Six.

1255
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:15,394
OK, stop! Stop, stop!
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1256
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,994
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1257
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,471
(tires screeching)

1258
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,235
(Trey) Feds are headed this way.

1259
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,834
- Get everything on the plane.
- Yep.

1260
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,477
- Dad!
- (Gabriel) Careful.

1261
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,916
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1262
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,796
Daddy!

1263
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:56,269
(Lucy sobbing)

1264
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:00,316
- (groans)
- No!

1265
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,630
Hold this.

1266
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,954
Aaargh!

1267
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,512
No!

1268
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,830
Jesus Christ.

1269
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:31,036
You got her?

1270
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,231
You're sure?

1271
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,798
Nice effort, though.

1272
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,358
- Matthew!
- Oh, shit! All right, OK!

1273
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,192
OK! I'm doin' it. I know.

1274
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,671
McClane.

1275
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,558
Would you do me a favor?

1276
01:54:55,840 --> 01:55:00,595
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

1277
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,752
when Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1278
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,593
and I would love for you to see that.

1279
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,475
Goddammit. Matthew?

1280
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,949
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

1281
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:16,953
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

1282
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,031
McClane!

1283
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,509
- Ohh!
- Stay with me.

1284
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,079
Dad?

1285
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:28,188
On your tombstone it should read, "Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

1286
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,748
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf...!"

1287
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,514
(sobbing) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

1288
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,637
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1289
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,079
I knew you'd come for me.

1290
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:59,676
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

1291
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,832
Move, move.

1292
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,238
(man) Freeze!

1293
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:18,073
Hold, hold! He's OK.

1294
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,560
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around!

1295
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:24,676
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

1296
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:29,276
Oooh! Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1297
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:33,319
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

1298
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:38,030
- You shot yourself!
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1299
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:41,112
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1300
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,673
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1301
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,437
Is he OK?

1302
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:02,159
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1303
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,470
Put 'em down further?

1304
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,712
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

1305
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,958
All right.

1306
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,951
(groans)

1307
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,871
I'll be right back.

1308
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,590
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1309
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:23,194
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

1310
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,556
He gave me some...
What's it called? Mor...? Morphine.

1311
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:32,078
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1312
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:35,994
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really? Hm.

1313
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,351
Not that one.

1314
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,158
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

1315
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:44,835
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

1316
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:49,277
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

1317
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:50,713
Yeah.

1318
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,669
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1319
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,271
That would suck.

1320
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,552
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1321
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:06,189
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

1322
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,672
Hey.

1323
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,792
- Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
- Hey...

1324
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:19,155
What was I gonna do?

1325
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,630
That's what makes you that guy.

1326
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,715
Yeah.

1327
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,713
So, um, did he say anything about me?

1328
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,516
Jesus, Lucy.

1329
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,716
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1330
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:45,469
I'm in enough pain already.

1331
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:47,357
Hospital.
