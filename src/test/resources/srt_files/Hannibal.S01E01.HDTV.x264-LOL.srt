1
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,023
(sound muted)

2
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:34,746
(soft ambient pulse)

3
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:17,655
(Sound returns.)

4
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,707
(siren in the distance)

5
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,662
(sound muted)

6
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,714
(soft ambient pulse)

7
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:35,957
(Sound returns.)

8
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,259
(insects chirping)

9
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,935
(house alarm)

10
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,157
I shoot Mr. Marlow twice,

11
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:56,444
severing jugulars and carotids
with near-surgical precision.

12
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,864
He will die watching me take
what is his away from him.

13
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,816
This is my design.

14
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:05,653
(house alarm)
(woman whimpering frantically)

15
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:21,853
I shoot Mrs. Marlow expertly
through the neck.

16
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:25,006
This is not a fatal wound.
The bullet misses every artery.

17
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:28,676
She is paralyzed
before it leaves her body.

18
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:33,014
Which doesn't mean
she can't feel pain.

19
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:35,016
It just means

20
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:38,369
she can't do anything about it.

21
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,740
This is my design.

22
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,879
(house alarm)

23
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:49,881
(Alarm stops.)

24
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:53,751
(phone ringing on other end)
(keypad beeps)

25
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:56,904
<i>This is DDX Security.
Who am I speaking with?</i>

26
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:02,977
I need the incident report
for the home security company.

27
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:12,053
This was recorded
as a false alarm.

28
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:19,360
There was a false alarm
last... week.

29
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:24,032
He tapped their phone.

30
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:27,568
Yeah. It's been tapped.

31
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:30,571
He recorded Mrs. Marlow's conversation
with the security company.

32
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:32,724
<i>- This is DDX Security.
Who am I speaking with?</i>

33
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:34,842
<i>- Theresa Marlow.</i>

34
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,929
<i>Can you please confirm your</i>
<i>password for security purposes?</i>

35
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:40,832
<i>Tea kettle.</i>

36
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:44,185
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Marlow.</i>
<i>We detected a front-door alarm.</i>

37
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,688
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

38
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:50,692
<i>Is there anyone in the house with
you at this time, Mrs. Marlow?</i>

39
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:54,462
- I'm just here with my husband.
<i>- Do you require</i>

40
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,965
<i>- any further assistance?</i>
<i>- No. Thank you so much for calling.</i>

41
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,738
And this is when it gets
truly horrifying

42
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,273
for Mrs. Marlow.

43
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,815
Everyone has thought
about killing someone,

44
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,917
one way or another,

45
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:20,838
be it your own hand
or the hand of God.

46
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,143
Now think about killing
Mrs. Marlow.

47
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,831
Why did she deserve this?

48
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,816
Tell me your design.

49
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,485
Tell me who you are.

50
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,834
Sync and correction by GeirDM
www.addic7ed.com

51
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,910
Mr. Graham.

52
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:45,496
Special Agent

53
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,982
Jack Crawford. I head
the Behavioral Science Unit.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,984
- We've met.
- Yes.

55
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,587
We had a disagreement
when we opened up the museum.

56
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:55,590
I disagreed with what
you named it.

57
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,592
The, uh, Evil Minds
Research Museum.

58
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:59,460
It's a little hammy, Jack.

59
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:02,346
I see you've hitched

60
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,348
your horse to a teaching post,

61
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,501
and I also understand it's
difficult for you to be social.

62
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,503
Well, I'm just talking at them.

63
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,331
- I'm not listening to them.
It's not social.

64
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:13,141
- I see.

65
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:16,477
May I?

66
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,531
Where do you fall

67
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,467
on the spectrum?

68
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,570
My horse is hitched to a post

69
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:28,823
that is closer to
Asperger's and autistics

70
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:31,159
than narcissists
and sociopaths.

71
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:35,196
But you can empathize
with narcissists

72
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,331
- and sociopaths.
- I can empathize with anybody.

73
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,967
It's less to do
with a personality disorder

74
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:42,136
- than an active imagination.
- Um...

75
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:45,006
can I...

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,475
borrow your imagination?

77
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,460
<i>Eight girls</i>

78
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,846
abducted from eight different
Minnesota campuses,

79
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,148
- all in the last eight months.
- I thought there were seven.

80
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:57,235
- There were.
- When did you tag the eighth?

81
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,405
About three minutes before
I walked into your lecture hall.

82
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,408
You're calling them abductions
because you don't have any bodies?

83
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,111
No bodies, no parts
of bodies, nothing

84
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,778
that comes out of bodies.
Nothing.

85
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,781
Then those girls weren't taken from
where you think they were taken.

86
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,783
Then where were
they taken from?

87
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,785
I don't know. Someplace else.

88
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:17,121
All of them abducted
on a Friday

89
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,123
so they wouldn't have to be
reported missing until Monday.

90
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:23,410
Now, however he's covering his
tracks, he needs a weekend to do it.

91
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:27,965
Number eight?

92
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,601
Elise Nichols. St. Cloud State
on the Mississippi.

93
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:33,104
Disappeared on Friday.
Was supposed to house sit

94
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:35,806
for her parents
over the weekend, feed the cat.

95
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,308
She never made it home.

96
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,393
Yeah, one through seven are
dead, don't you think?

97
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:41,946
He's not keeping them around.
He got himself

98
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,032
- a new one.
- So we focus on Elise Nichols.

99
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,788
They're all very, um...
Mall of America.

100
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,042
That's a lot
of wind-chafed skin.

101
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,044
Same hair colour,
same eye colour.

102
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,464
Roughly the same age.
Same height, same weight.

103
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,466
So what is it
about all of these girls?

104
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:06,754
It's not about all of these girls.
It's just about one of them.

105
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:10,474
He's like Willy Wonka. Every
girl he takes is a candy bar,

106
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,320
and hidden in amongst
all of those candy

107
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:16,130
bars is the one true
intended victim,

108
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:18,216
which, if we follow through
on our metaphor,

109
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,402
is your golden ticket.
- So, is he

110
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,404
warming up
for his golden ticket,

111
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,439
or just reliving whatever it is
he did to her?

112
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:26,958
The golden ticket
wouldn't be the first

113
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,442
taken, and she
wouldn't be the last.

114
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:30,895
He would, um, hide
how special she was.

115
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,314
I mean, I would. Wouldn't you?

116
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:35,316
I want you to get closer
to this.

117
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:38,169
No. You have Heimlich at
Harvard and Bloom at Georgetown.

118
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:41,672
- They do the same thing I do.
- That's not exactly true, is it?

119
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,824
You have a very specific way
of thinking about things.

120
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:47,845
Has there been a lot of discussion
about the, uh, specific way

121
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,998
- I think?
- You make jumps you can't explain, Will.

122
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,351
No, no. The evidence explains.

123
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,636
Then help me find
some evidence.

124
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:02,310
That may require me
to be sociable.

125
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:17,124
(echoing voice): <i>She could've</i>
<i>gone off by herself.</i>

126
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,412
She... she was a very interior
young woman.

127
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,699
She didn't like living
in her dorm.

128
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:29,036
I could see how the pressure
of school might have

129
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,821
gotten to her.

130
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:33,874
She likes trains.

131
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,477
Maybe she just got
on a train and...

132
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,679
She looks like the other girls.

133
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:41,582
Yes, she fits the profile.

134
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,187
Could Elise still be alive?

135
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,893
We simply have no way
of knowing.

136
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,781
- How's the cat?
- (Mrs. Nichols): What?

137
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,668
How's your cat?

138
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,393
Elise was supposed to feed it.

139
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,373
Was the cat weird
when you came home?

140
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:08,009
It must've been hungry.
It didn't eat all weekend.

141
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:10,878
I... I didn't notice.

142
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:18,085
Could you give us a moment,
please?

143
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:30,398
(whispering): He took her
from here.

144
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:35,319
She got on a train,
she came home,

145
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,321
she fed the cat.

146
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,373
He took her.

147
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:46,047
The Nichols' house is
a crime scene.

148
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:48,049
I need ERT immediately.

149
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,135
I want Zeller, Katz,
and Jimmy Price.

150
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,137
Yes, and a photographer.

151
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:56,424
Why is it now a crime scene?

152
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,642
Can I see your daughter's room?

153
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,640
I'll get that.

154
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:16,694
Mr. Nichols, please put
your hands in your pockets

155
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,812
and avoid touching anything.

156
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,814
But we've been
in and out of here

157
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:22,816
all day.

158
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,203
You can hold the cat,
if it's easier.

159
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:38,165
- Elise.
- I need you to leave

160
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,850
the room.

161
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:49,276
When you're ready to talk,
you talk.

162
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:53,114
If you don't feel like it,
you don't talk.

163
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:55,116
We'll be downstairs.

164
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,351
You let me know when you're
ready for us to come in.

165
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:14,418
(siren)

166
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:31,035
(soft ambient pulse)

167
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:07,254
- You're Will Graham.
- You're not supposed to be in here.

168
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:12,393
You wrote the standard monograph on
time of death by insect activity.

169
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:15,145
I found antler velvet
in two of the wounds.

170
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:17,531
You, uh, not real FBI?

171
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:20,034
I'm a special investigator.

172
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,703
Never been an FBI agent?

173
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:24,989
Um... strict

174
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,875
- screening procedures.
- Detects instability...

175
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,544
You unstable?

176
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:33,280
Now, you know you're not
supposed to be in here.

177
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:36,383
I found antler velvet in two of
the wounds, like she was gored.

178
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,385
I was looking for velvet
in the other wounds

179
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,055
- but I was interrupted.
- Hold on, excuse me. Look,

180
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,532
deer and elk pin their prey, OK?
They put

181
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,974
all their weight
into their antlers,

182
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,493
try and suffocate a victim.
That's how

183
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,977
they would kill, like,
a fox or a coyote.

184
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:48,929
All right, Elise Nichols was
strangled, suffocated,

185
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:51,148
- her ribs are broken.
- Antler velvet is rich

186
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:53,059
in nutrients. It actually
promotes healing.

187
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,935
He may have put it
in there on purpose.

188
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:57,238
You think he was trying
to heal her?

189
00:12:57,272 --> 00:13:01,141
He wanted to undo
as much as he could...

190
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,494
given that he'd
already killed her.

191
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,746
He put her back
where he found her.

192
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,982
Whatever he did to the others,
he couldn't do it to her.

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,952
(Jack): Is this
his golden ticket?

194
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,157
No.

195
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,176
This is an apology.

196
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,966
Does anyone have any aspirin?

197
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,232
Hello.

198
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:47,020
Hey.

199
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:51,992
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Come on. Come on.

200
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,726
Hey.

201
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,478
Hey, come here.

202
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,013
Hey.

203
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:33,901
Winston, this is everybody.

204
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,420
Everybody, this is Winston.

205
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,455
(barking)
Tss! Tss!

206
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,793
That's right.

207
00:14:56,207 --> 00:15:01,094
(heartbeat)

208
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,193
What are you doing in here?

209
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,131
I enjoy the smell
of urinal cake.

210
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,833
Me too. We need to talk.

211
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,502
USE THE LADIES' ROOM!

212
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,143
You respect my judgment, Will?

213
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:27,229
Mm-hmm. Yes.

214
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,665
Good, because we
will stand a better

215
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,067
chance of catching
this guy with you

216
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:34,853
- in the saddle.
- Yeah, I'm in the saddle.

217
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:39,107
I'm just, um, confused
which direction I'm pointing.

218
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:41,743
I don't know

219
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:43,745
this kind of psychopath.
I've never read about him.

220
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,548
I don't even know if
he's a psychopath.

221
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:47,315
He's not insensitive.
He's not shallow.

222
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,910
You know something about
him; otherwise, you

223
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,487
wouldn't have said,
"This is an apology".

224
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:55,791
What is he apologizing for?
- He couldn't honour her. He feels bad.

225
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,659
Well, feeling bad defeats
the purpose of being

226
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,511
- a psychopath, doesn't it?
- Yes! It does.

227
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:02,047
Then what kind of crazy is he?!

228
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,986
He couldn't show her he loved
her, so he put her corpse back

229
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:10,005
where he killed it.
Whatever crazy that is.

230
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:12,274
You think he loves these girls?

231
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:14,893
He loves one of them.
A-And, yes, I think

232
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:17,980
by association he has some form
of love for the others.

233
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:21,850
There was no semen, there was no saliva.
Elise Nichols died a virgin.

234
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,852
- She stayed that way.
- That's not how

235
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,171
he's loving them. He wouldn't
disrespect them that way!

236
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:28,189
He doesn't want these girls
to suffer.

237
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:31,576
He kills them quickly and...

238
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:35,664
to his thinking, with mercy.

239
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:41,036
Sensitive psychopath.

240
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:43,722
Risked getting caught

241
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,725
so he could tuck Elise Nichols
back into bed.

242
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,378
He has to take the next girl
soon...

243
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:54,316
'cause he knows he's gonna
get caught.

244
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,069
One way or the other.

245
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:15,053
I got you.

246
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,528
(Jack): Graham likes you.

247
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:42,531
Doesn't think you'll run
any mind games on him.

248
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:46,368
I don't. I'm as honest with
him as I'd be with a patient.

249
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:48,370
You've been observing him
while you've been

250
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,706
guest-lecturing here
at the academy, yes?

251
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,241
I've never been in a room
alone with Will.

252
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,010
- Why not?

253
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,745
- Because I want to be
his friend, and I am.

254
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:00,549
Ah, it seems a shame not to take
advantage... academically speaking.

255
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,918
You already asked me
to do a study on him,

256
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:05,420
Jack. I said no. And anything

257
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:09,424
scholarly on Will Graham would
have to be published posthumously.

258
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,494
So, you've never been alone with him
because you have a professional

259
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,731
curiosity. (Jack chuckles.)

260
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:18,066
Normally I wouldn't
even broach this,

261
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:22,738
but what do you think one
of Will's strongest drives is?

262
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,990
Fear.

263
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,475
- Mm-hmm.
- Will Graham deals

264
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:30,645
with huge amounts of fear.
It comes with his imagination.

265
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:32,814
It's the price of imagination.

266
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:35,209
Alana, I wouldn't
put him out there

267
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,586
if I didn't think I
could cover him.

268
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,654
All right, if I didn't think
I could cover him 80%.

269
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,156
I wouldn't put him out there.

270
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,759
He's out there.
I need him out there.

271
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,378
Should he get too
close, I need you to

272
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:46,962
make sure he's not
out there alone.

273
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:51,850
Promise me something, Jack.

274
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,638
Don't let him get too close.

275
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:59,357
He won't... get too close.

276
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:07,015
(sighing): OK.

277
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:10,202
Tried her skin for prints...
of course nothing.

278
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:13,354
We did get a hand spread off her neck.
- Report say anything

279
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,865
about nails?

280
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,357
- Fingernails were smudged
when we took the scrapings.

281
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,994
The scrapings were
from her own palms

282
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:20,979
when she scratched them.
She never scratched him.

283
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,998
- Piece of metal is all we got.
- We should be looking

284
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,250
at plumbers, steamfitters,
tool workers...

285
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:55,247
Other injuries were probably but
not conclusively post-mortem.

286
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:57,158
So... not gored.

287
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,034
- She has lots of piercings
that look like they were caused

288
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,903
by deer antlers. I
didn't say the deer

289
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:02,737
was responsible for
putting them there.

290
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:04,673
She was mounted on them.

291
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:07,159
Like hooks.

292
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:11,680
She may have been bled.
- Her liver was removed.

293
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:13,765
See that? He took it out,
and then...

294
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,584
- yep, he put it back in.
- Huh.

295
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:19,254
Why would he cut it out
if he's just gonna sew it

296
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:20,755
back in again?

297
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:22,941
There was something wrong
with the meat.

298
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:26,645
She has liver cancer.

299
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:32,651
He's, um... he's eating them.

300
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,438
(crying) Please.

301
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,449
(crying) Thank you.

302
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:37,689
I hate being this neurotic.
- If you weren't neurotic,

303
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:41,410
Franklyn, you would be something
much worse.

304
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:52,004
Our brain is designed to experience
anxiety in short bursts,

305
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,008
not the prolonged duress
yours has seemed to enjoy.

306
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,843
That's why you feel
as though a lion

307
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,644
were on the verge
of devouring you.

308
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,264
(crying)

309
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,483
- Franklyn.
- Yes.

310
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:07,853
You have to convince yourself
the lion is not in the room.

311
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,855
When it is,

312
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,223
I assure you,

313
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,242
you will know.

314
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:21,917
Dr. Lecter.
I'm, uh, Special Ag...

315
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:23,427
I hate to be
discourteous, but this

316
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,903
is a private exit
for my patients.

317
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:29,424
- Oh, Dr. Lecter. Sorry. Um,

318
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:31,576
I'm, uh, Special Agent

319
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:34,363
Jack Crawford, FBI.
May I come in?

320
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,381
You may wait
in the waiting room.

321
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,383
Franklyn, I'll see you
next week.

322
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,385
- Yes.
- Unless, of course,

323
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,087
this is about him.

324
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:44,439
No, this is all about you.

325
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,283
Please, come in.

326
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,238
So,

327
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,607
may I ask how this is
all about me?

328
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,243
You can ask,
but I may have to ask you

329
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,946
a few questions first.

330
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:10,082
You expecting another patient?

331
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,750
We're all alone.

332
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,386
Oh, good.

333
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,805
- No secretary?
- Was predispositioned

334
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,225
to romantic whims. Followed her
heart to the United Kingdom.

335
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,677
(Jack chuckles.)
Sad to see her go.

336
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,766
Wow.

337
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,656
- Are these yours, Doctor?
- Among the first.

338
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,275
My boarding school in Paris
when I was a boy.

339
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,277
The amount of detail is
incredible.

340
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,079
I learned very early

341
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,915
a scalpel cuts better points
than a pencil sharpener.

342
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,651
Well, now I understand
why your drawings earned you

343
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:48,787
an internship at Johns Hopkins.

344
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,991
I'm beginning to suspect
you're investigating me,

345
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,845
- Agent Crawford.
- (Chuckling): No, no.

346
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:59,998
No, you were referred to me
by Alana Bloom

347
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:03,435
in the psychology department...
Georgetown.

348
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,671
Most psychology departments
are filled with personality

349
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,724
deficients. Dr. Bloom would be
the exception.

350
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,010
Yes, she would. Yes, she would.

351
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:14,013
Well, she told me
that you mentored her

352
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,997
during her residency
at Johns Hopkins.

353
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,200
I learned as much from her
as she did from me.

354
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,318
Yes, but she also showed me,
uh, your paper,

355
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,237
"Evolutionary..." uh,

356
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,823
"Evolutionary Origins
of Social Exclusion"?

357
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,324
Yes.

358
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,326
Very interesting.
Very interesting.

359
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,861
Even for a layman.

360
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:32,497
- A layman?
- Yeah.

361
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,116
So many learned
fellows going about

362
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,700
in the halls of
Behavioral Science

363
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,628
- at the FBI, and you
consider yourself a layman.

364
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,537
- I do when I'm in your company,

365
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:42,290
doctor. Um,

366
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:46,211
I need you to help me
with a psychological profile.

367
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:51,549
(Lecter): Tell me, then,
how many confessions?

368
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,236
Twelve dozen, the last time
I checked. None of them had

369
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,521
any details...
until this morning.

370
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,157
And then they all had details.

371
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:02,577
Some genius in Duluth PD took a
photograph of Elise Nichols' body

372
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,746
with his cell phone,
shared it with his friends,

373
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,348
and then Freddy Lounds

374
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:08,583
posted it on Tattlecrime.com.

375
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,085
Tasteless.

376
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:13,672
(Lecter): Do you have
trouble with taste?

377
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,174
My thoughts are often
not tasty.

378
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,843
Nor mine.

379
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,513
- No effective barriers.
- I build forts.

380
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,582
- Associations come quickly.
- So do forts.

381
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,922
Not fond of eye contact,
are you?

382
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,924
Eyes are distracting...

383
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,727
you see too much,
you don't see enough.

384
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,947
And-And it's hard to focus
when you're thinking, um,

385
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:41,266
"Oh, those whites are
really white",

386
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:44,452
or, "He must have hepatitis",
or, "Oh, is that a burst

387
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:48,273
"vein?" So, yeah,

388
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,375
I try to avoid eyes
whenever possible.

389
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,794
- Jack?
- Yes?

390
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,963
I imagine what you see
and learn touches

391
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,965
everything else in your mind.

392
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,967
Your values and decency are
present

393
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,286
yet shocked
at your associations,

394
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:04,489
appalled at your dreams.

395
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,809
No forts in the bone arena of
your skull for things you love.

396
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:11,296
Whose profile
are you working on?

397
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,732
Whose profile is he working on?

398
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:17,135
I'm sorry, Will.
Observing is what we do.

399
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:19,137
I can't shut mine off any more
than you can shut yours off.

400
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:22,073
Please, don't psychoanalyze me.

401
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,743
You won't like me
when I'm psychoanalyzed.

402
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,911
- Will.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

403
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:30,365
I have to go give a lecture
on psychoanalyzing.

404
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,120
Maybe we shouldn't poke him
like that,

405
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:39,407
Doctor. Perhaps a less,
uh, direct approach.

406
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:41,426
What he has is

407
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,211
pure empathy.

408
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,430
He can assume
your point of view,

409
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,599
or mine, and maybe some other
points of view that scare him.

410
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:52,220
It's an uncomfortable gift,
Jack.

411
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:56,007
Perception's a tool
that's pointed on both ends.

412
00:27:56,025 --> 00:28:01,396
This cannibal you have him
getting to know...

413
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,432
I think I can help
good Will see his face.

414
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,084
(Jack): Stag head
was reported stolen

415
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:29,843
last night, about
a mile from here.

416
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,345
Just the head?

417
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,797
Minneapolis Homicide's
already made a statement.

418
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:35,799
They're calling him
the Minnesota Shrike.

419
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,301
Like the bird?

420
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:41,472
Shrike's a perching bird.
Impales mice

421
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:44,274
and lizards on thorny branches
and barbed wire.

422
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,194
Rips their organs
right out of their bodies,

423
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:49,947
puts them in a little birdie
pantry, and eats them later.

424
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:52,116
I can't tell
whether it's sloppy

425
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,518
- or shrewd.
- He wanted her found

426
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,686
this way.

427
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:58,122
It's...

428
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:01,158
it's petulant.

429
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:04,027
I almost feel
like he's mocking her.

430
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:06,880
Or... he's mocking us.

431
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,635
Where did all his love go?

432
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:16,373
Whoever tucked Elise Nichols into
bed didn't paint this picture.

433
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:20,344
He took her lungs.

434
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,730
I'm pretty sure she was alive
when he cut 'em out.

435
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,198
Our cannibal loves women.

436
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:44,201
He doesn't want to destroy them;
He wants to consume them,

437
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:47,037
to keep some part
of them inside.

438
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:49,173
This girl's killer thought
that she was a pig.

439
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:52,709
- You think this was a copycat?
- The cannibal

440
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:54,711
who killed Elise Nichols had
a place to do it

441
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:58,515
and no interest in...
in field kabuki. So,

442
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,435
he has a house, or two,
or a-a cabin...

443
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:03,637
something with an antler room.

444
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:13,530
He has a daughter.

445
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:17,100
The same age as the other girls.
Same-same hair colour,

446
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:19,119
same eye colour, same height,
same weight.

447
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,409
She's an only child.
She's leaving home.

448
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:30,414
He can't stand the thought
of losing her.

449
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,451
She's his golden ticket.

450
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:37,454
What about the copycat?

451
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:39,556
You know,
an intelligent psychopath,

452
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:42,392
particularly a sadist,
is very hard to catch.

453
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,394
There's no traceable motive,
there'll be no patterns.

454
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,396
He may never kill
this way again.

455
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,732
Have Dr. Lecter draw up
a psychological profile.

456
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:51,268
You seemed very impressed
with his opinion.

457
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,562
(knocking on door)

458
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:39,533
(blankets shuffling)

459
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,568
(footsteps)

460
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:48,208
Good morning, Will.
May I come in?

461
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:51,328
- Where's Crawford?
- Deposed in court.

462
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:55,048
The adventure will be yours
and mine today.

463
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,750
May I come in?

464
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:08,462
I'm very careful
about what I put into my body,

465
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:11,682
which means I end up
preparing most meals myself.

466
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:15,552
A little protein scramble
to start the day.

467
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,572
Some eggs, some sausage.

468
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:26,663
Mm, it's delicious.

469
00:32:26,698 --> 00:32:29,199
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

470
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,172
I would apologize
for my analytical ambush,

471
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,841
but I know I will soon be
apologizing again

472
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,843
and you'll tire of that
eventually,

473
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,695
- so I have to consider
using apologies sparingly.

474
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,513
- Just keep it professional.

475
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:47,935
Or we could socialize,
like adults.

476
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,937
God forbid we become friendly.

477
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,422
I don't find you
that interesting.

478
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,608
You will.

479
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:04,484
Agent Crawford tells me you have
a knack for the monsters.

480
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:09,289
I don't think the Shrike
killed that girl

481
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:10,824
in the field.

482
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,662
The devil is in the details.

483
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:17,414
What didn't your
copycat do to the

484
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:19,115
girl in the field?
What gave it away?

485
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,335
Everything.

486
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:24,681
It's like he had to
show me a negative

487
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:27,975
so that I could see the positive.
It...

488
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,477
That crime scene was
practically gift-wrapped.

489
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:33,563
The mathematics
of human behaviour...

490
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,565
all those ugly variables.

491
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,303
Some bad math
with this Shrike fellow, huh?

492
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:43,273
Are you reconstructing
his fantasies?

493
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:45,275
- Heh.
- What kind of problems

494
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:47,327
- does he have?
- Uh, he has a few.

495
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:52,749
You ever have any problems,
Will?

496
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:54,868
No.

497
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,586
Of course you don't.

498
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:58,922
You and I are just alike...

499
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,924
problem-free. Nothing about us

500
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,993
to feel horrible about.

501
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:08,965
You know, Will...

502
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:12,335
I think Uncle Jack sees you
as a fragile little teacup.

503
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:16,506
The finest china,
used for only special guests.

504
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:20,394
(Will laughing)

505
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,881
How do you see me?

506
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:33,190
The mongoose I want under the
house when the snakes slither by.

507
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:39,028
Finish your breakfast.

508
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:48,088
(Will): What are you
smiling at?

509
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:53,042
Peeking behind the curtain.

510
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,554
I'm just curious how
the FBI goes about its

511
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:58,047
business when it's not
kicking in doors.

512
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:01,384
You're lucky we're not doing
house-to-house interviews.

513
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:03,887
We found a little piece of metal
in Elise Nichols' clothes...

514
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:06,239
a shred from a pipe threader.

515
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:11,060
There must be hundreds of construction
sites all over Minnesota.

516
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,746
A certain kind of metal,

517
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,748
certain kind of pipe,
certain kind of pipe coating,

518
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,408
so we're checking all
the construction

519
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,034
sites that use
that kind of pipe.

520
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:20,036
What are we looking for?

521
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,522
At this stage,
anything really. But mostly,

522
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:24,708
anything peculiar.

523
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:33,016
<i>Two fellas from the FBI.</i>

524
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,752
<i>They goin' through</i>
<i>the drawers now.</i>

525
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,421
Mm-hmm. Puttin' papers
in file boxes.

526
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:41,691
Yes, they are takin' things.

527
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:44,361
No. Well, they didn't say...

528
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,696
Yes, they can.

529
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,732
What did you say
your names were?

530
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:52,536
Garrett Jacob Hobbs?

531
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,321
He's one of our pipe threaders.
Those

532
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:56,072
are all the resignation letters.

533
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:59,943
Plumbers' Union requires 'em
whenever members finish a job.

534
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:02,045
(whispering): I'll
call you back.

535
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,882
- Uh, does Mr. Hobbs have a daughter?
- Might have.

536
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:09,953
Eighteen or 19, wind-chafed,
uh, plain but pretty.

537
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:13,623
- She'd have auburn hair, about this tall.
- Maybe.

538
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:16,125
I don't know. I don't keep
company with these people.

539
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:19,062
What is it
about Garrett Jacob Hobbs

540
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,547
you find so peculiar?

541
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,299
He left a phone number,
no address.

542
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:26,153
And therefore he has
something to hide?

543
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:28,188
The others all left addresses.

544
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,692
Do you have an address
for Mr. Hobbs?

545
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,152
I got it.

546
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:15,351
Caller ID said it was...

547
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:19,656
Hello?

548
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,659
[Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs?]

549
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:24,360
Yeah.

550
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:27,163
You don't know me
and I suspect we'll never meet.

551
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:29,866
This is a courtesy call.
Listen very carefully.

552
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:35,705
Are you listening?

553
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,707
Yes.

554
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,728
They know.

555
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,019
(birds singing)

556
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:19,155
(rattling)

557
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:42,395
Ah... ah!

558
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,951
Garrett Jacob Hobbs! FBI!

559
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:12,925
(girl whimpering)

560
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:21,550
(gunshot)

561
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,149
No, no, no.

562
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,037
See?

563
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,323
See?

564
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:54,783
(girl coughing and gasping)

565
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:56,502
No, no, no.

566
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,673
(Alana): biting in lesser assaults
and bar fights, child abuse...

567
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:55,010
Emergency room personnel may be
very helpful that way.

568
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:59,031
If they have any memories
of bad bites, no matter who was

569
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,533
bitten or h...

570
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:04,453
♪

571
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,155
Where's Graham?

572
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:10,659
You said he wouldn't
get too close.

573
