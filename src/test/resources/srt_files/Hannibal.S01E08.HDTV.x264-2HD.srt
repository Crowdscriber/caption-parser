1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:01,552
<i>Previously on Hannibal</i>

2
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:04,638
You entered into a Devil's
Bargain with Jack Crawford.

3
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:06,707
You know what looking
at this does.

4
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:08,977
Am I your psychiatrist, or are
we simply having conversations?

5
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:11,145
I don't want to get
in the middle of you and Jack.

6
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:14,183
<i>- I like you as a buffer.
- Graham likes you.</i>

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,218
Because I want
to be his friend, and I am.

8
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,121
Well, it seems a shame
not to take advantage.

9
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,823
- This is my friend Tobias.
- Good evening.

10
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,860
- I hate being this neurotic.
- If you weren't neurotic,

11
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:26,864
Franklyn, you would be
something much worse.

12
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:30,102
Whatever the Ripper was doing,
it worked.

13
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,635
These strings are harder
to bow than the regular ones.

14
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:00,439
You have to learn how to bow
authentic strings

15
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:02,818
to better bow strings
how they're made today.

16
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:04,058
I should learn to play

17
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:06,005
the easier strings first,
then the harder ones.

18
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,111
No, you shouldn't.

19
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:09,082
Are they really made
from cat guts?

20
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,420
Not always.

21
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:02,478
That's better.

22
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,180
Good.

23
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,436
If it wasn't a coyote,
the coyotes probably got it.

24
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:34,106
Probably got it
even if it was a coyote.

25
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,542
You're not expecting
to find it alive, are you?

26
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,644
We'll be lucky to find a paw.

27
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:42,750
So, you invited me over
to help you

28
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:45,119
collect animal parts?

29
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:48,089
I invited you over on the
off chance we do find it alive.

30
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,625
It's hard for me to wrangle
a wounded animal by myself.

31
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,998
Did you think it was a date?

32
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:57,333
Honestly,
it never crossed my mind.

33
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,770
Oh.

34
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:01,705
Why not?

35
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,877
You just don't seem
like you date.

36
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:09,414
Oh. Too broken to date?

37
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,449
You're not broken.

38
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,920
- What's your excuse?
- For not dating?

39
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,890
Why are you assuming
I don't date?

40
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,858
Do you?

41
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,460
No.

42
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,731
Seems like something
for somebody else.

43
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,435
I'm sure I'll become
that somebody someday,

44
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,870
but right now I think too much.

45
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,640
So,

46
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:33,642
what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna try to think less,

47
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,711
or are you just gonna wait
till it happens naturally?

48
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,880
I haven't thought about it.

49
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,655
Are you seeing anything?

50
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:46,490
Uh, no, actually.

51
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,762
I'm not even seeing any tracks.

52
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,198
I mean, except for the ones
we made.

53
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,340
Good morning.

54
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,075
Please, come in.

55
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,583
<i>I have a lot of respect
for you.</i>

56
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,617
Since we can't be friends,

57
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,589
or... you're not comfortable
with that,

58
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:17,425
I found myself looking
at my friends through your eyes,

59
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:21,663
imagining what your diagnosis
might be.

60
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,167
So you become
the psychoanalyst?

61
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:26,068
I become you.

62
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,671
Who are you psychoanalyzing?

63
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,574
My friend Tobias.

64
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:36,381
I... Googled "psychopaths",

65
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,550
went down the checklist,

66
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,854
and I was a little surprised

67
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:46,059
to see how many boxes
I had checked.

68
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,260
Why were you so curious
to Google?

69
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:50,429
He's been saying
very dark things

70
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:52,833
and then saying,
"just kidding!" A lot.

71
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,202
It started to seem
kind of crazy.

72
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,005
Psychopaths are not crazy.

73
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,373
They're fully aware
of what they do

74
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,744
and the consequences
of those actions.

75
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:06,015
Would you diagnose someone
like Tobias as a psychopath?

76
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:09,318
Or, uh, are you supposed
to diagnose other people

77
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:12,923
in front of me? Do you... would
you rather just talk about me?

78
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,926
Not at all.

79
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:17,695
Are you bored with me?

80
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,459
No.

81
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,847
This is your hour,
Franklyn.

82
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,831
We will talk about whatever
you would like to talk about.

83
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,772
I'd like to talk about Tobias.
Perhaps you can

84
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,175
- help me analyze him.
- I'm not analyzing

85
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:31,578
your friend; I'm analyzing
your perception of him.

86
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:35,115
It may help you know yourself
better. You could be

87
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:38,052
projecting onto him what
you consider to be your flaws.

88
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,622
Does that mean
that I'm a psychopath?

89
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,925
You're not a psychopath,

90
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:47,196
although you may be attracted
to them.

91
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:05,583
The victim is Douglas Wilson,
a member

92
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:08,252
of the Baltimore Metropolitan
Orchestra's brass section...

93
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,821
A trombone player.

94
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,758
He was killed shortly after
his last performance.

95
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:14,860
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

96
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:18,598
His killer brought him here

97
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,802
to... put on a show.

98
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,781
Will, is it me, or is it
becoming easier for you to look?

99
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,784
I tell myself...

100
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:36,819
It's purely
an intellectual exercise.

101
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:38,856
Well, in the narrow view
of forensics,

102
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,724
- that's exactly what it is.
- They're not any easier, Jack.

103
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,730
I shake it off,

104
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,399
keep on looking.

105
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,835
Good.

106
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,108
You shake it off.
Get to work.

107
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,149
We'll come back in
when you're ready for us.

108
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:12,129
I open his throat
from the outside

109
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:14,332
to open the trachea

110
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,433
and expose the vocal chords.

111
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,406
I open his throat
from the inside

112
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,509
using the neck of a cello.

113
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:34,488
Powder on the wound.

114
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,263
Rosin from the bow.

115
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,300
I wanted to play him.

116
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,404
I wanted to create a sound.

117
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:51,508
My sound.

118
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:57,014
This... is my design.

119
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,860
I worry that I've made
Franklyn feel powerless.

120
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:36,055
He wants to be my friend.

121
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:39,852
His obsession with me is
interfering with his progress.

122
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,975
I'm considering referring
him to another doctor.

123
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:45,909
Referrals can be complicated.

124
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,382
I referred you
to another psychiatrist.

125
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,417
You refused.

126
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,687
I'm more tenacious
than Franklyn.

127
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,125
Why were you so tenacious?

128
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:01,676
I feel protective of you.
You support me

129
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:05,867
as a colleague and psychiatrist,
and as a human being.

130
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:09,405
I want to be supportive
of you... after what happened.

131
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:15,011
I'm not the only psychiatrist who's
ever been attacked by a patient.

132
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,843
I hesitated to even bring up
the subject

133
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:20,585
of an obsessive patient because
of your traumatic experience.

134
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:24,656
Hannibal...

135
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:28,193
I'm your psychiatrist;
you're not mine.

136
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,103
Played him
like a fiddle.

137
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:38,672
Along with rosin powder,

138
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,699
we found sodium carbonate,
sulfur dioxide, lye,

139
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:42,958
and olive oil in the wounds.

140
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,832
What is the deal with
the olive oil?

141
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,181
- Sure wasn't making salad.
- He removed anything

142
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:50,431
non-muscular or fatty
from around the vocal folds.

143
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:54,056
The chords themselves were treated
with a sulfur dioxide solution.

144
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:57,927
The sulfur dioxide had the effect
of hardening the vocal chords.

145
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,263
Made them easier to play.

146
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,569
Had to open you up to get
a decent sound out of you.

147
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:13,078
You pick it up and can't play
it, he'll put you down and play you.

148
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:16,716
He took the time to whiten
the vocal chords before playing them.

149
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:20,386
It's not about whitening them; It was
about, um, increasing elasticity.

150
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:24,157
He treated the vocal chords the
same way you treat catgut string.

151
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:27,327
Yes, I played the violin.

152
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,968
This takes a steady hand.

153
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:36,038
A confidence.

154
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:38,240
He's killed before.

155
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:41,744
- Like this?
- No, not like this.

156
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,415
This is a skilled musician

157
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,917
trying a new instrument.

158
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:59,398
Among the first musical
instruments were flutes

159
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,500
carved from human bone.

160
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:04,904
This murder was

161
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:07,908
a performance.

162
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:10,478
Every life is a piece of music.

163
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:14,149
Like music, we are finite
events, unique arrangements,

164
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:17,052
sometimes harmonious,
sometimes dissonant.

165
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,022
Sometimes
not worth hearing again.

166
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,326
- He's a poet and a psychopath.
- And a craftsman.

167
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:26,063
He was shrinking and tanning
the vocal chords.

168
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:29,900
Like turning iron wire
into musical steel string.

169
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:32,237
Was there olive oil?

170
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,308
- Yes.
- Whatever sound

171
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,944
he was trying to produce,
it was an authentic one.

172
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:43,383
Olive oil hasn't been used in the
production of catgut for over a century.

173
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,586
It was said to increase
the life of the strings

174
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:49,756
and create a sweeter,
more melodic sound.

175
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:52,126
No, I hear what
he was playing

176
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:54,095
behind my eyes
when I close them.

177
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:57,933
What do you see
behind closed eyes?

178
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:06,276
Um... I see myself.

179
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:09,013
You said the killer was
performing.

180
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,149
- Who was he performing for?
- I don't know. Um...

181
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:15,520
Patron of the arts?
A fellow musician? Or...

182
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,021
Another killer?

183
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:20,458
It's a serenade.

184
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,497
No, this isn't how he kills. Normally,
he doesn't kill for an audience.

185
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,684
And you believe he risked
getting caught for a serenade?

186
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:30,804
I believe...

187
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:33,974
he wants to show someone
how well he plays.

188
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,278
<i>Do you remember</i>

189
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,781
when I said Tobias was saying
very dark things?

190
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,618
- I made note of it.
- Well, he said that he wanted

191
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:48,024
to cut someone's throat
and play it like a violin.

192
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:50,492
They found somebody
whose throat was cut

193
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,628
and played like a violin.

194
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,071
So you think Tobias killed
that man at the symphony?

195
00:14:57,191 --> 00:14:58,617
I don't know.

196
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,839
I-I...

197
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,643
If I do, do I have
to report it?

198
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,579
Do you have a reason not to?

199
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,214
What if I'm wrong?

200
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:11,251
What if you're right?

201
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:13,052
I'm always wrong.

202
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,624
I don't know. Why would he say
something like that to me?

203
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:20,461
Why do you think?

204
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,767
'Cause he knows I'd tell you.

205
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:03,277
You're Franklyn's therapist,
Dr. Lecter.

206
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,246
- Nice to see you again.
- Is it Tobias?

207
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,748
Yes.

208
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,750
Your strings are all gut.

209
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:11,753
I also carry steel and polymer
strings, if you prefer.

210
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,355
I prefer gut.

211
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:17,660
Harps strung with gut still make
music after 2,000 years.

212
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,029
I didn't

213
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:23,100
- hear you ring the bell.
- I didn't want you to stop playing.

214
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:27,104
- Was it an original composition?
- Something I've been writing.

215
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:29,573
- You compose?
- I discover.

216
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,110
Can't impose
traditional composition

217
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:34,579
on an instrument
that's inherently free form.

218
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:37,049
What instrument
would that be?

219
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:39,218
The Theremin.

220
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,820
It can generate any pitch
throughout its range...

221
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:44,224
Even those
between conventional notes.

222
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,725
And so can a violin,

223
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:48,561
or a trombone.

224
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:52,266
It seems we are both comfortable
playing between conventional notes.

225
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,803
I hear the symphony's

226
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:57,171
looking for a new trombonist.

227
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:59,608
Altogether horrible
what happened.

228
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,276
Not altogether.

229
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,779
It's an unfortunate way
to leave the symphony, yes,

230
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,782
but I can't help thinking
the orchestra will be better

231
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,653
-for it.
- At least the brass section.

232
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:14,058
What brings you here
looking for gut?

233
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:17,929
My harpsichord needs new strings.
It's making an awful noise.

234
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:20,032
Perhaps you could help.

235
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,644
What kind of animal was it?

236
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:25,681
It might've been a raccoon.

237
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:27,850
Might've been?

238
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:30,820
Well, by the time
I knocked a hole in the chimney,

239
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:33,224
it climbed out the top.

240
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,995
Well, at least it got out.

241
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,869
What are you doing out?

242
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:47,706
I thought I'd come over,
make some noise,

243
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:50,576
shoo away any predators
at your door.

244
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,779
It looks like you're making
plenty of noise all by yourself.

245
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:02,557
You avoided being in a room
alone with me essentially

246
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,126
since I met you.

247
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,961
You were smooth about it.

248
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:10,266
- Evidently not smooth enough.
- And now you're making

249
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,001
house calls?

250
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,906
Just a drive-by
on my way home.

251
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:19,809
Since you're not my patient.

252
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,311
No.

253
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,347
I'm not.

254
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:43,103
I’m confused.

255
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:46,874
You have to stop thinking
so much.

256
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:53,182
I can stop the thinking
if we're not...

257
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,885
- But if we're...
- Intimate.

258
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,626
The way that I am
in relationships...

259
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:05,396
Not that this is a relationship;
it's just a kiss.

260
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,466
A great kiss.

261
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,969
But I...

262
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,206
the way that I am isn't

263
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:17,577
- compatible with the way that...
- The way I am.

264
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,983
I wouldn't be good for you.

265
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:28,088
You wouldn't be good for me,
and I wouldn't be able

266
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:30,758
to stop analyzing,
because I have this

267
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:33,894
professional curiosity
about you and...

268
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,973
I am not your patient.

269
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,211
If I were

270
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,582
my patient, my advice to me...

271
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,985
don't do this.

272
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:58,223
I have to follow my own advice.

273
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,936
I'm gonna go ahead
and go now.

274
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,037
Goodnight, Will.

275
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:28,724
More wine?

276
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:34,531
A late harvest Vidal
from Linden.

277
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,568
Oh, Virginia.
I thought it was French.

278
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:40,070
The Virginia wine revolution
is upon us.

279
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,275
I apologize for being
so blunt, Tobias,

280
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,345
but I have to ask.

281
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:50,149
Did you kill that trombonist?

282
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,585
Do you really have to ask?

283
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:55,956
No. Just changing the subject.

284
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,959
Franklyn gave you my message.

285
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,596
The murder is being
investigated by the FBI.

286
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:04,633
They're going to find you.

287
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,968
Let them.

288
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,971
You want to get caught?

289
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,140
I want them to try.

290
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,142
They may investigate me

291
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,812
because I own a string shop.

292
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,148
They'll send men
to investigate,

293
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:20,150
and I'll kill them.

294
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,519
Then I'll find Franklyn
and kill him.

295
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:25,022
Then I would disappear.

296
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,028
- Don't kill Franklyn.
- I've been looking forward to it.

297
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,863
Actually...

298
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:37,704
- I was going to kill you.
- Of course you were.

299
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,339
I'm lean.

300
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,508
Lean animals yield
the toughest gut.

301
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,645
What stopped you
from wanting to kill me?

302
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,515
Or have you stopped?

303
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,854
I stopped after I followed you
one night. Out of town.

304
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,856
To a lonely road.

305
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:55,958
To a bus yard.

306
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,936
You're reckless, Tobias.

307
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:10,975
I'm not going to tell anyone
what I saw you do and do well.

308
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:14,881
So my recklessness doesn't
concern you.

309
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,949
It concerns me

310
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:20,185
because you won't be drawing
attention just to yourself.

311
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:32,333
I could use a friend.

312
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:34,737
Someone who can
understand me.

313
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:38,340
Who thinks like I do and can see
the world and the people in it

314
00:23:38,408 --> 00:23:40,342
the way I do.

315
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,578
I know exactly how you feel.

316
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:45,582
But I don't want
to be your friend.

317
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,053
Then why did you invite me
here for dinner?

318
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,356
Wasn't just to restring
your harpsichord.

319
00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:54,692
I was going to kill you.

320
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,596
I didn't poison you, Tobias.

321
00:23:57,664 --> 00:24:00,065
I wouldn't do that to the food.

322
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,808
Expecting someone?

323
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:11,078
No.

324
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:24,926
Well, I kissed Alana Bloom.

325
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, come in.

326
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,135
You have a guest?

327
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:35,373
A colleague.
You just missed him.

328
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,074
Didn't finish his dinner.

329
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,244
An urgent call of some sort.
He had to leave suddenly.

330
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,846
This benefits you,

331
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,249
because I have dessert for two.

332
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,222
Tell me,

333
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,457
what was Alana's reaction?

334
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:54,595
She said she wouldn't be good
for me,

335
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:57,764
and I wouldn't be good for her.

336
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:00,068
I don't disagree.

337
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:03,339
She would feel an obligation to her
field of study to observe you,

338
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:05,508
and you would resent her for it.

339
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,577
- I know.
- Wondering then

340
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:10,313
why you kissed her,
and felt compelled

341
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:12,882
to drive an hour in the snow
to tell me about it.

342
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,653
Well, I wanted to kiss her
since I met her. She's very kissable.

343
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,657
You waited a long time,

344
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:22,294
which suggests you were
kissing her for a reason,

345
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:24,296
in addition to wanting to.

346
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:27,867
I heard an animal
trapped in my chimney.

347
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:29,568
Um...

348
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:33,373
Broke through the wall
to get it out.

349
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,809
Didn't find anything inside.

350
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:40,348
Alana showed up,
she looked at me...

351
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,952
I... maybe her face changed.

352
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,121
I don't know.

353
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,390
But, um, she knew.

354
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,230
What did she know, Will?

355
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:57,468
There was no animal
in the chimney.

356
00:25:57,535 --> 00:25:59,604
It was only in my head.

357
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,839
I sleepwalk.

358
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:05,543
I get headaches.

359
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:07,645
I am hearing things.

360
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,051
I feel unstable.

361
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,188
That's why you kissed her.

362
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,189
A clutch for balance.

363
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:23,264
You said yourself
what you do is not good for you.

364
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,833
Well, unfortunately,
I am good for it.

365
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,438
Are you still hearing
this killer's serenade

366
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,273
behind your eyes?

367
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,475
Well, it's our song.

368
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:53,898
I hesitate telling you this, as it
borders on a violation of doctor-patient

369
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:56,001
confidentiality.

370
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:02,176
A patient told me today
he suspects a friend of his may

371
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:04,610
be involved with the murder
at the symphony.

372
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:08,915
Right, um...

373
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:14,690
Um... what did he say
about his friend?

374
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,077
He owns a music store
in Baltimore,

375
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:20,329
specializing
in string instruments.

376
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:22,864
Perhaps
you should interview him.

377
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,436
Yeah.

378
00:27:30,455 --> 00:27:34,359
For the first time in a long while,
I see a possibility of friendship.

379
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,494
Is there someone new
in your life?

380
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,895
I met a man much like myself.

381
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:42,435
Same hobbies, same worldviews,

382
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:45,805
but I'm not interested in being his friend.
I'm curious about him,

383
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,308
and that got me curious
about friendship.

384
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,645
Whose friendship
are you considering?

385
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,549
Oddly enough, a colleague
and a patient,

386
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:57,386
not unlike how I'm a colleague
and a patient of yours.

387
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,321
We've discussed him before.

388
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,356
- Will Graham.
- He's nothing like me.

389
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:04,960
We see the world
in different ways,

390
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,964
yet he can
assume my point of view.

391
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:11,803
By profiling
the criminally insane.

392
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,739
As good a demonstration as any.

393
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:17,542
I find it reassuring.

394
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:20,612
It's nice
when someone sees us, Hannibal.

395
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,683
Or has the ability to see us.

396
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:27,253
It requires trust.

397
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:31,091
Trust is difficult for you.

398
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,559
You've helped me
to better understand what I want

399
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:36,429
in a friendship,
and what I don't.

400
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:39,267
Someone worthy
of your friendship.

401
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,702
- Yes.
- You spend

402
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,606
a lot of time
building walls, Hannibal.

403
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:46,775
It's natural to want to see

404
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:50,753
if someone is clever enough
to climb over them.

405
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:56,652
<i>JSB's Suite No.1.</i>

406
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,689
Okay.

407
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:01,926
Special agent Will Graham
with the FBI.

408
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:05,010
- Are you the owner?
- Yes. Tobias Budge.

409
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,299
I'm just showing one of my students out.
Can I have a moment?

410
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,535
Adagio.

411
00:29:10,603 --> 00:29:12,705
For Saturday.

412
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:18,177
What can I help you with?

413
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:21,415
We're investigating the death
of Douglas Wilson. He was...

414
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,916
The trombonist.

415
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:24,918
That's right.
Did you know him?

416
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:26,220
I was aware of him.

417
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:28,823
Baltimore is a small town,

418
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:32,928
and the cultural arts community
is an even smaller one.

419
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:35,297
Well, that's why
we're here, Mr. Budge.

420
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:37,767
I hear someone cut his throat
and tried to play it with a bow.

421
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,604
Why do you say "try"?

422
00:29:41,672 --> 00:29:44,374
The strings have to be treated.

423
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:47,011
You can't just
open somebody up and draw a bow

424
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,447
across their innards
and expect to produce a sound.

425
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:56,388
The vocal chords were chemically treated, uh,
similar to how catgut string is treated.

426
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,859
We kept those details
out of the press.

427
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:02,996
Looking for someone who knows
how to manufacture gut strings?

428
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:04,999
Anybody leap to mind?

429
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,034
Mine are imported from Italy.

430
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:09,037
Best catgut is.

431
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,038
The string section
of the Baltimore Metropolitan

432
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,275
Orchestra refuses
to play anything else.

433
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,776
More authentic.

434
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:17,612
A richer, darker sound.

435
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:21,017
Allows music
to say what words can't.

436
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:29,793
Something wrong?

437
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:33,131
Didn't you hear that?

438
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:37,003
I didn't hear anything.

439
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,205
Excuse me a minute.

440
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,608
Sorry about that.

441
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,152
Officers?

442
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:23,656
Officers?

443
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,710
I need ERT at Chordophone
Strings, downtown Baltimore.

444
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,092
Officer down.

445
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:09,012
Nine.

446
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Nine times.

447
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:14,151
I can count on two hands
the number of times I've been

448
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,787
dumped by a psychiatrist.
I'm sorry, Franklyn,

449
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,458
but I think you should
see another doctor.

450
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,593
- You're giving me a referral?
- Yes, I am.

451
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:24,397
- You were a referral!
- I am also a part of the problem.

452
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:26,831
You focus too much

453
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:30,236
on your therapist,
and not enough on your therapy.

454
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:34,007
You lost respect for me
because I wouldn't

455
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:37,779
- report Tobias, didn't you?
- Report Tobias for what?

456
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,417
Tobias.

457
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:44,686
I came to say goodbye,
Franklyn.

458
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:47,089
What do you mean, goodbye?

459
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:49,091
Oh, my God.

460
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,429
Oh, my God, is that your blood?
I just killed two men.

461
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:55,966
The police came to question me
about the murder.

462
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:02,873
Ok... you have

463
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:04,976
to give yourself up right now.

464
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:08,347
This plane is going down.

465
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:10,883
Let it have
a controlled descent.

466
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,052
We can get you back up
in the air again.

467
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,322
There's rehabilitation
for everyone.

468
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:17,791
Franklyn, I want you
to leave now.

469
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:20,795
Stay right where you are,
Franklyn.

470
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:25,066
You've done

471
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:27,336
a horrible thing,

472
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:30,872
and... I know...

473
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,409
that you wish to God
that you didn't.

474
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:35,911
But you did.

475
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:38,614
And there's nothing you can do
to change that.

476
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:42,853
Only thing you can change is
your future.

477
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,621
Right?

478
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,893
No? You're probably scared.

479
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,062
You probably feel

480
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:54,198
- like you're all alone.
- I'm not alone.

481
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:57,703
That's right.
You're not alone. Nothing has

482
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:00,806
happened in our relationship that
you and I can't...

483
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:13,547
I was looking forward to that.

484
00:36:13,614 --> 00:36:16,517
I saved you the trouble.

485
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,905
Ah!

486
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:13,884
Ah!

487
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:42,216
Ahhh!

488
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:05,012
I was worried you were dead.

489
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,084
Tobias Budge

490
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:13,855
killed two
Baltimore police officers,

491
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:15,891
nearly killed
an FBI special agent,

492
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:19,061
and after all of that,
his first stop

493
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:21,330
is here, at your office.

494
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:24,601
He came to kill my patient.

495
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:29,106
Your patient. Is that
who Budge was serenading?

496
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:32,075
I don't know.

497
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:34,512
Franklyn knew more

498
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,181
than he was telling me.
He told Mr. Budge

499
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,351
that he didn't have
to kill anymore.

500
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:45,090
And then he broke Franklyn's
neck, and then he attacked me.

501
00:39:45,158 --> 00:39:47,260
You killed him?

502
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,663
Yeah.

503
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:53,834
Could Franklyn have been
involved

504
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:56,704
in whatever Budge was doing?

505
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:01,209
I thought this was a simple
matter of poor choice in friends.

506
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:03,645
This doesn't feel simple to me.

507
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:17,928
I feel like I've...

508
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:20,198
dragged you into my world.

509
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:22,000
I got here on my own.

510
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:25,938
But I appreciate the company.

511
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,021
I'm going to start
seeing patients again.

512
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:48,197
It's strange, thinking about
going back to daily practice.

513
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:51,266
Well, it's good
you stepped away.

514
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:54,170
Even if it was
only for a few days.

515
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:57,875
Patients will sit
where Franklyn died.

516
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:03,314
I will sit where I almost died,
and I will offer therapy.

517
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:08,686
It's easy to understand
why you retired after you were

518
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:10,389
attacked.

519
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:15,628
Will you ever feel comfortable
returning to psychiatric work?

520
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:19,565
This is psychiatric work.

521
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:22,302
One patient isn't a practice.

522
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,775
I can't help

523
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:31,447
feeling responsible
for what happened to Franklyn.

524
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:36,085
Every person has an intrinsic responsibility
for their own life, Hannibal.

525
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,925
No one else can take on
that responsibility.

526
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:44,027
Not even you.

527
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,802
Did you take responsibility

528
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,939
when you were attacked
by your patient?

529
00:41:56,008 --> 00:41:58,310
Yes.

530
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:02,582
But I don't take
responsibility for his death.

531
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,825
Nor should you.

532
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:22,676
