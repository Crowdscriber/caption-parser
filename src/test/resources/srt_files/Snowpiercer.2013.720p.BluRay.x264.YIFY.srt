1
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,071
Snowpiercer.

2
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:35,172
Good day.

3
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:38,675
On this day, July 1st 2014...

4
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:41,011
at this hour, 0600...

5
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,764
we are at the very first
airport in the world...

6
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:47,267
topic of so much controversy
over the past 7 years...

7
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,478
has continued development.

8
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:54,441
Protests from environmental groups and a
number of developing countries continue.

9
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:00,614
It had been claimed The CW7 is
the answer to global warming.

10
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,449
And we are witnesses.

11
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:06,537
Leaders who argue that global
warming can no longer be ignored.

12
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:11,041
Today, 79 countries will
begin dispersing CW7...

13
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,961
in the upper layers
of the atmosphere.

14
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:20,509
And surprisingly bring down the average
global temperature to the finest levels.

15
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,220
It is just a day away that...

16
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,181
According to scientists...

17
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,351
the artificial cooling
substance CW7...

18
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:33,939
will succeed in bringing average global
temperature down to manageable level.

19
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:38,068
As a revolutionary solution to
mankind's warming of the planet.

20
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:02,069
Bed check.

21
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:10,160
Alright, get in line.

22
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:12,076
Everybody sit down.

23
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:19,509
One, two, three...
four, five, six...

24
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:20,629
Keep going.

25
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,631
Go on.

26
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,833
Hey you, sit down.

27
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:32,933
Curtis, sit down.

28
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,582
Sit down.

29
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,560
I said sit down!

30
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,076
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

31
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:48,371
Can't you sit and count? You
want to get shot? You're crazy.

32
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,200
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

33
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,538
Are there any experienced
violinist here?

34
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:55,998
Raise your hands.

35
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,833
Violinist!

36
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,835
Stand up, come forward.

37
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:01,503
Food, come and get it.

38
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,256
Violinist, they're
having a laugh.

39
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:07,154
Those bastards in the front
sections think they own us.

40
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,890
Eating their steak dinner and
listening to string quarter.

41
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,161
Will be different
when we get there.

42
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,268
I want steak.

43
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,761
Excuse me, sir.

44
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,070
My wife and I played violin in
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

45
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,614
I was first chair.

46
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,324
Can you still play?

47
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:31,992
Of course, you never forget.

48
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,619
Show me your hands.

49
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:38,582
You, follow me.

50
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,084
Leave your belongings,
we just need your hands.

51
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:42,612
Both?

52
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,713
Yes, both hands.

53
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:48,634
My wife Doris plays beautifully.
Better than me, even.

54
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,636
They just need one person.

55
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,013
Then I won't go.

56
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,266
Doris, Doris...

57
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,206
Sit down, everyone.

58
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:03,690
Sit down.

59
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,662
- They can't just...
- Sit down.

60
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,195
Those fucking bastards.

61
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,696
Now isn't the time.

62
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,198
When is the time?

63
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:12,824
Soon.

64
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,121
Doris.

65
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,454
I'll be back, Doris.
It's alright.

66
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,083
I'll come back.

67
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,643
What does steak
taste like again?

68
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:41,770
I had it once, but
I can't remember.

69
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,934
If you can't remember then
it's better to forget.

70
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:47,109
What does it smell
like when it's cooked?

71
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,111
It must emanate
around the place.

72
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:50,445
Curtis.

73
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,160
It's not it.

74
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,651
Sorry.

75
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,951
Curtis, here!

76
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:01,706
Timbo!

77
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,834
How's it hanging, buddy?

78
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:05,713
Give me a pow.

79
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:09,715
Listen.

80
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,140
I think I need that
protein block.

81
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,819
How about I trade you,
this one for that one?

82
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:18,974
No.

83
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:22,442
Nice bargaining power, Curtis. Here,
give me this one, I'll give you that...

84
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:25,230
Relax, relax...
Come here, Timmy.

85
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:27,941
Come right...

86
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,611
I have an idea.

87
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,398
I'll give you this one and
that one for that one.

88
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:39,097
- What do you say?
- No.

89
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,163
Go get him.

90
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,813
Timmy!

91
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:50,422
Timothy, your mom is gonna
give you a damn good spanking.

92
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:51,882
Where the fuck he went?

93
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:55,433
Hey, come here. Give it to me.

94
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,371
Hi Jose, how are you doing?

95
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,657
Timmy! Work with me here.

96
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:03,411
Edgar, why did you let
him get up there?

97
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,717
No I didn't, he got up there
by himself. He's very nimble.

98
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,095
- He's 5.
- He's a very nimble 5 year old.

99
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:10,685
Timmy, sweety come down.

100
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:14,738
Come here.

101
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,782
What do you want for it?

102
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,831
In the whole wide train?

103
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,715
In the whole wide train.

104
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,078
The ball.

105
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,017
The ball? No.

106
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,508
No, I'm sorry I can't do that.
I can't do that.

107
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:30,337
Yes, I get the ball
for a whole hour.

108
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,583
Done.

109
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,832
Curtis. Is it time?

110
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:45,093
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

111
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,791
Red paper?

112
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,336
Yeah, it's the one we've
been waiting for.

113
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,880
Our informant gave us a name.

114
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:19,192
N, A, M...

115
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,138
Nam Koong Min Soo.

116
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:25,738
He's a security expert. He's
in the prison section now.

117
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,535
Wait, you're joking right?
He's in prison?

118
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,235
Out of here.

119
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:30,394
I'm just saying, what kind
of chance do we have...

120
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,457
Edgar.

121
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:35,502
I just think if this guy says that
he's such a great security expert...

122
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,858
- why can't he just break himself?
- That's enough! Go.

123
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:43,994
Let's go, Tim.

124
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:45,495
Come on, let's go.

125
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,980
Edgar just wants
to help, you know.

126
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,504
He thinks the world of you.

127
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,426
He shouldn't worship me the way he
does. I'm not who he thinks I am.

128
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:03,247
Few of us ever are.

129
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,515
Alright, we're here.

130
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,192
Tail section, quarantine
section, prison section.

131
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:12,542
Gate, gate, gate.

132
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,609
4 seconds when all three
gates are open at once.

133
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:20,203
We have 4 second to go through
three gates and bust Nam out.

134
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:23,491
That Nam gets us the
rest of the way.

135
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:28,058
Our fate depends on this man.

136
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,501
Yeah.

137
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:36,379
If we can get him to cooperate he can take
us all the way to the front of the train.

138
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,592
Very front section?

139
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,844
Yeah.

140
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,183
From here right through
the front of the train.

141
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,018
Everything in one stroke.

142
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,522
We control the engine,
we control the world.

143
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:56,524
Without that, we have nothing.

144
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:00,284
All past revolutions have failed
because they couldn't take the engine.

145
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,988
What are you saying?

146
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,609
This time we take the engine.

147
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,221
Then what?

148
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,279
We kill them.

149
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,708
Wilford?

150
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,080
You should run the train
now, not Wilford.

151
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:26,721
I am a shadow of
my former shadow.

152
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,518
My day was decades ago.

153
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:34,896
How old is Gilliam?

154
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,190
Shut up, Edgar.

155
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:41,736
I'm not saying that I want that to
happen, that's not what I'm saying.

156
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:46,199
What I mean is he
will die someday.

157
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:51,371
And when that happens, you're
gonna have to take over.

158
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,791
You're gonna have
to run the train.

159
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:57,961
I am not a leader.

160
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:01,881
I don't know.

161
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,677
I think you'd be pretty
good if you ask me.

162
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,189
Edgar.

163
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:22,569
How far back can you remember?

164
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:25,488
I do not know, like what?

165
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,491
Your mother, you remember her?

166
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:35,331
I can remember a face...

167
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,460
every once in a while.

168
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,589
But it's not clear.

169
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:47,433
Stay down, everybody.

170
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:50,151
- Everybody stay in your place.
- Fucking look at me.

171
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,096
Keep down, keep down.

172
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:59,814
- Medical inspection. Just the kids.
- All the kids come with me.

173
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:01,492
It's a medical check up.

174
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,026
You're doing good.

175
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:05,570
Everybody, all the kids.

176
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,198
- All the kids?
- You too - That's right, just come.

177
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,473
Stay back there, ma'am.
Just stay back there.

178
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,412
Alright, one more.

179
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:17,213
Yup, come on.

180
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,417
You need to go.

181
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:23,153
It's just a medical check up.
You just stay back there.

182
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:26,289
Come on, that's right. Come
with the others, okay.

183
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,895
You, go and check.

184
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:24,800
- Don't move.
- Go, Timmy!

185
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:35,926
Timmy!

186
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,094
That's her baby!

187
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:48,689
Andy!

188
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,134
Give me back my son.

189
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,865
Give me my son, you
fucking bitch!

190
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:56,574
Andy!

191
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,145
Let him throw his shoe.

192
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,593
- Timmy!
- Tim!

193
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:42,792
At this altitude, we
need only 7 minutes.

194
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:29,808
7 minutes allotted for
your speech, sir.

195
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:35,989
This is so disappointing.

196
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:44,289
We don't need all that,
we only got 7 minutes.

197
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:54,048
Passengers...

198
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,955
This is not a shoe.

199
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,225
This is disorder.

200
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,976
This is size 10 chaos.

201
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:09,207
This, you see this?
This is death.

202
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:13,651
In this locomotive we call
home, there is one thing...

203
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,946
that between our warm hearts
and the bitter cold...

204
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,067
Clothing? Jeans? No, order.

205
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:25,640
Order is the barrier that holds
back the cold and death.

206
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,958
We must all of us, on
this train of life...

207
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:31,711
remain in our
allotted stations...

208
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,505
we must each of us occupy...

209
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:38,676
our preordained
particulate position.

210
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,393
Would you wear a
shoe on your head?

211
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,690
Of course you wouldn't
wear a shoe on your head.

212
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:51,397
A shoe doesn't
belong in your head.

213
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,394
A shoe belongs on your foot.

214
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:57,117
A hat belongs on your head.

215
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,781
I am a hat, you are a shoe.

216
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,867
I belong on the head,
you belong on the foot.

217
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:05,429
Yes? So it is.

218
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,374
In the beginning, order was
prescribed by your ticket.

219
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:13,211
First bus, economy, and
freeloaders like you.

220
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:18,049
Eternal order is prescribed
by the Sacred Engine.

221
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:20,968
All things flow from
the Sacred Engine.

222
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,887
All things in their place.

223
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,264
All passengers in their section.

224
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:28,017
All water flowing,
all heat rise...

225
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:30,895
pays homage to the
Sacred Engine.

226
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:34,273
In it's own particulate...

227
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,693
preordained position.

228
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,362
So it is.

229
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:43,324
Now, as in the beginning...

230
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,219
I belong to the front.

231
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:50,651
You belong to the tail.

232
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:55,211
When the foot seeks the
place of the head...

233
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,880
a sacred line is crossed.

234
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,216
Know your place.

235
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:02,301
Keep your place.

236
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:04,762
Be a shoe.

237
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:14,272
We have 42 seconds left.

238
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:17,733
So we can go to comment
of Mr. Wilford,

239
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,903
the divine keeper of
the Sacred Engine.

240
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,966
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

241
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,528
Are you there?

242
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:31,851
Are you there, sir?

243
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,712
It's breaking up. Well...

244
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:41,375
Mr. Wilford's a very busy man.

245
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:43,475
So it is.

246
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,279
We're just gonna watch?

247
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,865
- Not now.
- I'm not just gonna fucking sit here.

248
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,192
Nah, alright.

249
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,660
Stop, stop right there.
Sit down.

250
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,615
Put that useless gun down.
Put it away.

251
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,999
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam.

252
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,719
It's a pleasure!

253
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,589
You look healthy.

254
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,696
He's fine.

255
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:20,565
Minister Mason, please deliver
a message to Mr. Wilford.

256
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:22,072
Certainly, what should I say?

257
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:25,329
Tell him he and I need to talk.

258
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:28,406
Well, you can talk to me.

259
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:31,794
Mr. Wilford has no
reason to visit here.

260
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:33,873
Not here.

261
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:35,963
At the front.

262
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:54,396
Nice to hear it.

263
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,350
Your son will be a
hero, I promise.

264
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,271
Or daughter, whatever it is.

265
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,208
I got it.

266
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,296
- Your contribution has been dully noted.
- Thanks.

267
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,323
So sorry to interrupt you
while you're praying.

268
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,286
So sorry.

269
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:16,245
There's your Buddha
back, thanks very much.

270
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:22,274
Move! Move!

271
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:25,743
Stop fooling around.

272
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,284
I've got a better batch.

273
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:58,627
Stronger, fresh, uncut.

274
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:00,537
Want to try some?

275
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,048
How many protein blocks for
10 rocks of uncut Kronol?

276
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:15,410
They don't have bullets.

277
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:17,598
Why do you say that?

278
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,478
You remember what Mason said? She
said, "Put down that useless gun".

279
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:24,649
She meant...

280
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,358
she wouldn't give the
order to shoot me.

281
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:28,963
No.

282
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:32,313
No, I think the guns
are literally useless.

283
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:36,158
They've used up Al their bullets
4 years ago on the last revolt.

284
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,121
Bullets are extinct.

285
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:45,496
If you're wrong, we could be
finish before we even start.

286
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,045
I think we should be patient.

287
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,340
Wait for the next red letter.

288
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:09,114
To the left.

289
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:10,907
And right.

290
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:13,568
Not yet, up. Now left.

291
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:16,669
Good, good.

292
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:23,160
1...2...1...2...
1...2...1...2...

293
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,745
Hello? Andrew.

294
00:24:33,216 --> 00:24:34,576
Andrew!

295
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,435
Wake-up. Rise and shine.

296
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:42,309
When you dream to much of the
sun, you forget the trees.

297
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,432
I believe this is your son.

298
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:51,504
I'm sorry, it's not very good.

299
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,826
It's not my best work,
it's a little dark.

300
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:58,991
If you look very deep into the eyes,
you can see a little bit of hope.

301
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,744
What about my boy? You
got one of Timmy?

302
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:03,589
Yes, Tanya. I do.

303
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:06,791
Easy, easy. Don't
hurt yourself.

304
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:10,124
Here, there you go, Timmy.

305
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:15,937
Look at him.

306
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,678
One little smile.

307
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:31,542
Curtis, you gotta let
me come with you.

308
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,192
No, Tanya, I'm sorry.

309
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:35,361
You will be if you
don't let me come.

310
00:25:35,937 --> 00:25:39,257
I'm going to the front and I'm gonna make
that bitch sorry she put a hand on my boy.

311
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:40,533
Make this one tighter.

312
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:45,120
You know I'm stronger than all
these skinny ass soldiers anyway.

313
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,416
Please.

314
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:54,380
Shit, what's going on?

315
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,340
Change of schedule, boys.
Come to back.

316
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,676
It's now or never.

317
00:25:58,802 --> 00:26:01,215
Don't panic. Stick
with the plan.

318
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,227
Hide that, hide your
weapons in your clothes.

319
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,663
- Head check.
- Yeah.

320
00:26:13,817 --> 00:26:15,124
Line up.

321
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:21,651
Alright, sit down.

322
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:28,385
1...2...3... What
the fuck do we do?

323
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,131
6...Keep going.

324
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:33,335
I've had enough of this
protein block bullshit.

325
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:34,837
Yeah, this is bullshit.

326
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:37,387
- I'm hungry.
- I want chicken.

327
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:39,497
We're not gonna sit
down for this shit.

328
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:44,207
We want chicken! Chicken!

329
00:26:45,557 --> 00:26:47,607
Quiet! Be quiet!

330
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:50,734
Calm down. It's okay.

331
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:52,938
You want him dead? Is that it?

332
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:54,440
Keep quiet.

333
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,577
Still going for it, are we?

334
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:02,693
Come on, let's go! Let's do it.

335
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,872
The rifles.

336
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:11,457
No, we can get them.

337
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,792
We're easily outnumbered
their bullets.

338
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,424
This is it.

339
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:22,468
Curtis, come on.

340
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:25,095
We're out of time,
we gotta do it now.

341
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:41,804
They've got no bullets!
They've got no bullets!

342
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:02,365
Keep going, keep going!

343
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:12,348
Close the gate quick. Shut it.

344
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:02,700
I'm fine, Grey. You go now.

345
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:28,802
Fuck.

346
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:33,319
Nam Koong Min Soo. Kronol addict.
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

347
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,350
- Hurry up, Edgar.
- Hurry up?

348
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,647
So sorry for keeping
you all waiting.

349
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:41,565
Obviously I work here so...

350
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,654
- Open it.
- Here we go.

351
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:04,586
Kronol head...

352
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:10,141
So this is Kronol? I hear it's
pretty big in the front section.

353
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:12,471
Careful, that's how
these guys hallucinate.

354
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:14,723
It's industrial waste.

355
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,903
And it's highly flammable.

356
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:41,254
Are you Nam Koong Min
Soo, security specialist?

357
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:48,048
Did you design all the door locks and
the security systems on the train?

358
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,051
Look at him man, he's gone.
Look at his eyes.

359
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:53,345
He's fried his brain
with that fucking shit.

360
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:55,662
Are you Nam?

361
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,577
Nam, are you listening?

362
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:24,502
Yes, I'm listening, bastard.

363
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:30,549
My name is not "Nem", it is
"Nam". Namgoung Minsoo, shit.

364
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:35,101
Namgoung is my name, my
surname is Minsoo, asshole.

365
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,235
Unknown words.

366
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:40,184
Try again with the
correct vocabulary.

367
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:43,145
We need your help.

368
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:44,730
For what?

369
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:47,649
We're going to the front.

370
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:50,152
And we need you to
open up the gates.

371
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:53,739
If I don't want to?

372
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:57,659
Uncut, straight from the barrel.

373
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:01,580
Every door you open, you
get one lap of Kronol.

374
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:19,692
Jesus, Marlboro Light?

375
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:23,352
I can't believe it.

376
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:26,813
Cigarettes have been extinct
for more than 10 years now.

377
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,992
You want a smoke too, asshole?

378
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:44,523
It's too good for shit like you.

379
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,668
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

380
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,753
You help us, you get your drug.

381
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:52,464
If not, we put you back
where we found you.

382
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:54,341
What'll be, asshole?

383
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:03,308
Chan.

384
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:06,311
Chan, get out of here.
Let's get out.

385
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:31,366
That's enough.

386
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:35,549
I'll put you back in the drawer.

387
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,792
Get up.

388
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:08,647
My daughter, Yona. To move
forward, we need her.

389
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:11,626
So you're coming with us?

390
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:17,877
For each door, I want
two blocks of Kronol.

391
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,316
She's an addict too?

392
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,142
Nobody there.

393
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:52,589
Kronol?

394
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:16,942
Look at all these beds.
Where is everybody?

395
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,944
Looks like they left in a hurry.

396
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,426
There's food on the table.

397
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:29,955
This can't be a window, can it?

398
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:50,120
Still cold.

399
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:02,166
Dead.

400
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:06,428
All dead.

401
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:23,425
Alright, let's go everyone. Stay
focus. We didn't come here for this.

402
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,177
You heard the man, let's go.
Move.

403
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,142
Nehm... Nam!

404
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,101
Kronol!

405
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:35,562
How did you know there
was nobody there?

406
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,562
He's running.

407
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:50,087
Paul?

408
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:52,632
Paul!

409
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:54,521
What is he doing?

410
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:55,854
He looks so different.

411
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,000
Just a second.

412
00:36:57,168 --> 00:37:00,563
It's used to be automatic, but
it's hard when it extinct.

413
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,444
- It's not the Paul I remember.
- No.

414
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:05,425
Paul? It's Curtis!

415
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:08,459
They ain't coming back,
so now I gotta do it.

416
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:11,815
Manually.

417
00:37:13,684 --> 00:37:15,310
So that's how it's made.

418
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:17,508
Still hot.

419
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:19,915
Look at them all.

420
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,691
You do some nice work.

421
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:24,653
That's right man, that's your
food. That's your protein block.

422
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,762
Is this why they took you?
To make this garbage?

423
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,231
Paul?

424
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:33,828
You've been alone
this whole time?

425
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,705
Alone.

426
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,604
In the zone.

427
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:43,592
We're going to the front.
Come with us.

428
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:45,757
Alright, you're going
to the front? Yeah.

429
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:49,469
But no way, my place
is here alright?

430
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:52,474
Here? Making this crap? Why?

431
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:18,353
- You can't draw this.
- Okay.

432
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,048
Oh man.

433
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:26,715
All this time, we've
been eating this shit?

434
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:28,800
I eat them too, you know?

435
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:30,719
Every single day.

436
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:35,348
Where'd you get this?

437
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,810
Have you been the
one writing this?

438
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,271
I don't write them...

439
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:44,107
Why do you have this?
Who gave this to you?

440
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:47,200
They just leave them for me.

441
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,828
I put them in the protein
block, I stamp them on.

442
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:51,948
That's it.

443
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:57,621
The water supply section?

444
00:38:57,788 --> 00:38:59,998
Yes, just a few carts up.

445
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,960
It's where the water's
cleansed and recycled.

446
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,796
It's one of the most crucial
sections in the train.

447
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:10,550
If we take it, we'll
have the upperhand?

448
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:13,345
We don't even have to
go to the very front.

449
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,805
We control the water...

450
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:18,433
we control the negotiation.

451
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:27,324
Excuse me, sorry to
bother you there, could I

452
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:29,648
get you a glass of water
to speed this up?

453
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:35,992
Would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all waiting.

454
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:38,370
Is it my fault?

455
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:39,764
You, you are.

456
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:42,832
Although you've been fucking
smelling that thing that...

457
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,489
time is a probably a distant
concept for you, isn't it?

458
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:50,924
Of course, I do it
for the Kronol.

459
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:53,927
Here we go again. Kronol
this, Kronol that...

460
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:57,055
Christ almighty man,
do some fucking work.

461
00:39:57,348 --> 00:39:59,659
You're the one who's
giving me this.

462
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:03,319
Are you thick? That's what you asked
for each time you opened the gate.

463
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:12,706
Yona? It's Yona right?

464
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,298
How old are you?

465
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,161
17.

466
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:23,206
17, you're a train baby then?

467
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:26,923
How about you?

468
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:30,422
17 years on earth.

469
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,550
17 years in the tail section.

470
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:35,348
Earth?

471
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:37,637
What was it like?

472
00:40:38,264 --> 00:40:39,514
I don't remember.

473
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:41,341
Why?

474
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:45,704
I don't want to remember
anything before I met Gilliam.

475
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:51,234
Yona.

476
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,154
Are you clairvoyant?

477
00:40:54,864 --> 00:40:57,490
Clairvoyant? What's that?

478
00:40:57,783 --> 00:41:01,411
You always seem to know
what's behind the gates.

479
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:03,788
Do you see things in your mind?

480
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:21,306
Don't open it.

481
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:23,183
What?

482
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,031
Stop!

483
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:07,375
Be careful.

484
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:11,486
You too.

485
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:40,802
Team 2, move.

486
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:42,308
Move forward!

487
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:47,193
We're passing Yekaterina bridge!

488
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:53,834
We're at the bridge, guys!

489
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:56,935
10...9...8...7...

490
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:03,087
5...4...3...2...1.

491
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:07,635
Happy new year!

492
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:10,142
Happy new year!

493
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:12,997
I hate getting old, I hate it.

494
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:22,821
Everybody down!

495
00:46:22,941 --> 00:46:24,353
Hang on.

496
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,918
Impact!

497
00:46:39,638 --> 00:46:42,793
Not yet. A second one.

498
00:46:43,545 --> 00:46:45,766
Stay down.

499
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:02,945
Nam, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

500
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:05,243
He's high as a fucking kite.

501
00:47:11,657 --> 00:47:13,223
We're getting closer.

502
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,107
Safe passage.

503
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,839
One, two. One, two.

504
00:48:11,592 --> 00:48:16,110
Happy Yekaterina bridge,
you filthy ingrates.

505
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:21,809
You people, who if not for
the benevolent Wilford...

506
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:26,144
would have frozen solid
18 years ago today...

507
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:29,323
You people...

508
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:33,613
who would suck up the generous
titties of Wilford ever since...

509
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,865
for food and shelter.

510
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:38,075
And now,

511
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:44,342
in front of our hallowed water
supplies section no less...

512
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:47,350
you repay his kindness...

513
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:50,306
with violent hooliganism.

514
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,858
You scum.

515
00:48:59,431 --> 00:49:02,308
Precisely 74% of you shall die.

516
00:49:08,732 --> 00:49:13,361
My friend, you suffer from a
misplaced optimism of the doom.

517
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:16,084
This is going to be good.

518
00:49:25,374 --> 00:49:26,958
What? What did he say?

519
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:29,360
He said you guys are fucked.

520
00:49:31,213 --> 00:49:33,446
You should beat
those sectioners.

521
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,475
There's a tunnel right
after Yekaterina...

522
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:39,679
A tunnel?

523
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:41,222
A fucking long one.

524
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,273
What are you doing? Run.

525
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:49,076
Everybody down!

526
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:51,246
Go, go, go!

527
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,339
Chan, get out, get out.

528
00:51:08,894 --> 00:51:11,568
Chan! We need fire!

529
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,830
Chan, bring the fire.

530
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,068
Throw them in the back, we're
gonna get the lights here.

531
00:51:17,235 --> 00:51:19,134
Chan, the matches.

532
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:51,582
We will crush you,
motherfuckers!

533
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:54,814
Officer Fuyu!

534
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:59,622
What are you doing? Don't
look at me. Get them.

535
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:14,940
Put me down, stop
squeezing my leg.

536
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:35,299
Surrender! Surrender!

537
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:40,322
Surrender, he'll kill me
if we don't surrender.

538
00:52:43,196 --> 00:52:44,550
Sure.

539
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:12,675
Curtis!

540
00:54:02,817 --> 00:54:04,747
Stop!

541
00:54:05,237 --> 00:54:08,453
Stop everybody!

542
00:54:08,573 --> 00:54:10,485
Drop your weapons!

543
00:54:14,412 --> 00:54:15,669
Stop!

544
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:17,458
Everybody stop!

545
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:27,069
Do what he says, for
crying out loud.

546
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,464
Drop your weapons!

547
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:33,019
Don't look.

548
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:15,115
Survivors.

549
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:18,803
Wash yourselves.

550
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,540
The water supplies section...

551
00:56:26,628 --> 00:56:28,379
Wash away the blood.

552
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,242
Have you seen these kids?

553
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:02,241
I don't know anything about...

554
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:08,800
Where are they, you bitch?

555
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,094
I don't know, it's not me.

556
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:17,720
Tell us or we'll cut
your arm you bastard.

557
00:57:17,887 --> 00:57:20,023
Wilford knows.

558
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:24,059
Wilford likes kids.

559
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:25,829
He does.

560
00:57:25,854 --> 00:57:29,648
That's why he sent that yellow
worm cloth to get them for him.

561
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:32,122
It's Wilford you want, not me!

562
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,486
Wilford likes kids?

563
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,685
All he cares about is
his ratchet engine.

564
00:57:37,805 --> 00:57:39,908
The engine is sacred.

565
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:42,536
And Wilford is divine.

566
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:45,414
Wilford is merciful.

567
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:49,626
Call him.

568
00:57:50,962 --> 00:57:52,671
See if he'll come save you.

569
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:54,006
Yes.

570
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,551
Wilford the merciful.

571
00:57:57,719 --> 00:57:58,719
Call him.

572
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:03,480
He won't come here, he
won't leave his engine.

573
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,594
We're gonna rip you into little
pieces, he still won't come?

574
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:14,860
When we control the water and turn
that off, he'll have to come.

575
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:16,904
Turn off the water?

576
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:21,200
You'll only be condemning
your own people.

577
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:23,952
The water come from the front.

578
00:58:24,496 --> 00:58:29,114
The nose of the train, it breaks up the
snow and ice and turns it into water.

579
00:58:29,234 --> 00:58:31,463
Like an elephant's trunk.

580
00:58:31,878 --> 00:58:33,629
The water comes in the mouth.

581
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:36,378
Not in the bum, Curtis.

582
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:41,470
Yes, Wilford knows you
well, Mr Curtis Everett.

583
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:43,305
He's been watching you.

584
00:58:44,474 --> 00:58:47,233
And we know you won't
harm your own people.

585
00:58:48,645 --> 00:58:53,154
Too bad you couldn't save your second
in command, what was his name? Edgar?

586
00:58:53,274 --> 00:58:54,468
Shut the fuck up!

587
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:56,157
Mr Curtis, I can help you.

588
00:58:56,277 --> 00:58:58,195
You can fucking die,
is what you can do.

589
00:58:58,363 --> 00:59:00,572
No, I can help you. I swear it.

590
00:59:00,782 --> 00:59:02,372
Listen to me.

591
00:59:02,492 --> 00:59:05,166
Wilford won't come here.
He's not coming.

592
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:06,954
You've got to go to him.

593
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:08,789
And I can take you.

594
00:59:08,957 --> 00:59:12,173
I know the train, I can
guarantee you safe passage.

595
00:59:12,293 --> 00:59:14,211
Why the fuck would I trust you?

596
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:18,423
Because I want to live.

597
00:59:20,176 --> 00:59:22,553
So you'd sell out
Wilford the Benevolent?

598
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,905
If I take you to the front...

599
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:28,431
you have to kill him.

600
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:30,424
I'll get you close enough.

601
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,897
You kill him and let me live.

602
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:42,364
Curtis?

603
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:53,500
You still determined
to push ahead?

604
00:59:54,586 --> 00:59:55,794
Of course.

605
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,215
We're not even half way.

606
01:00:00,675 --> 01:00:03,825
You already go further
than anyone else.

607
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:08,768
Rather than McGregor,
4 years ago.

608
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:14,184
10 cars, 20 cars, it doesn't matter
unless you make it to the engine.

609
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:18,817
They'll just regroup and attack us again.
We gotta pull them up at the routes.

610
01:00:19,694 --> 01:00:22,112
So many have been killed.

611
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:26,106
We've lost so many.

612
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:28,374
I know.

613
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:30,370
You seen our men?

614
01:00:30,997 --> 01:00:32,601
They are exhausted.

615
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:36,126
I told them to
wash themselves...

616
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:39,546
so I can assess the damage.

617
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:02,788
Let me go ahead.

618
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:14,536
I got Mason now, I can
move a lot faster.

619
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:17,668
You stay here with the wounded
and guard the prisoners.

620
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,171
Let me take the Engine, I'll
call for you to lead us.

621
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:24,383
Stop it, Curtis.

622
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:26,835
Why are you doing that?

623
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:33,475
You know very well that
you're already our leader.

624
01:01:35,144 --> 01:01:37,546
You have to accept that.

625
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:46,024
How can I lead if I
have two good arms.

626
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:10,858
It's faded out.

627
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:18,812
Better to have both arms...

628
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,399
You can't do a lot
with one, you know?

629
01:02:23,234 --> 01:02:25,360
Especially when
you hold a woman.

630
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:28,470
Much better to have two
arms, won't you agree?

631
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:40,000
Well you get to the
narrow bridge...

632
01:02:40,918 --> 01:02:43,045
big gate with a W on it.

633
01:02:45,882 --> 01:02:47,549
Wilford's behind that.

634
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:52,262
Don't let Wilford talk.

635
01:02:54,974 --> 01:02:56,516
Cut out his tongue.

636
01:02:59,604 --> 01:03:02,324
Okay, let's all get in there.
Squeeze in.

637
01:03:06,903 --> 01:03:08,576
Perfect, perfect.

638
01:03:08,696 --> 01:03:10,488
The hat becomes you well.

639
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:14,177
Now Grey...

640
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:18,879
You must go with Curtis.

641
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,547
Forgot somebody.

642
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:31,972
Okay.

643
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:41,645
Kronol.

644
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,758
Don't mind me, back to work
everyone. Back to work.

645
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,511
Minister, are you okay?

646
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:15,679
I'm okay.

647
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,805
Please don't eat it...

648
01:04:16,973 --> 01:04:19,474
They're very friendly,
they won't bite.

649
01:04:19,642 --> 01:04:21,852
They might bite a tomato.

650
01:04:26,524 --> 01:04:27,858
You can eat this too?

651
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:31,444
A train baby wouldn't
know about this.

652
01:04:31,612 --> 01:04:33,488
I grew up walking over it.

653
01:04:34,031 --> 01:04:36,491
This is located under the snow.

654
01:04:36,701 --> 01:04:37,701
Of the earth.

655
01:04:38,452 --> 01:04:39,870
What is this?

656
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:41,746
It moves.

657
01:04:42,123 --> 01:04:43,707
Underground.

658
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:46,293
What does this mean?

659
01:05:12,862 --> 01:05:15,071
Do any of you feel like Sushi?

660
01:05:15,364 --> 01:05:17,782
Hell yeah...

661
01:05:18,117 --> 01:05:19,474
Right?

662
01:05:23,664 --> 01:05:25,347
You people are very lucky.

663
01:05:26,209 --> 01:05:28,585
This is only served
twice in a year.

664
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:30,907
In January and July.

665
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:33,381
Why? Not enough fish?

666
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:35,759
Enough is not the criteria.

667
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:37,677
Balance.

668
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:42,015
This aquarium is closed
ecological system.

669
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:45,852
And the number of
individual units...

670
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,231
must be very closely,
precisely controlled.

671
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,325
In order to maintain the
proper sustainable balance.

672
01:06:34,842 --> 01:06:38,071
No, you eat this.

673
01:06:38,906 --> 01:06:40,532
You know what that's made of?

674
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,006
Dig in.

675
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,884
Curtis, my friend, do you
think that we might...

676
01:07:16,004 --> 01:07:18,729
dispense for the restrain
for this next section?

677
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:21,489
I'm not your friend.
And why would I?

678
01:07:21,936 --> 01:07:23,867
For the sake of the young?

679
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:25,639
Education?

680
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:30,040
Quiet!

681
01:07:30,207 --> 01:07:32,125
Good morning, children.

682
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:35,879
I'm pleased to present
guests from tail section.

683
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:39,215
Yes, what do we say to tail
section guests, children?

684
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:43,053
Hello, tail section guests.

685
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,316
Timmy!

686
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,510
Andy!

687
01:07:48,185 --> 01:07:49,534
Andy?

688
01:07:53,189 --> 01:07:54,481
This little boy...

689
01:07:55,149 --> 01:07:56,280
His name is Timmy.

690
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,609
This is my son.

691
01:07:57,943 --> 01:07:59,504
Please take a good
look at the picture.

692
01:07:59,612 --> 01:08:00,451
I saw them.

693
01:08:00,571 --> 01:08:01,962
- When?
- Where?

694
01:08:02,323 --> 01:08:04,574
Came through there,
went through there.

695
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:07,243
Is that all, boy?

696
01:08:07,703 --> 01:08:08,794
Yes.

697
01:08:11,332 --> 01:08:14,784
- Were they crying?
- No, but they looked like they wanted to.

698
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:18,004
I heard Old Tail Sectioners...

699
01:08:18,172 --> 01:08:21,389
were lazy dogs and they
all drink their own shit.

700
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:24,135
No, they're very nice.

701
01:08:24,303 --> 01:08:27,055
Very just and merciful.

702
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:28,390
So it is.

703
01:08:28,557 --> 01:08:32,143
Minister Mason, we were
just about to show a video.

704
01:08:32,311 --> 01:08:33,311
Very good.

705
01:08:36,577 --> 01:08:39,021
Wilford!

706
01:08:40,277 --> 01:08:43,947
From a very young age, Mr. Wilford's
love of locomotive was apparent.

707
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:47,867
When I grow up, I'll
live on a train forever.

708
01:08:47,987 --> 01:08:49,709
Forever!

709
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:51,432
His early dreams
were realized...

710
01:08:51,552 --> 01:08:54,755
when he founded his
transportation empire...

711
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:57,091
the Wilford Industries.

712
01:08:57,211 --> 01:08:59,337
But his greatest dream
was to construct...

713
01:08:59,463 --> 01:09:01,595
a luxury locomotive
cruiseline...

714
01:09:01,715 --> 01:09:05,641
connecting railways of the
entire world into one.

715
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:10,172
A circular railway that
expands for 438,000 km...

716
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:12,940
and completes one
circle every year.

717
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:17,403
In the extreme cold of the Arctic, and the
scorching heat of the African desert...

718
01:09:17,523 --> 01:09:19,983
Wildford's train is
self-sustained...

719
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:22,825
possesses the most
sophisticated design...

720
01:09:22,945 --> 01:09:24,404
advance technology...

721
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:26,531
As hard as it is to believe...

722
01:09:26,699 --> 01:09:29,896
people in the old world
made fun of Mr Wildford.

723
01:09:30,016 --> 01:09:32,287
They criticized him for
overengineering...

724
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:35,463
and overequipping
this wonderful train.

725
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:38,543
But Mr Wilford knew
something they did not.

726
01:09:38,711 --> 01:09:39,770
And what was that?

727
01:09:39,795 --> 01:09:44,090
All world people are frigging morons
who got turned into popsicles.

728
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:45,808
Sort of.

729
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:49,762
Mr. Wilford knew that CW7
would freeze the world.

730
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:53,558
So what did the prophetic
Mr Wilford invented?

731
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:55,810
To protect the chosen
from that calamity?

732
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,985
The Engine!

733
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:00,482
Rumble rumble, rattle rattle...

734
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:03,259
it will never die!

735
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:09,014
What happens if
the engine stops?

736
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:10,998
We'd all freeze and die.

737
01:10:11,118 --> 01:10:13,369
But will it stop, will it stop?

738
01:10:13,496 --> 01:10:14,543
No! No!

739
01:10:14,663 --> 01:10:16,414
Can you tell us why?

740
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:21,092
The Engine is eternal,
the Engine is forever...

741
01:10:21,212 --> 01:10:23,386
Rumble rumble, rattle rattle...

742
01:10:23,506 --> 01:10:25,679
who is the reason why?

743
01:10:25,799 --> 01:10:29,804
Wilford! Yeah!

744
01:10:29,924 --> 01:10:32,649
Wilford Wilford, hip hurray!

745
01:10:33,349 --> 01:10:36,142
I love that one, such a tonic.

746
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,241
It's time children,
come this way.

747
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:41,821
Don't trip now.

748
01:10:41,941 --> 01:10:44,468
Don't push, there's
plenty of room.

749
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:46,819
Who can tell me
what's coming up?

750
01:10:47,029 --> 01:10:49,829
Those of 7.

751
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:53,409
Pay attention, this tableau
will surely on the exam.

752
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:56,412
15 years ago, in the third
year of the train...

753
01:10:56,539 --> 01:10:59,290
7 passengers tried to stop...

754
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:02,377
Wilford's miracle train
and go outside...

755
01:11:02,586 --> 01:11:04,504
and what do we call
this event, Magdalena?

756
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:06,506
The Revolt of the Seven.

757
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:09,133
Very good, long
before you were born.

758
01:11:09,552 --> 01:11:11,344
Of course they failed
to stop the train.

759
01:11:11,512 --> 01:11:14,264
Instead they jumped out
of the running train.

760
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,723
Here they come now.

761
01:11:17,518 --> 01:11:20,777
Look, you see that?

762
01:11:22,273 --> 01:11:23,273
What?

763
01:11:23,774 --> 01:11:26,622
There they are, that's
how far they made it.

764
01:11:31,615 --> 01:11:34,158
You see that woman before?

765
01:11:35,786 --> 01:11:38,663
She was the maid
in the lead car.

766
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:41,708
An Inuit.

767
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:43,835
An Eskimo, actually.

768
01:11:44,587 --> 01:11:47,880
She knew all about
the ice and snow.

769
01:11:48,299 --> 01:11:50,550
She believed she can
survive outside.

770
01:11:50,759 --> 01:11:53,094
If we ever go outside the train?

771
01:11:53,304 --> 01:11:56,312
We'd all freeze and die.

772
01:11:56,432 --> 01:11:58,349
If the engine stops running?

773
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:01,192
We'd all die.

774
01:12:01,312 --> 01:12:04,361
And who takes care of
the Sacred Engine?

775
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:07,195
Mr. Wilford.

776
01:12:08,027 --> 01:12:11,310
Children, it's the new
year eggs from Mr Wilford.

777
01:12:11,822 --> 01:12:13,906
Touch them, they are still warm.

778
01:12:14,074 --> 01:12:16,284
These eggs are boiled
using water...

779
01:12:16,452 --> 01:12:18,942
heated by the Sacred
Engine itself.

780
01:12:19,062 --> 01:12:21,456
As a special treat, we
have playing for us...

781
01:12:21,582 --> 01:12:26,217
the world's renowned first chair violinist
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,

782
01:12:26,337 --> 01:12:28,731
Mr. Gerald Mclnster.

783
01:12:33,135 --> 01:12:34,677
Is that really Gerald?

784
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:36,387
He looks damn great.

785
01:12:37,181 --> 01:12:38,431
Happy new year.

786
01:12:42,895 --> 01:12:44,312
No, thank you.

787
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:53,972
Let's go Curtis.

788
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:02,622
Happy new year.

789
01:13:13,676 --> 01:13:15,940
I thought the chickens
were extinct.

790
01:13:28,211 --> 01:13:31,433
There are actually many things on board
that were rumored to be extinct.

791
01:13:31,553 --> 01:13:32,647
Such as?

792
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:36,714
This.

793
01:13:54,425 --> 01:13:56,347
Andrew! No!

794
01:14:10,107 --> 01:14:12,196
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

795
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:22,827
No.

796
01:14:47,686 --> 01:14:48,686
Curtis.

797
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:51,981
You have to lead us.

798
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,086
Curtis, my friend, we
understand each other...

799
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:09,368
listen to my words,
it wasn't me.

800
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,101
We go forward.

801
01:15:41,114 --> 01:15:42,114
Open!

802
01:15:42,241 --> 01:15:43,241
Quickly!

803
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:35,376
It's Mason.

804
01:16:35,544 --> 01:16:37,310
Shit, check her pulse.

805
01:17:02,179 --> 01:17:04,787
Hey, don't do...

806
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:15,476
That does not look good.

807
01:18:33,036 --> 01:18:34,111
It happened.

808
01:18:48,427 --> 01:18:50,021
You've got the master key right?

809
01:18:53,974 --> 01:18:55,977
Wait, don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

810
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:34,917
You've just killed a front
section passenger...

811
01:19:38,268 --> 01:19:39,954
I didn't see a thing.

812
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:43,272
Where are you going?
Wait a minute!

813
01:19:43,547 --> 01:19:45,645
Could we talk about
it just one second?

814
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:19,887
Son of a bitch!

815
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,042
Close the door.

816
01:22:55,632 --> 01:22:56,632
Tanya.

817
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:05,849
My Timmy.

818
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:09,571
My Timmy...

819
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:30,249
We're gonna find him.

820
01:23:30,559 --> 01:23:31,963
I promise.

821
01:23:34,337 --> 01:23:35,592
I know.

822
01:23:41,553 --> 01:23:43,020
Thank you.

823
01:24:44,449 --> 01:24:45,984
Take this.

824
01:24:55,502 --> 01:24:58,128
Come on, motherfucker.
You got my Kronol.

825
01:24:58,248 --> 01:24:59,931
I want that shit.

826
01:25:01,758 --> 01:25:04,583
I want my Kronol back.

827
01:25:05,203 --> 01:25:07,009
That's my Kronol.

828
01:25:11,896 --> 01:25:14,884
I swear man, I'm gonna kill you.

829
01:27:00,335 --> 01:27:01,460
Opens the door.

830
01:27:05,632 --> 01:27:07,833
Kronol first!

831
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,011
You want Kronol? Here.

832
01:27:11,346 --> 01:27:12,346
Take it.

833
01:27:13,215 --> 01:27:15,432
Open it! Open the gate!

834
01:27:20,063 --> 01:27:22,485
Are you looking for some
trouble or something?

835
01:27:49,384 --> 01:27:52,375
You got a problem
with the gates?

836
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:57,865
Here, smoke a cigarette.

837
01:28:17,328 --> 01:28:19,685
It is a great honor for you.

838
01:28:20,498 --> 01:28:23,882
This is the last
cigarette of humanity.

839
01:28:24,002 --> 01:28:25,875
Go enjoy it.

840
01:28:29,924 --> 01:28:32,133
You've ever been to
the tail section?

841
01:28:35,028 --> 01:28:37,143
Do you have any idea
what went on back there?

842
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:39,096
When we boarded?

843
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,064
It was chaos.

844
01:28:49,569 --> 01:28:51,229
We didn't freeze to death.

845
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:53,614
But we didn't have
time to be thankful.

846
01:28:54,118 --> 01:28:56,867
Wilford's soldiers came
and they took everything.

847
01:28:58,536 --> 01:29:00,704
It was thousand
people in iron box...

848
01:29:00,872 --> 01:29:02,995
no food, no water.

849
01:29:11,591 --> 01:29:14,009
After a month, we ate the weak.

850
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:29,900
You know what I
hate about myself?

851
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:36,659
I know what people taste like.

852
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:44,539
I know that babies taste best.

853
01:29:58,638 --> 01:30:00,234
There was a woman.

854
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:04,351
She was hiding with her baby.

855
01:30:07,188 --> 01:30:09,231
And some men with knives came.

856
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:15,487
They killed her and
took the baby.

857
01:30:19,242 --> 01:30:20,784
And then an old man...

858
01:30:22,745 --> 01:30:24,248
no relations, just...

859
01:30:25,123 --> 01:30:26,456
an old man.

860
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,930
He stepped forward
and he said...

861
01:30:30,503 --> 01:30:31,962
"Give me the knife."

862
01:30:33,589 --> 01:30:36,133
Everyone thought he'd
killed the baby himself...

863
01:30:37,468 --> 01:30:38,927
But he took the knife...

864
01:30:42,056 --> 01:30:43,724
and he cut out his own arm...

865
01:30:46,644 --> 01:30:48,311
and he said, "eat this".

866
01:30:48,431 --> 01:30:50,081
"If you're so hungry..."

867
01:30:52,316 --> 01:30:55,444
"eat this, just leave the baby".

868
01:31:00,575 --> 01:31:02,701
I had never seen
anything like that.

869
01:31:07,206 --> 01:31:09,291
And the men put
down their knives.

870
01:31:14,005 --> 01:31:16,339
You probably guessed
who that old man was.

871
01:31:21,387 --> 01:31:23,180
That baby was Edgar.

872
01:31:28,352 --> 01:31:30,228
And I was the man
with the knife.

873
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:39,946
I killed Edgar's mother.

874
01:31:52,431 --> 01:31:56,425
And then one by one, other people
in the tail section started...

875
01:31:56,917 --> 01:32:00,050
cutting arms and legs
and offering them.

876
01:32:02,011 --> 01:32:03,428
It was like a miracle.

877
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,067
I wanted to...

878
01:32:12,605 --> 01:32:13,954
I tried.

879
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:30,956
A month later, Wilford's soldiers
brought those protein blocks.

880
01:32:31,207 --> 01:32:33,333
We've been eating
that shit ever since.

881
01:32:38,172 --> 01:32:40,382
18 years I hate Wilford.

882
01:32:46,222 --> 01:32:48,765
18 years I've waited
for this moment.

883
01:32:55,064 --> 01:32:56,565
And now I'm here.

884
01:33:12,874 --> 01:33:14,265
Open the gate.

885
01:33:17,545 --> 01:33:18,735
Please.

886
01:33:20,756 --> 01:33:23,133
Your story is so
beautiful, Curtis.

887
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,387
But I don't want
to open the door.

888
01:33:29,593 --> 01:33:31,892
You know what I want?

889
01:33:34,186 --> 01:33:36,062
I want to open a door.

890
01:33:39,609 --> 01:33:41,276
But not this one.

891
01:33:42,862 --> 01:33:44,321
That one.

892
01:33:50,453 --> 01:33:52,917
The one that leads
to the outside.

893
01:33:53,623 --> 01:33:56,875
We've been sentenced
for 18 years.

894
01:33:57,043 --> 01:34:00,003
Everyone thinks it's a wall.

895
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:03,590
But it's a fucking door.

896
01:34:05,176 --> 01:34:09,207
Open it and get us out of here.

897
01:34:09,555 --> 01:34:12,974
And freeze to death? What
are you, fucking crazy?

898
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,104
I know...

899
01:34:19,732 --> 01:34:21,900
But maybe we can survive.

900
01:34:24,195 --> 01:34:26,738
You remember Yekaterina bridge?

901
01:34:27,406 --> 01:34:30,325
When we got slaughtered
with an ax.

902
01:34:30,993 --> 01:34:35,211
Every new year, I
check something.

903
01:34:35,331 --> 01:34:37,290
We see the wreckage
of a plane...

904
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:39,417
under the snow.

905
01:34:41,796 --> 01:34:48,391
For ten years the
tail can barely seen.

906
01:34:48,511 --> 01:34:53,168
But now I can see the
fuselage and wings.

907
01:34:55,309 --> 01:34:59,027
There is less and
less snow and ice.

908
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:02,023
It melts.

909
01:35:03,401 --> 01:35:06,945
Snow becomes more fragile,

910
01:35:07,405 --> 01:35:09,531
it doesn't take much to
get rid of everything.

911
01:35:11,701 --> 01:35:13,201
Recently,

912
01:35:14,954 --> 01:35:16,913
you know what I saw?

913
01:35:19,349 --> 01:35:21,543
Outside, there was...

914
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:29,300
Drops.

915
01:35:30,052 --> 01:35:31,469
It is not worth telling it.

916
01:35:31,637 --> 01:35:33,722
You gotta take it
easy on that Kronol.

917
01:35:33,973 --> 01:35:36,863
That bullshit is gonna
fry your brain.

918
01:35:37,309 --> 01:35:39,269
You don't think I'm right.

919
01:35:40,146 --> 01:35:42,230
Kronol is the first...

920
01:35:44,775 --> 01:35:47,742
highly flammable chemical.

921
01:35:47,862 --> 01:35:49,461
A spark and boom!

922
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:54,909
Basically, it's a fucking bomb.

923
01:36:00,312 --> 01:36:03,710
I not only store
these to get high,

924
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:06,921
but to blow that gate.

925
01:36:07,465 --> 01:36:08,631
Matches, quickly.

926
01:36:08,966 --> 01:36:10,467
What are you doing?

927
01:36:11,093 --> 01:36:12,350
Give it to me!

928
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:13,715
Take that off the door.

929
01:36:14,972 --> 01:36:15,972
Fire!

930
01:36:30,571 --> 01:36:32,142
Curtis Everett.

931
01:36:33,032 --> 01:36:35,805
I've been asked to extend
a formal invitation...

932
01:36:35,925 --> 01:36:38,631
from Mr. Wilford to
join him for dinner.

933
01:36:40,122 --> 01:36:41,685
After you.

934
01:37:09,235 --> 01:37:11,194
Curtis? Is that you?

935
01:37:14,198 --> 01:37:15,657
Curtis, dear boy.

936
01:37:16,075 --> 01:37:17,213
Come in.

937
01:37:20,746 --> 01:37:22,622
Let's take a look at you.

938
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:24,124
Are you hungry?

939
01:37:25,084 --> 01:37:27,961
You did a man's work,
coming all this way.

940
01:37:29,797 --> 01:37:32,013
Please, sit down.

941
01:37:32,133 --> 01:37:36,374
You are the first human being to have
walked the total length of this train.

942
01:37:36,804 --> 01:37:38,096
Tail to Engine.

943
01:37:38,472 --> 01:37:39,806
Did you know that?

944
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:42,464
Well done, bravo.

945
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:48,201
None of your people have ever
been here, to the Engine.

946
01:37:48,649 --> 01:37:50,650
I've never been to
the tail section.

947
01:37:50,901 --> 01:37:53,444
Why not? Too dirty for you?

948
01:37:54,113 --> 01:37:56,394
Don't want to rub against the
vermin of the tail section?

949
01:37:56,991 --> 01:38:00,160
Do you think my station is
without it's own drawbacks?

950
01:38:00,369 --> 01:38:01,703
It's noisy.

951
01:38:02,663 --> 01:38:03,997
And it's lonely.

952
01:38:06,542 --> 01:38:07,542
Right.

953
01:38:08,502 --> 01:38:09,586
Steaks.

954
01:38:10,087 --> 01:38:11,462
Plenty of room.

955
01:38:12,006 --> 01:38:14,270
This whore to bring you
anything you want.

956
01:38:14,884 --> 01:38:17,510
Curtis, everyone has their
preordained position.

957
01:38:17,803 --> 01:38:20,096
And everyone is in their
place except you.

958
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:24,642
That's what people in the best place
say to the people in the worst place.

959
01:38:26,478 --> 01:38:29,230
There's not a soul on this train
that wouldn't trade places with you.

960
01:38:29,565 --> 01:38:31,107
Would you trade places with me?

961
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,400
Fuck you.

962
01:38:33,444 --> 01:38:34,944
Curtis, dear boy.

963
01:38:35,112 --> 01:38:39,199
The fact is that we are all stuck
inside this blasted train.

964
01:38:39,408 --> 01:38:42,076
We are prisoners in
this hunk of metal.

965
01:38:42,203 --> 01:38:43,685
Medium rare?

966
01:38:44,163 --> 01:38:46,581
And this train is a
closed ecosystem.

967
01:38:46,749 --> 01:38:49,083
We must always
strive for balance.

968
01:38:49,919 --> 01:38:53,588
Air, water, food
supply, population.

969
01:38:53,756 --> 01:38:55,423
It must all be kept in balance.

970
01:38:56,175 --> 01:38:59,493
For optimum balance, however
there'll have been time when more...

971
01:38:59,613 --> 01:39:01,829
radical solutions were required.

972
01:39:01,949 --> 01:39:05,600
When the population needed
to be reduced, rather...

973
01:39:06,268 --> 01:39:07,518
drastically.

974
01:39:10,814 --> 01:39:13,858
We don't have time for
true natural selection.

975
01:39:14,485 --> 01:39:18,780
We would all be hideously over crowded
and starved waiting for that.

976
01:39:20,741 --> 01:39:22,450
The next best solution...

977
01:39:23,494 --> 01:39:26,792
is to have individual units kill
off other individual units.

978
01:39:27,498 --> 01:39:31,215
From time to time, we've had
to stir the pot, so to speak.

979
01:39:31,335 --> 01:39:35,011
The Revolt of Seven,
The McGregor Riots...

980
01:39:35,464 --> 01:39:37,757
The Great Curtis Revolution.

981
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:42,470
A blockbuster production with a
devilishly unpredictable plot.

982
01:39:42,846 --> 01:39:46,099
Who could predicted your counter attack
with the torch at Yaketerina tunnel?

983
01:39:47,685 --> 01:39:48,810
Pure genius.

984
01:39:49,853 --> 01:39:51,986
That wasn't what Gilliam
and I had in our plan.

985
01:39:52,106 --> 01:39:53,106
What?

986
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:59,410
Don't tell me you didn't
know, Gilliam and I...

987
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:00,738
Our plan.

988
01:40:02,533 --> 01:40:03,533
Gilliam?

989
01:40:04,243 --> 01:40:05,243
Gilliam.

990
01:40:05,911 --> 01:40:08,586
The front and the tail
suppose to work together.

991
01:40:09,206 --> 01:40:12,083
He was more than a
partner, really.

992
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:14,268
He was my friend.

993
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:15,388
Bullshit.

994
01:40:15,546 --> 01:40:16,798
I don't believe you.

995
01:40:18,757 --> 01:40:22,802
Our original agreement was for the
insurgency to end at Yaketerina tunnel.

996
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:25,806
And all the survivors will go
back to the tail section...

997
01:40:26,518 --> 01:40:29,517
- To enjoy a much more space.
- You're a fucking liar.

998
01:40:29,893 --> 01:40:31,311
Gilliam would never do that.

999
01:40:32,146 --> 01:40:33,980
It all worked out in the end.

1000
01:40:34,231 --> 01:40:38,401
Your counter attack actually made the
insurgency 10 times more exciting.

1001
01:40:38,652 --> 01:40:42,947
Unfortunately the front suffered
more losses than anticipated and...

1002
01:40:43,532 --> 01:40:46,437
Gilliam had to pay the price.

1003
01:40:49,288 --> 01:40:50,913
Ironic, isn't it?

1004
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:55,918
How people dramatically cross that
thin barrier between life and death...

1005
01:40:56,628 --> 01:40:59,710
now there's just one
last thing for us to do.

1006
01:41:02,259 --> 01:41:03,676
Tally up the numbers.

1007
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:17,148
Hello Wilford, it's me.

1008
01:41:17,858 --> 01:41:19,486
I'm at Gilliam's place.

1009
01:41:19,818 --> 01:41:20,818
Hold on.

1010
01:41:21,362 --> 01:41:23,321
Is it still the same number?

1011
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:26,074
Yes, it still stands at 74%.

1012
01:41:26,194 --> 01:41:27,950
Okay, carry on.

1013
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:29,702
Wait.

1014
01:41:30,037 --> 01:41:33,539
Spare 18, to celebrate
our 18th year.

1015
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:37,580
It's an excellent idea.

1016
01:41:45,302 --> 01:41:46,377
Your people.

1017
01:41:47,563 --> 01:41:50,772
Goddammit Claude.
Mind the Engine!

1018
01:41:52,434 --> 01:41:54,602
She's getting
sensitive recently.

1019
01:41:56,345 --> 01:41:58,523
Sit down and mind
your table manners.

1020
01:42:00,567 --> 01:42:01,651
Relax.

1021
01:42:05,364 --> 01:42:06,989
Calm down.

1022
01:42:09,271 --> 01:42:12,767
Now I can see what Gilliam meant, he
told me you were brilliant and clever.

1023
01:42:12,887 --> 01:42:14,497
But always so tense.

1024
01:42:15,874 --> 01:42:18,000
When's the last
time you got laid?

1025
01:42:19,878 --> 01:42:23,464
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

1026
01:42:32,015 --> 01:42:33,391
I'll miss Gilliam.

1027
01:42:35,394 --> 01:42:37,687
I'll miss our late
night phone chats.

1028
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,649
He could go on for hours.

1029
01:42:42,276 --> 01:42:44,235
All with only one arm.

1030
01:42:45,946 --> 01:42:47,488
What's with that face?

1031
01:42:49,158 --> 01:42:50,450
What's the matter?

1032
01:42:51,577 --> 01:42:53,619
You look like a crazy person.

1033
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:56,247
As if there aren't enough
crazies on this train.

1034
01:43:25,527 --> 01:43:26,605
Blood!

1035
01:43:29,781 --> 01:43:31,091
Are you okay?

1036
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:35,957
What? What happened?

1037
01:43:37,831 --> 01:43:39,131
Get down.

1038
01:43:55,182 --> 01:43:56,355
Yona.

1039
01:43:56,475 --> 01:43:58,601
We must open this door.

1040
01:44:00,521 --> 01:44:03,353
You see those cables?

1041
01:44:03,649 --> 01:44:04,964
There are so many cables.

1042
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,360
Die!

1043
01:44:07,945 --> 01:44:09,153
Bastard!

1044
01:44:09,863 --> 01:44:13,849
It is easier for someone to
survive on this train...

1045
01:44:13,969 --> 01:44:16,244
if they have some
level of insanity.

1046
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,698
As Gilliam well understood...

1047
01:44:20,818 --> 01:44:24,961
we need to maintain the proper
balance of anxiety and fear...

1048
01:44:25,212 --> 01:44:28,610
chaos and horror in order
to keep life going.

1049
01:44:29,341 --> 01:44:33,902
If we don't have that,
we need to invent it.

1050
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:39,285
In that sense, the Great Curtis Revolution
you invented was truly a masterpiece.

1051
01:44:39,977 --> 01:44:40,977
Yona.

1052
01:44:41,562 --> 01:44:42,979
Red, number 8.

1053
01:44:43,188 --> 01:44:44,522
No, 7.

1054
01:44:50,529 --> 01:44:51,988
Come with me, Curtis.

1055
01:44:52,906 --> 01:44:54,740
Something I want to show you.

1056
01:44:55,325 --> 01:44:56,576
You deserve it.

1057
01:44:59,913 --> 01:45:00,913
Come on.

1058
01:45:10,299 --> 01:45:12,247
She's waking up now.

1059
01:45:40,579 --> 01:45:42,038
Cozy yes?

1060
01:45:42,706 --> 01:45:44,013
Peaceful.

1061
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:46,956
You are now in her heart.

1062
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:51,434
I've devoted my
entire life for this.

1063
01:45:52,549 --> 01:45:54,515
The Eternal Engine.

1064
01:45:56,762 --> 01:45:59,140
It is the eternity itself.

1065
01:46:02,476 --> 01:46:05,102
Have you ever been
alone on this train?

1066
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,856
When was the last
time you were alone?

1067
01:46:10,317 --> 01:46:12,992
You can't remember, can you?

1068
01:46:14,363 --> 01:46:16,286
So please do.

1069
01:46:16,406 --> 01:46:18,086
Take your time.

1070
01:47:18,009 --> 01:47:19,752
I just wrote it.

1071
01:47:20,929 --> 01:47:22,710
It's for you, Curtis.

1072
01:47:23,724 --> 01:47:24,830
Here.

1073
01:47:37,705 --> 01:47:39,321
I am old.

1074
01:47:40,657 --> 01:47:43,061
I want you to take my Station.

1075
01:47:44,327 --> 01:47:46,406
It's what you've always wanted.

1076
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:52,172
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

1077
01:47:54,796 --> 01:47:56,714
You must tend the Engine...

1078
01:47:57,674 --> 01:47:59,349
Keep her humming.

1079
01:48:05,307 --> 01:48:06,599
Look, Curtis.

1080
01:48:07,934 --> 01:48:09,643
Beyond the gate...

1081
01:48:11,354 --> 01:48:13,719
Sections after sections
precisely where they've

1082
01:48:13,732 --> 01:48:16,108
always been and where
they'll always be.

1083
01:48:16,276 --> 01:48:18,360
All adding up to what?

1084
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,640
The train.

1085
01:48:24,075 --> 01:48:26,911
And now the perfectly correct
number of human beings...

1086
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:30,623
All in their proper places,
all adding up to what?

1087
01:48:31,208 --> 01:48:32,333
Humanity.

1088
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:34,835
The train is the world.

1089
01:48:36,004 --> 01:48:37,505
We the humanity.

1090
01:48:39,841 --> 01:48:44,428
And now you have the sacred
responsibility to lead all humanity.

1091
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:48,224
Without you, Curtis, humanity
will cease to exist.

1092
01:48:49,684 --> 01:48:52,595
You've seen what people
do without leadership.

1093
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:55,231
They devour one another.

1094
01:49:17,838 --> 01:49:19,588
Yona, the Kronol!

1095
01:49:23,802 --> 01:49:25,792
Yona, stop! No.

1096
01:49:28,407 --> 01:49:29,859
No bullets?

1097
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:38,816
Get the Kronol then.

1098
01:49:40,068 --> 01:49:41,193
Look at them.

1099
01:49:42,946 --> 01:49:44,780
That's how people are.

1100
01:49:45,824 --> 01:49:46,907
You know.

1101
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,826
You've seen this.

1102
01:49:49,995 --> 01:49:51,328
You've been this.

1103
01:49:54,749 --> 01:49:56,959
Ridiculous. Pathetic,
aren't they?

1104
01:49:58,003 --> 01:50:00,421
You can save them
from themselves.

1105
01:50:01,882 --> 01:50:04,800
This is what Gilliam
saved you for.

1106
01:50:10,765 --> 01:50:12,073
Curtis.

1107
01:50:12,842 --> 01:50:14,643
This is your destiny.

1108
01:50:20,054 --> 01:50:21,083
It's done!

1109
01:50:21,203 --> 01:50:23,827
Curtis, matches.

1110
01:50:27,532 --> 01:50:30,471
Curtis! The match!

1111
01:51:03,735 --> 01:51:06,737
The space only allows for
a very small person.

1112
01:51:08,615 --> 01:51:10,775
Young children under 5.

1113
01:51:11,242 --> 01:51:15,621
The engine lasts forever but
not to all of it's parts.

1114
01:51:15,789 --> 01:51:20,257
That piece of equipment
went extinct recently.

1115
01:51:20,377 --> 01:51:22,721
We needed a replacement.

1116
01:51:23,546 --> 01:51:28,069
Thank goodness the tail section
manufactured us a steady supplies of kids.

1117
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:30,636
So we can keep going manually.

1118
01:51:34,557 --> 01:51:36,100
Fucking bastard!

1119
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:00,791
Yona...

1120
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:04,670
Take the fire.

1121
01:52:22,814 --> 01:52:24,218
Only one left.

1122
01:52:35,326 --> 01:52:38,746
Critical engine shutdown.

1123
01:52:38,866 --> 01:52:40,602
Okay.

1124
01:52:41,076 --> 01:52:44,085
Please stand at safe distance.

1125
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,599
Andy? Is that you?

1126
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:02,779
Andy!

1127
01:53:03,521 --> 01:53:05,105
Do you remember me?

1128
01:53:05,523 --> 01:53:07,816
Andy, stop, listen to me.

1129
01:53:08,109 --> 01:53:10,391
Don't go up those
stairs, listen.

1130
01:53:11,821 --> 01:53:12,821
Andy!

1131
01:53:14,032 --> 01:53:15,991
Come here, come over here.

1132
01:53:18,787 --> 01:53:20,287
Andy, listen to me!

1133
01:53:21,122 --> 01:53:22,414
Get out of there!

1134
01:53:27,587 --> 01:53:30,303
Goddammit Andy, listen to me.

1135
01:53:30,423 --> 01:53:34,725
Curtis, don't be
so melodramatic.

1136
01:53:35,559 --> 01:53:39,056
You know everyone has their
own preordained position.

1137
01:55:14,941 --> 01:55:16,236
Nice.

1138
01:57:28,119 --> 01:57:31,339
Dad!

1139
01:57:32,232 --> 01:57:36,172
Dad...

1140
01:57:40,798 --> 01:57:42,138
Curtis.

1141
01:57:53,394 --> 01:57:54,980
Stay here.
