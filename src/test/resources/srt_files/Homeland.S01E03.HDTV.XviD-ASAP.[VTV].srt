<i>The</i> <i>USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked...</i>

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,961
This was an act of terrorism.

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,466
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

12
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,136

favorites.

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,607
Until something shocks him...

14
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:40,444
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

<i>Running up...</i>

17
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:51,358

<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

19
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,469

An American prisoner of war

Well, that's one interpretation,

00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:32,395
but that's all it
is at the moment.

28
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:36,833
Jessica, it's me-- Brody.

29
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:39,168
If he is a terrorist,
we need eyes and ears

30
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:41,404
<i>on Brody from the minute</i>
<i>he steps off that plane.</i>

31
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,006
Out of the question.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,241
The terrorists
are still out there.

33
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:46,843
<i>We need Brody in the public eye</i>

34
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,345
<i>reminding America</i>
<i>that this is far from over.</i>

35
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,881
What if he's not up
for it-- psychologically?

36
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:57,121
<i>Just a couple questions

The...

00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,429
The brass sent you over here

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,697

41
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:08,931

for their bullshit war.

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,368
Abu Nazir?
Was he ever present

44
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,270
during any of your
interrogations?

45
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:15,071
No.

46
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,475
<i>You are the only Agency asset</i>

47
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,577
to have had eyes on Nazir
in seven years.

48
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,379
You know that they stone
women like me to death

49
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:23,813
<i>if we get caught doing anything</i>

50
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,148
<i>that we're not supposed to?</i>

51
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:26,917
I won't let anything
happen to you.

52
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,885
So Abu Nazir's resurfacing
just as Brody

53
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,254
has miraculously returned
home means nothing?

54
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:33,923
Dots are there, Carrie, but you
haven't connected them yet.

55
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,058
<i>Wait, there's no
camera</i> <i>in the garage?</i>

Shh.

61
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:40,255
Stay there.

62
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,668
What are you doing?

63
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,403
Nothing, Aamir.

64
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,104
Just getting dressed.

65
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:23,093
Oh, it's beautiful, Aamir.

66
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,228
You're beautiful.

67
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:45,348
I'd like to swap
out this couch, please.

68
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:48,384
And the painting.
Something a little less Motel 6.

69
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,588
I'll do what I did for the
McCain 2009 interview.

70
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:53,822
Highest ratings ever.

71
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,324
You know, I missed that one.

72
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,792
I was out of the country.

73
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,960
Of course.

74
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:01,029
Okay.

75
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:02,531
Oh, shit.

76
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,000
Carrie, would you get in here?

77
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,634
What is it?

78
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,637
It's a crew member
from the network.

79
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,339
They're about to move the couch

80
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:12,208
where we have a contact mic
mounted to the baseboard.

81
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:13,877
Holy mother of fuck.

82
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,380
Okay, wait a second.
Wait a second.

83
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,382
Can you...
you put that down?

84
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,684
And can we get
the painting back

85
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:21,851
on the wall, where it belongs?

86
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,020
We'll stick with Motel 6.

87
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:25,989
Just do it.

88
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,496
All right, I'm going to be late
for my briefing.

89
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,464
Let me know who wins.

90
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:40,037
Look, we're broadcasting
a special here in two days.

91
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,705
The homecoming
of an American hero.

92
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,006
I know what the audience wants.

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,808
You need to trust me.
No, I don't.

94
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,710
Okay. Keep the couch.

95
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:48,311
It's great. Let's just...
let's have you

96
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,246
take a seat right
there, please.

97
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,082
They back at it?

98
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,583
Looks like.

99
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:57,353
She has no idea who
she's dealing with.

100
00:06:57,387 --> 00:06:59,889
I had no idea he had such, uh,

101
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:03,393
strong feelings
about home decor.

102
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:05,096
It's probably
the only thing to him

103
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,998
that seems the same.

104
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:08,366
I kept everything
exactly the same

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,867
the whole time he was gone.

106
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:14,907
Not everything.

107
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:19,946
I'm not going to
do this interview.

108
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,714
It's a complete joke.

109
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:23,582
They're trying to make us
into some perfect family.

110
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,386
You are the perfect family.

111
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,221
No, we're not.

112
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:32,023
Well, not you, maybe,
but the rest of them.

113
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:34,191
Your brother's a Boy Scout,
literally.

114
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:37,361
Your mother, she's got
this whole MILF thing going.

115
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:40,431
And your father--
I mean, Sergeant Brody,

116
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:42,466
he's a hero.

117
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,103
Yeah, <i>he</i> is.

118
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:47,806
So leave the rest
of us out of it.

119
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,242
Okay,
suggestion, if I may.

120
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:53,045
Do the interview, right?

121
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,047
But do something crazy.

122
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,749
Like what?

123
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:58,751
Light my hair on fire?

124
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,620
Wear a burka.

125
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,822
Every time the interviewer
asks a question,

126
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,958
tell him to go
shut the fuck up.

127
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,392
Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,794
Look, the whole country
will be watching, right?

129
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,564
And you can say
whatever you want.

130
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,632
Tell the truth.

131
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,539
The truth would be interesting.

132
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,144
Intelligence work
has led us to this man.

133
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:29,148
Prince Farid Bin Abbud,

134
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:31,617
also known to his friends
as Freddie.

135
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:33,820
We spent years chasing rumors

136
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,989
that the prince
funded terrorists.

137
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,291
But we've never had proof until
a meeting between the prince

138
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,928
and Abu Nazir was videotaped
by this woman.

139
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:42,629
Lynne Reed.

140
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,030
A CIA asset and member

141
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,965
of the prince's
personal retinue.

142
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,533
We're running a hooker?

143
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,835
If, by hooker,
you mean someone who's out there

144
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,369
risking her life
while we're sitting

145
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,104
around a conference table,
then yeah,

146
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,706
we are.

147
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,974
I just received word from her

148
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:58,508
that she successfully
downloaded

149
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:00,176
the prince's cell phone
onto an I-X chip.

150
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:01,711
I'll be retrieving it
first thing tomorrow.

151
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,012
Very good.

152
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:07,016
So, immediately after
his meeting with Abu Nazir,

153
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,985
the prince came here to DC.

154
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,120
We believe the purpose
of his visit

155
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,155
is to move funds
to one of Abu Nazir's people

156
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,557
here in the United States.

157
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:16,125
If we can flag the transfer,

158
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,860
we can follow the money
to Nazir's operative.

159
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:19,829
The prince is a global guy.

160
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,631
He lives on that phone

161
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:23,233
that Lynne Reed
just downloaded for us,

162
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:26,803
so... should be
a good place to start.

163
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:28,838
Questions.

164
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:30,407
You say you
believe the prince

165
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,142
is here for the purpose of
transferring funds. Why?

166
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,045
Like I said,
the timing of the trip--

167
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,713
following on the heels
of the prince's meeting

168
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:39,482
with Abu Nazir in Cypress.

169
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:42,185
My understanding is the prince
comes to the United States

170
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:43,686
every year about this time.

171
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,689
To top off his harem,
not to fund terrorism.

172
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:52,261
Saul.

173
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:53,996
What was that about?

174
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,865
It was a legitimate question.

175
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,167
So ask me offline.
Don't torpedo my briefing.

176
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,503
It was a question, Carrie,
not an act of war.

177
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,905
Abu Nazir's express goal
is an attack on our country.

178
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,375
It's his holy grail.
No one doubts that.

179
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:06,909
Well, half the reason
I think Abu Nazir

180
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,444
has something
in the works now is Brody,

181
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,012
and you know I can't
talk about that.

182
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,547
So let me see if
I understand this.

183
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,248
You think when
I ask you the same

184
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,583
exact question I'd ask
anyone else, that really,

185
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:15,851
I'm just giving
you a hard time?

186
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,353
Is that it?

187
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:20,690
Got a meeting to get to.

188
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:43,514
Dana.

189
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,490
Where were you?

190
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:53,125
With friends.

191
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,460
You missed the prep
for the interview.

192
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,396
Yeah, that was
kind of the point.

193
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,998
Hey.

194
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:02,000
Sorry.

195
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:05,503
Sorry.

196
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,008
Can I go?

197
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:11,976
No.
Sure.

198
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,616
I didn't mean to
confuse things.

199
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,819
So you know,
she's always like this.

200
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,320
It's not you.

201
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,189
You sure?

202
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,591
Ask her to do anything,

203
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,326
and the attitude
goes up like a wall.

204
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,628
I mean, she's obviously got

205
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,665
a secret life
going on out there.

206
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,168
Well, she's 16.

207
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:37,770
Only 16.

208
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,939
Well, I meant, didn't you have

209
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,975
a secret life when
you were that age?

210
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,677
Yeah, with you.

211
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,179
That was different.

212
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:57,623
You want me to try
talking to her?

213
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:59,391
Please.

214
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,193
Be my guest.

215
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:18,947
If I run into any trouble,
I'll send up a flare.

216
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,042
- I don't know.
- It's funny, though, isn't it?

217
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:39,563
You actually went swimming.

218
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,965
I thought that was the idea.

219
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:03,988
So what exactly are you
expecting to find on that?

220
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:05,990
These operations
need money, right?

221
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,992
You think it's
coming from Farid?

222
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,594
He's certainly
got enough of it.

223
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:11,663
So now we look for something
out of the ordinary

224
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,432
on the download you got us.

225
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:16,001
Electronic wire
with odd routing...

226
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:17,503
a meeting he takes
with someone new,

227
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,538
outside his usual circle...

228
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,440
a transfer of money...

229
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,008
I'll know it when I see it.

230
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,510
Are you sure about this,

231
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:26,344
about Farid being
part of an attack?

232
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,115
Pretty much, yeah.

233
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,351
Because I've been right
beside him for over a year

234
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,154
and all I've seen is a nice
guy with a few sexual quirks.

235
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:38,723
He gave me this amazing
necklace yesterday.

236
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,391
He didn't have to,
he doesn't owe me.

237
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,561
I swear, it actually
meant something to him.

238
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,631
I'm sure it did.

239
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:47,032
He's taking us all
clubbing tonight,

240
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,467
to show off the new girls.

241
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:51,037
That's what his
whole life is about.

242
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:52,372
Just having fun.

243
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,474
I know it must seem that way,

244
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,477
but the man you recorded
him with, Abu Nazir,

245
00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:00,013
you know he's the real deal.

246
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:05,585
We never would have been able
to get this any other way.

247
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,187
You should feel really good
about what you've done.

248
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:12,925
Well, I have downloaded
his phone for you.

249
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,193
I'm done.

250
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,495
What about you?

251
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,864
Me? No.

252
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:21,199
I'm never done.

253
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:34,279
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your interview?

254
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,516
They pushed it back
a couple hours.

255
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,085
Are you nervous?
No.

256
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:41,187
I was told Lawrence O'Donnell
gives everyone a hard time

257
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:42,522
except guys in uniform.

258
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:44,557
Chris! Dana!
Breakfast!

259
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,258
So you know--

260
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:47,927
Chris is all about
sugar in the morning,

261
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,928
usually Cocoa Pebbles.

262
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:51,430
Dana doesn't touch breakfast.

263
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:54,533
It's as if you're
trying to poison her.

264
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,703
So what were you two
talking about last night?

265
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,538
Huh?

266
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,539
I heard Dana laughing,
it was hard not to.

267
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,141
What was so funny?

268
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,943
Oh. It was this video
called YouTube.

269
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,979
Have you seen it?

270
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,149
The dog talking about food?
No, not that one.

271
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,750
I saw a cat that smokes.

272
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,619
It was really quite funny.

273
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:15,954
Hey. Want some?

274
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:17,455
No, thanks.

275
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:21,926
I'll take some.

276
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,931
Thank you.

277
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:35,137
Looks good.

278
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:38,140
Lack of porn is
a little surprising,

279
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:40,108
given the prince's reputation.

280
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,477
You know, at your briefing

281
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:45,180
yesterday, I didn't
mean anything,

282
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:47,282
calling your asset a hooker.

283
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,751
Want to make it up to me?

284
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,620
Find me evidence of
a money transfer.

285
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:52,621
Start with the encrypted files.

286
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:55,024
Really, it's important.

287
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,695
Saul.

288
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,597
I just picked up the
download from Lynne Reed.

289
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:03,098
Anything there?
Crypto's processing it now.

290
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,000
Hopefully we'll know
in a couple hours.

291
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,203
Good. I got a meeting to go to...
Meeting to go to, sure.

292
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:10,273
How long are you going
to keep doing this?

293
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:11,942
When are you going to
forgive me for screwing up?

294
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,545
I forgive you, Carrie.
No, you don't.

295
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,447
I really don't want to
get into this here.

296
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:19,783
I lied to you, it was
wrong, I understand that.

297
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:22,219
Do you?

298
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:26,190
Good.
Saul...

299
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,458
Everyone lies in this
business, I accept that.

300
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:29,959
But we all draw
a line somewhere,

301
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,228
and the two sides of that
line are "us" and "them."

302
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:34,330
And whatever we had, you and I,
whatever trust we built up

303
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:35,798
over a decade of
me protecting you,

304
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,199
teaching you everything I know,

305
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:39,635
you destroyed it
when you lied to me

306
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,003
and you treated me like "them,"

307
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,207
like every other schmuck
in this building.

308
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,009
Now, when you say
you understand,

309
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:48,878
is that what you mean?

310
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,228
What was it like, hearing
your liberators rolling in?

311
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:05,496
Well, they flew in.

312
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,930
Which I didn't
know at the time.

313
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,398
I was in a pretty deep bunker,

314
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:10,333
so I couldn't really
hear what was going on.

315
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:13,703
Then I heard
a massive firefight.

316
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:18,239
I knew there'd be casualties,

317
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:21,843
but at the moment the door
to my bunker blew in,

318
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:24,245
I still didn't know
which side had won.

319
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:29,684
Then a flashbang went off,

320
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,053
which blinded me.

321
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,692
And I just braced for the end.

322
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:41,863
It took a while to work out
what had really happened.

323
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,197
That you were free.

324
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:44,865
Yeah.

325
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,567
Sergeant Brody, your
commanders showed us

326
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:47,801
the results of your initial

327
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,070
medical exam.
Yes.

328
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:55,074
There's a section, "Scars and
Other Identifying Marks."

329
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,510
It goes on for
nearly two pages.

330
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,946
You were beaten.

331
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,617
No...

332
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:06,886
Yes.
Tortured.

333
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:11,292
That's right.

334
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,793
To what end?

335
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:35,516
To what end?

336
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,018
What did they want from you?

337
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:53,769
They want you to lose faith.

338
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:57,339
Lose faith in your country,
which they say is the devil.

339
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:59,942
In your brother Marines, who
they say aren't coming for you

340
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:01,977
because you have
no military value.

341
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,848
In your wife,

342
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:09,352
who they say's got her arms
wrapped around someone else.

343
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:11,488
How do you resist that?

344
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:15,191
You can't.

345
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:19,863
Except by believing
that those people

346
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,365
they want you to renounce,

347
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,969
that they're keeping
the faith in you,

348
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:28,972
and you owe it to
them to do the same.

349
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:31,375
Semper fidelis.

350
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,021
Yeah.

351
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:58,034
Your father did his
interview this morning.

352
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:00,836
Good.

353
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:03,005
It is good, I think.
To talk about it.

354
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,841
To ten million people?

355
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,542
You think that's good?

356
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,278
Okay.

357
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:12,515
I get that you don't want to
do the interview with us.

358
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,083
I don't really think
anybody wants to hear

359
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:15,752
what it is I have to say.

360
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:17,454
Thank you for your order.

361
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:18,956
Please move forward
to the window.

362
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,427
Welcome to Gaucho Taco.
We'll be with you in a minute.

363
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,362
What's good here?

364
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:28,032
Well, it's 59 cent tacos, Mom.

365
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:30,235
I'm sure it's all delicious.

366
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:34,039
Look, Dana, I know
this is hard.

367
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,442
Your father was gone
for eight years.

368
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:38,444
And now he's back.

369
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,446
That's not it, Mom.

370
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,248
He's back and there's a
camera crew at our house,

371
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:45,451
when what we really
need is some privacy.

372
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:48,053
But that's his job now,
to be a public figure.

373
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,054
And it's our job to
be there for him.

374
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,589
We owe him that.

375
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,626
Dana, I do listen.

376
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,394
I know you think it's phony,

377
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,296
putting us up on stage,
and you're not wrong...

378
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:01,832
Well, Mom, it'd be a lot less
phony if you weren't fucking

379
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,801
his good friend Mike.

380
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,305
I'm not.

381
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,076
Oh, please, Mom.

382
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,645
With your black sleazy thongs
always drying in the bathroom,

383
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,081
and him coming over
to "help out."

384
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,983
Do you really think
I'm an idiot?

385
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:25,292
Dana, I thought he was dead.

386
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:26,827
We all did.

387
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:30,297
But he's not, Mom.

388
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:34,501
And he comes home,
to this devoted wife,

389
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:37,905
and everyone is in on
the secret except him.

390
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,910
Nice. Welcome home.

391
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,349
Dana!

392
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,318
Dana.

393
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:52,687
Your father can never
hear about any of this.

394
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:53,955
It would really hurt him.

395
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,957
Him, or you, Mom?

396
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,360
Him, both of us,

397
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:00,128
our entire family,
do you understand that?

398
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:02,531
Dana, I need you to promise.

399
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,702
Hi.
Hello.

400
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,641
This must be Jessica and Dana.

401
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:14,342
That's right, it's
my wife and my daughter.

402
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,977
I just stopped by to say hi

403
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,545
before the family
interview tomorrow.

404
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,847
Give us a chance
to get acquainted.

405
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:22,149
So...

406
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,885
Good we're all here.

407
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,397
You're late.

408
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,698
Yeah, sorry.

409
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,268
Where's Max?

410
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:40,805
He went home when the shift
ended, like I should have.

411
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:46,010
Please tell me
you found something.

412
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:48,179
Well, as a matter
of fact, I did.

413
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:49,580
Hello.

414
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:51,383
This must be Jessica and Dana.

415
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,851
Yes, my wife, my daughter.

416
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:54,786
I just stopped by to say hi

417
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:56,355
before the family
interview tomorrow.

418
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:57,790
Is that...?

419
00:23:57,824 --> 00:23:59,825
Lawrence O'Donnell, I know.
Here, watch this.

420
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:04,663
You know that family interview
they're all getting ready for?

421
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:11,035
She knows.

422
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,469
Dana does. About us.

423
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:14,271
I mean, how?

424
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:16,540
We were so careful.
When you said you "had something,"

425
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:17,974
I thought you
meant something big.

426
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:20,043
Well, this is big.
No, I mean like a bomb.

427
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:22,445
Or a call from Abu Nazir.

428
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:26,816
I picked up the downlink
from Lynne Reed today,

429
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,885
and after all we went through,
there's nothing on it.

430
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,754
I need to find something here.

431
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:32,589
Hey, aren't you the one who's
always telling me to be patient?

432
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,590
I don't have time
to be patient.

433
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,292
I have three weeks left and
we're sitting around watching

434
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,160
this, whatever it is,
this reality show.

435
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:40,330
Hey, have you eaten?

436
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:42,732
I noticed there's some
spaghetti in the cupboard.

437
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:45,736
It's only ten years
past its expiration date.

438
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,305
I'm sure it won't kill us.

439
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,941
All right.

440
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:02,354
So what do we do?

441
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:04,089
Just wait for the prince?

442
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:06,092
That's right, you wait,
and you look beautiful,

443
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:07,493
and you try and enjoy yourself.

444
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:08,995
Think you can manage that?

445
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,263
I can certainly try.

446
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:12,832
Here's a question.

447
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:14,333
How do I get one of those?

448
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:06,217
Are you all right?

449
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:09,687
Yeah. Fine.

450
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:13,157
It's all yours.

451
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,189
Another bottle.

452
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:48,892
Easy. Pace yourself.
I know.

453
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,728
We have all night.

454
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:51,996
You have two years.

455
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:06,043
I'm not so sure about that one.

456
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:09,212
His Highness says
she reminds him of you

457
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:11,781
when you first started.

458
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:13,983
His Highness has
a special favor to ask.

459
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:15,585
A job he wants you to do.

460
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:17,487
A job?

461
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:20,323
He's meeting with a businessman
tomorrow-- a new acquaintance.

462
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,391
He'd like you to go
there tonight

463
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:23,993
and make the man feel welcome.

464
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:27,430
Make him feel welcome?

465
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:29,665
Aamir said that?

466
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:33,603
He said he wishes
to make a good impression.

467
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:35,705
Why didn't he tell
me that himself?

468
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:40,309
The prince can be
excruciatingly indirect

469
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:44,480
in making his wishes known--
but for that, he has me.

470
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:47,816
Is there a problem?

471
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,786
No.

472
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,188
No problem.
Good.

473
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:55,423
The driver's waiting.

474
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,291
I need to freshen up first.

475
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:58,826
Hurry.

476
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:12,608
Hey.

477
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:15,111
You awake?

478
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,489
Brody, a lot's happened
in eight years.

479
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:31,160
There's a lot we need
to talk about.

480
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:35,865
I just want you to know that,
when you're ready, so am I.

481
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:38,868
Do you hear me?

482
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:41,369
Mm-hmm.

483
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:15,404
I want to try again.

484
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:22,244
Got any tomatoes?

485
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,146
In the crisper.

486
00:29:27,718 --> 00:29:30,186
Any from this century?

487
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,590
Uh, in the cupboard, there might
be a jar of something.

488
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:45,969
No.

489
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:48,672
Take yours off.

490
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:53,677
Please, take it off.

491
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,324
Let me.

492
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:40,592
No.

493
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:42,794
It's better if you don't.

494
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:06,849
Hello.

495
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,016
Hey, it's Lynne.

496
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,284
Lynne, where are you?

497
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,552
I'm out.

498
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:12,121
Uh, it's getting weird.

499
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,588
What do you mean?

500
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,357
Did you find anything
on that cell phone?

501
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,792
That transfer you were
talking about?

502
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,427
No, not yet.

503
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:19,895
I think I may have found it.

504
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,898
They just asked me
to go entertain

505
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:23,533
some new business acquaintance

506
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,902
that the prince is
meeting tomorrow. Who?

507
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,538
I don't know. It's somebody
he's trying to impress.

508
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,239
You sound worried.

509
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,275
Normally, we don't even
talk to any man

510
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,544
but the prince, and they want me
to go meet him now.

511
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,281
The backup--
they're going to be able

512
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,782
to follow me, right?

513
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:38,783
What?

514
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:40,552
The people protecting me--

515
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,087
where are they?
Yeah, they'll be right behind you.

516
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,722
Don't worry, we have your back.

517
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,824
Just keep your phone on.
We'll be able

518
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:47,726
to track you that way.
Okay.

519
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,594
Thank you.

520
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:55,099
Her protection?

521
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,067
Where's your van?

522
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,802
Lynne's about to meet the
prince's new business partner.

523
00:32:58,837 --> 00:33:00,771
She's a welcome gift.
Carrie, what did you tell her?

524
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:03,306
You heard what I told her.
What was I supposed to say?

525
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,141
No, Estes didn't
give you a protection detail?

526
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:07,010
Now, come on,
we finally got a break.

527
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,317
I'm not seeing her phone.

528
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:16,853
Why isn't this working?
I don't know.

529
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,354
Just trace her.

530
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:20,323
Since when did they make
R Street a one-way?

531
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:22,659
Okay, we've got her.
Where's the map?

532
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,995
Just give it a second, will ya?

533
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:26,462
Okay.

534
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:28,331
All right, she's still
at the club.

535
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:37,173
Lynne Reed?

536
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:38,474
Where we going?

537
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:39,942
Hay Adams.
You been before?

538
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,177
Many times.

539
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,778
Careful.
Thank you.

540
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,682
Nice hotel. Very nice.

541
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,121
So how did you get hooked up
with these guys, may I ask?

542
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,790
Okay, I get it,
none of my business.

543
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,492
You're right.

544
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:57,394
It's just they paid cash,
substantial tip in advance.

545
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,196
I mean substantial.

546
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,465
Wouldn't mind being on
the permanent list is all.

547
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,667
Well, take care of me and I'll
put in a good word for you.

548
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:06,903
Thank you.
You're very kind.

549
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:09,238
Just leave me your card.

550
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,699
Which way are they going?

551
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,734
We're nearly there.
Which way are they going?!

552
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:41,004
They're not going anywhere.
She's not moving.

553
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:42,706
Where are they?
Behind the club.

554
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,273
Turn there.
You think that's a good idea?

555
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:45,408
Turn there!

556
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:52,448
Shit.

557
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,520
Carrie, Carrie, wait!
Carrie!

558
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,355
Carrie, there is nothing
to be done here, okay?

559
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,724
They made her.

560
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:04,760
Come on, we can't be seen.

561
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:06,195
Shit. Shit.

562
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:09,966
Shit.

563
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,238
Fuck.

564
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,566
Where's your father?

565
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,602
Don't know.

566
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:47,071
Where's Dana?
Don't know that either.

567
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,474
They drove off together
about a half hour ago.

568
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:53,143
If she doesn't
do the interview,

569
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:56,245
does that mean I don't
get to do it either?

570
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,648
I mean, it's not that I don't
appreciate all that she does.

571
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,849
It's just, you know,
there are some things

572
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:02,917
that I don't appreciate.

573
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,687
Yeah, so ignore them.

574
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:07,656
Yeah, but it's...
I mean it's stuff

575
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,191
that I don't think
anyone would appreciate.

576
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:14,396
I mean, it's stuff that I don't
think you would appreciate.

577
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,704
What are you looking for?

578
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:24,205
You'll see.

579
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,041
What are these?

580
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:29,311
Historical artifacts.

581
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,846
Look.

582
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,117
You and Mom.

583
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,652
Mm-hmm.

584
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:39,387
Each padlock put
here by couples

585
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,855
who thought they'd stay
together forever.

586
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,358
I wonder how many did.

587
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:45,993
Not many, I bet.

588
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,968
Why are you even
showing these to me?

589
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,505
Because it's never easy.

590
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:58,507
A lot of things can happen.

591
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:02,411
You know, when I went
over to Afghanistan,

592
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,046
you were in third grade.

593
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,248
Chris was about this size.

594
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:09,418
Your mom and I were almost
still like newlyweds.

595
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:12,420
That's what I took
over there with me.

596
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,091
You were in a play that year.

597
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,827
<i>The Wackadoo Zoo.</i>

598
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,495
Oh, you were so good.

599
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,169
I can't believe that
you remember that.

600
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,406
Honey, it's practically all
I thought about for eight years.

601
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:36,045
It kept me alive.

602
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,518
But now I'm back.

603
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:45,122
Now all those things that
kept me going, they've gone.

604
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:48,025
All the people have moved on,
things have changed.

605
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,228
And what's replaced it,

606
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:53,797
well, doesn't make
any sense to me.

607
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:55,532
Not yet, at least.

608
00:37:55,566 --> 00:38:00,436
You know, I'm kind of struggling
for things to hold on to.

609
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:03,072
And your mom's struggling, too.

610
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:09,746
You should cut her some slack.

611
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,615
We both should.

612
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:20,057
Yeah.

613
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,262
So...

614
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:27,064
why are you even doing
this stupid interview then,

615
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,466
if things don't make sense?

616
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,067
I don't know.

617
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,036
Maybe just to keep the peace.

618
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:37,174
What are you going to say?

619
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,410
Well, I'm not going to lie.

620
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,646
But I'm not going to
tell the truth, either.

621
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,116
I'm not going to tell a
bunch of total strangers

622
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,151
what I just told you.

623
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,697
Hey.

624
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:02,733
Go ahead.

625
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:17,783
She was, um, DOA at Providence.

626
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:19,184
Two rounds,
point-blank.

627
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:20,952
Apparently, they
had her wearing

628
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:23,889
some crown jewel type necklace
that's, uh, vanished,

629
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:25,324
so local law enforcement
is saying

630
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,826
it's a robbery gone wrong.

631
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,029
That's good for us,
keeps us out of it.

632
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,732
You get anything off
the prince's cell finally?

633
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:37,969
Yeah, it fits.

634
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:39,871
Saudis must have
made her somehow,

635
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:41,906
decided to take her out.

636
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,822
I want to talk to Prince Farid.

637
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,758
DC police already did.

638
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:00,361
I've got the interview,
if you want to see.

639
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,396
You okay?

640
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:08,936
This guy is a Marine, right?

641
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:12,240
I thought they were
supposed to be on time.

642
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:13,908
Okay, that's good, Tim.

643
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:15,510
I like that there.
Keep that.

644
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:17,945
Come on, let's go
put on your nice clothes.

645
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:24,518
Hey.

646
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:25,520
Hey.

647
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:26,554
You ready?

648
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,628
I'm gonna go change.

649
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,662
Mike.

650
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:42,906
Uh, uh... uh,
she was my employee.

651
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,742
Uh, for nearly two years.

652
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,211
And this necklace,
it was a present from you?

653
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,613
Yes.

654
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,149
To your employee?

655
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:54,253
I'm told it was worth
quite a lot of money.

656
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,755
She was worth a lot.

657
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,757
To me.

658
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,560
She was a beautiful soul.

659
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:06,331
She-She would never
hurt anybody.

660
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:09,668
So, wipe that look
off your face,

661
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:12,104
and you find out
who did this to her.

662
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,773
Find out!

663
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:18,310
It continues in that vein.

664
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:19,745
I need to talk to Farid.

665
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:21,513
Not possible.

666
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,616
If you don't trust me, you're
welcome to be in the room...

667
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,784
It's not gonna happen, Carrie.

668
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,152
They're at the airport by now,

669
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:27,420
heading back to the Gulf.

670
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:30,123
You let them leave?

671
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:36,495
If it makes a difference,
State Department made the call.

672
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,364
Said it wasn't worth
antagonizing the Saudis.

673
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:39,631
Yeah, you mean

674
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:43,302
she wasn't worth
antagonizing them.

675
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,371
It hurts to lose
an asset, Carrie.

676
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:46,772
I get that.

677
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,107
But she's gone.

678
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:49,809
And Abu Nazir
is still out there.

679
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:53,779
What we need now is a
new way to find him.

680
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:57,382
I'm sitting in the home of

681
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:00,018
Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody,

682
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:03,722
his wife Jessica, and his
two children Chris and Dana.

683
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:06,858
A family that put a
yellow ribbon on the tree

684
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:09,195
for eight years

685
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:13,166
while Sergeant Brody was
presumed dead in Iraq,

686
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,904
when, in fact, he was being
held as a prisoner of war

687
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:19,039
under brutal conditions.

688
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:23,010
So, a lot of adjustments
to make, I'm sure.

689
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:25,179
How has the homecoming been?

690
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:30,351
Well...

691
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:40,694
It's been great.

692
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:43,897
For all of us.

693
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:47,201
It's been really, really great

694
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:50,238
to have him back.

695
00:42:50,273 --> 00:42:52,909
And I hope it is for him, too.

696
00:42:52,943 --> 00:42:54,911
Coming home.

697
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:08,593
Carrie Mathison.

698
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,961
Yeah, they called.

699
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:11,029
You police?

700
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:12,797
State Department.

701
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:14,532
Did anyone notify the family?

702
00:43:14,566 --> 00:43:16,734
Yeah, they're here.

703
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,536
They are?
Yeah.

704
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,539
Drove all night
from Sandusky, Ohio.

705
00:43:21,573 --> 00:43:23,875
Never been to DC before.

706
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:25,877
What did you tell them?

707
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:27,212
Nothing.

708
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:30,649
It's all hush-hush.

709
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:33,118
They're not idiots, though.

710
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:37,557
They know her so-called job was
traveling with a Saudi prince.

711
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:39,092
I don't think
there's any illusions

712
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:40,660
what he was paying her for.

713
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,248
<i>She wasn't just some escort.</i>

714
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:04,750
<i>She worked for us.</i>

715
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:07,619
<i>She gave her life</i>
<i>for this country.</i>

716
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:09,421
That's what I wanted to say.

717
00:44:09,456 --> 00:44:11,857
That's what any human being
would say to these people,

718
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:14,760
that she was good, that we
owed it to her to protect her.

719
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:16,663
But I-I could not say that.

720
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:20,301
I couldn't say that because
it's a secret; I'm not allowed.

721
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:22,837
And I was thinking,
this is a fucked-up business.

722
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:24,438
This is
a fucked-up business,

723
00:44:24,473 --> 00:44:25,439
and I...

724
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:27,207
Are you done?
No.

725
00:44:27,242 --> 00:44:28,876
No, I'm just gonna keep
talking and talking,

726
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,844
so you can't say you have
some meeting to go to

727
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:32,646
or make up whatever other excuse
you're gonna make up,

728
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:34,148
so you don't have
to deal with me.

729
00:44:34,182 --> 00:44:35,149
Carrie.

730
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:40,655
Everyone's left.

731
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,224
There's no meetings to go to.

732
00:44:49,933 --> 00:44:53,001
She called me from the club...

733
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:54,602
ten minutes
before she was killed.

734
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:00,876
She asked if I had protection
on her, and I said yes.

735
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:09,752
What do you want me to say?

736
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:12,989
It matters?

737
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:16,392
It doesn't matter?

738
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,228
Don't worry, it'll all be fine?

739
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,429
Just say something.

740
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:21,097
Because when you cut me out,

741
00:45:21,131 --> 00:45:23,867
I'm all alone out here
and I can't stand it.

742
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,094
They made your informant.

743
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:53,064
Killed her.

744
00:45:57,436 --> 00:45:59,437
And I didn't stop them.

745
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:13,684
So, this transfer you had
everybody looking for...

746
00:46:15,587 --> 00:46:18,489
Never happened.

747
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:20,524
And now they're gone.

748
00:46:24,797 --> 00:46:27,098
But the prince was so
broken up about her--

749
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:30,102
really, really sad.

750
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:32,505
I-I can't believe he knew
they were going to kill her.

751
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,509
What made you think
he was even involved?

752
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,278
The video of him with Abu
Nazir that Lynne Reed shot.

753
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:40,681
Which was what exactly?

754
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:43,951
Their conversation was benign,
what little we could hear of it.

755
00:46:43,986 --> 00:46:46,687
<i>An exchange of pleasantries.</i>

756
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:48,957
<i>Nothing more.</i>

757
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:50,991
<i>Maybe Abu Nazir</i>
<i>really went on that boat</i>

758
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:52,359
<i>to talk to someone else.</i>

759
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:55,496
Someone in the
prince's entourage.

760
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,531
Someone without his means?

761
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:03,270
If the prince
wants to fund something,

762
00:47:03,304 --> 00:47:05,605
he's got the resources.

763
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,607
Not everbody does.

764
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:11,110
You're looking for
a money transfer, right?

765
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:14,546
<i>Transfer of money</i>
<i>from a nomadic culture</i>

766
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,115
<i>that has always known</i>

767
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:21,485
<i>jewelry is the easiest way</i>
<i>to move wealth.</i>

768
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,655
<i>Tell me again about</i>
<i>the necklace she was wearing.</i>

769
00:47:27,526 --> 00:47:30,294
Five hundred thousand.

770
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:33,097
Three-fifty.

771
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:36,100
Four hundred.

772
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:49,313
Where did the money go?

773
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,318
Could be anywhere.

774
00:47:54,353 --> 00:47:56,821
Congratulations.

775
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:58,756
Not many young couples
can manage

776
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,259
their first home all cash.

777
00:48:01,293 --> 00:48:02,526
Thank you.

778
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:04,528
I hope you'll be happy here.

779
00:48:04,563 --> 00:48:06,597
I'm, uh, I'm sure we will be.

780
00:48:18,643 --> 00:48:21,345
They say you get used
to the noise.

781
00:48:21,379 --> 00:48:22,713
We don't mind it.

782
00:48:22,747 --> 00:48:25,215
I like being close
to the airport.

783
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,618
For us, it's perfect.

784
