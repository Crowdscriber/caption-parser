1
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,681
Set them up over here.

2
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,910
Vice President Matthews.

3
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:32,164
- Bob.
- Mr. Vice President.

4
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,476
- Mr. Vice President.
- Frank.

5
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:00,609
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stand on your mark.

6
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm fine right here.

7
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:15,958
Two minutes, people.

8
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,667
So they pull me from the car.

9
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,171
Both legs broken,
fractured skull, punctured lung.

10
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:24,007
My heart stops. Two full minutes.

11
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,509
They're pumping my chest. Nothing.

12
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,595
They grab the
defibrillators. Pachoom!

13
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,264
Nothing.

14
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:33,225
Third time,
the pistons start firing.

15
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,560
Doctors tell me it's
a miracle I'm alive.

16
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,063
But, seriously, you talk about
a wake-up call from God.

17
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:41,733
You don't get to come
back from the dead twice.

18
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,405
The President of the United States.

19
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:03,505
Good morning.

20
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:04,881
"The education reform
and achievement act

21
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:07,050
that I sign into law today

22
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:10,053
will affect every child and
parent in the United States,

23
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:13,765
will ensure a better educated
workforce for decades to come,

24
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,977
and will reinforce
America's preeminence

25
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:18,895
as an intellectual superpower.

26
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,733
And I'd like to thank one man in particular

27
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:26,111
who never lost sight of the larger mission,

28
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:29,072
who spearheaded this
bill from the beginning,

29
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:31,241
and that's congressman
Frank Underwood."

30
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,636
Invited guests, please join us

31
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,513
in the east room for refreshments.

32
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,473
Media, we will convene immediately

33
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,185
in the briefing room
for our conference.

34
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,229
Linda, thank you so much for
all the help you gave us

35
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,230
in getting this bill passed.

36
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:27,566
No, thank you, Frank.

37
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,359
This was your baby
from the beginning.

38
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,611
I appreciate you standing your
ground on this one, Frank.

39
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:34,114
I'm smart enough to
admit when I was wrong.

40
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:36,616
I was just telling Frank
we should set up a weekly

41
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:38,618
so he can keep us up to date on
what's going on in the house.

42
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,370
That sounds like a great idea.

43
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,330
Congratulations, sir.

44
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:45,584
Garrett, I was wondering if we
could talk for a few minutes.

45
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,461
That thing I mentioned a couple of
weeks ago about the jobs tax credit...

46
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:49,671
I've been giving it a
lot of thought, Jim,

47
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:51,715
and I think it's a good idea.

48
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:54,467
But I'd like to look over my
notes first, if you don't mind,

49
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:56,803
so I can talk about it
intelligently with you.

50
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:59,056
Sir, you have your call
with the Prime Minister.

51
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:01,391
Busy man.

52
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,309
Yes, he is.

53
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,189
Frank, I hear that
you are heading up

54
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,233
the special election
in my home state.

55
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,817
- Peter Russo.
- We're trying to keep that

56
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:13,028
under the radar until
he officially announces.

57
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,655
In fact, we're not even working out
of my office until that happens.

58
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:18,324
- Where are you working from?
- The basement of my house.

59
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:22,204
Any reason why the D.N.C.
didn't ask my advice on the candidate?

60
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,748
Well, I thought they passed
it by you, or Linda did.

61
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:27,626
- Nobody did.
- Well, that is unacceptable.

62
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,502
And I have major
doubts about Russo.

63
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:33,048
His inexperience? - Yes,
and he's urban-based.

64
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,300
- Mm.
- I don't know if he'll connect with rural voters.

65
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,177
Look, frankly, that's one
of my concerns as well.

66
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:38,720
We're working on that.

67
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,347
But if you were to come
out and stump with him,

68
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:43,809
that would go a long
way to convince...

69
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,978
Frank, I can't stump for
somebody I don't believe in.

70
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,981
It's early days yet.
I'd ask you to keep an open mind.

71
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,398
And let me know if you want me

72
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,734
to set up a meeting
between the two of you,

73
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,236
because, sir,
an endorsement from you

74
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:56,113
would be a big coup for him.

75
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,406
It's good to see you,
Mr. Vice President.

76
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:00,325
Frank.

77
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:12,838
Congressman Underwood?

78
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:16,216
Miss Barnes,
I was under the impression

79
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:17,968
you didn't wanna cover
the White House.

80
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,385
Slugline just got access yesterday.

81
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,221
- I know.
- I left the herald

82
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,388
because I didn't wanna
cover the White House,

83
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,807
and now here I am.

84
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:26,392
Access isn't the same
as a ball and chain.

85
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:29,188
Am I only gonna see you
at bill signings now?

86
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,856
I haven't heard from
you in three weeks.

87
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,649
Insecurity bores me.

88
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,986
I feel the same way
about condescension.

89
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,445
Your place, this evening,

90
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,114
and I'll text you when
I'm about to arrive.

91
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:41,200
What if I'm busy?

92
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,785
You're just afraid I'm
gonna stand you up again.

93
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:46,121
I just wanna make sure
it's worth my while.

94
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,040
It'll be worth your while.

95
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,916
This'll make up for last time.

96
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,210
It's a piece of history.

97
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,920
From the President's hand to yours.

98
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:58,424
You believe in all that higher-power stuff

99
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,135
they talk about in the room?

100
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:03,180
I believe there are
things beyond our control.

101
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,307
Who or what's controlling them...
that I don't know.

102
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:07,226
I don't believe in God.

103
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:09,353
Heaven, hell. None of it.

104
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:12,397
- Too much catholic school?
- Maybe.

105
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,483
I'm not saying you have
to believe in God, Peter,

106
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,110
or anything, for that matter.

107
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,071
But you shouldn't
rule anything out.

108
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:27,662
I should go.

109
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:29,122
It's on the campaign.

110
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,639
Our cross tabs show 81% of likely voters

111
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,557
are willing to consider
a recovering alcoholic.

112
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,310
Now, those numbers dip a little

113
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:34,020
when you introduce cocaine,
but not by much. Randy?

114
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,814
It's a risk, but it'll make waves.

115
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,441
Free coverage across the board.

116
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:38,984
The narrative has to be redemption.

117
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,444
A Phoenix from the ashes.

118
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,404
Well, let's not focus on the ashes.

119
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,697
We don't want people to
think Peter was a disaster.

120
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:46,825
No, no. We focus on the positive.

121
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:48,243
A "fresh start" and a "clean start"

122
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:49,828
both did well in focus groups.

123
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,372
"Clean start" sounds too
much like "clean slate."

124
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,249
I like "fresh start."
Yeah, I do too.

125
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,542
- How we doing on the fund-raising?
- The alcoholic thing

126
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:57,752
will turn off some of
the in-state donors,

127
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,504
but it's an off-year election.

128
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:01,631
We can hit up the usual suspects
in New York and California.

129
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:04,092
Walter, how vulnerable are we?

130
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,428
I'm not prepared to
answer that question.

131
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:07,679
Peter and I have yet to perform

132
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,722
the holy sacrament of confession.

133
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:12,309
We still need to address
the shipyard closing too.

134
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,436
Claire's helping us with that.

135
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:15,770
We are pushing a bill

136
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:18,023
called the Delaware
river watershed act,

137
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,650
and I think it's going
to bring about 5,000 jobs

138
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:22,777
into Peter's district
over the next three years.

139
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:24,696
We have a draft of
the bill completed.

140
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,366
Peter's in the process
of securing cosponsors.

141
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,451
And who have you called,
by the way?

142
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:31,286
I have some e-mails out,

143
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:32,996
but most of them wanna
see a bill first.

144
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:34,456
Have you set up a meeting
with the shipbuilders yet?

145
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,208
I don't think they're
gonna back me.

146
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,335
That's the entire point
of the bill, Peter.

147
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:40,420
Well, if I go to them and I say,

148
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:42,672
"hey, some of you maybe
will get your jobs back,

149
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:45,258
"not tomorrow,
but three years from now,

150
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,344
and most of you won't be getting
your jobs back anyway... "

151
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:48,552
all right, let's put a pin in this

152
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:50,222
until we get more sponsors.

153
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:52,307
I have to go to the office.
I'll catch you all later.

154
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:54,017
Okay, let's move on
to our field plan.

155
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,977
I want to go through the
regions one by one...

156
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,063
Francis.

157
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,440
We spent six weeks on that bill.

158
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:03,026
It'll be fine. He'll come around.

159
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,238
I'll see you later tonight?

160
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,739
I have an appointment.

161
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,366
So I won't see you until morning.

162
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,743
I'll be back before you get up.

163
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:17,541
I appreciate your taking
the time today, sir.

164
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,125
Did you get that tax credit memo

165
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,793
the economic research
team put together?

166
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:23,088
You didn't ask me here
to talk about memos.

167
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,964
I know small talk
when I hear it, Linda.

168
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:26,341
The President has asked

169
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:28,427
that you take a step back from Pennsylvania.

170
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,803
You've been taking a lot of trips there,
meeting with legislators...

171
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,889
it's my home state.
There's a jobs crisis.

172
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,891
We can't afford to play favorites.

173
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:37,102
The message is 50 states,
one solution;

174
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,145
not one state, 50 solutions.

175
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,399
I never expected to be involved
in every policy or decision,

176
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,735
but I have been completely
cut out of everything.

177
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:48,196
We value your input,
Mr. Vice President,

178
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,407
- but right now, we can't...
- Don't condescend, Linda.

179
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,992
No one even asked me who I
thought should fill my seat.

180
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:55,495
Why is Frank Underwood leading
the charge on that, not me?

181
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:56,955
That is a D.N.C. issue.

182
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:59,374
We are staying out of
it and so should you.

183
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,586
And so I'm supposed to just cut
ribbons and go to funerals?

184
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:05,213
You knew what you signed up for.

185
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:08,425
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

186
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,221
I didn't get my pen.

187
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,891
- Your pen?
- From the bill signing.

188
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:20,353
Oh, we'll see what
we can do about that.

189
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,949
I can see your security guy.

190
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,950
Meechum?

191
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,578
He's cute.

192
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,704
He'd never go for you.

193
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,081
Why not?

194
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,874
You're too intimidating.

195
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,002
He's the one with the gun.

196
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,963
But you're the one
with the congressman.

197
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,258
Uh-uh.

198
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,051
We'll talk after.

199
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,095
We'll talk before.

200
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,932
Peter Russo.

201
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,767
Pennsylvania's first district.

202
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:01,645
He's gonna run for governor.

203
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:03,062
Fill Matthews' seat.

204
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:05,106
It's an exclusive profile.

205
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,317
With someone no
one's ever heard of.

206
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:09,027
What's the angle?

207
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,529
Alcohol, drugs.

208
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,364
He's a kid from the streets.

209
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,782
I want the profile to come
out as soon as he announces,

210
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,826
and I'd like it to be kind.

211
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:18,786
I don't write puff pieces.

212
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,997
Then get someone else to write it.

213
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,748
I thought you had something for me.

214
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,418
It's too easy for people
to link me as your source.

215
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,837
It's dangerous.

216
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:31,883
I don't benefit from handing
out headlines to other people.

217
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,518
Generosity is its own
form of power, Zoe.

218
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,734
Step six.

219
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,245
Step seven.

220
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,100
You always wear
sunglasses at night?

221
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,480
How did you find me?

222
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,774
I figured you had
to be in government.

223
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,317
I kept googling till
I found your picture.

224
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,319
This won't work, what you're doing.

225
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,405
It was a one-time deal.

226
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:38,366
- You don't get to keep coming back for more.
- I'll go to the police.

227
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,952
They'll laugh in your face.
Look at you.

228
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,622
If the police won't listen to me,

229
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,790
I'll call TV stations.

230
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,126
I know the names...

231
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,378
Douglas Stamper, Peter Russo,

232
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,213
Frank Underwood.

233
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:55,341
You are walking down a road
you do not want to walk down.

234
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:04,809
Please, I won't call anyone.

235
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,687
But I need your help.

236
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:10,315
I don't have anywhere to go.
I don't have anyone I can call.

237
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:13,485
I've had to do things.
And I don't wanna do it anymore.

238
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,829
That's all I've got right now.

239
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,707
Find a place to stay and
let me know where you are.

240
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,168
I'll figure something out.

241
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:40,637
You hungry?

242
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:52,607
What's your name?

243
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,025
Sapphire.

244
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:56,778
No. What's your name?

245
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:01,616
Rachel.

246
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:05,453
Your ex-wife... anything uncouth?

247
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:08,206
- How do you mean?
- Bondage, orgies, water sports?

248
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,082
- No. Definitely not.
- Narcotics?

249
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,794
- She wasn't into that.
- Not even a little ganga?

250
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,588
- Okay. Once in a blue moon.
- Ever with your children?

251
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,757
- God, no!
- Ever in front of them?

252
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:18,924
Look, I'm not the world's best dad,

253
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,719
but I would never do that.

254
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,303
Fine. Let's move
on to prostitution.

255
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:23,805
How long is this gonna take?

256
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:25,306
Until there's nothing I
don't know about you.

257
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,766
I wrote all this down.

258
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,686
I've been doing this a
long time, congressman.

259
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:31,979
I know when I've scraped
all the shit off the shoe.

260
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,609
Prostitution.

261
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:43,032
After my divorce, I took a trip to Thailand.

262
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,242
It was about two weeks.

263
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,036
How many women?

264
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:49,205
Ten. Fifteen.

265
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:52,375
- I... I don't know. It was a bit of a blur.
- There were drugs?

266
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,252
Uh, yes.

267
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:58,590
Opium, speed, some smack.

268
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,341
- Powder or needles?
- Both.

269
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:01,801
Would any of these
women know who you are?

270
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,636
No. None of them spoke English.

271
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,764
And I never mentioned
I was a congressman.

272
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,891
Have you mainlined heroin
back here in the States?

273
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,437
- Just once.
- Any scars on your arm?

274
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:15,273
No. I was mainly into cocaine.

275
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,442
What about prostitutes
here in D.C.?

276
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,068
How often?

277
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,909
- I fucked around a bit, okay?
- Details, please.

278
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,702
Do you get off on
this or something?

279
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:29,746
Does a doctor enjoy it
when he cups your balls

280
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:31,497
and asks you to cough?

281
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:33,165
You wanna know how
many times I came?

282
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,042
I honestly don't
care whether you win.

283
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:37,378
But if you do, work with me.

284
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,131
How often did you solicit
prostitutes in D.C.?

285
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,592
Once every two or three months.

286
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,302
Sometimes more frequently,
sometimes less.

287
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,095
Do you have reason to believe
any of them were underage?

288
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:47,931
Jesus! No. Look, they were mostly high-end.

289
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,181
That doesn't mean they were 18.

290
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:50,850
I need a fucking break!

291
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,067
What's going on?

292
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,653
He's an amateur, Frank.

293
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,613
If I can get under his
skin in less than an hour,

294
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,323
how do you think he'll
hold up under the press?

295
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:06,658
It'll be a Turkey shoot.

296
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:09,160
All right. I'll speak to him.

297
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,837
Frank, it's just...
it's not gonna work.

298
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:20,630
I'm gonna get crucified.

299
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:23,174
You'll be fine. We've got
a crack team behind you.

300
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,135
It doesn't matter how good the team is.
With my past? Come on.

301
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,638
From the very beginning,
I said this was the plan.

302
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,515
- You agreed to it.
- I didn't think it through.

303
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:32,767
We have to tackle this head-on,

304
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:35,060
or the G.O.P. will crucify you.

305
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,229
We have to steal their ammunition from them.

306
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,566
Honesty is your best
defense and offense.

307
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,235
I'm the one that has to get in front
of these cameras and say this shit.

308
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:45,237
They don't have to say it. I do.

309
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:47,198
- Peter...
- I wanna be governor. I do.

310
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,950
But not this way.
I just can't do it.

311
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,952
If you weren't unsure now,

312
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:53,245
there'd be something
wrong with you.

313
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:54,706
I expected this.

314
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,749
Not easy... what we're
asking you to do.

315
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,378
It's okay to vacillate a little.

316
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,129
I'm not trying to throw
a wrench in the works.

317
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,506
I know you're not.
I'll tell you what.

318
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,717
You take the rest of the day off.

319
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,845
You go back to your office, you catch up
with whatever you have to catch up on,

320
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:11,639
you get a good night's sleep,
you go to a meeting tomorrow,

321
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,183
and then you come here and we'll
talk the whole thing through.

322
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,811
Can you give me at least that?

323
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,813
Yeah. Okay, Frank.

324
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,732
Good.

325
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:43,421
What's going on with all
the little sculptures?

326
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,506
I found a flower on
the dining room table

327
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:49,010
and a bird on the nightstand a few days ago.

328
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,304
It's a swan.

329
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:53,973
You made them?

330
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:55,641
Yes.

331
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:57,727
A new hobby?

332
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:02,147
No.

333
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:04,275
It's an interest.

334
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:16,495
May I bring up something
else I've noticed?

335
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,248
What's that?

336
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,918
You...

337
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,921
Standing in front
of the refrigerator.

338
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,926
Is there a reason you haven't
talked to me about it?

339
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:32,095
I haven't felt the need to.

340
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:33,679
Is it bad?

341
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:38,977
It's not pleasant.

342
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,520
But, no, it's not bad.

343
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:42,814
What can I do?

344
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,776
Nothing.

345
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,903
If there was something, I'd ask.

346
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:03,334
- Did you think it was weird that I called you?
- Totally weird.

347
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:07,338
Except for the fact that I
was planning on calling you.

348
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,340
Really? Why?

349
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:12,051
I was a real grade-a bitch
to you at the herald,

350
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:15,304
and I almost apologized when
I saw you at the White House,

351
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:16,973
but I chickened out.

352
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:19,892
So, anyway, I am drunk enough,
and I am sorry.

353
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:21,936
Why did you call me?

354
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:25,314
I was just wondering how things were
going at the old stomping ground.

355
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:27,441
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

356
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:29,777
It's just not the
same since tom left.

357
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:32,655
And I don't blame you
for doing what you did.

358
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:36,450
But this new guy?
Six years running E.W. Online

359
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:38,661
does not a managing editor make.

360
00:22:38,662 --> 00:22:41,956
Would you ever wanna
come work with us?

361
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:43,749
I mean, it'd be a
huge fucking deal.

362
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,169
Chief political
correspondent of the herald

363
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,753
moves to Slugline?

364
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,839
Did carly heath put you up to this?

365
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,174
No. Not at all.

366
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,051
But if you want, I can talk to her.

367
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,345
You think she would go for it?

368
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:58,221
Honestly, I don't know.

369
00:22:58,222 --> 00:23:01,517
She's got this sort of
anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.

370
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:03,435
Conventional news bores her.

371
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:07,023
But if you had something
gritty to show...

372
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:11,194
I've got a story if you want it.

373
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:12,737
It's pretty fucking great.

374
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:14,446
You would give away a story?

375
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:15,907
If you're not interested...

376
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:18,117
no, I'm interested.

377
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,832
If I seem a little hung over,
it is because I am.

378
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,126
A lot hung over, actually.

379
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:29,754
God, I almost had a
couple of months,

380
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,798
and then last night, I...

381
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,135
Well, I don't remember much, so...

382
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,930
But anyway, here I am.

383
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,389
Keep coming back.

384
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,724
It works if you work it.

385
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:44,267
Thank you for sharing, Diane.

386
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:46,229
I'm Doug, and I'm an alcoholic.

387
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,897
Hi, Doug.

388
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:52,860
One of the things I do
for a living is count.

389
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,237
I count votes.

390
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:57,198
Yeas, nays, neutrals, abstaining.

391
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,575
And I'm good at it.

392
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:02,620
But the most important count I
do has nothing to do with work.

393
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:07,041
It's the number of days since April 4, 1999.

394
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:10,086
As of this morning, that's 5,185.

395
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:14,339
The bigger that number gets,
the more it frightens me,

396
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,218
because I know all it takes is
one drink to go back to zero.

397
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:21,889
Most people see fear as
a weakness. It can be.

398
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,018
Sometimes for my job,
I have to put fear in other people.

399
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,937
I know that's not right.

400
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:31,232
But if I'm honest,
like the fourth step asks us to be,

401
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,276
I have to be ruthless,

402
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:36,403
because failure is not an option.

403
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:38,405
The same goes for my sobriety.

404
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:41,242
I have to be ruthless with myself.

405
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:43,244
I have to use my fear.

406
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:44,996
It makes me stronger.

407
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:48,291
Like everyone in this room,
I can't control who I am.

408
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,542
But I can control the zero.

409
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:53,336
Fuck the zero.

410
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:56,048
Thanks for sharing.

411
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,217
It works if you work it.

412
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:00,803
Who would like to share next?

413
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:03,055
- Was he at the meeting?
- He was.

414
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,515
I tried to find him afterwards,

415
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,600
but he was gone before I
could catch up with him.

416
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:09,937
- Did he say anything?
- No. He never shares. He looked preoccupied.

417
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:12,898
- You think he'll show up at the house today?
- I have no idea.

418
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,483
He's not answering my calls.

419
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:17,903
Mine neither. Anything
else I need to know?

420
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:21,157
I hear silence.
I don't like that sound.

421
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:23,326
Something came up. I'm handling it.

422
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:25,828
- Something serious?
- Serious but solvable.

423
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:29,040
- Do I wanna know more?
- I don't think you do. We'll be okay.

424
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,876
I might have to involve Nancy.
I'm hoping I won't have to.

425
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:35,129
But if I do, she'll have no
knowledge of anything damaging.

426
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,173
All right. Use your best judgment.

427
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:39,091
Of course, sir.

428
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,801
I've gotta go.

429
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:42,427
Miss Gallagher?

430
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:45,388
Can the congressman have a moment?

431
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:50,393
Things are... they're complicated.

432
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:52,938
I realize that,
but he truly needs you.

433
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:54,857
I don't know what I
could say to him.

434
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:57,026
I think just showing up would
do him a world of good.

435
00:25:57,027 --> 00:25:59,444
Today is tough. The speaker
has a full schedule...

436
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:01,488
look, I already spoke to Bob,
and he said he'd be fine

437
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,157
if you took the
rest of the day off.

438
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:05,368
In fact, he said he'd be
fine if you wanted to take

439
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,870
- the next six months off.
- What?

440
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:10,122
I want you to be deputy
campaign manager.

441
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:12,457
You work under Nash Aarons.

442
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:22,593
No. I spent years being Peter's crutch.
If you just want me there...

443
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:25,512
well, of course we want you there to help,
but not as a crutch.

444
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:28,933
Peter is a talented young
man with a lot of potential.

445
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,601
He knows this,

446
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:33,145
but he needs to hear it
from someone other than me.

447
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:35,231
Someone he truly cares about.

448
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:39,235
I'm sorry. This is
just a lot right now.

449
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,778
Well, you don't have to make a decision now,

450
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:42,280
but at least talk to Peter.

451
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,198
I mean, there's no harm in that,
now, is there?

452
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,614
Ten grand.

453
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:27,616
We divert it from your
campaign accounts.

454
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:29,994
- We itemize it so it looks like...
- Wait.

455
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,454
You want me to pay for this?

456
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:33,538
Use Frank's reelection fund.

457
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,166
Commissioner, the majority of
the money that you've raised

458
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,293
has come from people
we've sent your way.

459
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:40,045
And you sent them because I sprung
your boy Russo in the first place.

460
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:42,131
We're even. I don't owe you shit.

461
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:45,301
There's a girl in trouble.
Let's help her out.

462
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:50,097
- Not my problem.
- It could be.

463
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:52,975
We put her back on the streets,
there's no telling what she could do.

464
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:55,144
I'm a hell of a lot more afraid

465
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:58,356
of the U.S. attorney
than I am of some hooker.

466
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:01,566
This is a very inexpensive insurance policy.

467
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,068
I already broke the law once, Doug.

468
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:04,736
There's no fucking way

469
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:07,114
I'm gonna mess with campaign
finance regulations.

470
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:10,575
I don't even wanna
be hearing this shit.

471
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:19,751
Funeral for the former
ambassador of Japan

472
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:21,586
tomorrow at 9:30,

473
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:24,631
followed by a luncheon for the
national board of directors

474
00:28:24,632 --> 00:28:26,217
for the girl scouts of America.

475
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:28,135
- Mr. President.
- Jim.

476
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:30,221
After that, you've got a meet
and greet with the finalist...

477
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,431
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

478
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,679
This way, sir.

479
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:09,945
Hi.

480
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,448
Hey.

481
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:14,074
What are you doing here?

482
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:17,244
The congressman wanted
me to come over.

483
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:20,331
- Why?
- He wants me to work for your campaign.

484
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:22,207
- Deputy Manager.
- Frank!

485
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,420
He said you're having some doubts.

486
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:34,345
I was just about to tell him
that I decided not to run.

487
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:37,598
Oh. Oh.

488
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:42,146
Okay. Um, if you've
made up your mind,

489
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:44,398
then I should probably get going.

490
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,443
Did he tell you about the whole plan?
About coming clean?

491
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:49,194
Yeah, he did.

492
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:53,282
I have Kevin and
Sarah to think about.

493
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:55,367
- Everyone has a past.
- Not like mine.

494
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:57,411
You don't know half the
things I've done, Christina.

495
00:30:57,412 --> 00:31:00,664
My kids read. Their friends read.
I can't take that chance.

496
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:03,875
Look, if you don't wanna run,
then you shouldn't.

497
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:08,422
I do wanna run. I wouldn't have let
it go this far if I didn't want it.

498
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:11,383
Then maybe it's a good thing...

499
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:13,552
confronting your past,
even for your kids.

500
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:16,430
They're a lot stronger than
you give them credit for.

501
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:20,351
Look, if Underwood, if the D.N.C.,

502
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:23,354
if they all think you
can do it, then...

503
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:26,064
I don't care what they think.
I care what you think.

504
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:29,652
I think you'd be great.

505
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:36,367
- So, she really wants this?
- That's the impression I got.

506
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:39,370
What about ego? I don't need
to be dealing with a diva.

507
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:41,497
She's not a diva,
she's an award-winning journalist

508
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:43,415
with 15 years' experience.

509
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,083
You told me she
treated you like shit.

510
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:46,544
There was some friction.

511
00:31:46,545 --> 00:31:48,379
So why are you going
to bat for her?

512
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,047
Don't we want to work
with the best people?

513
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:51,590
Plus, it'd be big for the site.

514
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,551
The herald's senior
political writer?

515
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:55,927
Sure, but she's so old guard.
Everything's by the book.

516
00:31:55,928 --> 00:31:58,889
- There's no bite to it.
- She told me about a profile she's working on.

517
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,932
- It's got serious bite.
- What is it?

518
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:04,478
She can tell you herself.
You should talk to her.

519
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,702
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

520
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,745
Here's the deal.

521
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:25,082
My children stay out
of the limelight.

522
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,335
No photo ops, no press.

523
00:32:28,336 --> 00:32:31,255
We wouldn't dream of it.

524
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:36,552
Okay.

525
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:39,388
Let's do this.

526
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:23,848
Sit down.

527
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:42,993
- Where you from?
- Outside of Lynchburg.

528
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:45,370
- Virginia?
- Yeah.

529
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:48,290
- Are your parents still living there?
- No. I can't.

530
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:55,839
If I find a place for
you to stay for a while,

531
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,050
can I count on you to be smart?

532
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,219
- What kind of place?
- A nice place.

533
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,015
A safe place until we can
figure out something permanent.

534
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,644
But I need to know

535
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,937
that you won't pull
anything like this again.

536
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:12,939
Promise me.

537
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,107
I promise.

538
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:16,694
Look at me when you say it.

539
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:19,904
I promise you.

540
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:26,119
How you doing on money?

541
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,038
I don't have enough for tomorrow.

542
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:44,304
What are you doing?

543
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:50,935
- I thought you wanted me to...
- You said you were done with that.

544
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:03,948
I'll be in touch.

545
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,332
If you own up to some
of the shenanigans,

546
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,918
sweep the rest under the rug,
you might have a shot.

547
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:17,671
How much do we have to sweep under?

548
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:20,591
Well, the kid had a talent
for covering his tracks.

549
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:23,844
I've highlighted all the items
I think he should admit to.

550
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:25,429
The rest I wouldn't mention.

551
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,890
It's a lot not to talk about.

552
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:35,397
- I need your help with something.
- Right now?

553
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,441
- Yes.
- Is it important?

554
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:39,526
Because you told me I could
leave early this weekend

555
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:41,570
to go visit my daughter
down in Virginia.

556
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,572
You have a guest room
in your house, right?

557
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:45,824
Well, it's Mary's old room,
but, yes.

558
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:48,410
I need you to put someone up
for a while. A young woman.

559
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,788
- What? Who?
- Her name is Rachel.

560
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:52,414
I can't tell you anymore than that.

561
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,875
I don't understand.
Why do you need...

562
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:57,419
no questions, Nancy.
I just need you to do this for me.

563
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,755
I wouldn't be asking
if it weren't serious.

564
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,047
Put up for how long?

565
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,634
I don't know. It could be a while.

566
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:06,511
I'm supposed to put up a complete
stranger and not ask any questions?

567
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:09,723
Nancy, please. You're the
only person I can trust.

568
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:11,516
Is something illegal going on?

569
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:14,102
No. She's just a girl in trouble
who needs a place to stay.

570
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,980
- We have to be discreet.
- Can I at least meet her first?

571
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:19,107
I need to know now.

572
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:22,527
Okay, I guess.

573
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:26,197
Thank you.

574
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,620
There's no catch, Larry.

575
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:35,081
Your district gets over 20
million if the numbers hold.

576
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,961
And most of the money is earmarked

577
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,921
for economic development,
not research.

578
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,590
That's great, but I need
more than your support.

579
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:47,552
I need you to be a sponsor.

580
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,346
Fantastic, Larry.

581
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,974
Great. I'll put you down.

582
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:53,976
You too. Bye.

583
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:57,562
So that just leaves
Clayburn... and Price?

584
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,315
- With Jennings on the fence.
- And I know Roger. I'll call him.

585
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:02,651
And I'll track down these
other two over the weekend.

586
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,069
Really good work today, Peter.

587
00:37:08,365 --> 00:37:10,283
Do you know where I put my purse?

588
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:12,452
- It's right here.
- Oh.

589
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:15,330
Did you make those? I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

590
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:18,709
Oh, this? I've been fooling
around with it a little bit.

591
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,629
Can I see? Sarah learned how to
make these birds in her art class.

592
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,798
Then she taught it to Kevin,
and they got obsessed,

593
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:27,091
and there were little pieces of
paper all over the apartment.

594
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,594
- Do you wanna take them for the kids?
- Oh, no. I can't.

595
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,597
Oh, please. I'll just
throw them out eventually.

596
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:35,058
Thank you. They'll love them.

597
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,434
So you should bring the kids

598
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:38,729
by the house sometime
so I can meet them.

599
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,314
Kevin and Frank can
play the video games.

600
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:44,026
- He told you that?
- I was a little surprised, I have to admit.

601
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,653
If anybody knew he came home every day to...

602
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:49,364
- it's embarrassing.
- There's worse secrets to have.

603
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:51,658
Yeah, there are, I suppose.

604
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,454
I'll call you Monday after I
talk to Clayburn and Price.

605
00:37:56,455 --> 00:37:58,582
Okay, great.
Have a good weekend, Peter.

606
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,625
You too.

607
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:04,546
I had Linda talk to
the Vice President.

608
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:07,131
- He'll keep his nose out of it.
- I appreciate that.

609
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:10,260
He's a good man, but this is a very
delicate moment in the campaign.

610
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,387
- You start spreading doubts, and...
- He's a pain in the ass.

611
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:15,223
We all know it. You don't
have to mince words, Frank.

612
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:19,269
I have to say, sir,
the Vice President has a point.

613
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,272
I'm not 100% sold on Russo.

614
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:24,900
Do we really wanna go with
someone this untested?

615
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,569
- Frank?
- We're grooming him, sir.

616
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,237
- When do you announce?
- Next month.

617
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:31,615
- That's not enough time.
- What do you see in him?

618
00:38:31,616 --> 00:38:35,368
I was wondering the same thing.
There's not that much to see.

619
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,249
What I see is a
recovering alcoholic

620
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,834
with a history of drug abuse.

621
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:45,295
- What?
- Excuse me, Frank?

622
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:47,380
But he's clean now.
Has been for a year.

623
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:49,674
This is a redemption story,
Mr. President.

624
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,469
This is a bright young man who's
put his life back on track.

625
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,638
Now he wants to help put
Pennsylvania back on track.

626
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,809
- Drugs, Frank?
- People love an underdog, Linda,

627
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,812
and people love someone who
stands up after they've fallen.

628
00:39:01,813 --> 00:39:04,522
Combine those two,
it's a very powerful narrative.

629
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,524
All of our polling indicates
this is gonna work.

630
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:08,735
You want us to endorse someone
with a history of substance abuse?

631
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:11,905
Let us get his story out there and
watch it connect with the voters.

632
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,448
All I care about is a win, Frank.

633
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,408
And I believe Russo
is our best chance.

634
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,285
This is not a hail Mary,
Mr. President,

635
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,579
- this is a well-thought-out game plan.
- Mr. President...

636
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,165
I realize that I sometimes
think out of the box,

637
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:26,086
but the last time I did,
we signed an education bill.

638
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,843
All right. We won't
stand in your way.

639
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:36,262
- But if it backfires, Frank...
- I'll guide Peter every step along the way.

640
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:38,222
We will not disappoint you,
Mr. President.

641
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:39,724
Okay.

642
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,185
Thank you, sir.

643
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:44,146
Linda.

644
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,857
I didn't plan on telling
him so much so soon,

645
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:49,275
but if I didn't,
Linda would've swayed him.

646
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:51,945
There's no better way to
overpower a trickle of doubt

647
00:39:51,946 --> 00:39:53,822
than with a flood of naked truth.

648
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:56,074
This is why the education
bill was so important.

649
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,577
It bought me influence precisely
when I needed it most.

650
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:05,500
How long have you been drinking?

651
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,418
A long time. Since I was a kid.

652
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:09,713
How old were you when you
had your first drink?

653
00:40:09,714 --> 00:40:11,840
- Nine.
- Nine years old?

654
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,217
Yeah. My dad gave me a
beer for my ninth birthday.

655
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:16,761
When did you first
start using drugs?

656
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:19,848
I won't go into too many specifics

657
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:22,517
other than to say I had
a few minor brushes

658
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:25,228
with marijuana and cocaine
in the past but not recently,

659
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:27,022
and only a handful of times.

660
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,733
No other drugs besides
marijuana and cocaine?

661
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:31,359
No.

662
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,153
Under what circumstances?

663
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:35,906
Occasional social gatherings.
That's the most I'll say.

664
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,657
Ever while you were
in public office?

665
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:40,035
No. Never. My chief
problem was alcohol.

666
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:44,539
And you've been sober how long now?

667
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,584
- A little over a year.
- And what made you want to get sober?

668
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:52,214
Two things. My children,

669
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:55,759
whom I love more than
anything else in the world,

670
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,886
and my renewed faith in God.

671
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:15,987
Zoe.

672
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:18,489
Lucas.

673
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:23,661
I was just in the neighborhood,
and I thought...

674
00:41:23,662 --> 00:41:27,457
No. That's a lie. I was at
the bar around the corner.

675
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,459
The one with the, uh...

676
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,753
and I remembered that time

677
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:34,172
that I dropped you off after work.

678
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,591
I knew it was...

679
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:38,342
This block.

680
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:43,640
And I, uh, buzzed,
and then I waited...

681
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:46,268
- you're wasted.
- I'm pretty wasted.

682
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:03,701
Do you wanna know a deep,
dark secret?

683
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:20,510
Now we don't work together...

684
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:24,306
Anymore.

685
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,948
Lucas...

686
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:44,326
I'm really flattered.

687
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,537
But I'm just not in a place

688
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:51,708
where I'm even thinking
romantically right now.

689
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:59,090
I'm sorry. I, uh...

690
00:43:00,884 --> 00:43:02,969
Yeah.

691
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:07,849
Hey, hey!

692
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:34,334
You want me to pull up now, sir?

693
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:04,989
I still have my key.

694
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:45,655
I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything.

695
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:47,740
Thank you.

696
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:27,864
Hey, I got us wine, but I can't
find a corkscrew anywhere.

697
00:45:27,865 --> 00:45:30,074
Give it to me.

698
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:33,077
I need a pen.

699
00:45:35,288 --> 00:45:38,082
- The pen the President gave you?
- That'll work.

700
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:51,429
Did you talk to Ms. Skorsky?

701
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,516
I did. She said it was intense.

702
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:56,976
I think Carly's gonna offer
her a job at Slugline.

703
00:45:56,977 --> 00:45:59,812
- Was that your doing?
- Janine expressed interest.

704
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:02,065
I took the next step.

705
00:46:02,066 --> 00:46:05,693
Well done. Always good
to be owed favors.

706
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,698
I was wondering.
Do you ever think about my age?

707
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:13,076
No. Does my age bother you?

708
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:16,413
You must have other lovers...
men that are younger than me.

709
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:18,206
- No.
- Not that I would mind.

710
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:20,500
I am married, after all.

711
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:24,337
I don't have time for other lovers.

712
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:26,005
Mm.

713
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,176
Mm. Shit.

714
00:46:30,177 --> 00:46:32,470
It's turned. Give me that.

715
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:33,846
Mm.

716
00:46:47,444 --> 00:46:50,780
You could've just stepped on it.

717
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:55,535
I have asked the super to get an
exterminator in here, and he won't do it.

718
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:57,870
So anytime I see a cockroach
or a spider, or whatever,

719
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:00,790
I try and trap it,
and then I leave it by his door.

720
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:01,916
You really ought
to get your parents

721
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,585
to let you borrow some money.

722
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:05,545
Then you wouldn't have to
live in the third world.

723
00:47:05,546 --> 00:47:07,589
I would never take money from them.

724
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,467
Because they don't have it,
or because you don't want it.

725
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:12,594
Because I don't want it.

726
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:14,804
It's father's day, you know.

727
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:16,347
It is?

728
00:47:16,348 --> 00:47:17,932
You should call your father.

729
00:47:17,933 --> 00:47:19,892
I'll call him tomorrow.

730
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:22,395
Tomorrow you'll be the daughter
that forgot father's day

731
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:24,814
instead of the one who remembered.

732
00:47:24,815 --> 00:47:27,358
Go ahead. Call him.

733
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:40,746
Hey, dad. Sorry it's so late.

734
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:43,500
'Cause you weren't home the
last time I called her.

735
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:47,420
There's so little she'll ever
reveal to me or I to her.

736
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:49,422
I bet her father knows even less.

737
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:52,258
I'm sure she's speaking
half an octave higher.

738
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:54,469
Same voice she had when she was 16.

739
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,471
Telling him all about her new job,

740
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:57,721
how much she misses him,

741
00:47:57,722 --> 00:47:59,932
and sorry she didn't send a card.

742
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:02,768
Telling him everything
but the truth.

743
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:06,022
Just like she wouldn't tell me
about that young man downstairs.

744
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:07,524
I'm calling now, all right?

745
00:48:07,525 --> 00:48:09,233
Don't make me feel bad about it.

746
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:11,944
It was the best thing
that could've happened.

747
00:48:11,945 --> 00:48:13,779
I didn't fit in there.

748
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,449
I've been called worse, dad.

749
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,909
There's a value in having secrets.

750
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,871
Creatures like myself,
like Claire, like Zoe...

751
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:24,040
we wouldn't be
ourselves without them.

752
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,042
But Peter Russo,
on the other hand...

753
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:28,211
he's trapped by his secrets.

754
00:48:28,212 --> 00:48:30,463
What I'm trying to do is
give him the opportunity

755
00:48:30,464 --> 00:48:31,881
to set himself free.

756
00:48:31,882 --> 00:48:33,424
I don't know.

757
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:37,719
I don't know yet.

758
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,139
After all, we are
nothing more or less

759
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,932
than what we choose to reveal.

760
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:44,352
What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe,

761
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:47,188
just as Zoe is not to me
what she is to her father.

762
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:54,696
Probably Thanksgiving.

763
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:01,202
'Cause I don't think I can
make it back before then.

764
00:49:10,962 --> 00:49:12,922
Okay. I'll try.

765
00:49:16,175 --> 00:49:18,010
I said I'll try.

766
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:22,390
For Christmas. Uh... no.

767
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:26,603
Mm-mm.

768
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:32,525
No. I'm not seeing
anyone right now.

769
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:34,360
I don't feel like it.

770
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,032
Because I'm not interested in that.

771
00:49:42,535 --> 00:49:45,413
I would tell you, dad. Uh-huh.

772
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:47,457
Yeah.

773
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,878
Okay.

774
00:49:55,047 --> 00:49:56,882
Don't be worried about me.

775
00:49:56,883 --> 00:49:58,635
I'm fine.

776
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:01,220
Yeah.

777
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:05,266
Dad, I'm in...

778
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:07,851
I'm in a really great
place right now.

779
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:17,819
I'm gonna try.

780
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,616
I'm gonna try to come, okay?

781
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,789
Happy Father's Day.

782
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:49,059
Aren't you gonna wish
me a happy Father's Day?

783
00:50:50,102 --> 00:50:52,313
You don't have any children.

784
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:55,358
Don't I?

785
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:06,035
