1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,135
<i>Previously on</i>Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:06,271
Do not discuss me
with Hannibal Lecter.

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,474
I brought gideon back
because I thought he may be

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,743
useful in Will Graham's therapy.

5
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,246
I'm going to give you a chance
to save Will from himself.

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,281
Who does he want
to kill, doctor?

7
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,417
I want you to kill
Hannibal Lecter.

8
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:22,121
Will Graham is not a murderer.
He asked you to do this.

9
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,058
Get an ambulance!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

11
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,553
You're moving smoothly
and slowly, Jack.

12
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:32,324
Carrying your concentration
like a brimming cup.

13
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,160
Hannibal Lecter was
almost murdered...

14
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,132
By an employee
of this hospital.

15
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,135
An attendant

16
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:46,738
who we believe is
the person that...

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,808
Killed the bailiff and the judge
at your murder trial.

18
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,578
He killed the bailiff;
He didn't kill the judge.

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,316
That was the chesapeake ripper.
You know this?

20
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,717
He told me.

21
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,253
Then you told him
to kill Hannibal.

22
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,424
Nothing I said
made that happen, Jack.

23
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:08,160
It just happened.

24
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,864
It just happened.

25
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,233
You don't seem to be
too broken up about it.

26
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,636
There's a common emotion
we all recognize

27
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,771
and have not yet named.

28
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,512
The happy anticipation of being
able to feel contempt.

29
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,181
You feel contempt
for Hannibal?

30
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,618
Well, I have contempt for
the ripper. I have contempt
for what he does.

31
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,154
- And what does he do?
- What does he do?

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,892
What is the first and principal
thing he does?

33
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,729
What need does he serve
by killing?

34
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:47,366
- He harvests organs.
- No, that's only

35
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,235
the action of what he does.
Why does he need to do it?

36
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:55,240
The ripper kills in sounders
of three or four in quick order.

37
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,644
Do you know why?

38
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,447
I know why.

39
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,622
Then tell me.

40
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:15,861
Because if he waits too long,
then the meat spoils.

41
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,331
He's eating them?

42
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,601
Hannibal is like Garrett
Jacob hobbs? A cannibal?

43
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,736
No, not like
Garrett Jacob hobbs.

44
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,939
Hobbs ate his victims
to honor them;

45
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,642
the ripper eats his victims
because they're no better
to him than pigs.

46
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,780
With the exception
of Beverly katz, there is no

47
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,649
connection between Hannibal
and any ripper victims.

48
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,718
No immediate connection.

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,423
Hannibal Lecter is not
the chesapeake ripper.

50
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,991
If the ripper's killing,

51
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,627
you can bet Hannibal Lecter's
planning a dinner party.

52
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,664
You and I probably sipped wine
while swallowing the people

53
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,334
to whom we were trying
to give justice, Jack.

54
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,277
Who does he have to kill
before you open your eyes?

55
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,685
A remarkably lean organ,
the heart, yet such a potent

56
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,887
symbol of life...

57
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,291
And the things
that make us human -

58
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:23,495
good and bad, love and ache.

59
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,698
All of them skewered.

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
It's a thematic dish.

61
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,005
My heart certainly
feels skewered.

62
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,577
You have the scars
to prove it.

63
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,813
It feels as if that noose is
still around my neck.

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,486
Strange having nightmares;
I never used to.

65
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:51,823
Don't make the same
mistake I've made -

66
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,893
being your own psychiatrist.

67
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:59,631
I'm always assessing my feelings
instead of acting on them.

68
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,768
It's the safest course.

69
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,539
You have to find a way to deal
with what happened to you.

70
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,477
I'm metabolizing
the experience

71
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,713
by composing
a new piece of music.

72
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,585
Harpsichord or theremin?

73
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,421
Harpsichord.

74
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:26,358
Stravinsky said a true composer

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,361
thinks about his unfinished work
the whole time.

76
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,831
He's not always conscious
of this, but he's aware of it

77
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
when he suddenly knows
what to do.

78
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,601
And do you know what to do?

79
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,004
I need to get
my appetite back.

80
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,154
What do we got?

81
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:05,690
He's literally grafted
in place. These are

82
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,161
living roots.
He's got varicose vines.

83
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:11,630
Threaded through, uh,
from his heels,

84
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:15,967
under his legs, his back,
through his torso, out
his fingertips.

85
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,838
Followed some pretty tricky
endoscopic surgical paths.

86
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,441
Chesapeake ripper usually
cherry-picks his organs.

87
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,577
He took almost all of them;
Everything but the lungs.

88
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,653
The time that he devotes
to his work...

89
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,622
He really takes pride.

90
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,659
Belladonna for the heart.

91
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,894
Chain of white oleander
for the intestines.

92
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,796
Ragwort for the liver.

93
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,998
These flowers are
all poisonous.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,134
Yes. This is a judgment.

95
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,070
The ripper believes
that his victim was...

96
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:56,641
Toxic somehow, a poisonous man.

97
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,145
He's so damn certain
he makes me sick.

98
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,894
There is a pattern taking shape.

99
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,598
I just have to convince my eyes
to see it.

100
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,867
I've convinced myself

101
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,970
of something I had refused
to see for a long time.

102
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,907
And it only took Will Graham
trying to kill you to see it?

103
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,642
Yes.

104
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:34,179
I can't help Will.

105
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,981
I can't trust him.

106
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,052
He's in a dark place
where the shadows move

107
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,788
and it's not safe
to stand with him anymore.

108
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,724
I feel the same way.

109
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:53,765
We, um... Found another

110
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,735
ripper victim...
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't.

111
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,306
Not only do I have to
let Will go;

112
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,575
I have to let this all go.

113
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,179
I nearly died.

114
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,882
I would have,
if it weren't for you.

115
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm sorry,

116
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,322
but I can't dwell
on death anymore.

117
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,324
I don't blame you.

118
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,259
We both have to transform

119
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,262
our misfortunes
into life-enhancing events.

120
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:30,869
Well, when you figure out
how to do that, do let me know.

121
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,140
I'm going to start
by hosting a dinner party.

122
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,279
And please tell me you'll come.

123
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,214
I wouldn't miss it.

124
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,158
You should've let him die.

125
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,261
Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

126
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,967
He's gonna kill you,
you know.

127
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,202
Can't get me in here.

128
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,973
No, here is exactly
where he'll get you, Abel.

129
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,109
The moment I convinced
the chief of staff to put you

130
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,747
in a cell next to me, you were
stamped with an expiration date.

131
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:20,185
Anyone who gets too close
gets got.

132
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:26,291
He's the devil,
remember? Smoke.

133
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,629
I'd be very nervous
if I was Dr. chilton.

134
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,998
<i>He's getting close too.</i>

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,100
<i>The only way</i>
<i>you and Frederick are gonna</i>

136
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,302
<i>get out of this alive</i>
<i>is if the chesapeake</i>

137
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,938
<i>ripper is stopped.</i>

138
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,375
Hannibal Lecter deserves
to die.

139
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,344
You didn't bring me here to
help you kill Hannibal Lecter.

140
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,947
No, I didn't; I brought you
here to bear witness.

141
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,916
To tell Jack Crawford
that I sat

142
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:55,387
in Hannibal Lecter's
cobalt-blue dining room,

143
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,956
an ostentatious herb garden

144
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,993
<i>with leda and the swan</i>
<i>over the fireplace and you</i>
<i>having a fit in the corner.</i>

145
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,229
That's where I asked him
if he was the chesapeake ripper,

146
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,333
and he avoided the question and
suggested I kill alana bloom.

147
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,703
Yes.

148
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,304
Tell Jack that.

149
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,774
I'll tell Jack Crawford
everything

150
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,710
if you tell me
why Hannibal did it.

151
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,752
Because he wanted to see
what would happen.

152
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,856
<i>That's where I asked him</i>
<i>if he was the chesapeake ripper</i>

153
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:36,094
and he avoided the question and
<i>suggested I kill alana bloom.</i>

154
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,899
Abel gideon is a lunatic.

155
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:45,470
He is psychotic, not psychic.

156
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,472
We know that gideon has

157
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,442
a history of being
susceptible to suggestion.

158
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:55,080
The simplest explanation
as to why he can describe
Hannibal Lecter's home

159
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,382
is that he was
in Hannibal Lecter's home.

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,754
Will Graham could've
given him the details.

161
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,756
No such details were given.

162
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:08,226
There has not been a word
exchanged between those two men

163
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,862
in my hospital
that I have not heard.

164
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,733
Then you're aware what Will is
accusing Hannibal Lecter of.

165
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,968
Oh, yes.

166
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,470
I am aware.

167
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,139
And I am grateful
that I have trouble digesting

168
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,975
animal proteins,
as the last meals I have shared

169
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,144
with Hannibal Lecter
have all been salads.

170
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,413
Do you believe him?

171
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,784
Hannibal once served me tongue
and then made a joke
about eating mine.

172
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,457
It would be narrow
to not at least consider it.

173
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,260
Will is delusional.
He would like

174
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,897
to reinforce his delusion
with you, with me,

175
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,532
with Abel gideon.

176
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,168
That doesn't mean
he is not right.

177
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,837
No, it doesn't.

178
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,979
The chesapeake ripper is
killing again...

179
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,916
And Hannibal Lecter is
throwing a dinner party.

180
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,019
Jack, he fits the profile.

181
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,822
He is attracted to medical

182
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:16,161
and psychological fields because
they offer power over man.

183
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,229
Cannibalism...

184
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,301
Cannibalism is
an act of dominance.

185
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,269
His name's Sheldon isley!

186
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,605
A Baltimore city councilman!

187
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,241
Ripper's a politician now!

188
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,978
At least a conservationist.

189
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,614
Five, six years ago, isley

190
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:47,619
brokered a woodlands
development deal despite
the disapproval of the epa.

191
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:51,089
So the councilman paved
paradise and put up
a parking lot.

192
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,392
Well, what he paved was
an important nesting habitat

193
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,395
for endangered songbirds.
The son of a bitch.

194
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,131
He was wearing this
as a crown.

195
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,300
Autopsy report

196
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,936
gave us what you'd expect
from the chesapeake ripper -

197
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,405
pre-mortem surgical dissection,
latex glove impressions,

198
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,108
body was posed
before rigor set in.

199
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,111
- What did the lungs cough up?
- Water.

200
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:17,482
The councilman was drowned,
lungs filled with aspirated
water. He was standing in water

201
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,518
up to his thighs for
48 to 72 hours before he died.

202
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,088
- To feed the tree.
- Possibly.

203
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,658
Now, here's
the exciting part.

204
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,527
Tree man actually bears fruit.

205
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,298
Diatoms. Unicellular colonies.
Good as fingerprints -

206
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,367
no two water sources have
the same diatom population.

207
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:41,239
Water in the lungs gives us
location of death. Show me.

208
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:45,610
Here, in a 50-mile radius.

209
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,584
My head is filled

210
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,421
with conspiracies.
Too many versions of events

211
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,189
he said she said.

212
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,592
He said she said he said.
It's just maddening.

213
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,995
In my experience, that means

214
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,998
a lot of people are lying
about a lot of different things.

215
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,635
Well, the one thing I have
clarity on is Will Graham
tried to kill Hannibal.

216
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,571
And thinks
it was a righteous act.

217
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,574
Well, that says more about
Will than it does
about Hannibal.

218
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,011
Hannibal's been a teacher,

219
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,246
a mentor, and a friend.
I've known him before

220
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:25,650
you or Will or any of this.
I don't claim to know anyone.

221
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,089
I look at these dogs,

222
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,692
I see the best part of Will.

223
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,762
But he's lying.
He's manipulating.

224
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:41,232
He's playing a game and
he's not scared, not anymore.

225
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,470
That's what's
making him dangerous.

226
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,347
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

227
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,756
I feel like I've been
watching our friendship
on a split-screen.

228
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,827
The friendship
I perceived on one side

229
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,430
and the truth on the other.

230
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:49,500
It's a terrible
feeling, isn't it?

231
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,439
You've been lying
to me, Will.

232
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:58,242
Well, I-I don't have
a gauge for reality

233
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,312
that works well enough
to know if I've been lying.

234
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,348
But you understand the reality
of Beverly katz's death.

235
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,417
You understand
your role in that.

236
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,220
What was my role?

237
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,223
Beverly died at your behest.

238
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,159
You are as angry with yourself

239
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,728
as you are
with whoever murdered her.

240
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,731
Actually...

241
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,469
I am singularly angry
with whoever murdered her.

242
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,408
You tried to kill me, Will.

243
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,478
It's hard
not to take that personally.

244
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,380
However, if I were
Beverly's murderer...

245
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,551
I'd applaud your effort.

246
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,454
Oh, I'm no more guilty
of what you've accused me of

247
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,824
than you are
of what I've accused you of.

248
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,662
I don't expect you
to feel self-loathing

249
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,598
or regret, or shame.

250
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,900
You knew what you were doing,

251
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,902
and you made
your own decisions,

252
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,538
decisions that were
under your control.

253
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,374
Oh, you think I'm in control?

254
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:08,779
I think you are
more in control now
than you have ever been.

255
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,449
You found a way to hurt me.

256
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,723
I wonder how many more people
are going to get hurt
by what you do.

257
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,794
I'll give alana bloom
your best.

258
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,665
Goodbye, Will.

259
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:17,041
So, it seems all the king's
horses and all the king's men

260
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,543
could indeed put humpty
together again.

261
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,015
Is everything back
where I found it?

262
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:26,384
With one or two exceptions.

263
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,022
I know people
who consider me autocratic.

264
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,624
I'm not the most loved
of administrators,

265
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,495
but that nurse you murdered,
she was well-liked.

266
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,497
And so were the attendants
you killed.

267
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:43,000
There is nothing
like grief and trauma

268
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,470
to pull people together.

269
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,840
Jack Crawford would like
to have a word with you.

270
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:54,612
I trust you Will
behave yourself, Abel.

271
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,053
I'm sure you and Frederick
have had many a conversation

272
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:05,022
about my bad behavior, Jack.

273
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,024
How does he describe me?

274
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,660
A pure sociopath,
by the book.

275
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,364
- Is that by your book,
Frederick?
- Yes.

276
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:16,467
I'd just like to point out
that the word "sociopath" has

277
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,503
not been used by any respected
psychiatrist since 1968.

278
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,040
Dr. gideon, do you have
any information about the
chesapeake ripper, or not?

279
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:26,610
- Down to brass tacks.
- You told Will Graham that
you were in Dr. Lecter's home.

280
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,913
Why were you there?
I have never set foot

281
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:32,416
in Dr. Lecter's home.
I only met the man a week ago.

282
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,619
However, Dr. chilton was kind
enough to share the details

283
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,621
of his dining room.
Why would he do that?

284
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,690
Yes, why would he do that?

285
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,395
Will Graham is
very keen to believe

286
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,931
that Hannibal Lecter is
the chesapeake ripper.

287
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,967
Dr. chilton did very little
to disavow him

288
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,104
of that notion, and encouraged
me to do the same.

289
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,641
I apologize, agent Crawford,
for wasting your time.

290
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:01,045
It's not your actions
and betrayal that I resent,

291
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,548
Dr. chilton;
It's just the lies.

292
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,650
Mmhmm.
I'll walk you out.

293
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,052
Thank you.

294
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:12,690
Dr. chilton hired a nurse
who's had experience

295
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,761
in mental hospitals,
but not as an employee.

296
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,097
That nurse attempted to murder
Hannibal Lecter, and you blame

297
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,000
Will Graham.

298
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,636
You got the right box
there, Jack,

299
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,105
but you're looking
in the wrong corner.

300
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,513
All the coiled resentment
in this place,

301
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:39,417
it's gotta be bad
for the digestion.

302
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,053
You know that poor nurse shell
that I murdered?

303
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,923
I know she's seen
as some kind of beloved sister,

304
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:51,629
but wasn't she also
kind of a good-time girl
with a beer or two inside her?

305
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:54,131
I asked her if she had eyes
for me, and she said no.

306
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,200
So I had to take 'em.

307
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,072
Prosciutto roses.

308
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,341
Heart tartare.

309
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,009
Beef roulade.

310
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,348
Whatever this is.

311
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,150
Needless to say,

312
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,887
I will not be eating the food.

313
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,889
Nice to see you again,
Dr. chilton.

314
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:35,693
Hm. Hannibal
the cannibal.

315
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,896
That is what they'll call him,
you know.

316
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,898
Not according to Abel gideon.

317
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,701
Gideon has given me enough
trouble for one day. The fact

318
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:47,104
that he lied to you makes
me even more certain he was
telling Will Graham the truth.

319
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,874
Why did you come here tonight
if you're so convinced?

320
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,876
Darwinism.

321
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,179
I do not want him to think
I suspect anything.

322
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:59,850
I really shouldn't be
seen speaking to you.

323
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,254
I don't want to be perceived
as a threat.

324
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,761
Jack.

325
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:13,864
I'm so happy you're here.
After all, you are the guest

326
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:18,068
of honor. You saved my life.
Unfortunately, my friend,
I can't stay.

327
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,770
Um... ooh.

328
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:22,039
I would love to take some food
to go, if that's all right.

329
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:25,142
Of course. I'll get
one of the staff to get you
something from the kitchen.

330
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,711
No, no. That's all right.
Just, uh, bring me a container

331
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,714
and I'll serve myself
from here. Um,

332
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:34,051
with your permission,
of course, Dr. Lecter.

333
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,721
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, alana.

334
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:42,092
I do have your permission,
Dr. Lecter?

335
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,161
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

336
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,766
Eat it soon or it'll spoil.

337
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,007
Thank you. Good evening.
Good evening.

338
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,695
Z.

339
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,163
Test this.

340
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,818
Well, the ending
to my composition has been

341
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,121
eluding me, but you may just
have solved that problem
with "chopsticks."

342
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:59,036
If only every problem could be
solved with a simple waltz.

343
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,845
Jack's treating you
like a suspect.

344
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:11,048
Pointing fingers in the dark.

345
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,919
I've walked away from Will,

346
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,756
but I'm still trailing
his accusations.

347
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,427
I've walked away too.

348
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,963
I can't forgive Will
for what he did to you.

349
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,934
I just want to walk away
from all of it.

350
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,104
What does walking away
leave us?

351
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,173
Each other.

352
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,540
Hello, Dr. gideon.

353
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:13,463
Put the heart monitor on
the guard so no one knew gideon

354
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:17,935
was missing, at least as long as
it took for the guard to die,
which wasn't long.

355
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:20,237
- It was long enough.
- He was strung up with

356
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,307
fish hooks.
Hand-tied flies,

357
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,309
just like Will Graham
used to make.

358
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,511
This one has
a human hair in it,

359
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,579
and a tooth.
Jack,

360
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,582
there is no way gideon could've
done any of this

361
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,052
with the injuries he had,
much less get out of bed.

362
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,254
Well, the last time
gideon escaped custody,

363
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,656
he went looking
for the chesapeake ripper.

364
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,359
He found him, all right.

365
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:46,496
Last night... The
ripper found gideon.

366
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,990
You're awake.

367
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,458
So are you.

368
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,232
I was thinking
about funerals,

369
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,768
and how often
they make us want sex.

370
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,773
It's one in the eye
for death.

371
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,641
Not that...

372
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,644
This wasn't...
Funeral sex or...

373
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,614
- Of course it was.

374
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,385
We both just buried a friend.

375
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,587
We buried Will.

376
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,260
There's something liberating
about finally letting him go.

377
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,466
Yes. There is.

378
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,677
We have a lot of reasons
to do this;

379
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,746
not just funeral reasons.

380
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,724
Last time someone rang
my doorbell this early,

381
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,692
it was a census taker.

382
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,202
I'll see who it is.

383
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,686
Jack.
Hannibal.

384
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,421
What can I do for you?

385
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,090
We need to talk.

386
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,699
Abel gideon fell
down a stairwell last night.

387
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,434
He was hospitalized.

388
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,304
The security guard
standing watch has been killed

389
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:10,874
in what appears to be another
chesapeake ripper murder.

390
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,876
Gideon is nowhere to be found.

391
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,644
He escaped?

392
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,613
We know he didn't leave
the hospital on his own.

393
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,849
His back was broken.
He was taken by someone -

394
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:21,118
someone who knew him.

395
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,157
Where were you last night?

396
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,496
I was here.

397
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:35,165
All night?

398
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,234
Yes.

399
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,236
Anyone other than yourself

400
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:42,506
that can verify that?
I can.

401
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,311
I was with Hannibal
all night, Jack.

402
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,784
What are you accusing him of?
I'm not accusing him

403
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,621
of anything;
Only asking his whereabouts.

404
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,557
That's not all you're asking.

405
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,264
Rôti de cuisse.

406
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,966
Clay-roasted thigh.

407
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:47,204
And canoe-cut marrow bone.

408
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,286
I love cooking with Clay.

409
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:05,956
It creates
a more succulent dish

410
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:11,661
and adds a little
theatricality to dinner.

411
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,797
We come from Clay,
return to Clay.

412
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:22,239
Shall I carve?
I think you already have.

413
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:25,408
Your legs are
no good to you anymore.

414
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,777
You've got a t-4 fracture
of the vertebra.

415
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,714
This is a far more
practical use

416
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,782
for those limbs.

417
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,855
Hard to have anything,
isn't it, Dr. Lecter?

418
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,692
Rare to get it,
hard to keep it.

419
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,630
A damn slippery life.

420
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,905
You were determined to know
the chesapeake ripper,
Dr. gideon.

421
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,810
Now is your opportunity.

422
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:04,614
You intend me to be
my own last supper?

423
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,549
Yes.

424
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,655
How does one
politely refuse a dish

425
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:13,657
in circumstances such as these?

426
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:17,427
One doesn't.

427
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:19,863
The tragedy is not
to die, Abel,

428
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,731
but to be wasted.

429
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,631
My compliments to the chef.

430
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:01,838
- Goose, pig, cow.
- Not just cow; Wagyu beef.

431
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,973
There's about $100 worth
right there.

432
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,642
How do you know it's not kobe?

433
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,578
Well, all kobe is wagyu;
Not all wagyu is kobe.

434
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,915
- Ok.
- Well, at least we know
Dr. Lecter wasn't serving up

435
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,784
people.
You want people?

436
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,053
The chesapeake ripper has been
tying flies with them,

437
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,856
just like Will Graham
allegedly did.

438
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,761
Hair woven into the
monofilaments is Beverly's;

439
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:26,763
bone fragments of Miriam lass;

440
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:29,399
veining from Sheldon isley, uh,

441
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,534
optical nerve and arteries
from judge Davies,

442
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,438
and a toenail from James gray,
our muralist -

443
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,707
all victims
of the chesapeake ripper.

444
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,143
These four lures are almost
identical to what we found

445
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:42,045
in Will's house,
made with material from

446
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,148
the exact same human remains:
Abigail hobbs,

447
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,884
Donald Sutcliffe,
Marissa schuur,

448
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,887
Georgia madchen.

449
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,157
Will didn't kill
any of these people.

450
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,762
There was no copycat;
Never was.

451
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:01,898
It was always the ripper.

452
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,401
Finally taking credit
for all of his murders.

453
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,772
Maybe too much credit.
Found something else

454
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:11,441
in the lures.
Madrona bark

455
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:14,043
a tree almost non-existent
on the east coast,

456
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,546
but this bark was
peeled recently.

457
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,416
There's a small stand
of madrona bark in Virginia.

458
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,519
Inside your diatom
search area?

459
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,888
Yep.

460
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,489
Here.

461
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,607
Miriam.

462
