2
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,300
- So, how many times you call her?
- Once.

3
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,200
And she didn't call you back? Bitch.

4
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,500
Emily's not a bitch.

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,600
I was calling you a bitch,
for thinking about calling her again.

6
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
That is very bitch-like.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,400
You call a girl once, she don't call you back,
the relationship's over.

8
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,700
I was drunk.
I don't even remember what I said.

9
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,200
Maybe she never got the message.

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
- You drunk-dialed her?
- Still, no excuse.

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,900
- No more tequila for this guy.
- You're cut off.

12
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,300
- What is she so mad about, anyway?
- It's not that she's mad.

13
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,300
She feels like I'm putting her in
an uncomfortable situation with me and Ari.

14
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
You should've bluffed her, spun it around.

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Let her think you're uncomfortable
with the situation.

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,200
First Kristen, then Emily.
Why do you let these girls get in your head?

17
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,200
The guys have a point.
You're getting a little soft in your old age.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900
It's Ari, finally. Ari, where are you?

19
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,400
<i>Right where I'm supposed to be.
Where are you?</i>

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,100
We're at Coffee Bean, like we said.

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>No, we said Starbucks, Eric.</i>

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>I distinctly remember,
because I fucked a counter girl here.</i>

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,700
Be careful crossing the street.
He's at Starbucks.

24
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
What, did you rob a bank?

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,400
<i>I earned it. Pacific Blue residuals, baby.
We sold Malaysia.</i>

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,100
- How much you got there, bro?
- Don't you worry about it.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,100
So, what's with the face to face?

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,800
I just want you guys to know
that all of my attention...

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,300
<i>is now focused on Queens Boulevard.</i>

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
That's nice.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,500
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah. So, we have a deal or what?

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,000
- We got a deal pending.
- Pending what?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,400
Pending a meeting with the director.

34
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,800
We gotta get approved by the director now?

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,500
No, we don't. It's like a meet and greet.
A blind date. Fifteen minutes.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,300
You have a drink, you like each other,
you make a movie.

37
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,400
- Blind dates are my forte.
- There you go.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm heading up the coast with the missus.
Call me, tell me if you guys like each other.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
- You did good, Ari.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
- Tell him, E.
- You did good, Ari.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
We just had a moment. Did you feel that?

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,900
I think I'm gonna leave Mrs. Ari
and take you for the weekend.

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,100
Don't do that.

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
- So, who's the guy?
- Billy Walsh.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,700
- Yeah?
- You heard of him?

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,000
<i>Yeah, the guy won Sundance.
Film called Daze.</i>

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,200
I read the guy financed his movie...

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
- by donating blood.
- How was it?

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
I didn't see that shit.
You know I don't like indies.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
- I'm into the studio system.
- Ari says this guy's hot.

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
Everybody in town wants to work with him.
We got him.

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,700
He wants to work with Vince.

53
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
- You'll ask him about a part for me, right?
- And nothing else.

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,800
- Where's the meeting?
- Chateau.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
- Arnold, come on, boy.
- You guys want to roll with?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
The fuck else we got to do, player?

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,100
You guys hang here.
We'll be back in a little while.

58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,800
Don't talk to us like we're adopted, bro.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Just leave it outside the door, asshole!

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
It's Vincent Chase.

61
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,000
- You Billy?
- No.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
You guys see Billy around anywhere?

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,100
- You know Billy?
- Yeah, whatever.

64
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,300
All right.

65
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,200
Sorry, pal.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,500
- You sure you're not Billy?
- Do I look like fucking Billy?

67
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I don't think that's Billy.

68
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,600
My man, Vincent Chase.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,300
Wick was right.
You're very fuckable in person.

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,700
You fucking laughing?
This guy's the best actor of his generation.

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,300
No bullshit.
He'll blow all your asses off the screen.

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,900
- Thank you.
- You guys are early.

73
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,200
Actually, no. We're right on time.

74
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,900
That might mean something to me
if I knew who you were.

75
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,800
- This is my buddy, Eric.
- You can call me E.

76
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,600
Is that your thing, being on time?
I won Sundance at 24.

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
What do you gotta say
about that kind of arrival?

78
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,300
- Congratulations.
- Cool.

79
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,100
I'm gonna get dressed.
You guys grab a cocktail or something.

80
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,500
I'll be right out.

81
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,200
He's a nice guy.

82
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,400
We're not here to make friends.
We're here to make a movie.

83
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,700
You know Howard Hughes
used to stay in this room back in the day.

84
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,900
Now Scorsese's doing the movie.

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,200
They offered it to Billy first,
but he turned it down.

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,300
He ain't gonna soft-soap nobody.

87
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Billy's a genius, brother.
You're lucky to be working with him.

88
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,500
- You're an asshole!
- Shut up!

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,100
- Come on, let's get some coffee.
- Bye, baby.

90
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,300
Come on. I'm buying.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,700
You ever jerk off
with a belt around your neck?

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,100
No. Should I?

93
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,700
Sounds interesting.

94
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
All right, forget that shit.
Check this out. Scandinavian twins.

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
For $1,500, they'll come over
and fuck us like we're Vince.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't pay for pussy.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,900
Since when?
It's like 50 rub and tugs with you.

98
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,800
Since I like walking around
with money in my pocket.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on, Drama,
you got that fat residual check.

100
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,000
They're just your type.

101
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
No means no.

102
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Let me talk to him.
You're like a fucking bull in a china shop.

103
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,400
Thank you.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
All right, one.

105
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,100
My agent.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,800
Fucking prick wants me to do
a studio movie.

107
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
Yeah, mine, too.

108
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,600
I told him to go fuck himself.
I'm not in this for the money, Vince.

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,200
<i>Queens Boulevard
is gonna be my Mean Streets.</i>

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,400
- Kind of an ode to the way we grew up.
- You grew up in Queens?

111
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Scarsdale, but my dad owned a Key Food
in Kew Gardens.

112
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,000
I bet you'd like to see Vince
do a big studio movie, E?

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,600
- Actually, no.
- He just wants me to do a good film.

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,500
Come on. There is no glory
in making a $5 million indie, E.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
There is if it's a good one.

116
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,000
Ari said you had thoughts on the script,
things you might want to change.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,900
- It's done.
- What did you do?

118
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,300
I made Vincent's character a man.

119
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,800
See, he was a pussy.
That sensitive shit was putting me to sleep.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,900
The stuff with the girlfriend
was pretty good.

121
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,300
No, it wasn't.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Vince, I want to shoot you long-lensed.

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Give you size in the frame, power.

124
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,300
<i>Like Redford in Three Days of the Condor.
McQueen in Bullitt.</i>

125
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,200
<i>You like The Pope of Greenwich Village?</i>

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
It's one of my favorite films.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
You should do a remake of that, Vince.

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,100
No. No one should ever remake that movie.
It was perfect.

129
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,700
<i>You'd let them redo the Mona Lisa, E?</i>

130
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,900
Anyway...

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
read it. Tell me what you think.

132
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,800
- All right.
- Call my cell. I'll be waiting.

133
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,300
- Great.
- Don't let the suit influence you.

134
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Hey, man, I'm not a suit.

135
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,600
Yeah, man, you are.
You just don't know it yet.

136
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,900
- Toodle-loo.
- See you later.

137
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,800
I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,100
I really digged your movie, man.

139
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,000
<i>- It was great.
- Gracie.</i>

140
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,200
Unbelievable.

141
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,900
- You must've found a glitch.
- So what?

142
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,700
So you're a little glitch bitch.

143
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,200
Blame the game makers.
Don't blame the player, hater.

144
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,300
Give me that control.

145
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,900
- Get off! Why are...
- This one sucks.

146
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,600
Who dates Scarlett Johansson?

147
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Ryan Gosling? Actually, I don't know.

148
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,800
I love her.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,700
Vince, we got a big problem here.

150
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,400
E., we have no problems. Life is good.

151
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
Do you know who dates
Scarlett Johansson?

152
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,500
- No.
- I think I'm in love with her.

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,600
Did you read this?

154
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
You know I like to get
your impressions first.

155
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,500
It's a disaster.
This guy Walsh is out of his fucking mind.

156
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,100
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

157
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,200
What?

158
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,200
He wasn't so nice to E.

159
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
- That's not it.
- This guy gets more opinionated every day.

160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,900
Don't fuck this up, E.
I really want to do this.

161
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,100
The guy said the suit would be judgmental.

162
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
He's got a guy blowing you on Page 26!

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
Come on.

164
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
Seriously?

165
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,100
I better read it.

166
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,000
- I better read that shit, too.
- Who's blowing him?

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,300
I hope it's not the part of the bookie,
'cause I'm playing that.

168
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,200
That would be really awkward.

169
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,300
Look, Vince,
there's no shame in playing gay.

170
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,500
<i>Look at Tom Hanks, Philadelphia.
The guy won an Oscar.</i>

171
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,900
I'd take it in the ass on camera for an Oscar.

172
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,600
<i>You'd take it in the ass
for a guest spot on The Hughleys.</i>

173
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
That's not even on the air anymore.

174
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know about you,
but I don't want to see Vince...

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,300
running around Queens
with a silk shirt knotted at the bellybutton.

176
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,000
- You're really homophobic.
- No, I'm not.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,900
If you were gay, okay, I'd accept that.
But you're not.

178
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
So why are you gonna pretend you are?

179
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,400
'Cause the guy's an actor, you fucking idiot.
That's what he does.

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,100
No, that's what you do,
you ass-fucked loser.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Keep it up, Turtle.

182
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,600
It's not about an Oscar
or the neighborhood.

183
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,400
If it's good, I'll do it.

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm just not sure I understand
why it's in there.

185
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,600
It's in there 'cause Walsh is psychotic.
He's got to change the script back.

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,900
- So call him, E.
- I'm calling him.

187
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Billy, it's E.

188
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,700
Yeah, Vince's guy.

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,500
Listen, we want to talk to you
about the script.

190
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,900
Hold on a second.

191
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
He's at Crazy Girls.
He wants us to come over right now.

192
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,600
- Sweet.
- Crazy Girls at noon?

193
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Cancel that order, honey.

194
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,700
Crazy Girls has got a great buffet.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,100
They got downgraded to a "B."

197
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,300
If these warm plates aren't heated up
to the right temperature...

198
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,400
they become hotbeds of bacteria.

199
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,600
Isn't that that girl from Cheetahs in Vegas?

200
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,100
Yeah, the one you cock blocked me for.

201
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,300
Please, she was so into me.

202
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
Don't cock block.

203
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,300
- I know you guys. How you been?
- I'm good.

204
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,500
This perv likes to beat off
with a belt around his neck.

205
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
This guy pays for pussy.

206
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,300
I see you guys haven't changed.

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,500
So, who wants a lap dance?

208
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,900
Sorry, baby. The money stays here.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What's the problem, E? You want a blonde?

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,100
I just wanted to talk about the script.

211
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,100
So talk about it.
You thought it was genius, right?

212
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,800
Not really, no.

213
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,100
No? What the fuck do you know?

214
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Vince, I thought I told you
not to let the suit influence you.

215
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,600
Stop calling me a suit, all right?

216
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,500
I just liked the script better
the way it was, that's all.

217
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,000
What did you think, Vince?

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,400
I thought it was interesting.
I just didn't totally get it.

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,300
That's cool.
I was trying to be abstract, like Kurosawa.

220
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,100
<i>- You ever seen a Kurosawa film?
- Yeah, I saw Seven Samurai.</i>

221
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,900
I seen them all, Vince.
I'll send you a couple.

222
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,000
Cool.

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You think the scene
where you're getting a blowjob from a guy...

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,900
makes you look like a fag, right?

225
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
<i>You ever see Midnight Cowboy?
Does Voight look like a fag in that?</i>

226
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,300
In that hat and those boots, he does.

227
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
My point is, I wanna make you look manly.

228
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,000
- Okay.
- But you gotta trust me.

229
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Kristen.

230
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,300
Really?

231
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,000
Excuse me for a second. Sorry.

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,900
Ex-Mrs. Suit?

233
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,900
You could say that.

234
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,200
- Hello?
- So who's Emily?

235
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,300
What are you talking about?
How do you know Emily?

236
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,700
I got home and checked my messages
and heard you calling Emily.

237
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,400
<i>Can you turn the music down?</i>

238
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,200
I was drunk last night.
I must've dialed your number by accident.

239
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,800
You sure it wasn't your subconscious way
of trying to reach out to me?

240
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,900
You analyzing me right now?

241
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,900
I got the message and I tried not to call,
but I miss you.

242
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Seriously?

243
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,300
Can we go out to dinner sometime this week
and talk about it?

244
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,400
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

245
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
I need $100.
This girl's gonna jerk me in the back.

246
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
No.

247
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,000
Drama won't lend me money
if it's for sexual acts.

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,900
Not now, Turtle. I'm on the phone.

249
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,100
You got glitter all over your face.

250
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,900
<i>- Can I call you tonight?
- All right.</i>

251
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,000
Bye.

252
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,100
What do you mean,
you committed to the guy?

253
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,600
I dig his vibe.
You don't have to get mad at me.

254
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
He is pretty cool.
He was throwing strippers $20s.

255
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,200
He's a pretentious prick.
You don't wanna make this movie with him.

256
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
You don't know artists.
You haven't hung out with many.

257
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
- Yeah, we're very sensitive.
- I know people, all right?

258
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,900
This guy is an egomaniac
and he's an asshole.

259
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,300
Vince, I'll respect
whatever decision you make...

260
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,900
but I'm still going for
that part of the bookie.

261
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
I thought I was making the decisions
around here.

262
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,600
Not ultimately. Enough of this.

263
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,000
Why don't you tell these guys
how you drunk-dialed Kristen, not Emily?

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,900
- You called Kristen?
- You idiot.

265
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,700
What's wrong with you?
Don't ever drunk-dial.

266
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,900
E., marry this girl or kill her.
We can't take this anymore.

267
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,200
- So, did you call the babysitter?
- I thought you did.

268
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,500
No, you were supposed to.
You're the one who likes to talk to her.

269
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,000
You think I have a thing for Olga?
This weekend is all us.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm good to go, baby.

271
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't even think about answering that.

272
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
- Don't even...
- Just quick.

273
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,100
- Hello?
- We got a big problem.

274
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,600
Hold on a second.

275
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,700
Vince has got a problem.

276
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Baby, I took it an hour ago, okay?
I got 10 more minutes before it kicks in.

277
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,300
Just give me a second, honey. Baby.

278
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,000
Vince hated Walsh?

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,600
No, I hated him.
Vince doesn't know I'm doing this.

280
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Behind the back. Slick, I'm aroused.
Go, baby, go.

281
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,400
<i>- Have you met this guy?
- Yeah, he's a pompous dickhead.</i>

282
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Why didn't you say something?

283
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,600
You wanted me to deliver the movie.
That's what I did.

284
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,600
You got to get Walsh off.

285
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,800
So now you need my help?
So now you come to the master.

286
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,400
No, Vince needs you.
This guy's gonna ruin the film.

287
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,300
This meeting was not set up
so that Walsh could approve Vince.

288
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,100
<i>It was set up so Vince could approve Walsh,
all right?</i>

289
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,300
He picks up the phone, the guy's done.

290
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
He won't do it, he likes him.
He digs his vibe.

291
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,500
<i>- Yeah? Has he seen his movie?
- No.</i>

292
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,800
<i>- Have you seen his movie?
- No.</i>

293
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,900
Do your fucking homework.
You've got a screening room. Use it.

294
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,800
<i>- Come on.
- What, have you seen it?</i>

295
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,400
No, I haven't. You think I'll stand in line
in the snow in Utah wearing a beanie?

296
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
<i>Maybe Vince will hate the movie, though.</i>

297
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,300
I gotta go.

298
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the pool.

299
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,200
- Come on.
- You said no business calls. We had a deal.

300
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm ready to go here, all right?

301
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,300
It's like R. Kelly at recess.

302
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,500
Honey, what are you doing?
Are you kidding me? Baby!

303
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,700
Hello?

304
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,200
<i>The Advocate just called to confirm a rumor
that in Vince's next movie...</i>

305
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,400
he's gonna be jerking off some guy
in the subway.

306
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,100
No, Shauna, the guy is touching him.
And don't worry, he's not doing it.

307
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,500
Vince is on his way to becoming
a major sex symbol. Don't fuck this up.

308
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,200
<i>- Get him on screen with someone with tits.
- Man!</i>

309
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,600
<i>When I was on Kimmel,
we said the name of the place...</i>

310
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,000
the guy gave us the whole system
for nothing.

311
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,900
<i>What do you mean, you were on Kimmel?
Is that "X"?</i>

312
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,900
- No, it's a TV show.
- Do you have any "X"?

313
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,200
No, I don't have any "X."
Why don't you girls have a seat?

314
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,200
<i>Even if this movie
is better than The Godfather...</i>

315
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,300
you guys both tell Vince you hated it.
What is this?

316
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,400
That's Sierra and this is Portia.

317
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,200
We pulled them out of Crazy Girls, bro.
For free. How sweet is that?

318
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Sweet.

319
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,000
Full house.

320
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,900
- Nice.
- I bet this movie's gonna kick ass.

321
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,200
- Positivity.
- All right, Turtle, fire it up.

322
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,700
Holy shit, that sucked!

323
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,600
- Fuck black and white.
- Reminds me of Godard.

324
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,000
So, what did you think?

325
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,100
What'd you think?

326
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,100
I knew you were gonna hate it.
You came into this with no other possibility.

327
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
I didn't hate it.

328
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,100
You didn't hate it?

329
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,900
You know, truthfully,
I think this guy's a complete jerk-off.

330
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,200
- It was amazing, right?
- He's a fucking genius.

331
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,600
Vince, you do this movie,
they're gonna burn down Queens Boulevard.

332
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,900
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Johnny, run down the list again.

333
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,400
<i>Will Smith, Six Degrees of Separation.
Robin Williams, Birdcage.</i>

334
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,800
<i>Lucky Leo's gone gay two times:
Basketball Diaries and Eclipse.</i>

335
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,800
<i>So has Pacino in Cruising
and Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

336
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
<i>- Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man.
- Rain Man was gay?</i>

337
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
He wasn't gay, just retarded.

338
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,100
Either way, you play gay or retarded,
you win an Oscar.

339
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Guys, give me a second.
I need some time to think.

340
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,600
What do you girls say
we take this party up to the hot tub?

341
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,500
I'm really not in the mood for that tonight.

342
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,800
- What's the matter? You don't feel good?
- I'm a little depressed.

343
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm getting evicted.
I'm late on my rent again.

344
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
- How much is rent?
- $1,200.

345
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,500
I got your rent money right here.
Let's go swimming.

346
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,900
I thought you don't pay for sex.

347
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm not paying for sex.
I'm paying her rent, jerk-off.

348
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,800
Yeah, right.

349
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
So?

350
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,700
I feel like he's gonna make a great movie.

351
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,300
So the only problem you have
is that one scene?

352
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,900
Yeah, one fucking scene.

353
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,300
- I can't believe I fell off the wagon.
- Come on, no regrets.

354
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,200
- Was she any good, at least?
- She was great. She's coming back tonight.

355
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm gonna have to borrow some money
from Vince.

356
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,800
We're willing to respect
your vision of the movie.

357
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,400
But we want final cut on the scene.
It makes no sense to either of us.

358
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
But you shoot it,
and maybe you'll change our mind.

359
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
No. Sorry, no deal.

360
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,200
- Then Vince isn't doing it.
- Vincent, I make movies a certain way.

361
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
You made one movie.

362
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,000
Look, Vince, you're the star.

363
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Wick will throw me off before he loses you,
so be it.

364
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,400
You're willing to throw
this whole movie away over one point?

365
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,900
Yes, suit.

366
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,000
That's how much I care about my vision.

367
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,700
Good luck with it, Vincent. Seriously.

368
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
All right, fuck it. I'll do it.

369
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,200
- You'll do it?
- I'll do it.

370
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,400
All right, do it. Don't fuck this up.

371
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,700
The guy blowing you...

372
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm gonna play that part.
That way, you're in really good hands.

373
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,200
Don't worry,
I've got a pretty solid acting background.

374
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,400
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- I fucking had you, motherfucker!

375
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,100
Fucker!

376
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,700
- I don't get it.
- It was a joke. He was joking the whole time.

377
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,800
- What, the scene's not in the movie?
- No, it's not in the movie.

378
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,500
- It made no sense in the movie.
- I knew it, God damn it.

379
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,300
Good fucking scene, though.
I'm gonna use it somewhere else.

380
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,000
And it wasn't a joke, Vincent. It was a test.

381
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,100
I needed to make sure that you trusted me.

382
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,800
The only way this movie's gonna work
is if we trust each other.

383
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,300
Yeah, I agree.

384
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
But you know what?

385
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Now there's a bigger problem.

386
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,600
- What's that?
- I can't trust you.

387
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,100
Come on.

388
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,900
No, you can give E. A hard time.
That's cool.

389
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,900
You think you're gonna fuck with me,
and I'm gonna sit back and do nothing?

390
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,900
You know what? Fuck you, motherfucker.
You're fired.

391
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,600
- I'm a good actor, aren't I?
- Fucking...

392
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,200
You fucking...

393
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,100
I'm so confused right now. What are you...

394
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,400
- A toast. I'll toast to that.
- Yo, Johnny, Turtle.

395
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,700
We're making a movie.

396
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,100
No, Vince. I'm putting my foot down.

397
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't worry, the scene's gone.

398
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,500
- Yeah?
- He's been fucking with us.

399
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
Cheers, baby!

400
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,500
To Vince not getting a blowjob
from some dude.

401
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,800
Thank God.

402
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,200
- Billy, I gotta tell you, loved your movie.
- Yeah, you told me that already, man.

403
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
- Yeah, but this time I actually saw it.
- Did you actually love it?

404
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,300
Look, man, I just want to play the part
of the bookie.

405
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,600
I know I could do a really good job.

406
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,900
A lying, conniving, two-faced prick.
You're perfect for it.

407
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,800
- Thanks.
- All right!

408
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,500
There it is!

409
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,600
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.
Next stop, Queens Boulevard.</i>

410
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Cheers!
