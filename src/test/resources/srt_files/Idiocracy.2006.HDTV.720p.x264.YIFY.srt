1
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:42,170
<i>As the 21st century began...</i>

2
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:45,804
<i>human evolution was
at a turning point.</i>

3
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:50,851
<i>Natural selection, the process by which
the strongest, the smartest...</i>

4
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:54,514
<i>the fastest reproduced
in greater numbers than the rest...</i>

5
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:58,457
<i>a process which had once
favored the noblest traits of man...</i>

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960
<i>now began to favor
different traits.</i>

7
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,963
<i>The Joey Buttafuoco case-</i>

8
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,865
<i>Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized...</i>

9
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,062
<i>and more intelligent.</i>

10
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>But as time went on, things seemed
to be heading in the opposite direction.</i>

11
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:15,276
<i>A dumbing down.</i>

12
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:17,402
<i>How did this happen?</i>

13
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:20,778
<i>Evolution does not necessarily
reward intelligence.</i>

14
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:23,408
<i>With no natural predators
to thin the herd...</i>

15
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,818
<i>it began to simply reward those
who reproduced the most...</i>

16
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:31,052
<i>and left the intelligent
to become an endangered species.</i>

17
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:36,687
Having kids is such
an important decision.

18
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,232
We're just waiting
for the right time.

19
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,665
It's not something you want
to rush into, obviously.

20
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,669
No way.

21
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:45,171
<i>Oh, shit,
I'm pregnant again!</i>

22
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:48,368
Shit!
I got too many damn kids!

23
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:51,708
- I thought you was on the pill or some shit!
- Hell, no!

24
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:53,782
Shit! I must've been
thinkin' of Brittany.

25
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:56,009
Brittany?
No, you didn't!

26
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,178
- There's no way we could have a child now.
- Mm-mm.

27
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:01,256
Not with the market
the way it is, no.

28
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,688
God, no. That just
wouldn't make any sense.

29
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,727
Come on over here, bitch!
He don't care about you!

30
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,491
Yeah? Well, there must be
somethin' he likes over here.

31
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,863
- She don't mean nothin' to me, baby!
- Clevon!

32
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:16,028
Oh, shit.
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

33
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,437
Well, we finally decided
to have children...

34
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:23,568
and I'm not pointing fingers,
but it's not going well.

35
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,579
And this is helping.

36
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,775
I'm just saying that before I have in vitro,
maybe you should be willing to-

37
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:30,784
It's always me, right?

38
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:34,253
Well, it's not
my sperm count.

39
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,916
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm gonna fuck all y'all!

40
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,788
That's my boy!

41
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,192
Whoo! Whoo!

42
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:44,998
Clevon is lucky
to be alive.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,432
He attempted to jump
a Jet Ski from a lake...

44
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:50,767
into a swimming pool
and impaled his crotch on an iron gate.

45
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,932
But thanks to recent advances
in stem cell research...

46
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,010
and the fine work of Doctors Krinski
and Altschuler...

47
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,306
Clevon should regain
full reproductive function.

48
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,313
Get your hands
off my junk!

49
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,647
Unfortunately, Trevor passed away
from a heart attack...

50
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:09,849
while masturbating...

51
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,052
to produce sperm
for artificial insemination.

52
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,061
But I have
some eggs frozen...

53
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:18,860
so just as soon as the right guy
comes along, you know-

54
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,596
<i>And so it went for generations...</i>

55
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,505
<i>although few, if any,
seemed to notice.</i>

56
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,378
<i>But in the year 2005, in a military base
just outside of Washington, D. C...</i>

57
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:38,419
<i>a simple army librarian
was unknowingly...</i>

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,422
<i>about to change the entire course
of human history.</i>

59
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,287
Come on, asshole!
Go on! Take him to jail!

60
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,190
Hey, Bauers.

61
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,790
This is Peterson,
your new replacement.

62
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,769
- My what? I'm gettin' replaced?
- Yeah, they didn't tell you?

63
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,965
- No.
- Some new assignment.

64
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,372
They're being all weird
and hush-hush about it.

65
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,309
I don't want a new assignment.
I tell Sergeant Metsler that every time.

66
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:08,179
- I'm good at this.
- Good at what? Sittin' on ass?

67
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:10,877
<i>No one ever comes in here.</i>

68
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:14,217
Yeah, I know. It's perfect for me.
No one bothers me. I can't screw up.

69
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:17,383
<i>If I can just stay in here another eight years,
I get my pension.</i>

70
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:20,620
I'm all set. Can you just
get me out of this?

71
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,459
No way. Not this time.
It's coming from high up.

72
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:27,934
Jesus. I don't understand.
Why me?

73
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:31,665
Every time Metsler says, "Lead, follow,
or get out of the way," I get out of the way.

74
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:35,402
When he says that, you're not supposed
to choose "get out of the way. "

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,571
It's supposed to embarrass you
into leading or at least following.

76
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,546
That doesn't
embarrass me.

77
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,550
Look, Joe.
You don't have a choice.

78
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,483
You're just gonna
have to follow.

79
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:48,055
Like, follow me upstairs,
like, now.

80
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:51,922
Right now?
Shouldn't I train this guy?

81
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:56,225
I think he can figure out how to sit on his ass
and watch TV all day. Let's go.

82
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:06,365
<i>Gentlemen, meet Joe Bauers...</i>

83
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,603
our first subject for the Human
Hibernation Experiment.

84
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,645
Now, as you know,
throughout the years...

85
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:14,215
many of our best pilots,
soldiers and military leaders...

86
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,511
often go their entire careers
without ever seeing battle.

87
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:21,351
<i>With the Human Hibernation Project,
we will be able to save our best men...</i>

88
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:24,391
frozen in their prime,
for use when they are needed most.

89
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:28,224
<i>Joe, here, is not
one of our best men.</i>

90
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,960
Mr. Bauers was chosen primarily
for how remarkably average he is.

91
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:37,732
<i>Extremely average in every
category. Remarkable, truly.</i>

92
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,603
The most average person
in our entire armed forces.

93
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:43,234
Additionally, he has no family,
is unmarried...

94
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:45,643
is an only child,
and both parents are deceased...

95
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:49,410
making him an ideal candidate,
with no one to ask any nosy questions...

96
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:51,577
should something go wrong
with the experiment.

97
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:56,248
<i>We had a little less luck in finding a female
researcher's dream within our ranks...</i>

98
00:05:56,358 --> 00:06:00,419
and were forced to look
into the private sector.

99
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,987
<i>This is Rita. Like Joe,
she has no immediate family.</i>

100
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:06,829
<i>Rita agreed to participate
in this experiment...</i>

101
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:10,996
in exchange for dropping
of certain criminal charges and a small fee.

102
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:14,803
<i>We did, however, have to come
to an arrangement with her pimp...</i>

103
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,937
<i>a gentleman who goes by the name
Upgrayedd, which he spells thusly-</i>

104
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:24,713
<i>With two D's, as he says,
for a double dose of this pimping.</i>

105
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,050
Upgrayedd agreed
to loan us Rita for exactly one year...

106
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:30,488
<i>and keep quiet on the matter,
in exchange for certain leeways...</i>

107
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:33,823
<i>with the local authorities
in running his pimp game.</i>

108
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:38,093
<i>First, however, there was
the difficult challenge of gaining his trust.</i>

109
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,029
<i>Collins, could we skip
to the technicals, please?</i>

110
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,435
Sure.
Let me just finish here.

111
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,839
You see, a pimp's love is very different
from that of a square.

112
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,969
Collins!

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,748
Fine. We'll move on.

114
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,648
It is a fascinating
world though.

115
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,656
Jesus, Collins.

116
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,061
Yeah, that's-

117
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:21,136
Anyway, the experiment
in which these two subjects...

118
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,234
are to be placed
into a dry freeze...

119
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,677
for exactly one year
is set to begin tomorrow.

120
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,975
As you know,
this is highly classified.

121
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:33,214
<i>However, if successful, we believe humans
can be stored indefinitely.</i>

122
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,453
So this is kinda crazy, huh?

123
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:47,092
- What unit are you with?
- Oh, I ain't in the service.

124
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:50,069
Oh, private sector.
Okay.

125
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:54,666
- So, uh, what do you do?
- A little of this, a little of that.

126
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:56,971
Wow, that's great.

127
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,911
You know, I really envy people
that can make a living that way-

128
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:02,040
<i>doing a little of this
and a little of that.</i>

129
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,951
I, uh, had a neighbor, Glen.
He used to make chainsaw sculptures...

130
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:08,955
and then he'd sell 'em
at the flea market.

131
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,957
Yeah.

132
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,829
So, uh, you an artist
or somethin'?

133
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:20,033
- Uh, yeah.
- You do paintings or-

134
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,603
- Yeah, paintings.
- Okay, great.

135
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,868
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you paint mostly?

136
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,038
I don't know, just...
people and fruit and shit.

137
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:38,313
Wow. Well, must be great to be able
to make a living doing something you love.

138
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,048
Yeah. It's not all it's cracked up to be.

139
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:42,817
<i>Who wants to go first?</i>

140
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,415
Me.

141
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:53,465
<i>What the f- Oh, hell, no. Uh-uh.</i>

142
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:57,265
Hey, no. You probably don't want to do that
with the I. V. s attached and all.

143
00:08:57,372 --> 00:09:00,466
- What's the matter?
- Man, Upgrayedd didn't tell me they'd be putting me...

144
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,668
in no damn coffin
with tubes and shit!

145
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:05,769
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
It'll be safe. Trust me.

146
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,438
Who's Upgrayedd?

147
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,517
He's my boyfriend.

148
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,820
Man, how do you know
this shit's safe?

149
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,821
These guys know what they're doing.

<i>Hey! Is this particular
individual the unfit mother?</i>

299
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:03,363
- Me? No.
- Okay. This particular individual is unscannable.

300
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,998
Listen, I can explain, okay?
I was in an army experiment.

301
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,500
<i>Wait a second. There's the other pod
from the army experiment.</i>

302
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,872
<i>There was a girl.
She was from the same experiment.</i>

303
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:20,345
Yeah, that's enough of your bullshit, sir.

304
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:22,473
<i>Joe was arrested for not
paying his hospital bill...</i>

305
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,019
<i>and not having
his U. P. C. tattoo.</i>

306
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,422
<i>He would soon discover that
in the future, justice was not only blind...</i>

307
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:35,325
<i>but had become
rather retarded as well.</i>

308
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,398
You shut up! Now-

309
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,831
I'm fixin' to commensurate
this trial here.

310
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:47,567
<i>We gonna see if we can't
come up with a verdict up in here.</i>

311
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:51,839
<i>Now, since y'all
say you ain't got no money...</i>

312
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:55,279
we have "proprietarily"

<i>one of them
court-appointed lawyers.</i>

<i>So, put your hands together
and give it up for Frito Pendejo.</i>

315
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,187
You're my lawyer?

316
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:10,627
Says here you, uh,
robbed a hospital?

317
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,131
- Why'd you do that?
- Yeah. I'm not guilty.

318
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:16,032
- That's not what the other lawyer said.
- What do you mean what the-

319
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:18,105
Listen, you gotta get me
on the stand, okay?

320
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:21,197
I can explain everything. We can take 'em
to your house, show 'em the pod.

321
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:23,572
<i>Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</i>

322
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:27,113
<i>Now, prosecutor,
why you think he done it?</i>

323
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:30,240
Okay, number one, Your Honor,
just look at him.

324
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,879
He talks like a fag too.

325
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,687
And "B," we've got all this,
like, evidence...

326
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,729
of how, like, this guy didn't
even pay at the hospital.

327
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,765
<i>And I heard that he doesn't
even have his tattoo.</i>

328
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,130
<i>I know!</i>

329
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:51,762
And I'm all, "You've gotta be shittin' me. "
But check this out, man.

330
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,773
Judge should be like, "Guilty. "
Peace.

331
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,179
- Objection!
- What are you objectifyin' on?

332
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,548
- Come on. Just get me on the stand.
- Okay.

333
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:09,317
- Um, Your Honor?
- Hmm?

334
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:11,254
I object...

335
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:15,351
that this guy also broke
my apartment to shit.

336
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:17,454
<i>- Yeah.
- What?</i>

337
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:22,093
And you know what else? I object that
he's not gonna have any money to pay me...

338
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:25,331
<i>after he pays back all the money
he stole from the hospital!</i>

339
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,430
Don't say I stole.
You're my lawyer.

340
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,475
And I object.

341
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:33,445
<i>I object that he interrupted me
while I was watching Ow! My Balls!</i>

342
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:38,007
That is not okay! And I rest my case!

343
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,519
Your Honor, I'm pretty sure
we have a mistrial here, sir.

344
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:43,988
- I'm gonna mistrial my foot up
your ass, you don't shut up.

345
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,559
- Please, listen.
- "Please, listen. "

346
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,389
I didn't steal anything.

Guilty!

some smart guy made it a long time ago.

446
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,769
I don't care.
Just get me there, okay?

447
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,344
- Well-
- Please!

448
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:21,676
Listen, I- I-
I "supersize" with you...

449
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:24,546
<i>but didn't you go to jail
for not havin' enough money?</i>

450
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:28,781
Okay, how about this? You get me
to the time machine, and when I get back...

451
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,880
I open a savings account
in your name.

452
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:33,516
That way, 500 years later,
it'll be worth billions.

453
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:35,151
<i>- Billions!
- 'Cause?</i>

454
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:38,095
'Cause of the interest,
it'll be worth billions of dollars.

455
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,758
- Oh, I- I like money.
- Yeah.

456
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,859
- How many billions?
- Like, 10.

457
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:47,134
Yeah, suck one.
Time machine costs, like, 20.

458
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,038
Yeah? Okay.
Uh, 30, Frito.

459
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:53,306
<i>Thirty billion dollars.</i>

460
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:57,850
Thirty billion.
So if you gave me 30 billion...

461
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,942
<i>and the time machine's 20-</i>

462
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,987
What's the minus
of 30 and 20?

463
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,819
Uh, it's, uh-
it's 80, Frito.

464
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,450
<i>It's $80 billion.
That's a mighty big minus, isn't it?</i>

465
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:11,292
<i>- Yeah. I like money though.
- Police! Open the door!</i>

466
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:13,559
<i>We're looking for an "excaped" individual.</i>

467
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:17,262
<i>- This particular individual's name is Not Sure.
- Eighty billion.</i>

468
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:21,364
Oh, um, he-
He's... somewhere else.

469
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:25,809
- You got something I can wear? - Yeah. There's
Pro-Wear on the top, assorted in the middle.

470
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,039
<i>A Coke machine in the vicinity caught his tattoo.</i>

471
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,912
<i>Seemed to be heading
for this particular "domistile. "</i>

472
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,418
<i>Okay, sir, we're comin' in.</i>

473
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,818
<i>- No, you can't come in.
- Can too!</i>

474
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:37,981
- Come on!
- All right, let's go get my billions.

475
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:44,354
Oh, okay, one more thing. We gotta go find
this girl, Rita, first, okay?

476
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,228
- Is she bangin'?
- Yeah, sure, she is.

477
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,234
That wasn't really
part of the deal.

478
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:53,238
- Okay, I'll, uh, throw in another couple billion, all right?
- I like money.

479
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,400
Okay, her pod's up here on the right.
She shouldn't be far away, I hope.

480
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,277
<i>Mmm, girl. Oh, yeah?
So when we gonna do it?</i>

481
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,714
'Cause you been chargin' me by the hour,
and it's been, like, three days.

482
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:08,811
Oh, yeah. Soon, baby, soon.
Hey, you know what?

483
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,550
Why don't you
come back tomorrow?

484
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:14,286
- Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah!
- Yeah?

485
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:17,557
When I finally utilize you,
you gonna be paying me.

486
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,122
That's right.
Whatever you say, sir.

487
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,702
- Hey, you still on the clock!
- Yeah, girl.

488
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:26,932
- Thank you!
- Rita!

489
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,908
Rita! It's me, Joe, from the experiment.
Get in the car! Come on.

490
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,309
Oh, yeah!
What the hell, man?

491
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:35,313
Just get in the car.
I'll explain everything.

492
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,906
- Where we going?
- Just get in the car.

493
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,179
<i>- Trust me.
- What happened to those army guys?</i>

494
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:45,547
<i>Wait a minute. You got cops after you?</i>

495
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,288
- Yeah.
- And you made me get in the car? I got two strikes, asshole!

496
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,864
Frito, take a right here.
Right, right!

497
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,933
<i>Into that dust storm,
Frito.</i>

498
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:02,166
<i>They must have just forgotten about us.</i>

499
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:05,676
<i>It's been 500 years? Oh, hell, no!</i>

500
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,977
Upgrayedd is gonna kill me! He gets mad
when I'm a day late with his money!

501
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,176
So, you owe
your boyfriend money?

502
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:14,776
Well, yeah,
he's sort of my manager too.

503
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:18,688
<i>You know, he helps me sell
the paintings and shit.</i>

504
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:24,128
Look, Rita, you gotta understand that
Upgrayedd's been dead for a long time now.

505
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,029
- Yeah, man, but you said there was a time machine, right?
- Yeah.

506
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:30,661
Yeah, there's a time machine
now that can take us back to the past...

507
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,171
but there was no
time machine back then, so-

508
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:36,208
Upgrayedd don't care where
the time machine is. Now, then, last week-

509
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,278
He will find a way
to come get his money!

510
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,473
- All I'm saying is you don't have to worry about it-
- You know what?

511
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,142
<i>Last time you told me not to worry
was 500 goddamn years ago...</i>

512
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,618
when you were trying to tell me
to get into some coffin.

513
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,712
<i>- Look, Rita, I don't know
how this happened, okay?</i>

514
00:34:49,823 --> 00:34:53,122
But I'm doing everything I can
to get us back there, okay? I promise you.

515
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:56,787
<i>You are harboring
a fugitive by the name of Not Sure.</i>

516
00:34:56,897 --> 00:35:00,526
Please, pull over and wait for the police
to incarcerate your passenger.

517
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:03,535
<i>- Hell, no. You know what? Let me outta here.
- Thank you for your help.</i>

518
00:35:03,637 --> 00:35:05,867
If you don't have one of these,
they're gonna throw you in jail.

519
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,964
You don't want to get thrown in the jails here.
I've been in them.

520
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:11,805
They're bad. You're better off being with us,
as bad as that sounds.

521
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:15,905
- What are you doing? Why are we slowing down?
- Turned off my battery.

522
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:23,811
Look, how far is it?
Can we just take a cab or something?

523
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:28,923
Oh, shit.

524
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,498
Oh! Oh, shit!

525
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,836
Yeah!

526
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:45,241
<i>What the hell's wrong
with you? That's your car.</i>

527
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:50,177
<i>Oh, hell, yeah! He's on fire!</i>

528
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,080
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

529
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,552
<i>Hey, how much farther is it?</i>

530
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:07,698
Uh, it's, like, far.

531
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:11,237
Man, I could really
go for a Starbucks, you know?

532
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,899
Yeah, well, I really don't think we have time
for a hand job, Joe.

533
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,672
<i>Man, he don't seem too bright.
You sure he knows where he's going?</i>

534
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:25,978
I sure hope so.
He's our only chance.

535
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:29,613
How'd you hook up with this guy, anyway?

536
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:33,989
He's my lawyer.
And he's not a very good one either.

537
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:36,654
<i>He's a goddamned idiot.</i>

538
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:41,564
There's a shuttle down in the Costco.
It'll drop us right by the time machine.

539
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:03,550
Jesus Christ.
Oh, look. One more thing.

540
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:07,058
He thinks he's gonna get billions of dollars
if he takes us there.

541
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,290
So if he mentions anything about
a savings account, just play along, okay?

542
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,298
Yeah, what if this
time machine don't work?

543
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,699
Then I'll spend
the rest of my life trying to fix it.

544
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:27,003
Welcome to Costco. I love you.
Welcome to Costco. I love you.

545
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:30,480
Welcome to Costco.
I love you.

546
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:36,385
Shuttle's down there in electronics,
about an hour from here.

547
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:46,663
We've been walking forever.
You sure you know where you're going?

548
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:50,258
Yeah, I know this place pretty good.
I went to law school here.

549
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,304
In Costco?

550
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,805
<i>Yeah. I couldn't
believe it myself.</i>

551
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:58,571
<i>Luckily, my dad was an alumnus
and pulled some strings.</i>

552
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:02,811
<i>Hey, come on, Joe.
I already told you...</i>

553
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,010
<i>we'd all like a hand job,
but we don't have time for it.</i>

554
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:17,662
<i>Hey, baby, wanna go out?</i>

555
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:20,324
<i>Wanna go out, honey?</i>

556
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,668
Shuttle comes every few minutes.
Shouldn't be long.

557
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:33,507
Do I got time to use the bathroom?

558
00:38:35,715 --> 00:38:38,411
<i>- Uh, the toilet.
- Be right back.</i>

559
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,787
Yeah,
back that thing up.

560
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:44,186
- Hey, you mind if I pound on that, Joe?
- What?

561
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,121
- I like having sex with chicks.
- Yeah?

562
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,126
- Yeah.
- I think everybody does, Frito.

563
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:51,595
Not like I do. Like when you
get it like this, sideways.

564
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:54,223
Then you just, like,
back it up. And then you-

565
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,529
<i>- That's real good.
- Then you- Oh, yeah!</i>

566
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:58,729
Stop! You're gonna
get us caught, okay?

567
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,738
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

568
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,365
<i>Costco has detected a dangerous
fugitive in aisle 16,702.</i>

569
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:05,910
Hey! What about Rita?
We can't just leave her here.

570
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,242
I don't care.
Come on!

571
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:12,717
Oh, shit. Wait a second. What are we gonna do?

572
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,753
Wait, okay, I know.
Here's what we do.

573
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,618
We go to the time machine,
then when I get back to the past...

574
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:19,658
I tell her not
to do the experiment.

575
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:21,954
- Then she won't even be here. That'll work, right?
- Uh-

576
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:24,030
<i>- No, wait.
Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

577
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,928
She already is here. That must mean
I didn't go back in time, right?

578
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:30,230
- Uh- - No, wait, hold on. It
just means I haven't done it yet.

579
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:33,134
Okay, so I go back and I tell
her not to do the experiment.

580
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,799
Then I won't have to do it either
because she won't be here.

581
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,309
- Then I won't have to come
back and save her, right? - I-

582
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:41,073
- But then, wait. Why am I still here?
- Uh-

583
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,149
Goddamn, how does
this time travel work?

584
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:47,117
<i>- Please stand clear.
- Freeze! Hands up! Don't move!</i>

585
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,916
- Put your hands up!
- Don't move! Freeze!

586
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:03,126
Look, if you guys are
taking me back to that jail...

587
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:05,966
<i>just go ahead and shoot me,
'cause there's no way-</i>

588
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,337
Ow! Fuck! Ow! Ow!

589
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:13,936
- What?
- Ow! Ow. Ow. Ow.

590
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,981
<i>What?</i>

591
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:18,312
<i>- Ow! God! Hey, stop!
- Damn it.</i>

592
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:23,950
<i>- What is this?
- Okay, sir, this is the White House.</i>

593
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:26,355
<i>- What are we doing at the White House?
- What?</i>

594
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:28,757
<i>Ow! Ow! Goddamn!</i>

595
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:32,320
<i>It turned out the results
of Joe's I. Q. test...</i>

596
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:36,528
<i>had caught the attention
of the highest levels of government.</i>

597
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:40,800
Okay, wait a minute. I'm the smartest guy
in the world? Says who?

598
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:43,000
The I. Q. test you
took in prison.

599
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,873
You got the highest score in history.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

600
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:48,880
<i>Yeah, dumb ass, you're even smarter
than President Camacho.</i>

601
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:51,746
That's how come he's making
you secretary of interior.

602
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,819
Okay, so who are you?

603
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,649
I'm the secretary of energy.

604
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:58,417
He won a contest.
Got to be a cabinet member.

605
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:02,325
I'm the secretary of state.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

606
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:05,693
- Why do you keep saying that?
- 'Cause they pay me every time I do.

607
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:09,666
It's a really good way to make money.
You're so smart, why don't you know that?

608
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,997
- He's the secretary of defense.
- Hi.

609
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:17,076
And, uh, funbags over there
is the attorney general.

610
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:19,509
Hi.

611
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,773
And that's
the secretary of education.

612
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,217
<i>He's kinda stupid, but he's
President Camacho's stepbrother.</i>

613
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,550
<i>Still, he does
a pretty good job, eh?</i>

614
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:33,217
You know, I think there's been
some kind of mistake...

615
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:36,784
'cause the test I took
was real, real easy.

616
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:40,889
I'm not the smartest guy
in the world. Okay?

617
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:49,164
Okay, even if that were true,
I can't be the secretary of the interior.

618
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:52,733
<i>- I don't even know what it is.
- You better find out.</i>

619
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,712
- Sit down. It's President Camacho.
- Hey, hey, hey, yo...

620
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:59,774
<i>I gotta take care of some "bidness," baby,
so I need y'all to wait outside.</i>

621
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:04,823
<i>Dwayne Elizondo Camacho,
five-time Ultimate Smackdown Champion...</i>

622
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:08,883
<i>porn superstar, and president
of the United States...</i>

623
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:12,396
<i>had called a special summit
with the smartest man in the world.</i>

624
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:15,126
- So you smart, huh?
- No, no.

625
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:21,734
I thought your head would be bigger.

626
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,838
Goddamn.

627
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:29,312
It look like a peanut.

628
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:31,349
Let's get you sworn in.

629
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:49,599
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president of America!</i>

630
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:55,674
<i>President Camacho!</i>

631
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,473
Shut up.

632
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,640
<i>Shut up. Sit your monkey ass down.</i>

633
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,308
Chill out.

634
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:10,988
Shit.

635
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:16,456
<i>I know shit's bad right now
with all that starvin' bullshit.</i>

636
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:21,131
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

637
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:22,861
Yeah!

638
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,870
- But I got a solution.
- That's what you said last time, dipshit!

639
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:27,872
<i>I got a solution.
You're a dick!</i>

640
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:30,568
South Carolina, "whassup?"

641
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:41,248
That's what I thought!

642
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:47,322
Now, I understand everyone's
shit's emotional right now...

643
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:49,952
but listen up.

644
00:43:50,063 --> 00:43:52,827
I got a three-point plan
to fix everything.

645
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:54,422
<i>Break it down, Camacho!</i>

646
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:59,733
Number one,
we got this guy, Not Sure.

647
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,674
<i>- Number two, he's got a higher
I. Q. than any man alive.</i>

648
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:09,077
<i>And number three, he's gonna fix everything.</i>

649
00:44:09,182 --> 00:44:12,413
<i>I give you my word
as president.</i>

650
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:15,043
He'll fix the problems
with all the dead crops.

651
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:17,554
He's gonna
make 'em grow again.

652
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:22,617
<i>- Crops?
- And that ain't all. I give you my word.</i>

653
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:27,757
He's gonna fix
the dust storms too.

654
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:32,096
I give you my word.

655
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:35,732
He's gonna
fix the "ecomony. "

656
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:40,608
And he's so smart...

657
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:45,912
he's gonna do it all in one week.

658
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,579
<i>President Camacho stood before
the world and promised everyone...</i>

659
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:53,284
<i>that Joe would solve
all their problems.</i>

660
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:57,557
<i>He would not only end the dust bowl
and heal the economy...</i>

661
00:44:57,663 --> 00:45:00,291
<i>but he would cure acne
and carsickness as well.</i>

662
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,664
<i>And if he didn't...</i>

663
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:05,260
<i>President Camacho
made another promise.</i>

664
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:09,000
<i>He would kick Joe's smart balls
all the way up to the roof of his smart mouth.</i>

665
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:13,272
<i>- And then, he would throw
his brainy ass back in jail.</i>

666
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:19,878
I should, uh, be honest
with you, Mr. President.

667
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:22,113
I don't know how to be
secretary of anything.

668
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,688
I mean, I've never
even voted, actually.

669
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,588
I don't know what the secretary
of the interior even is.

670
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:31,356
Come on, scrot. Don't be a pussy.
It beats jail, don't it?

671
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:35,798
Besides,
you do a kick-ass job...

672
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:38,132
you get a full
presidential pardon.

673
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:40,137
- No jail time.
- Yeah?

674
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,868
Fuck, yeah!
Now gimme a beer.

675
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:46,035
<i>And get you one too.</i>

676
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:53,943
Shit!

677
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:56,521
<i>Hold on, vato!</i>

678
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,351
<i>Whoo!</i>

679
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:21,072
- Do somethin' smart.
- Yeah.

680
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:26,077
Uh, okay.
Uh-

681
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:29,245
<i>I'll, uh-</i>

682
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:32,916
- Hey, we found that lawyer you wanted.
- Oh, okay. Great, thanks.

683
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:38,019
<i>Uh, right now, I'm going to, uh, you know,
confer with my counsel.</i>

684
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,995
<i>You understand?
So I'll be right back.</i>

685
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,466
Gotta go, uh, work on some crop stuff,
get that taken care of.

686
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:48,233
- Hopefully get it worked out by the time we get back here.
- Sounds pretty smart.

687
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,309
Wait here, okay?
Wait there.

688
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:53,242
Dude, this is trepidatious.
You got me a room at the White House.

689
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,314
Everyone gets laid at the White House.
Everyone.

690
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:57,041
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

691
00:46:57,149 --> 00:47:00,585
I'm real glad you're happy to be here, Frito,
but I brought you here to help me.

692
00:47:00,686 --> 00:47:03,348
<i>I don't know the first thing
about growin' crops...</i>

693
00:47:03,456 --> 00:47:05,686
much less
the goddamn "ecomony. "

694
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:07,725
Econ-Economy.

695
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:10,762
Let's see.
Growin' crops-

696
00:47:10,863 --> 00:47:14,526
No, I just need you to tell me
how to get to the time machine.

697
00:47:14,634 --> 00:47:18,798
Oh, that's easy.
You go down by the museum and stuff.

698
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:20,930
It's, like-
It's, like, by the museum...

699
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,634
sort of, but, well,
actually, not really.

700
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:28,271
More like- But on the street. You go, um-
Wait. Let me start over.

701
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,246
Okay, you know
where the time machine is?

702
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,318
Hey. Just draw me
a map, okay?

703
00:47:33,419 --> 00:47:36,047
You still want the money?

704
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:38,988
Oh. If I had some money
and a room at the White House...

705
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:43,994
- I would be like, "It's mine, all night!"
- Listen. Cut it out!

706
00:47:44,096 --> 00:47:46,894
Listen, I told these people
that you were smart, okay?

707
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,229
- So act smart!
- Smart like you?

708
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:52,827
<i>"Oh, I gotta go
to the time machine. I wanna go home. "</i>

709
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,737
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't talk like that. "

710
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:57,775
Shit, I thought
there was two of you.

711
00:47:57,877 --> 00:47:59,674
See?

712
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:02,339
<i>Doesn't look that big, is it?</i>

713
00:48:02,448 --> 00:48:05,576
Okay. Let's go take a look
at those crops.

714
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:09,678
Especially the ones, uh, you know,
out around the museum area.

715
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,986
All right?
Hey, come on!

716
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:20,490
Now, you either lead, follow,
or get out of the way. All right?

717
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,933
Whoa.
Did you just make that up?

718
00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:26,971
Yes, I did.
Now look...

719
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:29,667
I also need help finding this girl named Rita,
like, immediately...

720
00:48:29,775 --> 00:48:32,175
- and Frito will give you a hand with it.
- Why?

721
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:39,044
Well, because, uh, you know,
she'd be an essential... integral... asset...

722
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:43,952
<i>you know, for our team,
for us to, you know, utilize.</i>

723
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:53,497
Utilize her!
Utilize her!

724
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,692
<i>Utilize!</i>

725
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:58,861
Hey, uh, but you're gonna bring her here, right?

726
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:01,667
Oh, yeah.
Butt first!

727
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:06,512
<i>- Utilize her!
- Okay.</i>

728
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:15,518
Dang! May I approach
your benches?

729
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:23,755
Uh, yeah.
This sucks pretty bad.

730
00:49:23,863 --> 00:49:26,696
<i>Frito, why don't you come over here and,
uh, take a look at this?</i>

731
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:30,235
<i>Come on. Hustle over here, buddy.
I wanna figure this out.</i>

732
00:49:30,336 --> 00:49:34,136
See, uh, just not a lot of moisture.
Have you got the map?

733
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,208
- Oh, yeah.
- Discreetly.

734
00:49:40,546 --> 00:49:43,310
- It's right there.
- I see it. I see it.

735
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:45,976
<i>Stand up with me.</i>

736
00:49:46,085 --> 00:49:49,953
Yo, Mr. Secretary Not Sure.
They found that whore you wanted.

737
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:53,048
Hey, that may be how you refer
to women in the future, but come on.

738
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:57,425
No, sir. Turns out she charged some guy
a lotta money and didn't put out.

739
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,521
<i>Don't worry though.
We'll get her out...</i>

740
00:49:59,632 --> 00:50:02,931
on a work-release whorin' license
as long as you're doin' her.

741
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:06,232
Get your hands off me. What do you think
I'm gonna do, run through the field?

742
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:08,670
What the fuck
are you all starin' at?

743
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:10,799
- Joe?
- That's Not Sure, ma'am.

744
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:14,812
- Secretary Not Sure.
- Secretary? Secretary of what?

745
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:19,510
Say, would you guys mind if we had
a little moment together? Alone?

746
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:24,021
<i>You know,
in the bushes?</i>

747
00:50:25,758 --> 00:50:27,692
Oh, man.

748
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:39,829
- Fuck her, Joe!
- Hey, you want us to come along, make sure she puts out?

749
00:50:39,939 --> 00:50:41,964
No, thanks.
I can handle it. Yeah.

750
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:45,305
I thought you was in jail.
How'd you get to be the secretary of interior?

751
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:47,709
Just keep walking.
I'll explain everything.

752
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,457
Okay.
Get ready to run.

753
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:03,554
<i>- What?
- Oh, goddamn it.</i>

754
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:06,460
Way to go, Frito. You know what?
Just make a run for it anyways.

755
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,499
We'll ask for directions
on the way.

756
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:11,764
No way. I spent the last two days
looking for it. It ain't easy to find.

757
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:14,840
Damn it. I can't go back to jail,
and I sure can't solve these problems.

758
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,068
All's I know is I better find Upgrayedd
before he finds me.

759
00:51:18,177 --> 00:51:21,544
Listen to me. Upgrayedd
cannot find you, okay? It's impossible!

760
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:24,377
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! And even if Upgrayedd...

761
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:26,474
could somehow magically
travel through time...

762
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:30,021
we got secret service guys with huge guns
protecting us, okay?

763
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:32,022
So don't worry.
You're safe.

764
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:35,287
And you know what? It's none of my business,
but when we get back...

765
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:38,022
you and Upgrayedd should seriously think
about couples counseling, okay?

766
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,567
And you should also think about maybe finding
an art manager who's not also your boyfriend.

767
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:46,764
<i>Hey!
She's not puttin' out?</i>

768
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:51,002
Uh, no, she is.
We, uh-We already did it.

769
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,601
<i>Yeah. He was great.</i>

770
00:51:55,815 --> 00:51:59,478
Okay. Hey, a couple of us guys
were wonderin', uh...

771
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,553
if we'd go family-style
on her.

772
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:07,547
Uh, yeah,
probably not right now.

773
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,118
<i>We should focus on the crops.
So let's get back to work. Maybe later.</i>

774
00:52:18,237 --> 00:52:19,932
What the hell is this?

775
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:26,710
<i>- Tastes like Gatorade.
- Is that that Brawndo stuff?</i>

776
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:30,543
<i>They're watering crops
with a sports drink?</i>

777
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:34,948
<i>Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator
had come to replace water...</i>

778
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:37,215
<i>virtually everywhere.</i>

779
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,518
<i>Water, the basic component
of all life...</i>

780
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:42,617
<i>had been deemed a threat
to Brawndo's profit margin.</i>

781
00:52:42,728 --> 00:52:46,220
<i>The solution came during
the budget crisis of 2330...</i>

782
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:51,167
<i>when the Brawndo Corporation
simply bought the F. D. A...</i>

783
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,737
<i>and the F. C. C...</i>

784
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:55,068
<i>enabling them to say,
do and sell...</i>

785
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:57,074
<i>anything they wanted.</i>

786
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:04,742
<i>Joe didn't know
any of this...</i>

787
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,843
<i>but he did see a problem
that he might actually be able to solve.</i>

788
00:53:08,954 --> 00:53:13,516
<i>- With his options running out,
Joe took a bold step.</i>

789
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:15,753
<i>He would not
get out of the way.</i>

790
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:18,728
<i>This time, he would lead.</i>

791
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:20,856
For the last time,
I'm pretty sure...

792
00:53:20,966 --> 00:53:23,935
what's killing the crops
is this Brawndo stuff.

793
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:26,800
But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
It's got electrolytes.

794
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:28,965
<i>So wait a minute.
What you're saying...</i>

795
00:53:29,074 --> 00:53:32,874
is that you want us
to put water on the crops.

796
00:53:32,978 --> 00:53:36,004
- Yes.
- Water. Like out the toilet?

797
00:53:36,115 --> 00:53:40,108
Well, I mean, it doesn't have to be
out of the toilet, but, yeah, that's the idea.

798
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:43,552
- But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
- It's got electrolytes.

799
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:45,624
Okay, look.

800
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:49,216
The plants aren't growing, so I'm pretty sure
that the Brawndo's not working.

801
00:53:49,328 --> 00:53:53,992
Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know
that if you put water on plants, they grow.

802
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:57,796
Well, I've never seen no plants
grow out of no toilet.

803
00:53:57,903 --> 00:54:01,168
Hey, that's good. You sure you ain't
the smartest guy in the world?

804
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:05,232
- You wanna solve this problem.
I wanna get my pardon.

805
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:09,303
So why don't we just try it, okay,
and not worry about what plants crave?

806
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:11,883
Brawndo's got
what plants crave.

807
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:14,509
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, it's got electrolytes.

808
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,054
What are electrolytes?
Do you even know?

809
00:54:17,156 --> 00:54:19,920
It's what they use
to make Brawndo.

810
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:22,653
Yeah, but why do they
use them to make Brawndo?

811
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:25,321
'Cause Brawndo's
got electrolytes.

812
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:32,771
<i>After several hours,
Joe finally gave up on logic and reason...</i>

813
00:54:32,871 --> 00:54:35,931
<i>and simply told the cabinet
that he could talk to plants...</i>

814
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:38,669
<i>and that they wanted water.</i>

815
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:42,110
<i>He made believers
out of everyone.</i>

816
00:54:42,214 --> 00:54:45,775
<i>Joe didn't know it,
but the beloved electrolytes...</i>

817
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:49,843
<i>were salts that had been
building up in the topsoil over the decades...</i>

818
00:54:49,955 --> 00:54:52,685
<i>killing plants
and leading to the dust bowl.</i>

819
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:58,525
<i>As secretary of the interior,
Joe ordered all crops to be switched to water...</i>

820
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,761
<i>promising that, over time, plants would grow
and the dust bowl would end.</i>

821
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,896
<i>He was on the fast track
to a full presidential pardon.</i>

822
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:11,135
<i>Or so it seemed.</i>

823
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:16,146
Man, I hope somethin'
grows fast.

824
00:55:16,248 --> 00:55:18,239
Yeah. So we can haul
our ass back home.

825
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,945
Man. You really think those people
would have starved to death?

826
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:28,119
I don't know. I mean, how did the world
ever get like this?

827
00:55:28,227 --> 00:55:32,095
You know things are bad
when they're comin' to me for answers.

828
00:55:32,197 --> 00:55:34,961
- It's a weird feeling being smarter than everyone.
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,297
- I'm not used to it.
- Yeah. Me neither.

830
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,770
You think Einstein walked around thinkin'
everyone was a bunch of dumb shits?

831
00:55:43,876 --> 00:55:46,436
Yeah.
Hadn't thought of that.

832
00:55:46,545 --> 00:55:50,675
- Now you know why he built that bomb.
- Yeah.

833
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:55,280
Hey, Joe, listen.
Those cops-

834
00:55:55,387 --> 00:55:57,651
<i>- Oh, hey. I'm sorry about that.
- No. No.</i>

835
00:55:57,756 --> 00:56:00,782
They said that
you got me a pardon.

836
00:56:00,893 --> 00:56:03,919
You know, if you hadn't done that,
I'd still be in jail right now, so...

837
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,858
I guess I owe you one.

838
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:13,630
You know, you don't have to sleep
on the floor if you don't want to.

839
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,204
Oh. No. I'm-
I'm all right. Yeah.

840
00:56:19,311 --> 00:56:23,372
Besides, you know, I don't think Upgrayedd
would be too happy about that.

841
00:56:23,482 --> 00:56:25,143
You in bed with a stranger.

842
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,149
Yeah.

843
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:33,888
I know. I know.

844
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:40,988
<i>Yeah. Oh, boy.</i>

845
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:51,501
Oh, shit.
It's Upgrayedd.

846
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,044
<i>Oh, shit. It's not Upgrayedd.</i>

847
00:56:54,146 --> 00:56:56,444
<i>Given enough time,
Joe's plan might have worked.</i>

848
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:58,880
<i>But when the Brawndo stock
suddenly dropped to zero...</i>

849
00:56:58,984 --> 00:57:01,418
<i>leaving half the population
unemployed...</i>

850
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,217
<i>dumb, angry mobs took to the streets,
rioting and looting...</i>

851
00:57:05,324 --> 00:57:07,258
<i>and screaming
for Joe's head.</i>

852
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,055
<i>An emergency cabinet meeting
was called...</i>

853
00:57:10,162 --> 00:57:12,494
<i>with the C. E. O.
of the Brawndo Corporation.</i>

854
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:15,066
How come nobody's buying
Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator?

855
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:17,533
Aw, shit. Half the country
works for Brawndo.

856
00:57:17,636 --> 00:57:20,400
<i>Not anymore!
The stock has dropped to zero...</i>

857
00:57:20,506 --> 00:57:22,667
<i>and the computer did
that auto-layoff thing to everybody.</i>

858
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:25,334
- We're all unemployed!
- You think that makes the "ecomony" suck?

859
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:29,505
- Why is this happening?
- I think it's because we switched to water, but-

860
00:57:29,615 --> 00:57:32,106
- You mean this is all your fault?
- What?

861
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:36,051
Yeah, this is your fault. This shit started
happening when we switched to water!

862

He tried taking water
from toilets...

865
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:54,939
but it's Secretary Not Sure
who finds himself in the toilet now.

866

871
00:58:15,194 --> 00:58:19,392
Thank you, Velveeta.
Well, it started off boring and slow...

872
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:23,059

00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:34,269
<i>He said, "Man, whatever.</i>

877
00:58:34,379 --> 00:58:36,973
<i>The guy's guilty as shit.
We all know that. "</i>

878
00:58:37,082 --> 00:58:40,848
<i>And he sentenced his ass
to one night of Rehabilitation.</i>

879
00:58:40,953 --> 00:58:43,513
Hey, rehabilitation?
One night?

880
00:58:43,622 --> 00:58:45,522
Doesn't sound so bad.

881
00:58:45,624 --> 00:58:47,489
Not so bad, huh?

882
00:58:47,593 --> 00:58:50,858
<i>Here's some highlights
from last week's Rehabilitation.</i>

883
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,934
<i>And who could forget that wonderful finish...</i>

884
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,534
<i>by Rehab Officer Tylenol Jones?</i>

885
00:59:07,646 --> 00:59:11,343
And tomorrow night looks even more better.

886
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:15,853
Word is that Beef Supreme himself
might come out of retirement.

887
00:59:15,954 --> 00:59:18,650
Wow. Thank you, Formica.

888
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:23,117
So you think you can escape again
like you did last time?

889
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:26,026
- No. They pretty much fixed that.
- How?

890
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:28,395
They chained me
to a big rock.

891
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:31,701
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

892
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:33,998
Look, Rita, get Frito.

893
00:59:34,106 --> 00:59:37,234
Get him to take you back to the time machine
without me. Don't wait.

894
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:41,369
No. You could have split on me before,
but you didn't.

895
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,881
Look, you wanna pay me back?
Just go back, okay?

896
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:47,543
Tell people to read books.

897
00:59:47,653 --> 00:59:49,746
Tell people to stay in school,
you know.

898
00:59:49,855 --> 00:59:53,382
Tell people to just
use their brains or something.

899
00:59:53,492 --> 00:59:56,689
<i>I think maybe the world got like this
because of people like me.</i>

900
00:59:56,795 --> 01:00:01,391
I never did anything with my life.
At least you were an artist, you know?

901
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,060
<i>- So just go back and-
- Visit's over!</i>

902
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,497
And Rita, whatever you do,
keep painting, okay?

903
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:14,012
Good luck, Joe.

904
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:24,086
<i>Okay, that's five down and one more to go.</i>

905
01:00:24,189 --> 01:00:27,886
<i>Are you ready for a monster-truck duel
to the death?</i>

906
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:31,520
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up
for the Guitar Army.</i>

907
01:00:33,632 --> 01:00:35,600
<i>Okay, we're gonna do this shit.</i>

908
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:38,864
<i>But first, to lead us
in our Natural Anthem...</i>

909
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:43,737
<i>the star of Ow! My Balls!
Hormel Chavez!</i>

910
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:46,777
Thank you. Thank you.

911
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:51,872
<i>Hey! Come here!</i>

912
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:55,544
Come here!

913
01:00:55,654 --> 01:00:57,554
<i>Right in the balls!</i>

914
01:00:57,656 --> 01:01:02,457
That's just how that shit went on TV!

915
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:06,793
This execution is brought to you
by Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator.

916
01:01:06,898 --> 01:01:08,798
<i>After you've killed someone...</i>

917
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,834
<i>- your body needs electrolytes.
- Yeah.</i>

918
01:01:10,936 --> 01:01:14,235
So, my car's out front...

919
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:16,603
whenever you want me
to take you...

920
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,938
to the time machine.

921
01:01:19,044 --> 01:01:20,978
Thanks, Frito.

922
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:23,172
<i>- Yeah.
- I can't hear you!</i>

923
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:26,478
That's a real bummer
about Joe, huh?

924
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:29,179
<i>- I can't hear you!
- Yeah.</i>

925
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:34,748
<i>Oh! Can you turn this up?
I love Rehabilitation.</i>

926
01:01:46,271 --> 01:01:50,731
<i>Okay. Let's meet
our rehabilitation officers for tonight.</i>

927
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:54,141
<i>With a combined record
of 62 kills...</i>

928
01:01:54,246 --> 01:01:59,081
<i>please welcome Vinny Mawumba
in the Dildozer!</i>

929
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:10,658
<i>And his brother Bobby Mawumba
in the Ass Blaster!</i>

930
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:12,730
I get a truck too, right?

931
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:15,561
Yeah.
Here it comes.

932
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,178
Get in.

933
01:02:31,683 --> 01:02:34,049
You still got
the chain attached.

934
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:38,814
<i>- Door won't shut.
- What about the chain?</i>

935
01:02:38,924 --> 01:02:40,892
- We could break it.
- No. He could escape.

936
01:02:40,992 --> 01:02:44,553
- I got an idea. Let's put it in the trunk.
- Yeah. That'll work.

937
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:51,694
<i>- Who's smart now?
- Let's bring out our criminal.</i>

938
01:02:51,803 --> 01:02:54,931
<i>He tried to ruin the country
by pouring toilet water on crops.</i>

939
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,440
<i>He cost millions of people
their jobs.</i>

940
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:00,875
<i>Let's get ready
to rehabilitate Not Sure!</i>

941
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:15,257
Never would have guessed
this is how I was gonna die.

942
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,261
<i>Are you ready for some car-on-car action?</i>

943
01:03:18,363 --> 01:03:20,331
Yes.

944
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:24,266
- I can't watch this.
- This is-

945
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:28,863
<i>This is gonna be so sad.
I hope I don't cry.</i>

946
01:03:30,675 --> 01:03:34,577
Holy shit!
Frito, come here! Look!

947
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:37,147
He was right.
The water- it worked.

948
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:39,877
Frito, can you
get me over there?

949
01:03:40,852 --> 01:03:42,752
Yes.

950
01:03:42,854 --> 01:03:45,846
<i>No, you fuckin' moron.
To the Rehabilitation place.</i>

951
01:03:45,957 --> 01:03:47,982
- Uh, this way.
- Yeah!

952
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:54,464
Come on, Frito.
Hurry!

953
01:03:54,566 --> 01:03:57,592
<i>And now the dude that
everybody came here to see...</i>

954
01:03:57,702 --> 01:04:01,297
<i>- Yeah!
- the only undefeated officer ever in history...</i>

955
01:04:01,406 --> 01:04:04,933
<i>coming out of retirement
just to pound Not Sure's ass...</i>

956
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:10,003
<i>driving the biggest, hugest correctional
vehicle ever built in history-</i>

957
01:04:10,115 --> 01:04:13,983
<i>bigger than the Dildozer,
bigger than the Ass Blaster...</i>

958
01:04:14,085 --> 01:04:18,112
<i>bigger and huger than everything
ever before in history-</i>

959
01:04:18,223 --> 01:04:21,158
<i>the brand-new Assdozer!</i>

960
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:23,955
<i>Give it up for Beef Supreme!</i>

961
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:29,432
Oh!

962
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,374
Oh!

963
01:04:51,756 --> 01:04:55,021
<i>Oh, shit. I think it was too big, huh?</i>

964
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:57,617
<i>We seem to be
"experimenting"...</i>

965
01:04:57,729 --> 01:05:01,028
<i>some "techmological"
differences...</i>

966
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:03,032
<i>so, uh, shit.</i>

967
01:05:03,134 --> 01:05:06,501
Frito, look!

968
01:05:06,605 --> 01:05:08,800
- It's working everywhere!
- Huh.

969
01:05:08,907 --> 01:05:12,968
<i>Well, shit. That's a big pile of rocks.</i>

970
01:05:13,078 --> 01:05:16,206
<i>- Kinda reminds me of this one time that I was-
- Man.</i>

971
01:05:16,314 --> 01:05:18,339
<i>- Hey!
- Oh, oh, okay.</i>

972
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,645
<i>- Get this shit started!
- We're gonna start without Beef Supreme.</i>

973
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:24,483
<i>Let the rehabilitation begin!</i>

974
01:05:34,032 --> 01:05:36,592
Oh, shit.

975
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:39,602
Come on. Come on.

976
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:42,172
<i>Come on, Frito. Hurry!</i>

977
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:47,505
Oh!

978
01:05:52,217 --> 01:05:53,741
Goddamn it.

979
01:05:56,154 --> 01:06:00,022
- Yeah!
- Jesus, that was close.

980
01:06:02,527 --> 01:06:05,428
Mr. President! Mr. President,
I need to talk to you.

981
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,725
<i>You gotta stop this thing.
He was right about the water.</i>

982
01:06:07,832 --> 01:06:10,733
<i>We passed some crops
on the way here. They're growing.</i>

983
01:06:10,835 --> 01:06:12,735
I didn't see no crops.

984
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:15,567
<i>They're circling around.</i>

985
01:06:15,674 --> 01:06:18,199
<i>They're gonna do
the Malachi Crunch on him!</i>

986
01:06:20,845 --> 01:06:24,246
<i>- This is an illegal move, okay? So don't tell nobody.
- Oh!</i>

987
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:48,062
<i>So, uh-So the winner is, uh-</i>

988
01:06:49,874 --> 01:06:53,071
<i>- You gotta be shittin' me.
- Did he win?</i>

989
01:06:55,947 --> 01:06:58,142
Uh-oh. Look.

990
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:03,749
<i>Holy shit! It's Beef Supreme!</i>

991
01:07:11,096 --> 01:07:12,859
<i>Beef Supreme! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

992
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:17,230
Hey, Frito. Frito, you remember
those crops we saw off the road...

993
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:19,963
- right by the Starbucks?
- Uh-huh.

994
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:24,167
- Hey. Wanna make some money?
- I like money.

995
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:42,689
Hey, um, the, uh- the main
screen is malfunctioning...

996
01:07:42,794 --> 01:07:45,319
and they gonna need you
outside immediately.

997
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:51,559
There's a bunch of whores
in the hallway.

998
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:57,230
Come on, Frito.
Hurry.

999
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,402
Can't believe
you like money too.

1000
01:08:00,512 --> 01:08:03,003
- We should hang out.
- Totally.

1001
01:08:28,339 --> 01:08:30,364
<i>He's behind the truck!</i>

1002
01:08:32,477 --> 01:08:35,241
Yes! Yes!

1003
01:08:36,614 --> 01:08:38,673
- He's behind the fucking truck!
- He's over there!

1004
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,842
<i>Behind the truck, stupid!</i>

1005
01:08:51,162 --> 01:08:52,754
Look!

1006
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:58,527
Shit.
That's a good deal.

1007
01:08:58,636 --> 01:09:03,130
<i>- Extra foam.
- I got a bunch of money too.</i>

1008
01:09:03,241 --> 01:09:05,869
- Forgot what it was for.
- Huh.

1009
01:09:07,145 --> 01:09:10,945
- You think it was for lattes?
- Yeah. Probably.

1010
01:09:11,049 --> 01:09:15,315
<i>- You like money and sex? You're trippin' me out.
- What the fuck?</i>

1011
01:09:17,555 --> 01:09:19,785
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1012
01:09:29,434 --> 01:09:33,302
- Just hold on, okay?
Everyone just take it easy, okay?

1013
01:09:33,404 --> 01:09:35,304
Can I just
say something here?

1014
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:40,644
I don't even know
what I'm guilty of here.

1015
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:44,647
I never said that I was the smartest person
on earth. You people did.

1016
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:48,412
I didn't know that you'd lose your jobs
and all your money...

1017
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:50,646
and I'm very sorry
that that happened.

1018
01:09:50,755 --> 01:09:52,780
<i>But I'm tellin' you...</i>

1019
01:09:52,891 --> 01:09:55,257
if you put water on the crops,
it might actually-

1020
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,352
No, it will work.
I promise you!

1021
01:09:58,463 --> 01:10:02,866
<i>You just have to believe me.
I just wanted to help you. That's all.</i>

1022
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:07,802
<i>So you can try and shoot me.
You can try and run me over, whatever.</i>

1023
01:10:07,906 --> 01:10:11,364
But I just want you to ask yourselves
one question first.

1024
01:10:12,577 --> 01:10:15,102
Do you really want to live
in a world...

1025
01:10:15,213 --> 01:10:18,705
where you try to blow up the one person
that's tryin' to help you?

1026
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,790
Hold on. Just hold on.

1027
01:10:53,184 --> 01:10:55,379
Oh, man.
That was great.

1028
01:10:55,486 --> 01:10:59,149
Hey, was I wearing pants
when we went in there?

1029
01:10:59,257 --> 01:11:02,658
Shit. What do I look like,
a pants goblin?

1030
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,093
Wait.
This reminds me of something.

1031
01:11:06,197 --> 01:11:09,064
<i>Uh, "Rehabil-Rehabilate-</i>

1032
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:12,364
- Rehabilation. "
- Why do you keep trying to read that word?

1033
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,997
- You a fag?
- I'll fag your face!

1034
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:27,675
- Come on, Frito.
- Yeah. I don't think so.

1035
01:11:29,053 --> 01:11:31,521
Oh, yeah.

1036
01:12:13,031 --> 01:12:17,491
This guy just got
his ass a pardon!

1037
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,273
Yeah!

1038
01:12:41,559 --> 01:12:44,995
Man, Rita. I mean,
I don't know what to say.

1039
01:12:45,096 --> 01:12:48,361
You saved my life.
No one's ever done anything like that for me.

1040
01:12:48,466 --> 01:12:50,366
Yeah, well...

1041
01:12:50,468 --> 01:12:53,494
you were looking out for the whole world so,
you know...

1042
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:57,301
- I thought someone should look out for you too.
- Thanks.

1043
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,276
I can't believe I'm even
saying this, but...

1044
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:03,370
<i>even though these people
tried to kill me...</i>

1045
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:06,939
- you know, I think I'm actually gonna kinda miss 'em.
- Yeah.

1046
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:09,884
Frito- he's gonna give us
a ride back to the time machine.

1047
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:13,218
I just, uh-
I hope he's okay to drive.

1048
01:13:14,659 --> 01:13:17,787
It's you. Oh, man,
I really love your show.

1049
01:13:17,895 --> 01:13:20,193
Thank you so much.

1050
01:13:20,298 --> 01:13:25,463
<i>- Uh, Joe, I'm not going.
- What?</i>

1051
01:13:27,271 --> 01:13:31,139
I had some pretty bad habits back there
that I don't want to fall into again.

1052
01:13:31,242 --> 01:13:33,210
Maybe it's time
I got a new start.

1053
01:13:33,311 --> 01:13:37,441
<i>Besides, they offered me
a pretty good job at Starbucks here.</i>

1054
01:13:37,548 --> 01:13:40,210
- I'm gonna be a C. E. O.
- At Starbucks?

1055
01:13:40,318 --> 01:13:43,151
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You're still gonna paint though, right?

1056
01:13:44,822 --> 01:13:48,223
Yeah. Sure.

1057
01:13:48,326 --> 01:13:50,157
I guess this is
good-bye then.

1058
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:54,259
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

1059
01:13:54,365 --> 01:13:58,529
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1060
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:02,868
Not Sure, get your ass up here,
wherever you is.

1061
01:14:05,476 --> 01:14:07,706
Let me get that little
peanut head up here.

1062
01:14:07,812 --> 01:14:10,576
Yo. Yo.

1063
01:14:10,681 --> 01:14:12,615
I have decided...

1064
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:15,242
to make this man-

1065
01:14:15,353 --> 01:14:18,288
the man who solved
all our problems-

1066
01:14:19,624 --> 01:14:22,286
<i>I have decided to make him...</i>

1067
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:24,691
my new vice president.

1068
01:14:27,231 --> 01:14:30,462
Mr. President, thanks.
That's real cool of you, sir...

1069
01:14:30,568 --> 01:14:34,436
- but I can't accept it, sir.
- What? Why?

1070
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:39,272
- You know, I gotta get home.
- But we still got all these problems.

1071
01:14:39,377 --> 01:14:42,369
Look, you know, you're just gonna
have to solve 'em yourselves.

1072
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,948
- How?
- Think about it, you know?

1073
01:14:45,049 --> 01:14:48,109
You're just gonna have to figure it out
like we did with the crops.

1074
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:52,747
<i>But how are we gonna figure out about
the garbage "ambulanches" and the "comony"?</i>

1075
01:14:52,857 --> 01:14:58,693
<i>And what about the nuc-
"nucular" reactor in Florida?</i>

1076
01:14:58,796 --> 01:15:01,264
It's broke and leaky
and something's happening.

1077
01:15:01,365 --> 01:15:06,735
- I thought it was in Georgia.
- Georgia's in Florida, dumb ass.

1078
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:09,897
Hey. Hey, I know.
Let's put toilet water on it. Huh?

1079
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:13,067
- Yeah!
- Good, good. That's a good idea.

1080
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:15,873
<i>- Like we did on the crops.
- Come on, vato.</i>

1081
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,278
Hey, you can't leave.

1082
01:15:18,382 --> 01:15:24,321
Whatever happened to all that "lead, follow,
or get outta the way" shit, huh?

1083
01:15:35,099 --> 01:15:39,502
I guess I just can't get outta the way anymore,
can I? You know what?

1084
01:15:39,604 --> 01:15:42,505
- Forget about the time machine.
- Yeah!

1085
01:15:46,544 --> 01:15:49,945
That ride sucks anyways.

1086
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:52,174
Ride?

1087
01:15:55,653 --> 01:15:58,121
<i>Welcome to the Time Masheen.</i>

1088
01:15:58,222 --> 01:16:02,716
<i>We are going to take you back,
first to the year 1939...</i>

1089
01:16:02,827 --> 01:16:05,318
<i>when Charlie Chaplin
and his evil Nazi regime...</i>

1090
01:16:05,429 --> 01:16:08,489
<i>enslaved Europe and tried
to take over the world.</i>

1091
01:16:08,599 --> 01:16:11,193
<i>So you knew this thing
was just a ride the whole time?</i>

1092
01:16:11,302 --> 01:16:14,794
Yeah. You thought you could really
travel through time, huh?

1093
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:17,271
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Yeah.

1094
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:20,310
For the smartest guy in the world,
you're pretty dumb sometimes.

1095
01:16:20,411 --> 01:16:25,314
- So why didn't you tell us?
- 'Cause I like money. I'm sorry.

1096
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:29,216
But if it's not a real time machine,
there wouldn't have been any money.

1097
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,812
You know, 'cause I can't go back in time
and open a savings account.

1098
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:35,858
Uh, uh, uh-

1099
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,724
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

1100
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:42,198
Well,
I guess we're stuck here.

1101
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:47,397
<i>But then an even
greater force emerged- the "UN."</i>

1102
01:16:47,505 --> 01:16:51,803
<i>And the "UN"
un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1103
01:16:51,976 --> 01:16:55,468
<i>And so, after serving a short
term as vice president...</i>

1104
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:58,878
<i>Joe was elected
the president of America.</i>

1105
01:16:58,983 --> 01:17:01,144
<i>Frito became vice president...</i>

1106
01:17:01,252 --> 01:17:04,415
<i>and Rita, the former prostitute,
became first lady.</i>

1107
01:17:04,522 --> 01:17:08,014
Today I step into the shoes
of a great man...

1108
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:12,255
a man by the name
of Dwayne Elizondo...

1109
01:17:12,363 --> 01:17:16,356
Mountain Dew
Herbert Camacho.

1110
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:20,597
<i>Under President Not Sure's
leadership, a new era dawned.</i>

1111
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:24,539
You know, there was a time
in this country...

1112
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:28,908
when smart people
were considered cool.

1113
01:17:29,013 --> 01:17:31,948
Well, maybe not cool,
but smart people did things...

1114
01:17:32,049 --> 01:17:36,110
like build ships and pyramids,
and they even went to the moon.

1115
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,744
Yeah!

1116
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:44,088
And there was a time
in this country, a long time ago...

1117
01:17:44,195 --> 01:17:46,595
when reading wasn't
just for fags...

1118
01:17:46,697 --> 01:17:48,961
<i>and neither was writing.</i>

1119
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:53,162
<i>People wrote books and movies,
movies that had stories...</i>

1120
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:57,570
so you cared whose ass it was
and why it was farting.

1121
01:17:57,675 --> 01:18:01,133
And I believe that time
can come again!

1122
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:16,652
Not Sure, Not Sure, Not Sure!

1123
01:18:20,498 --> 01:18:22,466
<i>Joe and Rita had three children...</i>

1124
01:18:22,566 --> 01:18:25,364
<i>the three smartest kids
in the world.</i>

1125
01:18:26,504 --> 01:18:28,995
<i>Vice President Frito
took eight wives...</i>

1126
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:31,540
<i>and had a total of 32 kids-</i>

1127
01:18:31,642 --> 01:18:34,873
<i>thirty-two of the dumbest kids
ever to walk the earth.</i>

1128
01:18:40,117 --> 01:18:43,280
<i>Okay, so maybe Joe
didn't save mankind...</i>

1129
01:18:43,387 --> 01:18:45,821
<i>but he got the ball rolling...</i>

1130
01:18:45,923 --> 01:18:49,723
<i>and that's pretty good
for an average guy.</i>

1131
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:52,322
I'm gonna go find this ho.
