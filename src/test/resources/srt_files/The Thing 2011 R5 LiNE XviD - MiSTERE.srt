1
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,920
I remembered a joke.

2
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,640
It's funny.

3
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
Seorg and his wife
were having sex one night,

4
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,720
 when their young son
 suddenly enters the room.

5
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,120
 Hang on a sec.
 We are going in the right direction?

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
 Olav!

7
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,480
 What are we looking for?

8
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,760
 Just keep going.

9
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,120
 A little bit more or else
 we will be flagged on the site.

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,960
 Okay.
 Continue the joke.

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,000
 The boy gets scared and leaves
 running from the room, crying.

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,400
 The mother says, "Honey! Now,
 what should we do? "

13
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
 You know women...

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,440
 The father says:
 "Let me handle this."

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 Then he leaves
 and goes to the child's bedroom

16
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,200
 to say he was joking.

17
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,040
 He opens the door and sees
 the small bastard

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,840
 is lying on top of his grandmother,
 having sex with her!

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,600
 Very animated too, rises and falls,
 up and down.

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
 Then he looks
 for the father and says:

21
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
 What's wrong, Dad?

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
 You play with mine
so I play with her, right?

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
 Stop!

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
 Is it here?

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,720
 It's right here.

26
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,400
 Don't move!

27
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,320
 Turn on the light.

28
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,040
 Good God!

30
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
 Kate!

31
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
- Shit.
- Sorry, Kate.

32
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,760
These fellas said that you've been
expecting them?

33
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
- Of course, thanks, Hanks.
- Thanks.

34
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Hey, uh...You forgot, didn't you?

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
No, no, I just--

36
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
Yeah.

37
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,000
He just wanted to...
Actually, this is him.

38
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
 I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.

39
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
 Kate Lloyd.

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.
Do you know who I am?

41
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,840
I do.

42
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Adam told me
a little bit about you as well.

43
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,040
 He said you specialized
 in vertebrate paleontology.

44
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,600
Primarily, yes.

45
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,760
And obviously you extracted specimens
from pack ice.

46
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,760
I've worked on several cold weather digs.

47
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
 Good.

48
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,320
An old friend of mine,
a colleague of Oslo,

49
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,160
runs a geological research station
in Antarctica.

50
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,240
48 hours ago, his team found something

51
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
quite remarkable.

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,080
 Really?

53
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
What'd they find?

54
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
We're flying down there tommorow evening
to examine the site.

55
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,320
 And I need a paleontologist.

56
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,080
Doctor, I'm sure you can understand that

57
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,240
I need to know a little bit about what
it is I'm being asked to dig up?

58
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
 There is a structure.

59
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
 A structure?

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,200
 - Yes.
 - In Antarctica?

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
 And a specimen.

62
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
 That's all I can tell you.

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
 And I guess I don't have any time
 to think about this.

64
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,960
 No, I'm sorry. I need
 your answer right now.

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
 Well...

66
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
 I'm in.

67
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
 Great.

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,920
 Adam will get you the details
 of our departure.

69
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,320
 - Right, I'll see you in the car.
 - Yes, of course. Thank you.

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
 Adam.

71
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
 What the hell is it?

72
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,040
You now officially know as much as I do.

73
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,360
 But I'll tell you one thing, I
 worked for that guy for three years

74
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,120
 and I've never seen him this excited.

75
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
 She US?

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
 Look at this guy.

77
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,960
 I mean, how is that even
 humanly possible?

78
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,400
 I was hoping maybe you could
 help me with something?

79
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,360
 I can't seem to get ahold of a newspaper
 three weeks old

80
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,240
 and I'm a man in desperate need
 for certain information.

81
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,920
 Carter, don't do this to
 yourself, man.

82
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
 And what information would that be?

83
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,120
 I want to know how the
 Cavaliers are going.

84
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,480
 I don't follow football.

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,080
 It's a basketball team.

86
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,040
 They play basketball.

87
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,960
 Barely.
 They're the Cavaliers, man.

88
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,880
 - Sorry, I couldn't help you.
 - Nah, that's all right.

89
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,400
 Listen, just so you guys know,
 whatever y'all are doing,

90
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,520
 you might wanna wrap it up
 in a couple of days.

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah, why's that?

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,480
 There's a storm moving in.
 A nasty one.

93
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,520
 Good morning, Griggs.
 Yeah, he's right.

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
 And the last place
 where you want to be

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
 is cooped up with a dozen
 Norwegian guys.

96
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,520
 Trust me.

97
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,720
 Base in sight of my 1 o'clock.

98
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,120
<i> This is H3 Sea King inbound to Thule.
Do you copy?</i>

99
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,600
<i>Hello, H3 Sea King.
 Please, approach from the west.</i>

100
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,480
<i>Landing pad is cleared

101
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,200
<i>Bravo, coming back.</i>

102
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
 Good to go, Griggs.

103
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
 - Dr. Halvorson?
 - Yes?

104
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,840
 - Welcome to Thule.
 - Thank you.

105
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,160
 Edvard asked you to go
 to the site, right now.

106
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,120
 Lars is going to drive you.

107
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
 - Hi.
 - Hi. Welcome.

108
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,120
<i> - Please go in the Spryte </i>.
<i> - Thanks.</i>

109
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,440
 Hello, sir.

110
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
 Watch your step.

111
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,080
 Brighten.

112
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,000
 Edvard!

113
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,240
 - You got it.
 - Sure, I did.

114
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,640
 Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd.

115
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,160
- Columbia paleontology.
- Welcome.

116
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,080
 Adam Finch,
 my research assistant.

117
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,400
 -Welcome.
 - Hi.

118
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
 This is Edvard, my good friend.

119
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,600
 This is some of my team.
 Karl and Juliette. Both geologists.

120
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,160
 - Hi.
 - Welcome.

121
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,560
 Okay.

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,160
 Let me show you why you flew
 10,000 miles.

123
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
 Holy shit!

124
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,040
 We estimated this has been here
 approximately 100,000 years.

125
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,560
 We picked up a signal transmitting.

126
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,240
 Some kind of distress call, perhaps.

127
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,440
 Incredible.

128
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,400
 We think the signal
 was triggered

129
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,600
 when the survivor
 exited the craft.

130
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,520
 Survivor?

131
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,760
 My God.

132
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,480
 How long will it take to get it out,
 do you know, Kate?

133
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,040
 Assuming you've the right equipment,
 I'd say...

134
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
 maybe half a day.

135
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,120
 Good.

136
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,080
 The ice, should I ask you how fragile
 is it?

137
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,960
 It's not in a fracture zone.

138
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,800
 So there's very little risk of fissuring.

139
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
 And the ice is quite dense.

140
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,160
 So we think we can get it out in one piece.

141
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,560
 Good.

142
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,600
 I mean, rough estimates about 6 by 12 feet,
 3 and a half feet high.

143
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,960
 - Probably some place right around--
 - That's great...

144
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,600
 Make sure that everyone stays off
 the radio.

145
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,720
 I do not want any information out.

146
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 And the crane...do we have
 something appropriate for this?

147
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,640
 Yes, it's already there.
 It's all set up.

148
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
 I'm Peder, by the way.

149
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,920
 - Peder.
 - Nice to meet you.

150
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,680
 So, you've gotten it all taken care of.
 I don't think you really need me.

151
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,920
 What about him?
 He's secretly disinterested or--?

152
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,280
 Oh, that's Lars.

153
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,040
 He does not understand English,
 but he works like a bear.

154
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,680
And, as you can see from the scans,
the ship carved a 200m tunnel into the ice.

155
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,920
 So, let me get this right.
 You crashed into a glacier...

156
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,320
 And then without enough information

157
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,840
 you leave the cozy confines of your ship?

158
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,800
 Maybe he was hurt and wanted to find
 someplace warm.

159
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,960
 Well, I guess it didn't find it.

160
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,560
 The first night is hard.

160
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,989
- Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you up.
- No, no, it's fine.

160
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,100
I'll never look at them the same again.

160
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
 What do you mean for transport weight?

161
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,200
 To cut it down to a portable weight, we have to
 take it from here to here.

163
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,920
 Start with 4 inches.

164
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,200
 I never believed in this shit.

165
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,840
 I always did.

166
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,120
 - We're all set?
 - Nearly there.

167
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
 Good.

168
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
 Good.

169
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
 But before we do,
 I'm going to take a tissue sample.

170
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,280
 Do you really that's a good idea?

171
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,080
 Yes, I do.

172
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,240
 I mean the conditions are so unpredictable

173
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
 and we don't have the proper equipment.

174
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,960
 Sterilization is an issue.

175
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
 Edvard, what do you have in the way of
 a small diameter drill?

176
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,840
 Up to 30mm.

177
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,000
 Very good.

178
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,680
 I think somewhere around here.

179
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,720
 Kate.
 Just a second.

180
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,080
 In the future, don't contradict me
 in front of those people again.

181
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,800
 - I just thought...
 - You're not here to think.

182
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,440
  You're here to get that thing safe out of the ice.

183
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,000
 I hope we understand each other.

184
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,960
 So, have you ever tasted this before?

185
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,040
 - No, I haven't.
 - It tastes very bad.

186
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,560
 Gentlemen.
 Ladies.

187
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,200
 After a short but thorough investigation

188
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
 of our visitor,

189
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
 I can say, unequivocally,

190
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,800
 that I've never seen anything
 on any cellular level,

191
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,160
 like what we have
 in that other room.

192
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,200
<i> Now, the impact of this find </i>

193
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,280
<i>will be felt
 for thousands of years. </i>

194
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,720
<i>From this point on, </i>

195
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,960
<i>the world as we know it
 has forever been altered. </i>

196
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,280
 You, my friends,
 will all be immortalized,

197
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
 as the people
 who made this discovery.

198
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
 Thank you.

199
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,200
 Do you think they're going to pay a bonus
 for bringing over an alien

200
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,040
 instead of coal samples?

201
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,960
 You've got anything better than
 this cough syrup?

202
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,840
 - Hey, Griggy.
 - Yeah?

203
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,080
 You want to go out and get the cabinet stash?

204
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
 Sure, no problem.

205
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,920
 I'm on it.

206
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,480
 Where did I put this bottle?

207
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,800
 Jesus Ch...

208
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,240
 Screw you, man.

209
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,320
 Son of a...

210
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,600
 It broke out!

211
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,040
 What?

212
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 It ain't a damn joke, man!

213
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,120
 The freaking thing's alive!

214
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,200
 I was in the room, man,
 looking at the ice

215
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,920
 then the freaking thing jumped out!

216
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,440
 We search
 in groups of two and three.

217
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,320
The entire camp. If you find it, pull out,
don't attempt anything on your own.

217
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,989
And be careful...

217
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,200
We don't know what condition it's in.

217
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:07,330
Griggs, did you leave that open?

217
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:13,250
- I don't remember.
- Shit.

217
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,880
Hey, just be careful, man. That thing jumped
through the fucking roof.

217
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Jesus Christ.

217
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,880
Help! Over here!

217
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,880
Help! Somebody! Over here!

217
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,880
- It attacked Henrik.
- Come on.

217
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,880
- Jesus!
- In there!

217
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
- God, somebody do something!
- Oh my God.

217
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Shoot it! Shoot the fucker, man!

217
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,580
We got to burn that fucker, man! Burn it!

217
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,580
Throw it, throw it!

217
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,780
His blood pressure's low.

217
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
Henrik and...his small children.

217
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,680
Yes, it's horrible. It's a horrible tragedy.

217
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,680
We're all shocked. At what happened to Henrik.

217
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,780
But with due respect, we need to examine the remains
before it all disintegrates.

217
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,780
- Hey, that was a man. Not remains.
- No, I know, I'm talking about the creature.

217
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,880
And I'm sure we're all aware of the importance
of this discovery.

217
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,880
This may be the first and only time
mankind has been visited by an alien lifeform.

217
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:48,350
- And as scientists, we're obliged to study it.
- Didn't work out so well the last time, did it?

217
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,880
I think you should destroy it.

217
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,169
Completely.

217
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,350
- I think you've contributed enough to this matter now.
- Oh, really?

217
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:02,469
Listen, your guy, Olav, back there,
he's in bad shape.

217
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,769
Now, we're going to fly him back to McMurdo
at sun-up and take him to the military hospital.

217
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,969
And what're you going to tell them, hmm?

217
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm gonna tell them the truth, as crazy
as it sounds.

218
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,840
 Kate?
 Can you help here?

219
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,760
 Come on.

220
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,480
 Pull that side up.

221
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,400
 His face is encased in some type
 of amniotic sac.

222
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,920
 The tissue. Looks almost new.

223
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,800
 What was it doing to him?

224
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,240
 It appears that it was absorbing him.

225
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,120
 Some type of digestion.

226
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,520
 It's fascinating.

227
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,600
 It <i>is</i> fascinating.

228
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,680
 - What's the matter? Are you okay?
 - I'm fine.

229
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,400
 - You sure?
 - Yeah, I'm okay.

230
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,080
 - Do you need something?
 - No, no. I'm okay.

231
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,520
 What is this?

232
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,320
 Looks like a titanium plate.

233
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,000
Used to reinforce bones and compound fractures.

234
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,960
 Yeah, that's right.

235
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,440
 Henrik broke his arm last year.

236
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,400
 He had to go to Argentina
 to get it set.

237
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
So if this was in his arm,
what's it doing out of him now?

238
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
That's a good question.

239
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,080
 What are you doing?

240
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,960
 Took a sample of Henrik's tissue.

241
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,200
 I want to find out what this thing
 was doing to him.

242
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,560
 I think you should take a look at this.

243
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,960
 These cells aren't dead.

244
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
 That's not possible.

245
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,640
 Looks like the alien cells
 are somehow

246
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,160
 attacking Henrik's cells
 and then they--

247
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,480
What is that? It looks like
they are transforming...

248
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,520
 They're imitating his cells.

249
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,480
Okay, I don't know if that's what I'm seeing, but...

250
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,400
 They're imitating him.

254
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,960
 It's going to be okay, Olav.

255
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
 A doctor will see you in McMurdo.

257
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,960
 Kate.

258
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,640
- Hey.
- Hi.

259
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,720
 We're leaving.

260
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,270
Once the weather holds up, we'll be back with help

261
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,360
as soon as we can.

262
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,480
 Okay.

263
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,000
 Alright.

264
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,120
 - Keep him warm.
 - I will.

265
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,880
C'mon, let's go.

266
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,280
 Sit down there.

267
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,200
 There you go.

268
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,240
 Ah, let's get the hell out of here.

270
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,000
 Carter!
 Carter, wait!

272
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,280
She's flagging us down.

273
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,720
 - What's wrong?
 - They shouldn't leave.

274
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,080
 Carter.

275
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
 Let's just get out of here, man.

276
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,040
 Alright, fuck it, we're landing.

277
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,440
 Shit.

278
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,120
 Let's take her down.

279
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,520
 Is there something wrong?

280
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,680
 No, everything's fine.

281
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,040
 Probably just forgot something.

282
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,600
 We'll be in the air in no time, okay?

283
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,640
 Don't worry.

284
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,640
 Hang in there.

285
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,760
 Something's wrong.

286
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,640
 Hailing McMurdo, or any ears on
 the emergency channel.

287
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,960
 Do you copy? Over.

288
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,220
I repeat, this is Thule Station.

289
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,720
They crashed here,
right behind this ridgeline.

290
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,040
 It's impossible to reach them.

291
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,080
 This doesn't make any sense.

292
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,670
I mean, they have plenty of visibility, right?

293
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,180
We're not going after them?
Shouldn't we try?

294
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,320
We need a chopper to even get close to them.

295
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,980
And there's refueling and hailing.

296
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,320
All this can't be a coincidence.

297
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,440
Radio's dead. It's fucking dead.

298
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,560
The incoming storm.

299
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,880
Fuck.

300
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,520
There's too much interference.

301
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,560
We have four missing persons.
We have no helicopter or radio.

302
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,680
 You made a mistake
 for bringing these people here.

303
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,160
 More people may die.

304
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,960
 But, Sander, we don't know
 even if they are dead or not.

305
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,160
 Colin, Lars, get your gear.

306
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,960
<i> We'll take a snowcat
to the next base.</i>

307
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,440
 Lars, do it now.

308
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,240
 I don't think that's a good idea.

309
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,120
 And why is that?

310
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
Because no one can leave this camp...

311
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,680
 until we know more about what's going on here.

312
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,240
- I make decisions about this camp.
- I know, Edvard, but...

313
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,080
 Why did you flag down that helicopter?

314
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,840
 Because I thought it was in danger.

315
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,240
 Why?

316
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,320
 I took a sample of Henrik's blood...

317
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,000
 and I saw that the alien cells
 were still alive.

318
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,600
 They were alive and they were copying
 Henrik's cells.

319
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,120
 Replicating them.

320
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,040
 Adam saw it too.

321
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,040
 Is that true?

322
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,120
 I don't know.

323
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
 I mean, I don't know what we saw.

324
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
 I mean, we saw something.

325
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,040
 I don't understand.
 What are you saying?

326
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,040
 That this thing can,
 and probably has,

327
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,000
 replicated a person.

328
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,800
 - What?
 - That can't be.

329
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,480
- Who?
 -This is insane.

330
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,520
 Okay, Okay. Kate? Kate?
 Okay! Kate.

331
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,480
This is not the time to be yelling fire.

332
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,680
 Let's stop, gather our thoughts,

333
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,520
 and discuss this in private.

334
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,760
 We don't need any private meeting, Doctor.

335
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,240
 We all want the fucking information!

336
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,760
 There's more.

337
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,480
 What are those?

338
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,200
 I think they are fillings from someone's teeth.

339
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,720
I found them by a puddle of blood in the shower.

340
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,080
 Puddle of blood?

341
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,600
 It can clone cells,
 but not inorganic material.

342
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,760
It couldn't copy these, so
it spit them out.

343
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 - We're wasting too much time already. Lars?
 - Listen!

344
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,080
 When I went back to check it,
 someone had cleaned up the blood.

345
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,320
 Someone had wiped it away.

346
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,600
 Alright, so whatever it is...

347
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,960
 It is still here.

348
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,000
 I've heard enough.

349
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,200
 Lars, Colin, get the gear.
 Ten minutes.

350
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,880
 Please, Edvard.

351
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,880
 You can't leave.

352
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,520
 You can't leave!
 You don't know what we're dealing with.

353
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,480
 Well done.

354
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,240
 Kate?

355
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,280
 I don't know if I should be speaking about this.

356
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,440
 I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

357
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,160
 Speaking about what?

358
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
 You were saying...

359
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,720
 about someone cleaning up the
 blood from the shower.

360
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,480
 - And that someone here may not be themselves.
 - Juliette, please...

361
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,040
 What did you see?

362
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,680
 After the crash, I think...I saw
 Colin coming from the showers.

363
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,200
 He was holding something.

364
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,920
 It could've been a towel, a rag,
 something to clean up.

365
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,240
 Kate, I can't say for sure, but
 it's just that I s--

366
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,080
 He's leaving with Edvard.

367
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,000
 We can't let them go.

368
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,360
 We can't let any of them go.

369
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,160
 I know where they keep
 the keys for the vehicles.

370
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,800
- Where are they?
- In that drawer.

371
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,280
 - This one?
 - Yes.

372
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,960
 - How many am I looking for?
 - Five.

373
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,040
 Three and four.

374
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,360
 You said there were five?

375
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,960
 Run!

376
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,200
 Kate, what happened?

377
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,560
 Karl. It got Karl. It got...Karl.

378
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,880
 Kate.

379
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,280
 Burn it!

380
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
 Enough, that's enough.

381
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,680
 Burn in hell.

382
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,480
 What the fuck's happening to us?

383
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,640
 It attacks its prey,

384
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,080
 copies it perfectly...

385
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,680
 and then hides inside it.

386
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,040
 Waiting.

387
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,560
 Is it still among us?

388
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,360
 It could be any of us.

389
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,960
 We got to get out of here.

390
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,600
 Yeah, right now.

391
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,240
 And it could be getting a vehicle with it.

392
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,440
 You'll be alone.

393
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,480
 Vulnerable.

394
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,480
 That's exactly what it wants.

395
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,560
 Not to mention you'll be giving it
 a way out of here.

396
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,080
 A way to spread.

397
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,600
 It's like a virus.

398
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
 So what do we do with any virus?

399
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,320
 Quarantine.

400
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,120
We isolate it and then we kill it.

401
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,600
 Yeah.

402
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,600
 We have to rely on science.

403
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,120
 Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the
 cells of the creature

404
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,240
might create a reaction...of some kind.

405
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,720
So we take blood samples from everybody.

406
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,280
 Yeah, and we test each one of them.

407
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,200
 Yes, Adam and I can do that.

408
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,160
Okay.

409
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,280
 Lars and I'll disable the vehicles.

410
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,360
 We have to trust in this plan.

411
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,160
 It's our only chance of making it through this.

412
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,720
 - Is that it?
 - Yes.

413
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,480
 - No more vehicles?
 - Only these.

414
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,200
 Okay.

415
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,760
 What?

416
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,240
 Grenades.

417
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Is everything alright?

418
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,560
 Yes, yes, everything's fine.

419
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,920
 Good.

420
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,840
 - Lars, you're okay?
 - Yes.

421
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,800
 Kate, we should go.

422
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,120
 The storm is getting worse.

423
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,720
 Who is that?

424
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,320
 Hurry up. They're coming.

425
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,480
 The Americans.

426
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,560
 It is impossible for a human
 to survive in that crash.

427
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,720
 We should burn them.
 Right here, right now.

428
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,720
 - Let's finish them off!
 - Peder?

429
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,200
 It could be murder.

430
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,400
- It could be survival, Kate.
- Yes, but we don't have to kill them.

431
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,800
 Right? We can just lock them up...

432
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,120
 until the Sander's test is ready.

433
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,280
 Please.

434
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,280
 Please.

435
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,880
So this is a good idea?

436
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,520
 Locking us up?

437
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,600
 You need our help.

441
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,200
 Warn your scientists they can't handle
 with what we saw in that chopper.

442
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,640
 For all I know, you could be one of those things.

443
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,720
 It is pretty hard to believe you both
 walked away from that crash.

444
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,160
 - Yeah, I get that, I do, but...
 - We're preparing a test.

445
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,800
 And then we figure out who's who.

446
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,240
 It's all I can offer you right now.

447
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,880
 Damn!
 There's a fire here!

448
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,840
 Someone sabotaged it.
 There's nothing left. Nothing.

449
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,240
 Now there's no test.

450
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,280
 How could this happen?

451
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,400
 It was no accident.

452
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,840
 You.

453
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,840
 You were in there with him.

454
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,640
 You were the last one.

455
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,080
 - How are you accusing me?
 - Why not?

456
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,960
 - He's got something to hide.
 - What are you, an asshole?

457
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,280
 I was the one working on the test.
 I left for 2 minutes!

458
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,120
- You just don't want us to know the truth, do ya?
- Bullshit!

460
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,550
 This is a goddamn fucking nightmare!

461
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,320
 There might be another way.

462
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,840
 I think there might be another way
 to tell.

463
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,160
 Peder, give me your flashlight.

464
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,880
 Now tell Lars
 to open his mouth.

465
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,960
 Tell him to open his mouth.

466
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,320
 Open your mouth.

467
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,080
 Good.

468
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,560
 Lars has fillings.
 So he's human.

469
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,360
 It can't imitate
 inorganic material.

470
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,040
 See?

471
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,800
 Yes.

472
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,760
 Good.

473
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,280
 Good.

474
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,480
 Open.

475
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,480
 Come on!

476
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,120
 You're next!

477
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,920
 Open your mouth!

478
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,720
 Okay.

479
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,680
 Good.

480
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,560
 Right now, it's at least something.

481
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,360
 A way to eliminate
 some of us.

482
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,720
So I'm gonna get killed because
I floss?

483
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,920
 Nobody's getting killed.

484
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,320
 Kate?

485
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,200
Kate, come on.

486
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,960
 Kate.

487
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,400
 Just do it.

488
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,360
 Kate.

489
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,360
 Open.

490
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,960
Just go stand over there.

491
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,720
You know as well as I do, there are
too many variables.

492
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,240
 Open your mouth.

493
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,000
 Open your mouth!

494
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,920
 They are porcelain.

495
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,840
 Go stand with Adam.

496
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,520
 Anyone else with porcelain fillings?

497
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,400
 Or clean teeth?

498
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,040
It's bloody absurd.

499
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,840
 This is wrong.

500
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,720
 Jonas, you and Lars go out.

501
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,600
 Get Carter and Jameson,
 bring them in here, we'll check them too.

502
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,720
 But why don't we just leave them where they are?
 They can't do anything.

503
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,480
 We need to know.

504
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,600
- What?
- She wants us to find the Americans.

505
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,040
 Let's do it, then.

506
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,560
 Come on!

507
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,280
 She is smart.

508
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,000
 Yes.

509
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,240
 She is in control now.

510
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,640
 Shit.

511
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,360
 They escaped.

512
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,280
 Lars.

513
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,840
 Let's go back inside.

514
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,640
 No. We have to find them.

515
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,720
 Lars, be careful.
 They are not human!

516
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,120
 Lars!

517
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,960
 Lars!

518
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,200
 Lars!

519
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 Lars. Wait.

520
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,600
 Lars.

521
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,280
 Peder.

522
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,280
 Stay calm!

523
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,200
 The threat isn't here.

524
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,640
 It's out there.

525
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,560
The Americans are the real enemy.

526
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,840
 He's right, Peder.

527
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,000
Whatever they're saying right now,
it doesn't matter.

528
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,920
 You can't trust them.

529
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,160
 Watch them.

530
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,720
 Kate!

531
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,320
 Come on!

532
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,000
 Come on!

533
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,480
 Where are they?

534
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,280
 - Where are the rest?
 - They attacked them.

535
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,760
 - Who?
 - They got Lars!

536
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,400
 -Peder!
 -They took Lars!

537
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,000
 - What happened?
 - Peder, keep them back.

538
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,960
 - We have to help him.
 - Stay on them, Peder.

539
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,120
 - What happened?
 - Peder, they took Lars.

540
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,760
 - The enemy is out there.
 - We don't know if we can trust them!

541
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,360
 Peder, don't listen to them.

542
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,760
Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder!

543
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,320
 They're inside.

544
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,520
 Where is Lars?

545
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,400
Calm down!

546
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,840
I said calm down!

547
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,560
 - Where the fuck is Lars?
 - Drop it!

548
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,040
 - Somebody tell him.
 - Peder, don't listen to them.

549
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,880
 - Put it down!
 - They killed Lars!

550
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,720
Lars is killed.
Burn them! Burn them!

551
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,160
 Peder? Peder?

552
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,360
 Okay!

553
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,400
 I just want to check my friend, okay?

554
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,360
 It's okay.

555
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,080
 He was going to fire.

556
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,040
- It's going to catch fire! It will explode!
- Come on! Let's go!

557
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,600
 Edvard?

558
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,040
 Edvard?

559
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,520
 - Pick him up.
 - Okay.

560
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,920
You.

561
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,600
 Yeah, you. Help him!

562
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,640
Alright, show yourselves!

563
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,880
 Right fucking now!

564
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,360
 Everybody in the rec room.

565
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,320
 Pick him up, come on.

566
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,080
 Sit down.

567
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,720
 Not all of us are human.

568
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,000
 Just put him over there on the couch.

569
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,000
 Help! Help me!

570
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,400
 My God!
 Get it off him!

571
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,480
 What the fuck is this shit, man?

572
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,160
Carter, Carter!

573
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,920
 Carter, burn it, man!

574
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,520
There is something wrong with it!
Hold on!

575
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,200
Goddamn it, Carter, burn it!

576
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,640
Look out!

577
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,600
 Adam!

578
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,440
Shit!
Carter, take it!

579
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,440
 Carter!

580
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,280
 There is something wrong with the pressure.

581
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,880
 Put some air in the pipe.

582
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,680
 Watch out!

583
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,240
 Carter!

584
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,360
 We gotta get the air up.

585
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,640
 No.

586
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,520
 God!

587
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,920
 Carter!

588
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,960
 No! No!

589
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,320
 I'm with you, buddy.

590
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,080
 Carter.

591
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,520
 You're okay?

592
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,760
 Yeah.

593
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,840
 And you?

594
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,360
 Not yet, no.

595
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,280
We find it and then we kill it.

596
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,080
 I think that was Sander.

597
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,280
 Yeah.

598
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,680
 - Shit!
 - God! Watch out!

599
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,760
 Kate, do you see it?

600
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,600
 Where did it go?

601
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,800
 There!

602
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,320
 Get back!

603
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,800
 Don't. Don't touch it.

604
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,640
 Do you hear that?

605
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,240
 Yeah.

606
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,520
 Kate!

607
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,240
 - Sander.
 - Wait.

608
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,920
 So what?

609
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,160
 He'll freeze out there.

610
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,720
 And if he doesn't?

611
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,840
 If it makes it out of here...

612
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,480
 millions of people could die.

613
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,920
 - It's got nowhere to go.
 - Yes, it does.

614
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,040
 Alright.

615
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,040
 What?

616
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,280
 What happened to Lars?

617
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,000
 We didn't kill him.

618
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,480
 Come on.

619
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,120
 Run, run!

620
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,000
 Kate!

621
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,880
 Kate!

622
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,320
 Kate!

623
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,920
 Kate?

624
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,920
 Kate?

626
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,000
 Kate!

627
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,680
 So what we do now?

628
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,520
 There's a Russian station...

629
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,760
 about 50 miles from here.

630
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,920
 Should have enough gas.

631
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,960
 We're gonna make it back, okay?

632
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,880
 Okay.

633
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,720
 Let's go.

634
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,640
 I'm going to put this in the back.

635
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,120
 You know how I knew
 you were human...

636
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,400
 when you showed up back at base?

637
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,880
 No.

638
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,840
 Your earring.

639
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,280
 It was on your other ear.

640
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,520
 Kate?

641
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,920
 Kate, what are you doing?

642
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,440
 Let's talk about it.

643
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,440
 Talk to me.

644
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,840
 Kate?

645
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,360
 Kate!

646
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,520
 Kate!

647
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,120
No!

647
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:10,420
Oh my God.

647
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:22,645
Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?

647
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,445
Edvard?

647
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:04,545
Lars? Lars, it's Matias.
It's Matias!

647
01:33:04,715 --> 01:33:05,238
- Open your mouth.
- What?

647
01:33:06,245 --> 01:33:12,638
- Do what I say, now!
- It's Matias. Lars, it's me, Matias.

647
01:33:24,115 --> 01:33:28,102
That's no dog. Start the helicopter, now!

647
01:33:35,525 --> 01:33:38,102
Get it up, get it up! Now!
Come on!
