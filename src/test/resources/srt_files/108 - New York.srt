2
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:14,985
Were you going to say goodbye?

3
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,585
Yeah, I was going to call you tonight.
I swear.

4
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,760
Should I come visit you in New York?

5
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,459
Can you? That'd be great.

6
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:25,593
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

7
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,737
I gotta go. The guys are waiting.

8
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:38,506
Give Philly a kiss for me.

9
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,208
I can't believe you remembered
my dog's name.

10
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,583
It's my favorite terrier.

11
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,885
Let's hit it.

12
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:54,721
E, remind me to call Charlotte, also.
She'll kill me if I don't say goodbye.

13
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,733
- You should call Jamie, too.
- I know.

14
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,530
Make a list so you don't forget anyone.

15
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,605
- That's what I do.
- That's a good idea.

16
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,673
- E, make me a list?
- Turtle, make a list.

17
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,571
You know Vince can't read my handwriting.

18
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:07,008
- God! You're useless.
- Says you.

19
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:09,672
- Did you cancel the newspapers?
- You gotta tell me first.

20
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,408
You gotta learn to anticipate, Turtle.

21
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:12,642
There's a chain of command.

22
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,946
I'm a soldier. I wait for orders.

23
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,281
He's right.

24
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,116
What happened to your delegation skills?

25
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:21,454
You had 10 waiters underneath you.
Can't you handle one little Turtle?

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,085
Instead of being an asshole,
you should be pissed at him.

27
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,925
My life is too good
to be worried about shit like this.

28
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:30,229
So where are we at
with Scarlett Johansson?

29
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:32,767
- Where are we at?
- Yes. Where are we at?

30
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:34,361
I told you to hook me up with her.

31
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:35,803
I told you I don't know her.

32
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,774
Find her. If I had your job,
it'd been done already.

33
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:40,208
Scarlett Jo?

34
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:44,146
<i>I had a little
Lost In Translation moment myself...</i>

35
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,717
<i>when I was doing
that TNT movie Summerfall.</i>

36
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:48,782
Isolated from the rest of the world...

37
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:52,084
just me and this little beauty,
Lauren Jennings.

38
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,190
They shot that movie in Pasadena.

39
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,782
Yeah, but I didn't have a car.

40
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:57,589
Back in the real world...

41
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,663
Vince, are we gonna throw
a going-away party?

42
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:01,425
Vince, we got to do something crazy.

43
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,024
Wahlberg spent $500,000 on his bash...

44
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,727
<i>before he left for The Italian Job.</i>

45
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,600
Wahlberg made $10 million for that movie.

46
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:10,072
Vince is making $60,000
before taxes and commissions.

47
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:12,302
I don't understand
why you couldn't get me more.

48
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,775
I don't make your deals, Vince.

49
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:15,709
Can I run with this party, Vince?

50
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:18,009
- E?
- I'm not running with it.

51
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,712
Run, Turtle. Run.

52
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:25,781
Who you gonna invite to the party, E?
Emily or Kristen?

53
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:30,428
I say invite them both. Let them duke it out
in a steel-cage match, winner takes all.

54
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:34,057
My money's on Kristen.
She'll knock the crap out of Emily.

55
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,326
I don't know. I saw Emily at Tae-Bo.

56
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,868
She was looking pretty feisty.
What do you think, E?

57
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,494
I think you guys are assholes.

58
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,095
Come on, man, it'd be hot.

59
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,570
I like cute little Emily.

60
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:45,700
- Then again, Kristen looks...
- Shut up, Drama.

61
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,777
Jesus.

62
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:49,278
Vince, who would you rather bang,
Kristen or Emily?

63
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,348
Don't answer that, Vince.

64
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:51,437
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,346
I kinda like them both.

66
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:54,816
E, you should feel good.

67
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,581
Movie star Vince Chase
would bang both your broads.

68
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,350
I do. I feel really blessed.

69
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:03,022
Three months in New York.
What's wrong with that, right?

70
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,491
It's not all it's cracked up to be, though.

71
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:09,192
Running errands, sitting on the set,
getting coffee? I'm not into it.

72
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,827
I put this fucking movie together.
I get treated like a glorified gofer.

73
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:17,134
You know, when I went to the reunion,
people would come up to me and say:

74
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:21,134
"So what are you doing?"
And I'd say, "I'm Vince's guy."

75
00:04:21,246 --> 00:04:23,271
Are you here to talk about business?

76
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:25,516
No, I'm here to talk about us.

77
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:27,175
It's kinda the same thing, right?

78
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:30,049
No, not to me it isn't.
You know what your problem is?

79
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:33,247
No, but I have a feeling you do. So tell me.

80
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,291
You are addicted to Vince.

81
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:38,555
Great. More textbook psychobabble.
Come on, let's hear it.

82
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,494
When you're around him, you feel great.

83
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,793
But when you're not,
you go through withdrawal...

84
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:46,598
and you talk about quitting all the time.
Classic addiction symptoms.

85
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,569
So, what, this is all my fault?

86
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,740
No. I think you're both
fucked-up codependents.

87
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,640
What about us? What are we?

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,942
We're a couple.

89
00:04:58,249 --> 00:04:59,580
Maybe we're not.

90
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:05,822
No, really, I'm just completely disgusted.

91
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:10,091
You call me and say we're going
to go to the game on the 21st.

92
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,192
I'm waiting for your phone call.
I call your office.

93
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:15,823
I don't get a call back.
Then I turn on the TV...

94
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,993
and I see you sitting next to Vin Diesel.

95
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,628
- So what the hell is that?
- I told Emily to call you.

96
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,731
She didn't call you. She fucked up.
My Blackberry was broken.

97
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:26,276
Wait a second, I called her, okay?

98
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,902
She gave you that message,
and you never called me back.

99
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:32,710
I was gonna go to the game with you.
I told Emily that we were gonna be late.

100
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,614
Okay? I went to go talk to Vin.

101
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,119
He's got an 18-wheeler with equipment
and going crazy.

102
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:38,519
They're making power shakes.

103
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:40,250
He's got the fucking crazy glasses on.

104
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,586
I don't know what's happening.

105
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,321
- I told Emily to call you.
- What language are you talking?

106
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:45,828
You thought... Is this an excuse?

107
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,093
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- It's exactly what happened.

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,225
I still don't know. You're talking Chinese.

109
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:52,997
I'm not talking Chinese.

110
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,129
Larry, how you doing?
Good to see you, pal.

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,232
- Johnny Drama.
- Yeah. Remember me?

112
00:05:58,343 --> 00:05:59,970
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Hey, Ari.

113
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:01,045
Hey.

114
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:02,839
- This whole thing?
- You like that?

115
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,847
- You don't like it?
- It's okay.

116
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,850
- How's the show going? Good?
- Yeah.

117
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:10,014
Any good parts in there?

118
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:15,693
- Maybe.
- That's great.

119
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,351
So, we will speak,
and I will take you to a game.

120
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,158
- Okay. All right.
- All right?

121
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,734
- Bye, Lar.
- Larry, let's talk.

122
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,064
Don't ever fucking harass a real client again.

123
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:28,434
I know the guy.

124
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:30,938
Ari! Come on.

125
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:33,139
There he is. Johnny!

126
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:36,673
Sorry I'm late.

127
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:39,215
- How you doing, you good?
- Yeah.

128
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,911
Why don't you come back to the office?

129
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,917
Just tell me the deal's done.

130
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:47,321
Basically, they don't have enough money
to pay for your flight.

131
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:48,653
Or your room.

132
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:50,886
Per diem?

133
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,758
I know you're excited about this movie.
It's a good little part.

134
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,459
But here's the thing.

135
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,766
I got you an audition
for a guest-starring role in a pilot.

136
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:04,734
- A pilot that's all but on the air.
- Yeah, what's it called?

137
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:07,107
<i>CSI: Minneapolis.</i>

138
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:08,569
Don Johnson...

139
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,841
playing William Peterson,
playing David Caruso...

140
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,143
playing the Gary Sinise role.

141
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,547
Sounds great.

142
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:17,212
It's like $10,000,
plus first-class airfare and expenses.

143
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,880
- To Minneapolis.
- No, it shoots in Vancouver.

144
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:22,653
<i>Now, the dates conflict
with Queens Boulevard...</i>

145
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,352
and there's no flexibility.

146
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,090
Shit. When it rains, it pours.

147
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,591
Do you think I got a shot at this?

148
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,169
You're Johnny Drama.

149
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:33,765
You always got a shot.

150
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,037
<i>When I played that cokehead stoolie
on Miami Vice...</i>

151
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:41,202
I remember right after a take,
Don Johnson said, "Nice job, kid."

152
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:44,907
- Or was it the black guy?
- What's the pay?

153
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,708
<i>A lot more than Queens Boulevard.</i>

154
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:49,548
Plus first-class accommodations,
fat per diem.

155
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:50,915
That's a tough choice.

156
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:53,149
What are you saying? No, it's not.

157
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:57,592
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll put you up
in New York, and I'll double your per diem.

158
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,220
My baby brother's
not putting me up anywhere.

159
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:03,367
<i>Come on, Drama. New Jack City.</i>

160
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,162
Room service, escorts.

161
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,869
Everybody knows the best whores
in the country are in Vancouver.

162
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:12,670
- Vancouver ain't the country.
- You know what I'm saying, jackass.

163
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,711
There's no money to stay in a hotel, Turtle.

164
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:15,836
What?

165
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,142
I can't be bringing girls back
to my mom's house.

166
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,741
- The walls are paper thin.
- You ain't making them scream anyway.

167
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,082
What if I pay my own way?

168
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:26,847
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
You gonna sell a kidney?

169
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,018
The going-away party.
We can charge $10 a head to get in.

170
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:33,029
- You wanna promote the going-away party?
- Interesting.

171
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,066
Come on, Vince, I'll make us a boatload
of money, all right?

172
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,896
You get 10% of the door...

173
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,061
and a prime table surrounded
by all the hotties in L.A.

174
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:44,335
- All you got to do is just smile.
- He doesn't need 10% of the door.

175
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,774
Yes, he does,
after you got him the shitty deal.

176
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:50,240
I told you, I didn't make his fucking deal.

177
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,076
Vince, override this guy.

178
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:56,253
E, come on. It's a party.

179
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:59,653
It'll make Turtle feel good about himself
if he earns a little cash.

180
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,691
Yes. It'll boost my self-esteem.

181
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,488
What do you say?

182
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,023
Yeah, whatever.

183
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,619
Knock it out, Turtle.

184
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,665
What's the movement
on Scarlett Johansson?

185
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,961
You know what, Vince? I'm not your pimp.

186
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:15,835
If you want Scarlett Johansson's number,
get it yourself.

187
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,999
What did I say?

188
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:21,874
Yo, mofos, check this out.

189
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,202
Ready?

190
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,510
Tobey Maguire's house.

191
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,121
Bang, Spidey!

192
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:39,621
What's better, Taggert or Taggert?

193
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,053
What?

194
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,294
Taggert or Taggert?

195
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,662
- The first one.
- Damn. Really?

196
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,601
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

197
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:49,798
No problem.

198
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,344
<i>Viking Quest, right?</i>

199
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,976
Yeah, that's me.

200
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,308
I knew it.

201
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,516
Do you think I can get a signed picture
for my wall?

202
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,845
- Yes.
- For an extra 1,000 invites.

203
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,151
Why not? For Torvald, anything.

204
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:17,496
Five minutes, that's all.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to her.

205
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:19,593
Then you can cross her off the list.

206
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:21,899
It never takes just five minutes with this girl.

207
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:23,200
Five minutes.

208
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,837
- Girls, what's happening?
- How you ladies doing?

209
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,310
Big party Saturday night.

210
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,780
Vince Chase is going out of town.
You gotta be there.

211
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:32,907
You might have heard.

212
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,245
Be there or be square.

213
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:35,319
How you ladies doing?

214
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,409
Off the hook.

215
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:38,887
$10, but if you give me your phone number,
it's $5.

216
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,481
It's gonna be a great party.
You don't wanna miss that.

217
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,124
Honey, how are ya?

218
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,530
- They call this work?
- God bless America!

219
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:01,009
I've never been with anyone
that can fuck this long.

220
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,704
I've been training for this movie.

221
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:05,612
It's gonna be a great fucking movie.

222
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,421
I've been sitting here for 45 minutes
while he's getting laid.

223
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,821
Then you're an idiot. You should leave.

224
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:17,019
- It's not Scarlett Johansson?
- No.

225
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:19,328
God, he's so disrespectful.

226
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,489
No. He's sick. He's codependent.

227
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,863
Why do you think
he never got his driver's license?

228
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,562
Fuck it. I'm leaving. Bullshit.

229
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,838
Yeah. Okay. Hold on.

230
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,366
Shauna, it's Richard again.

231
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:31,533
God!

232
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:34,375
Richard, you are
a spindly, weaselly, prick queen...

233
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,504
I swear, if you print that about Gary Busey...

234
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:39,447
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to ruin your fucking life.

235
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,984
- I'll see you back at the office, Christy.
- All right.

236
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,951
And stay on top of that douche bag.

237
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:45,113
Yeah.

238
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:48,492
Asshole.

239
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:52,356
What the fuck is this now?

240
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,621
God!

241
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,057
Shauna, I agree.

242
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,295
Bon voyage?

243
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:02,236
It sounds like you're shipping
a gay French couple off to sea.

244
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,671
I didn't know anything about it.

245
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:04,741
This is so low rent.

246
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:07,367
You could've used bonded paper
and an approved photo.

247
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,412
<i>It looks like an audition for American Idol.</i>

248
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:13,041
<i>Eric, you should know better.
Use your fucking directional!</i>

249
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,015
<i>God damn it! These people driving here.</i>

250
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,952
<i>Vincent doesn't need his name
associated with nightclub promoting.</i>

251
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:20,216
God forbid, there's a Happy Land fire
in there...

252
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,882
like that Great White concert
in Rhode Island...

253
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:24,188
we're fucked. Get your house in order, Eric.

254
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,555
Jesus.

255
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,357
Who says it's my house?

256
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,944
I just had Shauna rip me a new asshole.

257
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,641
You don't have to take shit from her.
She's a publicist.

258
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:49,484
Jerk-off, you plaster cheap crappy fliers
with Vince's picture all over town.

259
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:50,920
That wasn't cheap.

260
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,618
I paid half price, and it was still expensive.

261
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,250
So you go behind my fucking back?

262
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,056
I didn't go behind your back.

263
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,461
You wanted nothing to do with this.
I did it myself.

264
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,264
You were too busy getting Vince
to do a movie...

265
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:03,630
that's gonna leave us homeless.

266
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,431
This movie's gonna make Vince's career.

267
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:07,768
It better. Or else we're all fucked.

268
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,104
Maybe we're fucked anyway.

269
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,778
Come on, Turtle. Let's go get this thing.

270
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:17,141
Knock them dead there, Drama.
Good luck, buddy.

271
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,581
Thanks. Come on.

272
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,717
Look at you.

273
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:24,153
How you doing, baby?
I'm gonna nail this thing.

274
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:26,054
- Go get them, Johnny.
- All right.

275
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,291
What the fuck, E, you left me!

276
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,196
Luckily, look who I bumped into
driving down Wilshire.

277
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,891
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Janeen.

278
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:40,234
Janeen was sweet enough to give me a ride
after you ditched me.

279
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,035
Why did you do that to Vince, Eric?

280
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,968
Yeah, E, why?

281
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,103
Why?

282
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:49,606
Long story.

283
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:54,585
- You want a drink, babe?
- You got any juice boxes?

284
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:59,152
You should've seen him coming down
Wilshire Blvd. All alone.

285
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,886
He looked so cute.

286
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:02,888
Are you okay?

287
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:06,627
I'm a little shaken up. But I think I'll be okay.

288
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,460
I can't believe you're leaving.

289
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:10,229
I'm just going for a couple months.

290
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,759
Yeah?

291
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:23,715
Vince, we gotta be at Ari's in 20 minutes.

292
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,406
Can you cover for me?

293
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:28,553
- We're gonna have a Jacuz.
- We gotta go over these deal points.

294
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,189
Could you get me some more money
on that, please?

295
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,055
- What if they want you to sign something?
- Come on, E.

296
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,323
Who forges my signature better than you?
Shall we?

297
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,526
Be nice to Vince.

298
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:43,067
Yeah. Thanks.

299
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,864
Taggert! We meet again.

300
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:51,644
For you, maybe.
I always relish our encounters.

301
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:56,240
No, Taggert.
I'm afraid it's your time that's up!

302
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,988
I just crushed that.

303
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,099
Pizza boy's here.

304
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:20,039
Really?

305
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,065
Really.

306
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,405
What's wrong with her?

307
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:34,543
Ask my permission before you bang
one of my assistants.

308
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:36,786
- How'd you know that?
- 'Cause I know all.

309
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,255
I could've told you this would end badly.

310
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:41,393
I gotta fire her so you don't feel weird.

311
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:42,483
Don't fire her.

312
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:45,029
I'll just sexually harass her until she quits.

313
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,962
- Where's Vinny?
- He sent me.

314
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:50,698
As long as I'm here, I want to talk.

315
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:52,071
Yeah?

316
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:53,502
About management.

317
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:59,170
There you go, baby. All right!

318
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,439
Come here. Let's hug it out, you little bitch!
I love it.

319
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:05,346
Step aside and let a professional take over.
That's fantastic.

320
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,476
Let's call Jimmy Miller. Let's get leverage.

321
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,316
360, Handprint. Any one of these.

322
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:11,117
Ari, I'm talking about me.

323
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:15,892
I thought you already were his manager.
Because, believe me...

324
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:19,355
I would not put up with this much shit
from anyone who wasn't.

325
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,956
I know I am. But I want to do it for real.

326
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:24,602
I wanna have the conversation. Lock it in.

327
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:26,103
You come to me for advice?

328
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,901
I'm gonna fucking cry.
All right, here's what you do.

329
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:31,442
You deal with talent
the same way you deal with women.

330
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,034
You have to make them believe...

331
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,773
they need you more than you need them.

332
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:35,848
He doesn't need me much.

333
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:37,677
Of course not. You're fucking worthless.

334
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,775
I could get a million morons to do the job.

335
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,717
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

336
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:44,119
The point is that he is an insecure fuck...

337
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:47,488
like all beautiful but handed-everything-
on-a-silver platter people.

338
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,652
He doesn't trust anyone
in this world but you.

339
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:52,230
You've been born into royalty, baby.
You know that.

340
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:55,095
Now you just gotta be thankful
and wear the crown.

341
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,500
As much as I appreciate it,
I didn't come here to ask for your advice.

342
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:00,572
I came to ask for your support.

343
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,340
- Do I have a choice? No, I don't.
- No.

344
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,408
You got 1,000%.

345
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:11,877
Here's a little indie script, $60,000.
Big payday.

346
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:13,110
- Thanks.
- This is great.

347
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,210
What's next?
You get a uniform and a mustache?

348
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,515
I don't have health insurance.

349
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,523
- But I bet you had it over at Quiznos.
- Sbarros.

350
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,093
- And I had a business card.
- There you go.

351
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:25,029
What am I supposed to say to Emily
when I walk out?

352
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,065
Pretend you're on the phone.
You're focused.

353
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,724
You can't talk to her.

354
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,460
Let's try to get that immediately if we can.

355
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:32,799
See you later.

356
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,804
Johnny Chase?

357
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:40,707
Represent, bro.

358
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,977
- Sheila, how are ya?
- Hi, good. How are you?

359
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:49,649
- Hello.
- There he is.

360
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,916
- Thanks for having me.
- How ya doing?

361
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:56,057
- You look familiar.
- You auditioned for me a couple years ago.

362
00:17:56,996 --> 00:17:58,327
How did that go?

363
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:00,996
- You know.
- You can't work them all.

364
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,563
All right. Any notes, any thoughts,
anything I should know?

365
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,661
No, just give it a shot. We'll go from there.

366
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,740
I could do this a million different ways.

367
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:12,174
Why don't you try it just one way?
Make a choice and give it a shot.

368
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:13,472
Stick to it.

369
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,452
Hooga! One time, baby. Come on.

370
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,987
Taggert, we meet again.

371
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:34,399
And that's one time too many.

372
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,964
For you, maybe.

373
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:39,737
I always relish these moments.

374
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,500
Your time is up, Conlon.

375
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,102
No, Taggert.

376
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,775
I'm afraid it's your time that's up.

377
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,115
Come on, man.

378
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,676
A little respect. Yo, back there.

379
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,913
I'm acting here. A little respect?

380
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:58,718
I mean, please.

381
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,080
Important e-mail.

382
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,888
I've been working on this thing all day.
This is important.

383
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,257
John, don't let it throw you.

384
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:06,422
- Just ignore him.
- Focus.

385
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:09,023
Fuck that, man! Tell this guy to focus.

386
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:11,035
Johnny, thank you for coming in.

387
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:12,627
- Appreciate it.
- Bye.

388
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:15,272
- Great job.
- Thank you.

389
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,866
You know what? Fuck you!

390
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:23,710
Shit.

391
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,947
I don't know. I thought he was great.

392
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:29,714
Fuck TV!
Let's go to New York and make a movie!

393
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:33,815
- There you go, baby.
- Can I stay with your mother?

394
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:35,819
I remember.

395
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,627
Of course you can bring her.

396
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,124
Yeah?

397
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:47,770
Hopefully I'll see you in the Hamptons.

398
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,531
Labor Day. I can't wait. Bye.

399
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:54,709
I think that's the last one.

400
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:58,173
- So, what are you doing for dinner tonight?
- What?

401
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,319
We should go to dinner before the party.

402
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,182
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

403
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,552
Some stuff? What do you mean?
Sounds weird.

404
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,323
It's nothing weird.

405
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,187
E, you're not coming out of the closet,
are you?

406
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,222
'Cause you know I like long legs.

407
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,891
I want to talk to you
about being your manager.

408
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:17,435
As opposed to what?

409
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:20,599
As opposed to nothing,
which is what I am now.

410
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,935
Kristen's been fucking with your head again.

411
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,911
- No, she has not.
- Come on, E.

412
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:32,141
Admit it. You guys have a very
dysfunctional relationship.

413
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,947
Every time you come from her,
you sound like her.

414
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,989
- Maybe she should be my manager.
- All right, fuck dinner.

415
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,114
Relax, E.

416
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:42,919
I wanted to go to dinner
and talk about this stuff there.

417
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:44,553
You're making me talk about it here.

418
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:46,723
And it's just not going right. Fuck dinner.

419
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:50,199
Nothing's been said. Nobody said anything.

420
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:51,860
Nothing's been talked about.

421
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:54,701
You want to take me to dinner?
You wanna talk business?

422
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,537
You want to woo me? Wine and dine me.

423
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,834
All right.

424
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,111
Let me pack up some things. We'll talk.

425
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:12,716
- Who's buying?
- I'm buying.

426
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,649
With my credit card that I pay the bill on.

427
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,455
I'm doing this real. This is no bullshit.

428
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:18,894
Great. Now I know what I'm gonna order.

429
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,000
Lanie!

430
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:25,194
- Did I hear you're going out of town?
- I'm leaving tonight.

431
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:27,238
I can't believe
you didn't say goodbye to me.

432
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:29,534
Why do you think I'm here?
I'm saying goodbye now.

433
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:30,939
Listen.

434
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,136
You remember that
really good bottle of wine...

435
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,337
that I got here with Ridley?

436
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:36,881
- Yeah, '82 Margaux.
- Yeah, that's the one.

437
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:39,016
We're gonna have two of those.

438
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:41,644
You must be important.

439
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,180
We'll see.

440
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:47,359
Before l...

441
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,258
Can we hold off a couple seconds
before we get into business?

442
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:51,963
My boys just showed.

443
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:57,768
- What up, player?
- Yo!

444
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:01,698
I'm hungry.

445
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:04,934
You want this real.
This is how I did it with Ari.

446
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:07,979
- What are you gonna do for us?
- Yeah?

447
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,604
I've been doing this job for a year.

448
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:13,412
- I don't need to put up with this bullshit.
- E, you're really wooing me.

449
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,886
- E never was a real people person.
- That's gonna have to change...

450
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:19,116
if you want to be involved
in talent management.

451
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:21,386
Now, I'm pissed. What's your answer?

452
00:22:23,329 --> 00:22:24,990
What's your sales pitch?

453
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:31,631
All right, Vince.

454
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:33,432
I picked your last movie.

455
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:36,298
I put you in this new movie. I know you.

456
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:39,069
I know your strengths.
I know your weaknesses.

457
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:42,776
- Yeah, you do have a few.
- Vince ain't got no weaknesses.

458
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:44,509
That's a double negative.

459
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,380
You just said he's got weaknesses.

460
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,976
I'm starting to see how this business works.

461
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,653
I feel like I'm starting
to learn how to work it.

462
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,985
How many times
have we heard that one, Vince?

463
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:56,083
Shut the fuck up, Turtle.

464
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:59,323
Vince, take your time.
Don't rush into anything.

465
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:02,527
You guys are right.
I gotta think about things.

466
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:05,368
- I like the way things are.
- I don't.

467
00:23:06,906 --> 00:23:09,067
E, you know I don't like change.

468
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,540
I'm not going to New York.

469
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:11,974
- Really?
- Really.

470
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,873
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

471
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:19,951
Fuck you, all right?
You asked me to move out here.

472
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:22,418
Don't forget that. Here you go, asshole.

473
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:25,589
You're still going
to the going-away party, right?

474
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:27,022
Shut up, Turtle.

475
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:36,559
I can't believe he's not coming.
How can he not come?

476
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,637
I knew this Kristen thing
was gonna backfire.

477
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:41,069
We should've made Emily work.
She was a career girl.

478
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,140
No.

479
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:46,233
He said Kristen had nothing to do with it.
It was his own stupid decision.

480
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:49,239
You made the stupid decision, bro.

481
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:52,248
- What?
- Yeah. You ain't that easy.

482
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:57,282
You think you're going to find someone
you like that could tolerate you 24l7?

483
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,583
I love you, bro. But I ain't doing it.

484
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,716
I could do it.

485
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:02,521
Yes. That's a good option.

486
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:14,934
Let's go party.

487
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,531
Fuck that! I'm not going in there.

488
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,473
- Come on. One beer.
- No. Come on.

489
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,944
Let's get blasted on the plane.
Just the three of us.

490
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:25,744
Fine by me. But I just gotta go in there first
and handle a little business.

491
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:32,915
- Is that Vincent Chase in there?
- No. Vince is inside.

492
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:34,889
He just called me. I gotta go see him now.

493
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:36,325
Come in, though.

494
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:40,859
Yo, let me use your phone.

495
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:54,768
Hello?

496
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:57,679
This is awkward.

497
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,149
I forgot my wallet.

498
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:02,477
Come on, Vince. Fuck you.

499
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,113
Seriously, it's somewhere
on the coffee table.

500
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:06,623
<i>Come on. What do you say?</i>

501
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:09,159
<i>I'd get it myself,
but I gotta go all the way there...</i>

502
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,195
and all the way back. It just seems stupid.

503
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:12,992
What do you say? Come on.

504
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:16,366
Okay. I'll be there.

505
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:17,557
Thanks.

506
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:21,205
You're an asshole.

507
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:26,843
Excuse me, guys. Sorry. Have a good night.

508
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,647
You two, go get some drinks in there.
It's crazy.

509
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:36,454
- Cha-ching!
- Yeah.

510
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:39,919
My mother would rather be dead
than have you stay with us.

511
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,685
Sweet.

512
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:37,306
Only a real asshole would spend $30,000
on a flight...

513
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,407
when the whole job's
only paying him $60,000.

514
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:40,849
It's worth it.

515
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,080
How else are we gonna bring
the Sherpa weed and the dog?

516
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:46,718
You're still an asshole.

517
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,454
- Here's your wallet.
- Thanks.

518
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:52,719
You're telling me
you're willing to fuck up our friendship...

519
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:56,294
'cause if this doesn't work out,
there's no turning back.

520
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:58,226
My best friend, I can't fire.

521
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:01,597
But my manager, he's replaceable.

522
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:04,028
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

523
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:10,473
Yeah, at 5% of me, I'd take that chance, too.

524
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:11,600
10%.

525
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,669
Plus health insurance.

526
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,569
Hello?

527
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,612
Who is that? Kristen? Let me talk to her.

528
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:19,149
I wanna settle this whole thing.

529
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:20,343
Hold on a second.

530
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:23,285
Thanks for calling me back,
I really appreciate it.

531
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:25,812
Hello?

532
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:29,018
Hi, Vince. It's Scarlett. Is this a bad time?

533
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:33,361
Scarlett! How are you?

534
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,061
Where are you?

535
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,098
I'm in New York, I just got in.

536
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:42,299
Really? I'm on my way
to New York right now.

537
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:45,208
You wanna grab a late dinner?

538
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:49,842
Let's make it an early breakfast.

539
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:52,109
I tell you what. I'll call you when I land.

540
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,912
Okay. Cool.

541
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,815
- Talk to you later.
- See you later.

542
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,381
- Nice.
- That's what I do.

543
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:03,058
Get on the plane.

544
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:04,655
What about my car?

545
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:07,561
Your car?
You want me to buy you a new car?

546
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,290
- No, I like my car.
- Get the fuck out of here.

547
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,369
Leave it.

548
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,667
I can't have my manager driving around
in a piece of shit like that.

549
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:18,938
You going somewhere?

550
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,136
