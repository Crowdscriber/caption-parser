1
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:04,853
(engine shuts off)

2
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:24,317
(muffled talking,
phone ringing)

3
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:37,529
Mr. Goodman?

4
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:42,294
Mr. Goodman was my father,
<i>alev hashalom.</i>

5
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:43,667
Please call me Sam.

6
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:49,180
I am sorry we have
to meet like this,

7
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:53,497
but confidentiality is the
heart and soul of my work.

8
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:58,578
Yes, uh, Mother Claudia
explained all that to me.

9
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,455
She's the only one
who knows I'm here.

10
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:04,479
I'd like to keep it that way.

11
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,988
The monsignor,
he thinks I've lost my mind,

12
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,795
but I haven't.

13
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,648
I, um... I trust my instincts.

14
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,614
Instincts are everything.

15
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,191
We ignore them at our peril.

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,267
Do I... pay you for this?

17
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,698
No, no, no, no.
I don't do this for money.

18
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,835
It's more of a calling.

19
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,683
Did you lose someone?

20
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,929
(sighs)

21
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:43,217
Everyone.

22
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:45,956
Is that for me?

23
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:47,632
Um...

24
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:49,709
Please sit.

25
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:50,947
Thank you.

26
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,365
He goes by the name Arden,

27
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,194
but I believe his real name
may be Grouper.

28
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,529
He may have been an SS doctor.

29
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:06,342
I mean, there's hardly
anything at all in there.

30
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:11,120
Um, just a home address,
and even that my be a lie.

31
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:12,210
(chuckles)

32
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:14,452
Probably is a lie, all of it.

33
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:15,762
What do you mean?

34
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:19,434
Have you heard
of Operation Paperclip?

35
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:25,724
After the war, the Joint
Intelligence Objectives Agency

36
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,296
actively recruited
the best Nazi scientists.

37
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,103
To get around Truman's
express orders

38
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,004
to exclude Nazi supporters,

39
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:38,380
they created false biographies
for these men.

40
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,966
Forgive the question,

41
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:45,818
but have you ever seen him
without a shirt on?

42
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:47,513
Me?

43
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,376
Oh, no, no, never.

44
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:53,220
SS have a tattoo
of their blood type here.

45
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,566
It's how they were
easily identified

46
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,467
by the Allied Forces
after the liberation.

47
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,075
Do I need to look for it?

48
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,388
(quietly): No, no, no.

49
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,689
In fact, don't do anything

50
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,974
until I've completed my work.

51
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,226
If he is who you suspect,

52
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:14,470
the last thing you want to do

53
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,125
is corner him.

54
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,613
Dr. Arden?

55
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,613
Stop. You leave him there.

56
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,189
Where's Sister Jude?

57
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,950
I have to speak
to her right away.

58
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:31,738
This man is a monster.

59
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,135
You should see what
he's got in his office.

60
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,460
Go, Sister.

61
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,344
I've waited
so many years for this.

62
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,605
I can wait a few more minutes.

63
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,623
FRANK: Drop the gun, or I'll blow
your goddamn head off.

64
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,695
SISTER JUDE: You put up a
bit of a fight, I hear.

65
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,348
You had to be sedated.

66
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:10,134
Where did you
get the gun, Anne?

67
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:11,364
I took it off

68
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,618
one of those detectives.

69
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:17,147
And it's a good thing I did.

70
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,771
He would've killed me.

71
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:19,951
Dr. Arden?

72
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,122
Grouper.

73
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,953
Hans Grouper, I told you.

74
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,104
He's a Nazi.

75
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,356
The thing in his lab,

76
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,390
- did you see it?
- What thing?

77
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:29,397
Tell me, what do you
think you saw?

78
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:32,141
Oh, God. He got rid of it
before anyone could see.

79
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,618
Dr. Arden was in no condition
to do any such thing.

80
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,111
When I arrived, he was being
rushed to the hospital.

81
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,717
Good. I hope he dies.

82
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,640
Now, come on, wake up.

83
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,529
He's not going to die.

84
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,348
He'll be back here and soon.

85
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:48,345
Maybe with the police,
maybe with the monsignor.

86
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:50,971
You could end up
on his operating table,

87
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,982
and I out on the street,
so before that happens,

88
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:55,852
I want you to tell me

89
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,102
what you think you saw.

90
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,876
Go and look.

91
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:05,347
SISTER JUDE: <i>We did look.</i>

92
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:14,810
<i>Now, Frank says you claimed</i>
<i>to have seen</i>

93
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,269
<i>some sort of creature</i>
<i>that was alive.</i>

94
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:20,080
(hinges creak)

95
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,832
<i>Maybe it escaped on its own.</i>

96
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:32,662
I doubt that, Sister.

97
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,452
It had no legs.

98
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:38,953
Sister Jude?

99
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,373
Can't you see I'm busy?

100
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,307
There's a man in your office.

101
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,868
What man?

102
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:45,818
Did he say what he wanted?

103
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:47,783
His wife.

104
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,327
MAN: <i>Her name is Charlotte.</i>

105
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,668
Charlotte Brown
is her married name.

106
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,461
She was born Charlotte Cohen.

107
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,106
That's our son, David.

108
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,542
He's a sweet little boy,

109
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:00,023
but he has the colic.

110
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,389
He cries five,
six times a night.

111
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:04,041
Nothing we can do
to comfort him.

112
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,916
It's enough to make anyone
a little cuckoo,

113
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:09,063
especially a woman
as high-strung as Charlotte.

114
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,331
(chuckles) Cuckoo.

115
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,442
High-strung.

116
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:16,351
How about world-class actress?

117
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,034
She was very convincing,

118
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,765
playing Anne Frank.

119
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:22,921
That's how it all started.

120
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,261
She read the diary,

121
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,587
and when she was
eight months pregnant,

122
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,105
we drove down to Boston to see
a production of <i>Anne Frank.</i>

123
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,325
Just sort of hit her

124
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,059
in some personal way
when she saw the play.

125
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,291
I would say
that people sometimes

126
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,996
remark that she resembled
Anne Frank.

127
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,616
They were the same age.

128
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:45,380
So, the tattoo

129
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,066
on her arm...

130
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,784
Charlotte?

131
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,209
What the hell are you doing?

132
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,592
And all of this happened
after a night in the theater?

133
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,224
No. It all started
after we had the baby.

134
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:03,943
She couldn't sleep
because of the crying.

135
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,106
She said it made her
feel powerless.

136
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:07,413
She began to turn a deaf ear,

137
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:08,761
and then she began
leaving the house

138
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,402
and going to a library
to read about Auschwitz.

139
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,925
It's almost like
she wanted to relive it.

140
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:18,451
That she somehow could
change the outcome.

141
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:20,095
She'd go on about these babies

142
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,302
who were gassed

143
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,745
and tortured, and I'd ask her,

144
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:28,335
"What about your own baby,
Charlotte?"

145
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:29,343
(baby crying)

146
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:30,908
He doesn't want me.
He wants you.

147
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:32,700
- He wants his mother.
- I keep telling you,

148
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:33,780
I can't help it!

149
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,083
He's not the one

150
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,691
who needs me.

151
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:38,499
<i>She'd come home with bags</i>

152
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:41,810
<i>full of old newspapers,</i>
<i>art supplies.</i>

153
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:48,171
<i>She'd disappear into the den</i>

154
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:50,798
<i>to work on her project.</i>

155
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,777
THREDSON: Sounds to me
like a classic case

156
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,611
of postpartum psychosis.

157
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,127
How long have you
been standing there,

158
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,895
Dr. Butt-in-ski?

159
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,929
Long enough to make a
pretty good diagnosis.

160
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,103
The obsession, the manic
behavior, the disconnection

161
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:17,265
from her baby.

162
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,017
My wife isn't a psychotic.

163
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,027
She's a very emotional person.

164
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,061
She needs to come home.

165
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,255
I think that's dangerous.

166
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:27,041
Did you hear what he said?

167
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:29,933
The man wants his wife at home.

168
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,049
They made me change my clothes,
Sister Jude.

169
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,319
Why do I have to wear
this uncomfortable dress?

170
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,763
I don't care for it anymore.

171
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,533
It'll help make the
transition easier.

172
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:49,800
You're letting me go?

173
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,083
Charlotte?

174
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,255
My God, Charlotte.

175
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:54,804
I've been looking for you.

176
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:56,940
My name is Anne.

177
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,181
Charlotte,

178
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:59,476
it's time to come home.

179
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:02,938
Stay away from me.

180
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:05,172
My name is Anne Frank.

181
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,646
I'm a death camp survivor.

182
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,355
You're my wife and the
mother of our baby.

183
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:13,402
Now, please stop this
and come home with me.

184
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:14,872
No! You don't know me.

185
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,507
Sister Jude,
you have to help me.

186
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,958
I'm helping you, Charlotte.

187
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,727
I'm trying to reunite you

188
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,170
with your family.

189
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,732
What about Grouper?
His crimes against humanity?

190
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,088
No, no, go home.

191
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,404
Go home.

192
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,339
It can't be.

193
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,431
David needs you.

194
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,918
My baby?

195
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,052
I need you.

196
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,970
Everything's going
to be all right.

197
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,062
Okay? You'll see.

198
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:10,208
(door closes)

199
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:11,548
You're making a mistake.

200
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,635
Forget about it, Doctor.

201
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,423
It's none of
our concern anymore.

202
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:16,789
Kit Walker is my concern.

203
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,312
What's this barbaric rumor
I hear about sterilization?

204
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,579
- It's not a rumor.
- You're not a doctor.

205
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:23,298
You have no right
to authorize medical procedures

206
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:24,962
without their consent.

207
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:34,750
Are you afraid?

208
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:40,813
No.

209
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,327
I don't believe you.

210
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:51,288
Alma and I always wanted kids.

211
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:54,892
We always talked
about having two or three.

212
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,665
Always tomorrow.

213
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,607
And now there will be
no tomorrow.

214
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:06,016
For either of us.

215
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,288
I'm so sorry.

216
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,248
I got us into this mess.

217
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,453
No. I don't regret what we did.

218
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,927
There's no one to blame
except Sister Jude.

219
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,047
I think she's the devil.

220
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,614
(distant screaming,
footsteps approaching)

221
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,279
(keys jangling)

222
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,211
(lock clicking)

223
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,977
Now?

224
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:44,737
Yes.

225
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:47,039
If you hurry, you might
be able to have supper.

226
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,491
Supper?

227
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:51,248
I thought you were taking me
for the operation.

228
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:52,653
No, Kit.

229
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:54,627
Sister Jude changed her mind.

230
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,023
She said you showed signs

231
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:57,963
of true redemption.

232
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,699
You're being released
from solitary.

233
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,322
Yay.

234
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,218
What about Grace?

235
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:06,186
Oh, I haven't forgotten
about her.

236
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:18,757
GRACE: I can't believe
you'll hear me say this,

237
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,130
but I actually miss
the food from the kitchen.

238
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,935
Oh, you won't be eating tonight.

239
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:23,982
No food for

240
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:25,918
12 hours before the procedure.

241
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,630
You said Sister Jude
changed her mind.

242
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,311
For Kit. Rest up, dear.

243
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:32,028
You're going under the knife
in the morning.

244
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:32,998
You'll need your strength.

245
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,433
No. No, you can't do that!

246
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:37,796
Let me out!

247
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:40,021
Come back! Let me out!

248
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,635
Let me out!

249
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,980
Let me out! Someone!

250
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,087
(screams)

251
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:06,684
(rumbling)

252
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,341
We're leaving
right after dinner.

253
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:13,543
Meet me by the
front staircase at 6:00.

254
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:15,778
Is this real?

255
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,192
Don't be late.

256
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:45,039
Kit.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

257
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,281
Doc, you got to help Grace.

258
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,674
Jude's going to sterilize her.

259
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:50,872
- It's not right.
- Grace isn't my patient, Kit.

260
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:52,841
You are.

261
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,245
So, why don't we
just concentrate on you...

262
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,604
...and then I'll see
what I can do for Grace.

263
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,869
Deal?

264
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:06,020
Have you given thought
to what we discussed last time?

265
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:08,354
You want me to say I killed Alma
and those other ladies.

266
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,861
Only if you believe it's true.

267
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,492
You need to give yourself

268
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,449
permission to remember.

269
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,740
I think one way to do that
is to hear it in your own words.

270
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,748
I want you to describe
what you think happened.

271
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,506
Then I'll play it back for you

272
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:24,895
so you can hear it
in your own voice,

273
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:26,852
- with your own ears.
- And if I do that,

274
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,077
you're going to tell the courts

275
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,449
that I should...
that I should stay here,

276
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,224
and I-I won't go to the chair?

277
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:34,583
Yes. That is the bargain.

278
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,923
But I need to feel
you're sincere.

279
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,368
My name is Kit Walker.

280
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,457
And I murdered my wife.

281
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,073
Don't fight it.

282
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,224
It'll only make it worse.

283
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:09,512
Who is it?

284
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,331
What are you? My name is Alma.

285
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:21,932
(screaming)

286
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,168
SISTER JUDE: Can you take down
a message for Mr. Goodman?

287
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,841
Goodman. Tell him...

288
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:42,836
it was all a mistake and that
he should just go back home.

289
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,812
I gave him
the wrong information.

290
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:48,678
No, the wrong information.

291
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,898
Thanks.

292
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,865
What information was that?

293
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,119
It's not important.

294
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,362
It sounded to me
as if there was some

295
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,935
juicy little tidbit
stuck in your craw.

296
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:09,965
Oh, come on, Sister,
spit it up.

297
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:12,444
- You'll feel better.
- How's your leg?

298
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:13,970
Please.

299
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,517
Let's dispense
with the small talk, shall we?

300
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:19,244
You and I both know that,
during my absence,

301
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:22,021
you finally got a chance
to stick your nose in my lab.

302
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,797
A patient made a complaint.

303
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:26,725
I was obliged to follow up.

304
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:27,865
And?

305
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,892
It wasn't all that interesting.

306
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,704
I see.

307
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:36,966
Do you mind?

308
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:42,778
You should probably know

309
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,291
that I plan
on pressing charges.

310
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,780
To what end?

311
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:49,345
She's a confused young woman.

312
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:50,724
No, not her.

313
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,700
You. On your watch,

314
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:54,850
that crazy bitch got
a hold of a loaded gun,

315
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:58,204
and you sent her home without
so much as a slap on the wrist.

316
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,522
Your ineptitude is staggering.

317
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:06,890
Dr. Arden...
I know, in the past,

318
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,175
you and I have had
our differences,

319
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,585
and you're certainly
entitled to a...

320
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:13,417
a sense of safety here.

321
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,272
I hope, perhaps you and
I can start afresh.

322
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,448
Is that your idea
of an apology?

323
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:19,699
(chuckles)

324
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:22,013
Is that what you're
looking for... an apology?

325
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:23,396
No.

326
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:25,430
I'd prefer you grovel.

327
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,252
I think I'm entitled to it.

328
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,977
Perhaps if you prostrated
yourself on the floor

329
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,059
and begged my forgiveness.

330
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,131
No?

331
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,350
Barring that,
I have no other option

332
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:42,403
but to call the monsignor
and demand your dismissal.

333
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:50,045
You're through here, Sister.

334
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,012
And you know it.

335
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:01,600
(door closes)

336
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,857
SISTER EUNICE: Let me do that.

337
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,705
Sister!

338
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,612
- I didn't hear you.
- Now, now.

339
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:22,174
It's all right, Arthur.

340
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,127
You've nothing
to be ashamed of.

341
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,852
All the nuns here have had
some training as nurses. Sit.

342
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,220
I've been meaning
to speak to you.

343
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,341
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior

344
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:44,387
the night of the storm.

345
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:47,826
It was... untoward.

346
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,977
What do you say we chalk it up

347
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:54,344
to the barometric pressure
and never speak of it again?

348
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:57,772
I know what you did, Sister.

349
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,795
Thank you for protecting me.

350
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:04,330
Protecting us.

351
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,502
<i>Even though I don't</i>
<i>fully understand your work,</i>

352
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:09,204
<i>I feel I've been</i>
<i>an important part of it.</i>

353
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:12,130
ARDEN:
<i>And so you have, my cherub.</i>

354
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:15,627
(wheezing)

355
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,155
You'll be free
to continue that work

356
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:20,452
once Sister Jude
has been turned out.

357
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,519
The monsignor
will put you in charge,

358
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,874
and you'll need
a strong right hand.

359
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:27,882
Someone you can trust.

360
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,195
I trust you...

361
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:32,718
completely.

362
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:35,246
And I'm very impressed

363
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,388
that you managed to get her out

364
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,375
and into the woods
all on your own.

365
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,247
You'd be surprised.

366
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:42,148
She weighed very little.

367
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:45,026
(school bell ringing)

368
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:48,246
(children squealing playfully)

369
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:51,142
(blows whistle)

370
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,902
Mikey Curtis,
no monkey business!

371
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:20,560
(screams)

372
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,677
Peggy Cartwright,
what on earth is the matter?

373
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:24,679
There's a monster!

374
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:35,628
(all scream)

375
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:08,884
(shrieking)

376
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:17,095
(shrieking continues)

377
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:45,389
(Charlotte whimpering)

378
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,594
ARDEN: Well, well, well.

379
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:51,251
Look what the cat dragged in.

380
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,571
That didn't take very
long now, did it?

381
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,640
Stay away from me.

382
00:23:57,108 --> 00:24:00,083
Not so tough without your gun.

383
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,888
(door slams)

384
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:04,419
You didn't give it
much of a chance.

385
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,621
I have to go to work.
I'm afraid to leave her alone.

386
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,371
It's a period of adjustment.

387
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,325
I mean, you said yourself,
a baby needs its mother.

388
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:15,322
A normal mother, yes!
Charlotte's not normal!

389
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:18,940
She's worse.

390
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,682
<i>At least before,</i>
<i>she could tune out the crying.</i>

391
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,213
(baby crying) Charlotte?

392
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,398
Do you want to hold your baby?

393
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,998
(crying continues)

394
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:32,708
Yes, darling,
why don't I do that?!

395
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:41,516
Hey, stop it!

396
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:46,826
Are you insane?!

397
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,902
I thought if I brought her home,
she spent time with us,

398
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:54,058
she'd remember who she was,
see how much we need her.

399
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,695
Please, Sister.

400
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:00,456
You have to take her.
I can't handle her.

401
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,277
Isn't there some family
that could stay with her?

402
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,352
She needs professional help,
the care of a good doctor.

403
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:10,705
Like the doctor that came
in here and diagnosed her.

404
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,657
He seemed to understand
what she needed.

405
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,186
Dr. Thredson?

406
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,801
You're welcome to consult with
him if that's what you want.

407
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:21,887
Frank?

408
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:27,186
Find Dr. Thredson,
send him here.

409
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:43,632
Are you ready?

410
00:25:43,748 --> 00:25:45,263
What's the plan?
How do we do this?

411
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,159
We'll walk out the door,

412
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:48,736
we'll walk straight to my car.

413
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:49,914
Do you understand?

414
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:52,133
What do you mean?
How do we get past the guard?

415
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:55,017
Like I said, walk.

416
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:06,708
Night, Jimmy.

417
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,387
Dr. Thredson!

418
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,007
Excuse me. What were you...?

419
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:27,247
Dr. Arden?

420
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:28,736
That's right.

421
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:32,295
Oh, my God. You're the...

422
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:33,967
you're the man my wife shot.

423
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,594
Thank you for not
pressing charges.

424
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,510
She doesn't know
what she was doing.

425
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:40,971
She's out of her mind.

426
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:44,223
Yes, I'm aware
of that, Mr. Brown.

427
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:45,777
But you needn't worry.

428
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,709
I see no reason
for punitive action.

429
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:51,572
Not when there's a far more
humane remedy at hand.

430
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,930
As a matter of fact,
we could do it tonight.

431
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:57,852
Then she'll be home
by tomorrow, a new woman.

432
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,263
Dr. Thredson!

433
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,913
Dr. Thredson, Sister
Jude is asking for you.

434
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,584
Anne Frank, or whoever she is,

435
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,930
her husband brought her back.

436
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,212
(trunk slams)

437
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:24,227
I don't work here
anymore, Frank.

438
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:28,408
As a matter of fact,
I never did.

439
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:32,920
You can tell her I said that.

440
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:43,325
(engine starts)

441
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:49,088
(sniffling, whimpering)

442
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:55,627
Are you sure that this is safe?

443
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,256
ARDEN: Not only safe,
but highly effective.

444
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:02,015
In my hands,
the transorbital lobotomy

445
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:03,904
has become as routine as...

446
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:06,972
filling a cavity.

447
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,739
Holy apostle, Saint Jude,
faithful servant

448
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:13,909
and friend of Jesus,
the patron of hopeless cases

449
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,611
and things almost despaired of,

450
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:18,288
pray for me,
who am so miserable.

451
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:21,656
Make use, I implore thee,
of the particular privilege

452
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:25,657
that is accorded to thee,
to bring visible and speedy help

453
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,112
where help was almost
despaired of.

454
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:29,379
(knocking)

455
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,768
Um, bad news.
We searched everywhere.

456
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,805
Lana Winters
is nowhere to be found.

457
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:40,628
I'm certain she's off grounds,
Sister.

458
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,770
(sighs)

459
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:49,152
You know, when I was a child,

460
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:53,048
I'd come home after school
to an empty house.

461
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,273
My father had flown the coop,

462
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:58,139
and my mother worked
as a maid in a hotel.

463
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,008
It was lonely,

464
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:07,594
so I brought in
a baby squirrel I'd found,

465
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:10,027
and kept him in a shoebox.

466
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:14,007
And then, one day,
when I came home,

467
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,881
he looked sickly.

468
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,793
He was dead already,
but I didn't know that.

469
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,909
I'd forgotten to...

470
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:31,778
feed him for a couple days.

471
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,813
So I took him out of the box
and I laid him on the table

472
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,634
and I prayed my heart out

473
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,627
for several hours.

474
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:48,910
And when my mother came home
and found us,

475
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:50,142
she screamed bloody murder.

476
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,735
She picked him up
and threw him in the garbage.

477
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:59,253
She worked hard, my mother.

478
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:03,520
She was exhausted,
and she couldn't have known

479
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:06,101
how cruel that was.

480
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,555
But I cried and cried, saying,

481
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:15,519
"God didn't answer my prayers!"

482
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,773
(chuckles ruefully)

483
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,888
I remember...

484
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:29,531
my mother was pouring herself
a whiskey;

485
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,587
The Martin family cure
for everything.

486
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,923
She looked at me and laughed.

487
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,388
"God always answers
our prayers, Judy."

488
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:46,601
It's just rarely...

489
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:51,904
"the answer we're looking for."

490
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,706
It's over for me, Frank.

491
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:03,713
My goose is cooked.

492
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,165
I certainly hope
you're not blaming yourself.

493
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,814
Men are never gonna accept
a woman taking charge,

494
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,794
especially not a woman
as strong as you are.

495
00:31:11,992 --> 00:31:14,669
In my opinion,
you never really had a chance.

496
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:21,777
(gasps)

497
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:24,509

(Thredson exhales)

00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:48,886
Make yourself at home.

503
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:54,170
- Dr. Thredson?
- Oliver.

504
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:57,164
I really appreciate
everything you've done, but...

505
00:32:57,491 --> 00:32:59,563
I think I want
to go to my house.

506
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,612
Lana, once they discover
you missing,

507
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,807
the first place
they'll look is there.

508
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:07,637
You're much safer here...
at least for the night.

509
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,850
First thing in the morning,
we go to the police.

510
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,059
I already have an appointment
set up with Detective Spears.

511
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,574
I trust him implicitly.

512
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:14,726
We present the evidence,

513
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,549
together we shut down
Briarcliff.

514
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,245
(quiet laugh)

515
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,748
Relax. That place
is behind you.

516
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:24,717
Please, come in. Have a seat.

517
00:33:24,824 --> 00:33:27,249
You've had an incredibly
stressful day.

518
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,005
I'm going to prescribe a little
something to take the edge off.

519
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:32,049
I-I don't want any medicine.

520
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,678
A big, delicious glass of wine.

521
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:37,419
Well, that doesn't sound
half bad.

522
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:38,434
White or red?

523
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:39,626
Red.

524
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,660
(cork pops)

525
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:02,523
(wine pours)

526
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:14,036
(line ringing)

527
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:17,390
No calls.

528
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:19,540
I was trying to get a hold

529
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,916
of my friend Lois...
she might have heard

530
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,912
something about Wendy.

531
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,286
Lana, you have to realize

532
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,331
that I am at risk as well here.

533
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,812
I broke you out
of a mental institution.

534
00:34:27,923 --> 00:34:30,202
I can't afford to let
anyone know where you are.

535
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:32,186
Not until we go
public tomorrow.

536
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,207
You're gonna write about this.

537
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:45,412
You're gonna win
a Pulitzer Prize.

538
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,938
I just know it, Lana.

539
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,841
You are the person
to tell my story.

540
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,476
<i>Your</i> story?

541
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:03,652
Here's to taking down
Briarcliff.

542
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:06,521
Hear, hear.

543
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:29,667
Mint?

544
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:41,055
Boy... (quiet laugh)

545
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:45,964
That wine, um,
went straight to my head.

546
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:49,564
Would you mind
if I used your restroom?

547
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,156
Sure.

548
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:52,652
It's right down the hall.

549
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,512
Thank you.

550
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:04,289
(deep exhale)

551
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,902
(door opens)

552
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,473
I think I made a wrong turn.

553
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,357
I see you found my little...

554
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:37,672
hobby.

555
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,457
(breathing heavy)

556
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,770
You make furniture?

557
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:47,896
Lamps mainly.

558
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:50,472
I make the shades myself.

559
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,047
Really?

560
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:55,550
What kind of material
do you use?

561
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:57,923
(inhales) Skin.

562
00:36:58,188 --> 00:36:59,697
(screams)

563
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:12,946
Grace?

564
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:14,253
When'd you get...

565
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:15,958
Oh, God.

566
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:18,702
Hey, we need a doctor!

567
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,917
Those bastards... I can't believe
they actually did it.

568
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,735
Dr. Thredson, he promised me
this wasn't going to happen.

569
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:26,559
MAN: Kit Walker, you're under arrest
for the murder of Donna Burton,

570
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,380
Alison Riedel and Alma Walker.

571
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:31,185
- Wait.
- Where's Thredson?

572
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,006
You guys need
to talk to Dr. Thredson.

573
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:34,593
- No, we don't.
- It's a mistake.

574
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:37,161
We got his evaluation
and your taped confession.

575
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:39,582
- Come on, Kit. Let's go.
- No, he didn't do it.

576
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:40,726
She's alive.

577
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,111
- What?
- Everything you said is true.

578
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,424
For Christ sakes,
let me talk to her!

579
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:46,665
I saw her!

580
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:48,884
Alma's alive.

581
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:49,793
(yells)

582
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:51,568
I saw her!

583
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,359
(groaning)

584
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:11,703
Hello?

585
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:14,883
Hello?!

586
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,633
Wendy.

587
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,435
Oh, my God.

588
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,043
Wendy...

589
00:38:31,382 --> 00:38:32,263
Wendy.

590
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,191
(crying): Wendy!

591
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:38,649
(screams)

592
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:43,490
(yells)

593
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:45,927
THREDSON: She's been
on ice for a while.

594
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,421
I was hoping she'd be
a little more pliable

595
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,025
by the time you came to.

596
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,590
What's happening?

597
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,755
What did you do to her?!

598
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,778
Kept her fresh.

599
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:05,282
(exhales)
Normally, by now, I would've...

600
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:08,611
removed the skin.

601
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:17,691
And head.

602
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:20,519
No, we need to keep her around

603
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:23,048
a little longer
for our purposes.

604
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,932
We're going to continue
our therapy now, Lana.

605
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:36,026
You can begin...

606
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,543
by kissing her cold lips.

607
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,190
Don't worry.

608
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:45,312
She won't bite.

609
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:52,625
I took her teeth.

610
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:54,634
