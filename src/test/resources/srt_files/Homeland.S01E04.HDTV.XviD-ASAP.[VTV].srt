Abu Nazir.

Ever since that Lawrence
O'Donnell interview,

81
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,160
it's been like this
wherever he goes.

82
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:19,098
He's been blogged and tweeted
about, offered book deals,

83
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:20,900
been solicited
by every national talk show.

84
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,469
The vice president tells me
you had a hand in convincing

85
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:28,807
Sergeant Brody to go
public with his story.

86
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,275
The vice president didn't send
his chief political operative

87
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,778
here to thank me
for delivering Brody.

88
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:35,913
You're right.

89
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,948
I came to find out how closely

90
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:40,517
the public image
matches the man.

91
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:43,154
Now, for someone who's been
through what he's been through,

92
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:46,524
Sergeant Brody seems remarkably
composed.

93
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,094
Are you asking me
if he's emotionally stable?

94
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,096
Is he?

95
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,766
I'm not a psychiatrist.

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,968
But you ordered his psych
evaluation in Germany,

97
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:58,438
which I'm sure you reviewed.

98
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:01,508
So, if we looked under the hood,
what would we find?

99
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,311
Well, we weren't exactly vetting
him for national office.

100
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:07,613
That is why you're
here, isn't it?

101
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:11,617
In the most preliminary sense.

102
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,953
Then again, if his psychological
profile checks out,

103
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:17,322
and his politics are correct,
why not?

104
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,523
I sure know a lot of folks

105
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,526
who would open their checkbooks
to him right now.

106
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:28,167
Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but Saul Berenson is outside.

107
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,573
Tell him I'll be right out.

108
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,845
I'm sorry, Ms. Gaines,
but I need to take this.

109
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,983
My colleague has never learned
how to take no for an answer.

110
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,419
The vice president remembers
well your conversation

111
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:44,753
regarding directorship.

112
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,889
Any information
you could give us

113
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:50,426
on Sergeant Brody would
be much appreciated.

114
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,528
How much longer is he gonna be?
He'll be right with you.

115
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:55,197
Did you tell him I have an
operational protocol for him

116
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:57,099
to sign off on?
Sir, right now, he's in a meeting with...

117
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:59,769
Lizzie.

118
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,037
Saul.

119
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,341
We'll see ourselves out.

120
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:08,312
Nice to meet you.
Major.

121
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,117
So, tell me what's so important
that it couldn't wait.

122
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,287
Abu Nazir, David, remember him?

123
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:19,022
Two horns, long tail,
a strong scent of sulfur?

124
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:22,526
I think we found out how
he's financing his attack.

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,896
This is a photograph
of the prince's chief aide,

126
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,364
Latif Bin Walid,

127
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,800
taken nine hours after Lynn Reed
was killed.

128
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,301
And the necklace she was wearing

129
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,036
that the police reported
as stolen...

130
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,705
we believe it was
in this package.

131
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,741
You're saying that was the money
transfer we've been looking for?

132
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:39,243
It's a working theory.
Hard to believe Latif

133
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:42,613
would park a half a million
dollars in some Laundromat.

134
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:45,716
Not when that Laundromat's
doubling as a hawala broker.

135
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,217
Hundreds of millions move

136
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,319
through these informal networks
every day.

137
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,954
And because they're based on
an honor code,

138
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:53,089
there are no records,
which makes

139
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,425
financial transactions
nearly impossible to track.

140
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,961
Yeah, but hawala systems are
typically used to transfer funds

141
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:00,897
across borders, internationally,
not as dead drops.

142
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:04,835
What you're suggesting is pretty
unorthodox, isn't it?

143
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,637
Abu Nazir is always unorthodox.
That's why he's still out there.

144
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:09,840
Our friends at the Bureau
have ongoing surveillance

145
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:12,476
of the five known hawala
operations in the metro area.

146
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,446
That's where we got this photo
of Latif at the Laundromat.

147
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,916
Since then, 51 customers have
come and gone.

148
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:23,586
One of them may have the
necklace or its cash equivalent.

149
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,589
One of them may have the money
that Abu Nazir is using

150
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:28,158
to fund an attack
on American soil.

151
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,126
Why not just ask the guy

152
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,462
who runs the place which one
came for the necklace?

153
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,597
Same reason we're not
extraditing Latif.

154
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,999
Arrests at this time would be
of negative value.

155
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,801
We don't want to spook Abu Nazir

156
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,104
before we know how many others
he's activated.

157
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:43,306
Lynn Reed was killed
three weeks ago.

158
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,374
That means we're three weeks
behind the bad guys.

159
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,877
Which is why we need to
initiate an operation immediately.

160
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,912
Work up files
on all these people.

161
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,882
Do it.

162
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,318
All right, you heard him.

163
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:59,486
Let's start putting everybody
through facial recognition,

164
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:02,989
cross-referencing with INS, DMV,
every database we've got.

165
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:07,494
And once that happens, we'll split into
five two- person teams and run them down.

166
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:09,996
That means background checks,
limited surveillance,

167
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:12,799
selective face time with
family, friends, employers.

168
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:38,360
Hey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

169
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,162
The FISA warrant
expires tomorrow.

170
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,163
If you're asking me to
try and extend it, don't.

171
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,899
At least hear me out.

172
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,334
I had to drag a skeleton from
Judge Turner's closet

173
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,236
to get you those four
weeks in the first place.

174
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,571
I know what you did.
And you still haven't produced

175
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:54,441
a single lead connecting Sergeant Brody
to this or any plot against America.

176
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:55,909
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

177
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,177
It just means he may be
laying low for awhile.

178
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:01,380
Turned and trained,
but a sleeper.

179
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:04,383
You're arguing against
yourself, Carrie.

180
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:06,753
We can't watch him
indefinitely, and you know it.

181
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,755
But, Saul...
Listen to me.

182
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,557
Listen carefully.

183
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:13,694
This intelligence your asset
gave up her life to acquire--

184
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,897
do not squander it
by continuing to invade

185
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:18,266
the constitutionally-protected
privacy of the Brody family.

186
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,901
It's not an either/or
proposition.

187
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,703
The money we're tracking
is connected to Brody.

188
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,605
I just haven't found out how.

189
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,874
If you're right, the money will
eventually lead back to him.

190
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,543
But until then, you need to
take down that surveillance.

191
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:31,379
First chance you get, you will
remove the cameras and microphones

192
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,081
from Sergeant Brody's house,
and cover your tracks.

193
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:34,482
Are we clear?

194
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:47,427
I'm just saying,
they were a bunch of kids.

195
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:49,963
They're Marines, and they were
looking at you like a rock star.

196
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:52,132
Not because I was
a POW for eight years.

197
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,167
Because my face has been
plastered all over TV

198
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:56,069
for the last three weeks.

199
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:59,672
Whatever the reason, your visit
meant a lot to them, Brody.

200
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,974
Well, I'll take
your word for it.

201
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,510
Good. I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

202
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:07,813
Hey, you hungry?

203
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,982
I think we have steaks on the grill tonight.
Thanks, I'm good.

204
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,650
I'm just gonna grab
something on the way home.

205
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:14,185
You sure you don't want to come in?
Yeah.

206
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,920
Why not?

207
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:19,257
Mikey, all I'm saying is,
for the last two weeks,

208
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,626
you've hardly come by once.

209
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,795
I've been driving your
ass around every day.

210
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,530
I figured you'd be
sick of me by now.

211
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,532
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

212
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,102
Every time I invite you
into the house,

213
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:31,871
you make up
some lame-ass excuse.

214
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,276
If I didn't know
any better, I'd...

215
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:39,113
think you were avoiding us.

216
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:43,717
Hey, I just figured... I thought
I'd give you some space.

217
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:45,986
I mean, let you be alone
with your family

218
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,055
without me getting in the way.

219
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,959
Well, I appreciate that, Mike.

220
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,960
You looking out for the family.

221
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,029
And for Jessica.

222
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:59,499
Like you did while I was gone.

223
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,935
You'd have done the same for me.

224
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,808
You know what?

225
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:10,344
I'm not sure I would have.

226
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,253
Ah, I'll see you
tomorrow, Mike.

227
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:20,056
All right.

228
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,112
What's so interesting?

229
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,048
There, in the woods.

230
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:51,054
See the antlers?

231
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,589
It's
an eight-point buck.

232
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:54,224
It's beautiful.

233
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,527
Yeah, until he tramples
those tulips you planted.

234
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,131
How'd it go with the recruits?

235
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:01,566
Great.
Good.

236
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,768
Yeah.

237
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,036
When's dinner?

238
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,872
Whenever you want.

239
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:11,542
Okay, well, we need
some more propane.

240
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,081
Don't worry, honey,
probably just had a bad day.

241
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:19,916
Forget it, doesn't matter.

242
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,355
Come on, let's go wash up.

243
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,367
Are the kids asleep?

244
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:45,375

Dana-- she's waiting
in the car.

252
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,218
Did you see the flowers?

253
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:13,620
I did.
I told you.

254
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,789
I'll put out some soap flakes.

255
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:18,257
Soap flakes?
Yeah,

256
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,826
the deer think they're
smelling people.

If that doesn't work,

258

we can build a fence.

259
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,831
Build a fence--

260
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,600
there's an idea.

261
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,902
Maybe Mike could do it;
He's pretty handy.

262

Carrie?

263
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:39,245
Are you ready?

264
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,150
Come on, we don't have all day.

265
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:46,752
They're only gonna be in church
for, like, an hour and a half.

266
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:49,422
Rolling up this operation
is a fucking mistake.

267
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:54,093
You don't agree?

268
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,661
It's not like we have a choice.

269
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,329
Saul said that he would
have my head on a stick

270
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,630
and parade it out in front
of the inspector general.

Yeah, but what do you think?

Brody as long as I have.

Look, we've been on him

00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:43,064
Hey.

319
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,034
That was a beautiful service.

320
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,269
Yes, sir, it was.

321
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:50,671
Sergeant, this is
Elizabeth Gaines.

322
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:52,940
She is one of the vice
president's closest advisors.

323
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:55,175
It's an honor to meet you,
Sergeant Brody.

324
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:58,545
This happened yesterday?

325
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,847
When I dropped him off.

326
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,682
What did he say exactly?

327
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:03,784
He asked why I haven't been
coming around the house.

328
00:21:03,818 --> 00:21:06,453
I told him
I didn't want to intrude.

329
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:08,455
Think Dana said something?

330
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:10,290
No. Well, maybe we should

331
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:12,592
just go ahead and tell him ourselves.
What we should have done is

332
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:13,960
tell him right away
when he first got back.

333
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,795
Now it's turned
into this big lie.

334
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,896
Your story has inspired
a nation in need of inspiration.

335
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,131
Well,

336
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:20,633
I'm not so sure about that.

337
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:23,068
I asked Major Foster
to introduce us because

338
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:25,905
there's something I'd like
to discuss with you.

339
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:28,007
May I take you
to lunch next week?

340
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,111
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:32,379
Don't drive yourself crazy.

342
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,285
I just think that

343
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,055
maybe we should try
to find a way for us all

344
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:43,158
to be together again without
feeling so damn awkward.

345
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:49,363
We're having some people
over tomorrow night.

346
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,667
Good, good, I'll be there.

347
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,669
Hey.

348
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:57,337
We've barely spoken
in three weeks.

349
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:00,740
I'm kind of, kind of
worried about you.

350
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:05,144
I'm fine.

351
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,213
Tell me.

352
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:10,583
It's just...

353
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,454
he's so...

354
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:16,990
What?

355
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:19,759
Nothing.
Jessica, I want to know.

356
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:31,204
Work permit expires
at the end of November.

357
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:33,206
Lives with two roommates
in Tenleytown.

358
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,874
Single mother back in Jakarta.

359
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,509
So she's sending money home,

360
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:38,945
which explains her visit
to the hawala broker.

361
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:40,546
Personal references
all check out,

362
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,482
and I called up
her supervisor at Exotech.

363
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:44,183
Mm-hmm. Diligent, super bright,

364
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:46,519
star of his
I.T. department.

365
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:48,454
All right, moving on.

366
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,558
Where's Carrie?

367
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:52,826
Oh, she should be here soon.

368
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,728
She said she was running late.

369
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:57,063
She say why?

370
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:58,965
No, sir.

371
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,735
How well do you know her?

372
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,169
I like to think we're friends.

373
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:06,738
I understand she's
a bit of a folk hero

374
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:09,007
to some of you analysts.

375
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,542
Well, we've all read
the cables, sir,

376
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,143
heard the stories.

377
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:15,713
With you it's more
than that, isn't it?

378
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:17,648
You want to do what she does.

379
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:20,851
It's no secret I've
put in for Operations.

380
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,486
Three years in a row.

381
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,355
You know, you don't look
like a Galvez.

382
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:26,357
I take after my mother, sir.

383
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:28,059
She's Lebanese.
And your father?

384
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:29,327
Guatemalan.

385
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:30,929
They met at the DMV.

386
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:33,498
My mom refused to take off
her headscarf for the photo,

387
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,901
my dad was the guy
taking the pictures.

388
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:38,670
America.

389
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:40,406
Yes, sir.

390
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,209
Your file says
you're fluent in Arabic.

391
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:44,610
And Spanish, sir.

392
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:46,778
You know, there might
be something opening up

393
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,180
in the Cairo station.

394
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:52,783
My recommendation would
carry weight... which

395
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:55,620
brings us back to
Carrie Mathison.

396
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:58,122
I didn't put you
with her by accident.

397
00:23:58,157 --> 00:24:01,025
I don't understand.

398
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,427
During a debrief,
Carrie mentions

399
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,896
Abu Nazir's name
out of the blue.

400
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,564
Three days later,
one of her assets reports

401
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,867
the first Nazir sighting
in over seven years.

402
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:13,036
Maybe it's coincidence.

403
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,173
Or maybe there's something
she's just not telling us.

404
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,542
You want a taste of Operations?

405
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:24,079
Find out if she's running
something on the side.

406
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:30,486
Sir...

407
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,822
I'm not sure I-I'm
comfortable with...

408
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:38,493
Spying?

409
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:40,261
I'm making sure there are
no loose cannons

410
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:41,830
rolling around on my deck,

411
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:45,600
because if there are,
I need to tie them down.

412
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,443
Hey, Carrie.

413
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:54,777
David, hi.

414
00:24:54,812 --> 00:24:57,247
Sorry I'm late.

415
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:59,016
What was that all about?

416
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,585
Uh, he wanted
to review the, uh, Jalbani file

417
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,287
before he cleared it.

418
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:07,525
So we're onto the next case.

419
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,027
Raqim Faisel,
Assistant Professor

420
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,262
at Bryden University.

421
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:22,972
That woman you were talking to
at church today-- who is she?

422
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,141
Oh, she works for
the vice president.

423
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,444
Works for him how?

424
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,680
Some kind of advisor.

425
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:32,382
What did she want?

426
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,718
She wants to have
lunch with me.

427
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,553
Why?

428
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:38,822
No idea.

429
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:46,230
I invited Mike over
tomorrow night.

430
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:48,866
He knows most of the people
who are coming, so...

431
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,501
No. It's a
great idea, Jess.

432
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:51,836
The more the merrier.

433
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:00,013
Better go check on Chris,

434
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,349
make sure he's doing
his homework.

435
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:34,048
Yeah?

436
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,883
What happened to you?

437
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:38,019
- You just disappeared.
- I had some personal stuff

438
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:39,754
to take care of.

439
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:41,589
Yeah.

440
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:45,259
Well, uh, okay, listen.

441
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,695
I just, uh, finished running
background on Faisel.

442
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,196
Listen to this.

443
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,565
Three trips to Lahore
in the last 18 months.

444
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,966
For what purpose?

445
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,401
Unclear.

446
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:55,969
I put in a call
to Pakistani intelligence.

447
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,871
Oh, I don't trust those fuckers.

448
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,473
Make some appointments
at the university,

449
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:00,908
find out what you can.

450
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:02,543
And tomorrow,
you and I will spend

451
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:06,247
some quality time
with our professor.

452
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:21,263
You know, it's customary
to wait for someone to say,

453
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:24,065
"Come in"
before you actually come in.

454
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,668
You didn't say anything
to your father, did you?

455
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:29,738
About what?

456
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,275
No, I didn't.

457
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,010
'Cause if you did...

458
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,578
Ma, I didn't say a word.

459
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:42,116
Jesus, it's like the Spanish
Inquisition around here.

460
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,419
I believe you, okay?

461
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,804
What are you doing, Ma?

462
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:03,540
I'm sitting on your bed.

463
00:28:03,574 --> 00:28:06,309
Well, yeah, I can see that.

464
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:07,677
Is that a crime?

465
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:10,213
No, not exactly.

466
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:12,515
What then?

467
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:19,956
Is something wrong?

468
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,258
No.

469
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,800
Are you guys gonna get
a divorce?

470
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,669
No.

471
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:35,038
We're not getting divorced.

472
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,976
'Cause if you are, I just

473
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,845
want you to know
that I'm cool with it.

474
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:44,147
I just think you guys should do
whatever's best for you.

475
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,548
Dana,

476
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,884
no one's getting a divorce,
okay?

477
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:50,453
Okay.

478
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:55,725
You should probably

479
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,193
tell Chris that, 'cause he's,
like, totally certain

480
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:01,463
you and dad are gonna
ruin his life or something.

481
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,706
Rumor or fact?

482
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,609
What, me and Estes?

483
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:16,012
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

484
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,382
I don't know. I keep hearing
you guys had a thing once.

485
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:21,185
Is it any of your business?

486
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:29,258
We had a moment.

487
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,729
Misguided. Ancient
history now.

488
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,630
What?

489
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:37,133
I was on the wrong side
of that bet.

490
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:40,636
Why? Does it seem
so unlikely?

491
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:42,771
Kind of.

492
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:44,606
Well, he was the smartest guy

493
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,608
in the Near East
Division by a mile.

494
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,310
It's not that. It's just,

495
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:50,646
I don't see a lot of love lost
between you two.

496
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,548
It didn't end well.

497
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,916
Does it ever?

498
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:56,284
Uh...

499
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,823
That's our guy.

500
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:28,416
I thought you said
he lived in Truxton Circle.

501
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,418
He does.

502
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,655
Not headed there now.

503
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:39,293
Hello?

504
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:40,795
Where is he?

505
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:42,330
It's after 4:00.

506
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:44,099
He should be on his way here.

507
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,101
Tell him the traffic's bad
on the beltway.

508
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,636
What did you say?

509
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,104
He should use
an alternate route.

510
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,405
Tell him now.

511
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:33,849
Guy hasn't broken
the speed limit once.

512
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:36,419
Does that make him more
or less suspicious?

513
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:39,189
Makes him boring as shit.

514
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:41,191
<i>We tailed him all afternoon.</i>

515
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:43,159
After class, he drove
to a Moroccan restaurant

516
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,195
near the airport,
where he dined alone.

517
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:47,096
Second team's outside
his apartment now.

518
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:48,531
His briefcase looked full,

519
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:50,767
so, my guess is,
he's in for the night.

520
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:52,235
What's he an assistant
professor of?

521
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:54,537
Mechanical engineering.
Tenure track.

522
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:56,339
Generally liked.
Published, peer reviewed.

523
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,740
Muslim?

524
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,208
Yeah, but not a Koran thumper.

525
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:00,609
Worships at Kalid Muhammud.

526
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,845
What about those
three trips to Pakistan?

527
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,248
Lecturing at the University
of Lahore. It all checks out.

528
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:06,917
He was delivering
a series of papers

529
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:08,719
on alternative
energy applications.

530
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:11,522
All right. Then see what second
team comes up with tonight.

531
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,625
If nothing, move on.

532
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:18,130
Hey, uh, whose
birthday is it again?

533
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:19,865
I think it's Mitchell's.

534
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,700
I'm gonna go buy him a drink.

535
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,568
Sure. How about you?
You want another?

536
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:24,969
Uh, no. I should go.

537
00:32:25,004 --> 00:32:27,905
Stay and visit.

538
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,574
Visit?

539
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:33,811
Why not?

540
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:36,981
Why are you being nice to me?

541
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:38,549
Do I need a reason?

542
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,084
Not unless you want me

543
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:42,285
to believe a word you're saying.

544
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,488
All right.

545
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,089
Okay.

546
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:49,126
It occurs to me that
I've been holding on to the idea

547
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,661
of being angry at you,

548
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:52,897
rather than actually
being angry at you.

549
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:58,604
Just so we're clear, are
we talking about Baghdad,

550
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:01,807
or what happened pre-Baghdad?

551
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:04,243
Both.

552
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:07,312
Did you just get diagnosed with
cancer, or something, David?

553
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:09,147
You see? It's a
habit for you, too.

554
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:11,849
Neither of us can get past it.

555
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:13,584
Past what exactly?

556
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,252
Our

557
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,855
period of distrusting
each other.

558
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:20,457
Well, that could have
been pretty much any time,

559
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:21,925
couldn't it?

560
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:26,296
I don't know about that.

561
00:33:33,672 --> 00:33:36,475
Well, if I never said
it, I'll say it now.

562
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:41,380
I'm sorry, David.

563
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:44,784
Just so I'm clear,

564
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:47,019
are we talking about Baghdad,
or what happened pre-Baghdad?

565
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:48,621
Both.

566
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,723
Both. But mostly pre.

567
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:53,993
I can't believe I chased you
up to New York like that.

568
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,161
No, I never should have
left in the first place.

569
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:57,729
You deserved an explanation.

570
00:33:57,763 --> 00:34:00,498
I don't know. I might
have run away from me, too.

571
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:02,666
If I had known your marriage
would break up, David...

572
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:04,568
No, no.

573
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:07,839
The truth is, it was
probably over anyway.

574
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:14,178
How is Victoria?

575
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:16,414
Remarried.

576
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,184
To a nice Jewish guy
from Fort Lauderdale, a doctor.

577
00:34:19,218 --> 00:34:21,153
She and the kids
converted last year.

578
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,389
You're kidding me? Victoria?

579
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:26,993
Well...

580
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:28,595
mazel tov.

581
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:34,569
He's short.

582
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,309
So, how's it been?

583
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:45,179
It's been tough, I won't lie.

584
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:46,780
Well, at least he's home.

585
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,182
Joanie's husband
is still over there,

586
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,417
and she only gets
to talk to him once a month

587
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,119
on the SAT-phone
when he's back at Battalion.

588
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:53,954
Yeah.

589
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:56,189
How's the sex?

590
00:34:57,758 --> 00:34:59,292
I know.

591
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:01,127
It's awful, right?

592
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:02,795
More like nonexistent.

593
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,132
Denis couldn't get it up
for almost a year. Really?

594
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,535
Oh, yeah. What about drugs,
like Viagra, or whatever?

595
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:12,306
No, the problem wasn't
between his legs. It's up...

596
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,609
Have I ever been
with an impotent man?

597
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:16,477
I don't think so.

598
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:17,879
Well, you haven't lived.

599
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:22,117
Mm. Ooh!

600
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:25,820
Oh, uh, looks like
they might be, uh...

601
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:27,221
Oh, there she is.

602
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:28,656
Hey, Jess.
Hi.

603
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,224
This is Demmie.
Demmie, Jessica.

604
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,625
Jessica, Demmie.

605
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,594
Debbie, nice to meet you.

606
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:36,763
It's Demmie with two M's.

607
00:35:36,797 --> 00:35:38,998
Demmie.

608
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:41,300
Come in. Let me get you guys
something to drink.

609
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:42,501
Okay.

610
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:55,648
Where'd you find her?

611
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:58,618
It was short notice, all right?

612
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:05,791
So, where's Brody at anyway?

613
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:08,160
I don't know. I haven't
seen him for a little while.

614
00:36:08,194 --> 00:36:09,628
I have no idea where he is.

615
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:11,196
Want me to find him?

616
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,997
That would be great.
Thanks. All right.

617
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:25,976
I'll be right back.

618
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,094
Brody?

619
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,668
Brody?

620
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:51,004
So when are you going back
to work full-time?

621
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:53,340
This week, I think.
That'll be good.

622
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:55,141
Get you out of the house a little more.
Are you hungry?

623
00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:57,310
I am starving...

624
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:01,146
Brody?!

625
00:37:05,118 --> 00:37:06,920
Jesus fucking Christ.

626
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:08,355
Brody? What's going on?

627
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,490
Is everybody all right?

628
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:10,657
Looks like the soap flakes

629
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:11,659
didn't really work, Jess.

630
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:14,028
I killed the deer.

631
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:15,830
Give me the gun, Brody.

632
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:16,664
Back off, Mike.

633
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:17,565
Mom!

634
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,201
Go back inside, Chris.

635
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:21,502
Everything's gonna be fine.

636
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:22,904
Come on, Chris,
let's go inside.

637
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:24,172
It's gonna be okay.
You know what, Mike,

638
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:25,406
I can handle this.
Can you please

639
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,874
just tell everybody to go home.

640
00:37:26,908 --> 00:37:28,209
No, I'm not leaving you alone.

641
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:29,510
Just go, please.

642
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:31,112
Do what she says, Mike.

643
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:35,549
Make sure Chris stays inside.

644
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,917
I don't want him
coming back out here.

645
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:38,084
Chris? Why?
What's the problem?

646
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,552
What do you think I'm gonna do?

647
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:41,955
I don't think you're
gonna do anything.

648
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,623
All right.

649
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:45,225
I'm gonna go get a shovel,

650
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,126
clean up this beast before
the flies get to it.

651
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:50,129
Goddamn it!
Don't walk away from me, Brody.

652
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:52,198
He was eating all your
flowers, for Christ's sake.

653
00:37:52,232 --> 00:37:53,533
What's the big deal?

654
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:56,269
You fired a weapon!

655
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:59,605
In front of our friends,
in front of our son!

656
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,574
You want to believe
that's normal, go right ahead.

657
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:03,543
There's nothing wrong with me.
Is that right?

658
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:07,080
You barely sleep, you turn
your back on your friends,

659
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:08,581
you scare your children.

660
00:38:08,615 --> 00:38:09,949
I mean, you won't even...

661
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,818
What? Say it.

662
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:13,553
You can't even fuck your wife!

663
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,593
We need help, Brody.

664
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:22,896
I see what this is.

665
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,498
Time for me to get my head
shrunk, go to psych services?

666
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,501
I don't give a shit
who you talk to,

667
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:30,170
as long as you talk to somebody.

668
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:31,672
What if I say no?

669
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:38,145
Then I can't do this anymore.

670
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,611
♪ ♪

671
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,677
♪ ♪

672
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:54,256
<i>There's no point</i>
<i>in imagining the worst.</i>

673
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,524
I'm not imagining.
They followed me to this house.

674
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,227
They followed you
past this house.

675
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:02,096
Darling, I promise, no one
knows we're living here.

676
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,198
How can you be so sure?
Because if they did,

677
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,500
they'd be tearing
apart the living room,

678
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:06,701
not driving by outside.

679
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:08,270
No.

680
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,938
I still think we should leave.

681
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,774
Our instructions
were to sit tight.

682
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,881
In the meantime, we owe it
to ourselves not to panic.

683
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,452
You have a class to teach.

684
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,922
In less than an hour.

685
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:26,457
It's important that you do
exactly what you always do.

686
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:28,359
Go to work.

687
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,531
<i>Hiyati.</i>

688
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,800
We knew this would not be easy.

689
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:15,808
Who's next?

690
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:17,510
Sheik Eyad Hassoun.

691
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:19,478
He's a groundsman
for the Islamic House

692
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:21,180
on Constitution Avenue.

693
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:22,581
Any red flags?

694
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:24,317
It depends.
On what?

695
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:25,852
What you consider a red flag.

696
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:28,454
He was arrested 12 years
ago for refusing to leave

697
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:29,856
an unpermitted rally.

698
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,125
What was he protesting?

699
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,197
The presence of U.S.
Troops in Saudi Arabia.

700
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:38,966
All right, start with
his immigration status.

701
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:40,835
I'll be right back.

702
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,637
Any luck?
Not yet.

703
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:44,771
Keep laboring in the vineyards.
Something will turn up.

704
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,173
What I wouldn't give right now

705
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:47,541
for a little retail
intelligence.

706
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,845
Disenchanted imam,
an Islamist kid

707
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:52,380
halfway to the bomb belt.

708
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:53,815
A live source.

709
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,283
That would be nice.

710
00:41:55,317 --> 00:41:56,784
Anything else
on your Christmas list?

711
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,321
Yeah.

712
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:02,490
Let me put Virgil and
Max back on Brody.

713
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:04,392
But this time, we
leave no footprint.

714
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:07,328
Just a light tail, two
12-hour shifts. No.

715
00:42:07,363 --> 00:42:09,030
But we're following
all these other targets.

716
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,665
In case you hadn't noticed,

717
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,067
there's a lot of political heat
on the good sergeant.

718
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:15,537
Now more than ever,
we need to keep our distance.

719
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:19,407
I know it's hard.

720
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:22,477
I can't help but feel
I'm missing something.

721
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:25,313
You're missing him.

722
00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:27,915
When you're on somebody
all the time, it's like that.

723
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,384
You know that
as well as anybody.

724
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:32,586
He's in your rearview
now, Carrie.

725
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,921
You're moving
in another direction.

726
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,391
Understood?

727
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:42,028
Yeah.

728
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,339
Hey.

729
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:54,642
Are you all right?

730
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,244
Yeah.

731
00:43:56,278 --> 00:43:58,179
Just watching the storm.

732
00:43:58,213 --> 00:44:00,081
Oh, yeah?

733
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:01,849
Is it coming or going?

734
00:44:01,884 --> 00:44:04,252
Hard to tell.

735
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:06,621
Coming, I think.

736
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:12,594
You want to join me?

737
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:16,464
I was just getting ready to go.

738
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,835
There's a, uh...

739
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,437
There's a veteran'
support group meeting

740
00:44:22,471 --> 00:44:24,105
at the church tonight.

741
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,507
Okay.

742
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,375
Thought I'd...

743
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:32,479
Thought I'd drop in
and just try it out.

744
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:34,447
Okay.

745
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,217
Thank you.

746
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:38,885
Yeah, don't thank me yet.

747
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:41,353
I don't think
I'm gonna be able to stomach it

748
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:42,855
for more
than about five minutes.

749
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,028
Well, let's get you an umbrella,
just in case.

750
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:12,977
Stay away from the milk.

751
00:46:13,011 --> 00:46:14,945
Spoiled.

752
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,315
Thanks.

753
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

754
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:26,389
Hey, no worries.
No worries.

755
00:46:26,424 --> 00:46:28,225
Hey, I know you.

756
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:30,661
You were in the debrief at...
Please.

757
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:33,097
What?
It's just, I'm...

758
00:46:33,132 --> 00:46:37,135
I... I'm not supposed
to be here.

759
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,503
Why not?

760
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:41,874
Okay, seats everybody.
Time to begin.

761
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:47,412
Hey!

762
00:46:51,617 --> 00:46:53,985
Hey, wait.

763
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,020
Hey, wait.

764
00:46:57,054 --> 00:46:58,688
Wait!

765
00:46:58,722 --> 00:47:00,189
Look, I'm sorry.

766
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:02,925
I really had no idea
you were in this group.

767
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,194
I'm not. It's my first time.

768
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:07,263
Well, then, I'll leave you to it.
Hey, hold on.

769
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:08,698
Hold on a second.

770
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:11,334
What you say
your name was again?

771
00:47:11,368 --> 00:47:14,437
Carrie. Carrie Mathison.

772
00:47:14,471 --> 00:47:16,706
Look, I don't understand.
It's, uh... it's...

773
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,274
What's the problem?

774
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:20,309
It's totally fine
with me if you want to stay.

775
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:21,811
No, it's not that.
It's just, uh...

776
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:24,213
no one in there can know
what I do for a living.

777
00:47:24,247 --> 00:47:25,480
I'm still an active
intelligence officer.

778
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:28,716
Your secret's safe with me.

779
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,885
Besides, I'm better

780
00:47:30,919 --> 00:47:33,487
at spilling my guts
to total strangers anyway.

781
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,856
I hardly ever go
to the same meeting twice.

782
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:38,157
Sounds complicated.

783
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,828
You all right?

784
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:44,630
Are you?

785
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:46,465
Anyway, you should go back in.

786
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:48,500
They're getting started.

787
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:51,903
Hey, look, I'm not going back in
if it means you can't go in.

788
00:47:51,938 --> 00:47:53,338
Please, really, that's...

789
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,374
That's not necessary.

790
00:47:55,408 --> 00:47:57,877
Or maybe we could hold our own
private meeting out here?

791
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,313
How's that sound?

792
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:02,849
It's tempting.

793
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:05,151
Right?

794
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:09,823
Can I ask you a question?

795
00:48:09,857 --> 00:48:12,492
Sure.

796
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:14,661
Where was it you said
you served again? Baghdad?

797
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,429
Yeah.

798
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:22,068
How come it's so hard
to talk about

799
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:24,705
with people who weren't there?

800
00:48:26,908 --> 00:48:28,443
I have a better question.

801
00:48:28,477 --> 00:48:30,846
How come it's so hard
to talk with anyone

802
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,650
who wasn't there
about anything at all?

803
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:43,359
Okay, now I really am going.

804
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:45,394
Don't leave me like this.

805
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:49,064
All alone...
in the rain!

806
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:50,699
You'll be fine.

807
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:52,467
Nobody expects you
