Ellis is in charge
of international development.

Some watered-down champagne?

No, thank you. I'm fine.

You throw quite a party.

to Holly. Right, Joe?

It's just a small token of appreciation...

You have to forgive Ellis.

He gets very depressed
this time of year.

197

God's greatest gift, you know?

That's OK. I have my eye

to ask you on the phone.

We never finished this conversation.

00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:27,770
Mr Takagi...

327
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:32,986
I could talk about industrialisation
and men's fashions all day...

328
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:35,034
..but I'm afraid work must intrude...

329
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,075
..and my associate here
has some questions for you.

330
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,786
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,
actually.

331
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:43,579
[beeping]

332
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,508
I don't have that code.

333
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,771
You broke in here
to access our computer?

334
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,980
Any information you could get...

335
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,188
..when they wake up in Tokyo,
they'll change it.

336
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:03,068
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

337
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,117
Sit... down!

338
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:18,109
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

339
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:24,542
But I need the code key...

340
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:29,439
..because I am interested
in the $640 million...

341
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:34,143
..in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault...

342
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:37,727
..and the computer
controls the vault.

343
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,768
You want money?

344
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:43,488
What kind of terrorists are you?

345
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,992
Who said we were terrorists?

346
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,370
The bonds represent, at most...

347
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:14,083
..10 days' operating capital
for your parent organisation.

348
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:17,347
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

349
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:18,435
Now...

350
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,356
..the code, please.

351
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:26,564
It's useless to you.

352
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:29,956
There are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key's only one of them.

353
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,364
You'll never get it open.

354
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,924
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.

355
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:38,501
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

356
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:46,405
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

357
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:50,181
It would be a shame to ruin it.

358
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,598
I'm going to count to three.

359
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,439
There will not be a four.

360
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:01,094
Give me the code.

361
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:03,239
One,...

362
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:07,400
..two,...

363
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,303
- ..three,...
- I don't know it.

364
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,152
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

365
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:15,752
You're just gonna have to kill me.

366
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,064
OK.

367
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:22,313
We do it the hard way.

368
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,329
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

369
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:27,593
Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work
up on the machine floor.

370
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:28,969
[bumps head]

371
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:52,875
Nothing.

372
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:55,339
See to Heinrich.

373
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,220
Now...

374
00:30:58,636 --> 00:31:00,940
..you can break the code?

375
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:06,540
You didn't bring me
for my charming personality.

376
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:13,613
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.

377
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:15,213
You're calling the police right now.

378
00:31:15,277 --> 00:31:17,517
[loud music playing]
Of course I'm still coming by later.

379
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,845
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

380
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,014
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

381
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:27,695
Uli, get up on the pipes.

382
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,286
Marco, you go through here.

383
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:33,774
I'll throw you the cord.

384
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:39,247
Hans, we're on the roof.

385
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,392
Here.

386
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:57,969
Uli.

387
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,090
30 minutes to break the code,...

388
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:11,571
..two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

389
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:14,706
The 7th lock, however,
is out of my hands.

390
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,781
I'm sorry?

391
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:40,628
The 7th lock...
the electromagnetic seal.

392
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,541
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally?

393
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:46,453
Trust me.

394
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:51,126
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

395

We've got a fire alarm.

Call 911.

400
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:16,536
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.

401
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,848
Then disable the sys...

did the alarm go off?

Because you're a policeman.

There are rules for policemen.

did not see it that way...

650
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:18,778
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

651
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:24,634
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

652
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:26,427
[man] Sam, I don't have the new pages.

653
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:28,666
Harvey, keep your pants on.

654
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:30,427
Sam, I'm begging you.

655
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,595
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

656
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,420
I won't sit on this!

657
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:38,171
This is my story!
I'm going out there!

658
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:39,835
Look, Sam. Tell you what.

659
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,012
You don't give me a truck,
I'll steal a truck.

660
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:43,228
[Harvey]
Give us a break, Thornburg.

661
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:44,444
Eat it, Harvey!

662
00:58:44,508 --> 00:58:46,972
..four, three, two,...

663
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:48,221
..one.

664
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:50,109
Harvey, we're on the air.

665
00:58:54,237 --> 00:58:56,221
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

666
00:58:58,045 --> 00:58:59,678
And I'm Gail Wallens.

667
00:58:59,742 --> 00:59:01,662
This is Nightline News at 10.00.

668
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:04,446
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve...

669
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,550
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

670
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,823
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

671
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,160
The other man was Heinrich...

672
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:22,399
..and his bag is missing.

673
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:25,984
He had the detonator.

674
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:31,521
Theo.

675
00:59:32,288 --> 00:59:33,281
Theo.

676
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:34,464
Yo!

677
00:59:34,913 --> 00:59:37,952
We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?

678
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:39,873
Three down, four to go.

679
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:41,345
Then don't waste time...

680
00:59:41,441 --> 00:59:43,233
..talking to me.

681
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:45,377
This is Sergeant Al Powell...

682
00:59:45,474 --> 00:59:47,042
..of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

683
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:48,482
If the person who radioed for help...

684
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:49,666
..can hear me on this channel,...

685
00:59:49,825 --> 00:59:51,682
..acknowledge this transmission.

686
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:52,770
I say again,...

687
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:56,035
..if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,...

688
00:59:56,098 --> 00:59:58,466
..acknowledge this transmission!

689
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:05,123
I read you, pal.
You the guy in the car?

690
01:00:05,187 --> 01:00:07,075
What's left of him.

691
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,739
Can you identify yourself?

692
01:00:08,835 --> 01:00:10,468
Not now. Maybe later.

693
01:00:10,564 --> 01:00:12,484
Listen fast. This is a party line.

694
01:00:12,548 --> 01:00:14,468
The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.

695
01:00:14,564 --> 01:00:16,036
All right, here's the deal.

696
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:17,892
You got 30 or so hostages
on the 30th floor.

697
01:00:17,957 --> 01:00:19,300
The leader's name is Hans.

698
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:20,837
We have to find him and shut him up.

699
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:21,957
He's telling them everything!

700
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,036
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

701
01:00:24,101 --> 01:00:26,117
He can waste
as much time as he likes...

702
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:28,389
..but we must find the bag, Fritz.

703
01:00:28,485 --> 01:00:30,438
[McClane]
They have a freakin' arsenal here.

704
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,781
We must have the detonators.

705
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:34,245
They got missiles, automatic weapons,...

706
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,358
..and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

707
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:39,558
They're down to nine now,
counting the skydiver you met.

708
01:00:39,654 --> 01:00:41,382
These guys are mostly European...

709
01:00:41,478 --> 01:00:43,879
..judging by their clothing labels and...

710
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,911
..cigarettes.

711
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:54,440
They're well-financed and very slick.

712
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:56,135
How do you know that?

713
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,895
I've seen enough phoney IDs in my time...

714
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,640
..to recognise the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

715
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:06,152
Add all that up. I don't know
what the fuck it means...

716
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:08,233
..but you got
some bad-ass perpetrators...

717
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:09,672
..and they're here to stay.

718
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,617
I hear you, partner.

719
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:13,865
LA's finest are on it,...

720
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:15,433
..so light 'em if you got 'em.

721
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:18,729
Way ahead of you, partner.

722
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,130
So what do I call you?

723
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:23,818
Call me...

724
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,410
..Roy.

725
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:30,090
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else...

726
01:01:30,155 --> 01:01:31,275
..don't be shy, OK?

727
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:34,283
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.

728
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:37,452
They're all yours, Al.

729
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:55,437
Who's talking to 'em?

730
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,373
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

731
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,773
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?

732
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:03,693
What do these pricks want?

733
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:05,806
If you mean the terrorists,...

734
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:07,854
..we haven't heard a peep from them.

735
01:02:07,918 --> 01:02:09,710
Who have you been talking to?

736
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:13,487
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

737
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,078
But he appears to be
the one who phoned.

738
01:02:16,174 --> 01:02:19,279
He's killed one terrorist for sure
and claims he capped off two others.

739
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,527
He claims?

740
01:02:20,623 --> 01:02:22,736
Powell, has it occurred to you...

741
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,071
..he could be
one of the terrorists pulling your chain...

742
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,831
..or some nutcase in there?

743
01:02:26,928 --> 01:02:29,871
I don't think so.
In fact, I think he's a cop,...

744
01:02:29,967 --> 01:02:32,656
..maybe not LAPD,
But he's definitely a badge.

745
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,856
- How do you know that?
- A hunch... things he said...

746
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:38,608
..like being able to spot a phoney ID.

747
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,688
Jesus Christ, Powell!

748
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:43,152
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know!

749
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:44,721
TV's here.

750
01:02:45,617 --> 01:02:47,153
Oh, shit.

751
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:48,242
[horn honks]

752
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:51,762
[officers shouting]

753
01:03:03,474 --> 01:03:04,882
I have a request.

754
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:07,699
What idiot put you in charge?

755
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:09,203
You did...

756
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,284
..when you murdered my boss.

757
01:03:11,379 --> 01:03:13,364
Now everybody's looking to me.

758
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,924
Personally, I'd pass on the job.

759
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,252
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

760
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:28,149
Go on.

761
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:30,133
We have a pregnant woman.

762
01:03:30,197 --> 01:03:33,013
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks...

763
01:03:33,078 --> 01:03:36,117
..but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

764
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:39,446
So I'd like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

765
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:43,574
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

766
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:45,014
Good enough.

767
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,030
And unless you like it messy,...

768
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,271
..start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

769
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:52,279
Yes. You're right.

770
01:03:53,175 --> 01:03:54,775
It will be done.

771
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:56,568
Was there something else?

772
01:03:58,903 --> 01:04:00,408
No, thank you.

773
01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:09,336
Mr Takagi
chose his people well, Mrs...?

774
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:11,192
Gennero.

775
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:15,321
Ms Gennero.

776
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,378
We interrupt this programme
for a special news bulletin.

777
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,258
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

778
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:26,298
Tonight, Los Angeles has joined

779
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:29,306
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities

780
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:31,291
whose only membership requirement

781
01:04:31,387 --> 01:04:34,330
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.

782
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:38,619
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men

783
01:04:38,683 --> 01:04:41,244
seized control
of the Nakatomibuilding,

784
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:43,483
sealing off all entrances and exits.

785
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,403
All telephone lines have been cut

786
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:47,708
and the only communication
now possible

787
01:04:47,771 --> 01:04:50,588
has been through the use
of CB communicators

788
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,924
which the group
apparently brought with them.

789
01:04:53,021 --> 01:04:54,748
According to official sources,

790
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,340
the perpetrators of this building siege...

791
01:04:57,436 --> 01:05:00,061
Unit five,
hold your position in the main entrance.

792
01:05:00,156 --> 01:05:02,621
We got Charlie unit in position

793
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:04,190
by the parking structure.

794
01:05:04,253 --> 01:05:05,981
Let me ask you something.

795
01:05:06,077 --> 01:05:08,126
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

796
01:05:08,222 --> 01:05:09,342
Yeah.

797
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,134
Tell them to go ahead.

798
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:13,438
What's going on?

799
01:05:14,142 --> 01:05:16,222
What's it look like? We're going in.

800
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,974
Going in? Man, that's crazy!

801
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,926
There could be over 30 hostages
in there for all we know.

802
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,846
We don't know shit, Powell.

803
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:26,175
If there's hostages, how come
there were no ransom demands?

804
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,407
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

805
01:05:29,504 --> 01:05:31,616
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

806
01:05:31,712 --> 01:05:33,759
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch

807
01:05:33,824 --> 01:05:35,775
you've been talking to on that radio.

808
01:05:35,872 --> 01:05:37,472
Excuse me, sir,

809
01:05:37,536 --> 01:05:40,704
but what about the body
that fell out the window?

810
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,496
Probably some stockbroker
got depressed.

811
01:05:42,593 --> 01:05:43,681
We're ready, Chief.

812
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:46,017
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.

813
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,897
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!

814
01:06:00,354 --> 01:06:01,154
Powell?

815
01:06:02,594 --> 01:06:05,186
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

816
01:06:05,858 --> 01:06:07,106
Yo, Al.

817
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:09,667
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

818
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:10,819
I'll talk to you later.

819
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:11,811
Al, what's wrong?

820
01:06:11,907 --> 01:06:13,507
I'll talk to you later.

821
01:06:13,572 --> 01:06:15,555
If you are what I think you are,

822
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:18,083
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and

823
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:21,380
and when to pray.

824
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:23,588
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?

825
01:06:23,684 --> 01:06:24,996
Christ, Powell,

826
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,013
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

827
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:29,317
Let's load them up.

828
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,949
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

829
01:06:35,813 --> 01:06:38,341
Theo, you are the eyes now.

830
01:06:50,311 --> 01:06:51,559
- Rivers.
- Yo.

831
01:06:51,623 --> 01:06:54,310
Begin your reconnoitre.

832
01:06:54,918 --> 01:06:56,231
Let's go.

833
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:00,839
Shit!

834
01:07:18,985 --> 01:07:21,161
Come on. Let's go.

835
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:32,394
Ow! Jesus!

836
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:07,405
All right, spread out.

837
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,775
Shut up.

838
01:08:35,471 --> 01:08:37,295
Let's go.

839
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:43,601
You macho assholes. No! No!

840
01:08:46,448 --> 01:08:49,137
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

841
01:08:50,449 --> 01:08:52,529
'Twas the night before Christmas

842
01:08:52,593 --> 01:08:54,513
and all through the house

843
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:56,946
not a creature was stirring, except

844
01:08:57,042 --> 01:08:59,889
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard

845
01:08:59,954 --> 01:09:01,682
two-by-two cover formation.

846
01:09:03,986 --> 01:09:05,235
We're all set.

847
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:08,370
We're ready.

848
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,810
Kick ass.

849
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:10,962
Go!

850
01:09:11,058 --> 01:09:13,139
Right. Let's do it.

851
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,332
Take cover!

852
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:31,157
They're shooting at 'em.

853
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:33,204
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

854
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,093
They're shooting at the lights.

855
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:42,613
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

856
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:44,886
It's not happening.

857
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,133
Mike, burn it.

858
01:09:48,278 --> 01:09:49,910
Don't be impatient.

859
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,438
Just wound them.

860
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,790
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

861
01:09:56,886 --> 01:09:58,615
They're almost in.

862
01:09:58,679 --> 01:09:59,799
Send in the car.

863
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,430
Send in the car.

864
01:10:14,264 --> 01:10:15,577
Jesus Christ!

865
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:21,209
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

866
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:24,089
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

867
01:10:27,961 --> 01:10:30,522
The police have themselves an RV.

868
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,890
Southeast corner.

869
01:10:49,435 --> 01:10:51,259
Oh, Jesus Christ.

870
01:11:02,684 --> 01:11:05,308
Get back! Get the fuck back!

871
01:11:07,005 --> 01:11:08,092
Get over there.

872
01:11:08,188 --> 01:11:09,533
Schnell! Schnell!

873
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:11,645
Mach schnell!

874
01:11:14,398 --> 01:11:16,189
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

875
01:11:16,254 --> 01:11:18,045
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

876
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,261
Weiter!

877
01:11:22,142 --> 01:11:23,614
Mach los! Mach los!

878
01:11:42,816 --> 01:11:43,744
I see him!

879
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,513
- Fire!
- Clear!

880
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:05,154
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

881
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:08,162
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

882
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:10,306
Hit it again.

883
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,611
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

884
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:13,507
Let them pull back!

885
01:12:13,571 --> 01:12:15,971
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

886
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:16,418
Hit it

887
01:12:16,514 --> 01:12:17,507
again.

888
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:32,420
Fire.

889
01:12:46,373 --> 01:12:48,261
Fuck me.

890
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:50,790
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

891
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:01,223
Fuck it.

892
01:13:03,975 --> 01:13:05,574
Mach schnell! Mach los!

893
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:16,616
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

894
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,120
Geronimo, motherfucker.

895
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:41,002
Oh, shit!

896
01:13:46,058 --> 01:13:47,595
They're using artillery on us!

897
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:49,675
You idiot, it's not the police.

898
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:51,883
It's him.

899
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,299
Holy shit.

900
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,828
My God!

901
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:11,757
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

902
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:15,437
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

903
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:16,781
We've had an update

904
01:14:16,877 --> 01:14:19,309
on the terrorist takeover
of the Nakatomibuilding.

905
01:14:19,405 --> 01:14:21,485
Sources say
the terrorist leader, Hans,

906
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:23,501
may be this man... Hans Gruber.

907
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:26,382
A member of the radical
West German Volksfreimovement.

908
01:14:26,477 --> 01:14:30,126
Strangely, the Volksfreileadership
issued a communiqu� an hour ago

909
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,879
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organisation.

910
01:14:32,943 --> 01:14:34,959
Al, do you copy?

911
01:14:35,311 --> 01:14:36,686
Are you all right?

912
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:38,863
Yeah, I'm fine.

913
01:14:39,951 --> 01:14:41,232
W-what was that?

914
01:14:41,295 --> 01:14:44,112
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

915
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:46,992
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

916
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:48,784
No, but it's gonna need a paintjob

917
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,448
and a shitload of screen doors.

918
01:14:50,512 --> 01:14:53,168
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

919
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:55,665
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

920
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:59,793
I don't know who you think you are

921
01:14:59,889 --> 01:15:02,225
but you just destroyed a building.

922
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:05,265
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

923
01:15:05,361 --> 01:15:07,121
We don't want your help.

924
01:15:07,186 --> 01:15:10,162
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

925
01:15:10,226 --> 01:15:13,042
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

926
01:15:13,106 --> 01:15:14,034
Who the fuck is this?

927
01:15:15,602 --> 01:15:18,163
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

928
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:20,115
and I am in charge of this situation.

929
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,907
Oh, you're in charge?

930
01:15:22,003 --> 01:15:23,923
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

931
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,155
From up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.

932
01:15:27,219 --> 01:15:29,236
Listen to me, you little asshole...

933
01:15:29,299 --> 01:15:30,099
Asshole?

934
01:15:30,196 --> 01:15:31,923
I'm not the one
who just got buttfucked

935
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:33,747
on national TV, Dwayne.

936
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:35,028
Ah ha ha!

937
01:15:35,124 --> 01:15:36,884
Listen to me, jerk-off,

938
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:39,828
if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

939
01:15:39,924 --> 01:15:42,933
Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!

940
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,285
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

941
01:15:47,349 --> 01:15:49,269
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

942
01:15:49,365 --> 01:15:51,509
Hey, look. I love you.

943
01:15:51,605 --> 01:15:53,813
So do a lot of the other guys.

944
01:15:53,878 --> 01:15:56,374
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

945
01:15:56,437 --> 01:15:58,262
You hang in there.

946
01:15:59,798 --> 01:16:02,166
Yeah, thanks, partner.

947
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:09,175
What are you doing?

948
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:10,422
I'm tired of sitting here

949
01:16:10,519 --> 01:16:12,503
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

950
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:14,008
them or your husband.

951
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,991
What are you going to do?

952
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:16,888
Hey, babe,

953
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:18,775
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

954
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,631
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

955
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:24,120
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

956
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:26,968
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralised already.

957
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:28,665
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

958
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,865
Hope I'm not interrupting.

959
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:32,953
What does he want?

960
01:16:33,049 --> 01:16:36,569
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

961
01:16:43,673 --> 01:16:45,914
Look, let's be straight, OK?

962
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:48,442
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

963
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:50,458
up here to snatch a few purses.

964
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,091
You're very perceptive.

965
01:16:52,155 --> 01:16:53,755
I watch "60 Minutes".

966
01:16:53,851 --> 01:16:56,443
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

967
01:16:56,507 --> 01:16:58,843
they're motivated, they're happening,

968
01:16:58,939 --> 01:17:00,444
they want something.

969
01:17:00,507 --> 01:17:03,228
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

970
01:17:03,324 --> 01:17:05,436
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

971
01:17:05,532 --> 01:17:06,940
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland.

972
01:17:07,004 --> 01:17:08,316
It's none of my business.

973
01:17:08,412 --> 01:17:10,652
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

974
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:11,804
You're amazing.

975
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:14,108
You figured this all out already?

976
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:16,253
Hey, business is business.

977
01:17:16,317 --> 01:17:18,173
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

978
01:17:18,237 --> 01:17:19,452
What's the difference?

979
01:17:19,517 --> 01:17:20,573
Let's put it in my terms.

980
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:22,013
You're here on a hostile takeover.

981
01:17:22,078 --> 01:17:23,261
You grab us for some green

982
01:17:23,325 --> 01:17:26,493
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

983
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:27,389
Am I right?

984
01:17:27,966 --> 01:17:28,957
Hans,

985
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:30,558
bubbie...

986
01:17:31,038 --> 01:17:32,734
I'm your white knight.

987
01:17:33,822 --> 01:17:36,382
I must have missed "60 Minutes".

988
01:17:36,446 --> 01:17:37,439
What are you saying?

989
01:17:39,774 --> 01:17:42,847
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

990
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,927
I can give him to you.

991
01:17:51,488 --> 01:17:53,472
Oh, God...

992
01:17:55,488 --> 01:17:57,760
Roy? Roy, you all right?

993
01:17:58,976 --> 01:18:01,889
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

994
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:04,289
What do they put in these things,

995
01:18:04,384 --> 01:18:05,184
anyway?

996
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:07,425
Sugar, enriched flour,

997
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:09,441
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

998
01:18:09,537 --> 01:18:10,882
polysorbate 60,

999
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,610
and yellow dye number five.

1000
01:18:12,673 --> 01:18:15,522
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

1001
01:18:16,098 --> 01:18:17,890
How many kids you got, Al?

1002
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:21,859
As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

1003
01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:23,490
How about you, cowboy?

1004
01:18:23,586 --> 01:18:25,954
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

1005
01:18:27,139 --> 01:18:28,291
Yeah.

1006
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:29,603
Two.

1007
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:31,971
Sure hope I can see them

1008
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:34,243
swinging on a jungle gym
with Al Jr. someday.

1009
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,339
Well, now, that's a date

1010
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:40,452
but you bring the ice cream.

1011
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,044
[Hans] Touching, cowboy. Touching.

1012
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:45,156
Or should I call you

1013
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,300
Mr McClane?

1014
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:51,141
Mr Officer John McClane

1015
01:18:51,205 --> 01:18:53,765
of the New York
Police Department?

1016
01:18:55,301 --> 01:18:57,445
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

1017
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,782
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

1018
01:18:59,846 --> 01:19:03,142
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

1019
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,638
My friends call me John

1020
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:08,422
and you're neither, shithead.

1021
01:19:08,487 --> 01:19:12,039
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

1022
01:19:12,135 --> 01:19:14,727
A very special friend

1023
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:17,287
who was with you
at the party tonight.

1024
01:19:23,015 --> 01:19:25,064
Hey, John boy.

1025
01:19:26,312 --> 01:19:27,688
Ellis?

1026
01:19:27,944 --> 01:19:29,224
Yeah.

1027
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:33,097
Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.

1028
01:19:33,161 --> 01:19:36,104
I know you think you're doing your job
and I can appreciate that

1029
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:37,833
but you're just dragging
this thing out.

1030
01:19:37,897 --> 01:19:40,809
Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys

1031
01:19:40,905 --> 01:19:42,537
can talk to the LA Police.

1032
01:19:42,633 --> 01:19:45,865
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

1033
01:19:51,178 --> 01:19:52,874
Ellis, what have you told them?

1034
01:19:52,938 --> 01:19:56,874
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

1035
01:19:56,939 --> 01:19:58,347
at the party.

1036
01:19:59,339 --> 01:20:01,227
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

1037
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,507
Tell me about it.

1038
01:20:08,843 --> 01:20:10,507
All right, John, listen.

1039
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,644
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

1040
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:15,916
They know people are listening.

1041
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:19,789
They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.

1042
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:24,557
John, didn't you hear me?

1043
01:20:26,893 --> 01:20:28,717
Yeah, I hear you.

1044
01:20:28,781 --> 01:20:30,573
John, get with the programme.

1045
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:33,134
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

1046
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:35,662
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

1047
01:20:35,725 --> 01:20:38,670
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

1048
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:40,878
Ellis, listen to me carefully.

1049
01:20:40,942 --> 01:20:41,263
John...

1050
01:20:41,327 --> 01:20:43,247
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

1051
01:20:43,983 --> 01:20:45,326
Put Hans back on the line.

1052
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:49,839
Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are but I do.

1053
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:51,823
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

1054
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:53,231
and save your friend's life.

1055
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:55,439
You're not part of this equation.

1056
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:57,711
Hey, what am I, a method actor?

1057
01:20:57,776 --> 01:20:59,312
Babe, put away the gun.

1058
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:00,976
This is radio, not television.

1059
01:21:01,072 --> 01:21:03,057
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

1060
01:21:03,153 --> 01:21:04,528
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

1061
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,577
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

1062
01:21:06,673 --> 01:21:08,465
Tell them you don't know me!

1063
01:21:09,553 --> 01:21:11,857
How can you say that
after all these years?

1064
01:21:11,953 --> 01:21:15,345
John? John?

1065
01:21:38,035 --> 01:21:39,092
Do you hear that?

1066
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:42,196
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

1067
01:21:42,644 --> 01:21:45,108
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

1068
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:46,388
Sooner or later

1069
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:48,948
I might get to someone
you do care about.

1070
01:21:49,524 --> 01:21:51,988
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1071
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,157
He just let the guy die.

1072
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,205
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1073
01:21:57,269 --> 01:21:59,254
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

1074
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:02,870
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1075
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,142
He did everything he could
to save him.

1076
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:08,214
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

1077
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,871
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

1078
01:22:10,934 --> 01:22:14,326
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

1079
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:17,302
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

1080
01:22:17,398 --> 01:22:19,287
The man is hurting.

1081
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,919
He is alone, tired,

1082
01:22:20,984 --> 01:22:24,503
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

1083
01:22:24,599 --> 01:22:26,999
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

1084
01:22:27,063 --> 01:22:30,104
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

1085
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,984
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

1086
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,584
You listen to me, sergeant.

1087
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:38,041
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1088
01:22:38,105 --> 01:22:41,304
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1089
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,193
Attention, police.

1090
01:22:44,313 --> 01:22:46,298
Attention, police.

1091
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,337
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

1092
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:51,865
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1093
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:52,825
Who is this?

1094
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:54,394
This is Hans Gruber.

1095
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:58,938
I assume you realise the futility
of direct action against me.

1096
01:22:59,035 --> 01:23:00,858
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1097
01:23:00,955 --> 01:23:03,867
What is it you do wish for?

1098
01:23:03,963 --> 01:23:08,028
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

1099
01:23:08,123 --> 01:23:11,675
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.

1100
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:13,724
Now it can rattle it for me.

1101
01:23:15,068 --> 01:23:18,556
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1102
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:22,140
In Northern Ireland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

1103
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:26,684
In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Libert� de Quebec.

1104
01:23:26,749 --> 01:23:30,557
In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1105
01:23:30,621 --> 01:23:32,093
What the fuck?

1106
01:23:32,157 --> 01:23:33,917
Asian Dawn?

1107
01:23:34,013 --> 01:23:36,381
I read about them in "Time magazine".

1108
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:40,221
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1109
01:23:40,318 --> 01:23:43,390
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

1110
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:45,727
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

1111
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:47,966
to the Los Angeles
International Airport

1112
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:50,559
where they will be given
further instructions.

1113
01:23:50,623 --> 01:23:52,447
You have two hours to comply.

1114
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:55,839
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

1115
01:23:55,936 --> 01:23:59,520
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

1116
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,792
Hello? Hello!

1117
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:06,849
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

1118
01:24:06,912 --> 01:24:08,961
Do you think they'll even try?

1119
01:24:09,024 --> 01:24:10,689
Who cares?

1120
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,361
Theo, are we on schedule?

1121
01:24:15,457 --> 01:24:17,313
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1122
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:20,673
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

1123
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:22,242
It's Christmas, Theo.

1124
01:24:22,338 --> 01:24:24,770
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

1125
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:27,522
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1126
01:24:28,194 --> 01:24:29,187
Karl,

1127
01:24:29,283 --> 01:24:32,803
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1128
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:34,915
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1129
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:37,571
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1130
01:24:37,635 --> 01:24:39,875
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1131
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:42,531
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1132
01:24:43,043 --> 01:24:46,404
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1133
01:24:46,468 --> 01:24:49,892
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

1134
01:24:50,404 --> 01:24:51,877
I hear you.

1135
01:24:57,573 --> 01:24:59,877
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1136
01:24:59,973 --> 01:25:02,405
It doesn't make sense, man.

1137
01:25:03,685 --> 01:25:04,965
Hey, don't ask me, man.

1138
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:07,526
I'm just a deskjockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

1139
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:11,078
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

1140
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:14,022
In my youth. In my youth.

1141
01:25:14,086 --> 01:25:17,895
..author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage,

1142
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,078
A Study in Duality."

1143
01:25:19,174 --> 01:25:20,646
Dr Hasseldorf,

1144
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:22,758
what can we expect
in the next few hours?

1145
01:25:22,854 --> 01:25:23,367
Well, Gail,

1146
01:25:23,462 --> 01:25:25,927
by this time,
the hostages should be going through

1147
01:25:25,991 --> 01:25:28,200
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1148
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:30,055
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

1149
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,655
Finland.

1150
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,208
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

1151
01:25:35,304 --> 01:25:37,800
go through a sort of
psychological transference

1152
01:25:37,896 --> 01:25:39,944
and a projection of dependency.

1153
01:25:40,008 --> 01:25:42,728
A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.

1154
01:25:42,824 --> 01:25:45,289
We've had situations
where the hostages

1155
01:25:45,353 --> 01:25:47,625
have embraced their captors
after release

1156
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:49,929
and even corresponded with them
in prison.

1157
01:25:50,121 --> 01:25:52,810
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

1158
01:25:52,873 --> 01:25:55,722
D-A-W-N.

1159
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,225
- Sir?
- Yeah?

1160
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:59,146
Sir, the FBI is here.

1161
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:02,858
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

1162
01:26:02,923 --> 01:26:04,010
Hold this.

1163
01:26:04,298 --> 01:26:06,443
Want a breath mint?

1164
01:26:10,315 --> 01:26:12,172
Hey, how you doing, man?

1165
01:26:12,683 --> 01:26:15,211
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1166
01:26:15,307 --> 01:26:18,507
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

1167
01:26:18,572 --> 01:26:19,852
I'm, uh...

1168
01:26:21,228 --> 01:26:24,044
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

1169
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:26,925
Not any more.

1170
01:27:19,409 --> 01:27:22,833
Hi, there. How you doing?

1171
01:27:26,002 --> 01:27:27,025
Ohh...

1172
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:31,570
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

1173
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:33,138
You're one of them.

1174
01:27:33,234 --> 01:27:35,986
No! Don't kill me! Please!

1175
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:38,419
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

1176
01:27:38,483 --> 01:27:41,170
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1177
01:27:41,266 --> 01:27:42,867
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1178
01:27:45,299 --> 01:27:46,868
Oh, God.

1179
01:27:50,163 --> 01:27:51,668
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

1180
01:27:51,731 --> 01:27:53,268
What were you looking for?

1181
01:27:53,332 --> 01:27:55,668
I managed to get out of there and

1182
01:27:55,732 --> 01:27:58,741
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1183
01:27:58,804 --> 01:28:01,428
and see if I could signal for help.

1184
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:04,916
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

1185
01:28:04,981 --> 01:28:07,989
Hold it. Forget the roof.

1186
01:28:08,661 --> 01:28:11,382
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1187
01:28:12,757 --> 01:28:15,062
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1188
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:19,767
The best we can figure it,

1189
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:23,222
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

1190
01:28:23,318 --> 01:28:25,142
probably on the 30th floor

1191
01:28:25,238 --> 01:28:28,695
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1192
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,871
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1193
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:33,271
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

1194
01:28:33,335 --> 01:28:36,055
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1195
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:38,008
Aren't you forgetting something?

1196
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:39,064
Such as?

1197
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:40,760
What about John McClane?

1198
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:43,832
He's the reason
we have any information.

1199
01:28:43,896 --> 01:28:47,384
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

1200
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,688
He's inside? Who is he?

1201
01:28:49,785 --> 01:28:52,569
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

1202
01:28:52,665 --> 01:28:55,225
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

1203
01:29:00,538 --> 01:29:01,369
You smoke?

1204
01:29:02,874 --> 01:29:04,314
Yeah.

1205
01:29:08,827 --> 01:29:09,979
Thanks.

1206
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:16,475
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1207
01:29:20,571 --> 01:29:22,299
And if you're not one of them...

1208
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:26,748
I'm a cop from New York.

1209
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:30,076
New York?

1210
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,196
Yeah.

1211
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,781
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1212
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:36,093
Who knew?

1213
01:29:43,581 --> 01:29:45,885
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1214
01:29:55,263 --> 01:29:56,671
I'm John McClane.

1215
01:29:57,951 --> 01:29:59,391
You're, uh...

1216
01:30:00,703 --> 01:30:01,791
Clay.

1217
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:05,472
Bill Clay.

1218
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,344
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1219
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,640
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1220
01:30:16,705 --> 01:30:18,880
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

1221
01:30:18,944 --> 01:30:21,121
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1222
01:30:22,465 --> 01:30:23,649
Nope.

1223
01:30:26,593 --> 01:30:28,353
Time for the real thing, Bill.

1224
01:30:36,546 --> 01:30:38,722
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1225
01:30:39,395 --> 01:30:39,970
Come on.

1226
01:30:58,596 --> 01:31:00,036
Put down the gun

1227
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:02,724
and give me my detonators.

1228
01:31:06,948 --> 01:31:08,325
Well, well, well...

1229
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:11,205
Hans.

1230
01:31:12,197 --> 01:31:14,629
Put it down now.

1231
01:31:18,086 --> 01:31:20,646
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1232
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:23,911
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1233
01:31:26,791 --> 01:31:30,279
But what do you want
with the detonators?

1234
01:31:30,342 --> 01:31:32,903
I already used all the explosives.

1235
01:31:35,143 --> 01:31:36,455
Or did I?

1236
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:39,399
I'm going to count to three.

1237
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:41,800
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1238
01:31:42,888 --> 01:31:43,527
Oops.

1239
01:31:45,352 --> 01:31:46,632
No bullets.

1240
01:31:46,728 --> 01:31:49,673
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1241
01:31:49,768 --> 01:31:50,793
You were saying?

1242
01:32:43,245 --> 01:32:43,725
Karl.

1243
01:32:44,653 --> 01:32:45,805
Schie� dem Fenster.

1244
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,926
Shoot the glass!

1245
01:33:26,929 --> 01:33:28,369
Jesus Christ!

1246
01:33:56,403 --> 01:33:59,252
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1247
01:34:01,812 --> 01:34:04,692
..is the last resort of diplomacy,

1248
01:34:04,756 --> 01:34:07,700
then couldn't we just as well say

1249
01:34:07,764 --> 01:34:10,580
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?

1250
01:34:11,253 --> 01:34:13,301
Tell me you got something.

1251
01:34:13,365 --> 01:34:17,173
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1252
01:34:17,237 --> 01:34:18,613
and his family's home address

1253
01:34:18,709 --> 01:34:20,566
right here in LA.

1254
01:34:22,902 --> 01:34:23,606
Whoo!

1255
01:34:28,982 --> 01:34:30,102
Go to work.

1256
01:34:30,294 --> 01:34:32,022
Got it.

1257
01:34:43,639 --> 01:34:46,776
God, that man looks really pissed.

1258
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:50,936
He's still alive.

1259
01:34:51,288 --> 01:34:52,248
What?

1260
01:34:53,592 --> 01:34:57,368
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1261
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:14,554
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

1262
01:35:14,618 --> 01:35:16,698
because we just broke through
on number six

1263
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:19,387
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1264
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:24,571
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1265
01:35:26,907 --> 01:35:28,028
Hey, John.

1266
01:35:28,092 --> 01:35:30,427
John McClane, you still with us?

1267
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:31,579
Yeah.

1268
01:35:32,347 --> 01:35:36,028
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1269
01:35:36,572 --> 01:35:38,620
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1270
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:41,629
The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1271
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,253
We got a pool going on you.

1272
01:35:44,349 --> 01:35:46,141
What kind of odds am I getting?

1273
01:35:46,236 --> 01:35:47,805
You don't want to know.

1274
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:49,277
Put me down for 20.

1275
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:50,461
I'm good for it.

1276
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:56,797
Hey, pal, you got flatfeet?

1277
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:01,310
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

1278
01:36:01,374 --> 01:36:03,711
Something had
to get you off the street.

1279
01:36:03,774 --> 01:36:04,927
What's the matter?

1280
01:36:05,023 --> 01:36:08,127
You don't think jockeying papers
across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?

1281
01:36:09,983 --> 01:36:11,199
No.

1282
01:36:14,495 --> 01:36:16,448
I had an accident.

1283
01:36:16,544 --> 01:36:18,752
The way you drive, I can see why.

1284
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:19,552
What'd you do ?

1285
01:36:19,616 --> 01:36:22,111
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

1286
01:36:25,824 --> 01:36:26,976
I shot a kid.

1287
01:36:28,513 --> 01:36:30,273
He was 13 years old.

1288
01:36:31,457 --> 01:36:33,441
Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.

1289
01:36:33,505 --> 01:36:35,361
He had a ray gun, looked real enough.

1290
01:36:38,466 --> 01:36:42,081
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1291
01:36:42,146 --> 01:36:43,938
except how to live with a mistake.

1292
01:36:47,779 --> 01:36:51,971
Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.

1293
01:36:55,299 --> 01:36:56,579
Sorry, man.

1294
01:36:58,019 --> 01:37:00,612
Hey, man, how could you know?

1295
01:37:02,851 --> 01:37:04,611
I feel like shit anyway.

1296
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:09,028
Well, then, this won't matter.

1297
01:37:09,124 --> 01:37:13,668
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

1298
01:37:16,036 --> 01:37:17,157
The Feds?

1299
01:37:17,669 --> 01:37:18,725
You got it.

1300
01:37:20,229 --> 01:37:22,437
Those are the city engineers.

1301
01:37:23,589 --> 01:37:24,325
Wait.

1302
01:37:25,093 --> 01:37:26,918
They're going into the street circuits.

1303
01:37:26,982 --> 01:37:29,894
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

1304
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,854
That's the FBI.

1305
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:35,206
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1306
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:37,191
Regular as clockwork.

1307
01:37:38,951 --> 01:37:40,455
Or a time lock.

1308
01:37:40,967 --> 01:37:42,631
Precisely.

1309
01:37:42,727 --> 01:37:46,407
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1310
01:37:46,471 --> 01:37:49,095
in response to a terrorist incident.

1311
01:37:49,191 --> 01:37:51,240
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1312
01:37:51,303 --> 01:37:55,304
I give you the F-B-I.

1313
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,224
I want the building shut down.

1314
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,400
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1315
01:37:59,464 --> 01:38:03,305
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

1316
01:38:04,233 --> 01:38:05,705
You can't do it from here.

1317
01:38:05,801 --> 01:38:08,105
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1318
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:09,801
I could just... I got the radio...

1319
01:38:09,865 --> 01:38:13,226
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1320
01:38:13,322 --> 01:38:15,018
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1321
01:38:15,113 --> 01:38:17,002
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1322
01:38:17,066 --> 01:38:18,826
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1323
01:38:18,922 --> 01:38:21,386
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1324
01:38:21,482 --> 01:38:23,083
You have to go wider.

1325
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:28,042
- I need authorisation.
- How about the United States government?

1326
01:38:28,107 --> 01:38:30,123
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

1327
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:37,740
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1328
01:38:37,836 --> 01:38:40,076
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

1329
01:38:40,172 --> 01:38:44,876
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1330
01:38:44,972 --> 01:38:46,029
Are you crazy?!

1331
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:48,685
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

1332
01:38:48,749 --> 01:38:51,725
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

1333
01:38:51,789 --> 01:38:54,062
Shut it down now.

1334
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:59,406
Emergency lighting activated.

1335
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:02,670
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1336
01:39:02,766 --> 01:39:04,238
Ask the FBI.

1337
01:39:04,334 --> 01:39:06,958
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

1338
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:09,359
and they're running it step by step.

1339
01:39:11,406 --> 01:39:13,231
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1340
01:39:14,959 --> 01:39:16,303
Yes!

1341
01:39:38,225 --> 01:39:39,633
Merry Christmas.

1342
01:39:41,106 --> 01:39:44,145
They must be pissing in their pants.

1343
01:39:44,242 --> 01:39:46,034
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

1344
01:39:52,754 --> 01:39:54,035
Whoo!

1345
01:40:06,483 --> 01:40:08,659
What are we gonna do now?

1346
01:40:08,724 --> 01:40:11,604
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1347
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:13,396
We've shut them down.

1348
01:40:13,492 --> 01:40:16,756
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

1349
01:40:16,852 --> 01:40:18,964
Right up the ass.

1350
01:40:21,461 --> 01:40:22,933
This is Agent Johnson.

1351
01:40:22,997 --> 01:40:24,341
No, the other one.

1352
01:40:24,405 --> 01:40:27,573
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

1353
01:40:27,637 --> 01:40:30,966
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1354
01:40:36,662 --> 01:40:38,486
Oh, yes!

1355
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:42,455
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1356
01:40:44,919 --> 01:40:46,967
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1357
01:40:47,063 --> 01:40:51,319
The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.

1358
01:40:51,415 --> 01:40:53,943
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1359
01:40:54,008 --> 01:40:55,288
I hear you. We'll be ready.

1360
01:40:55,351 --> 01:40:58,584
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1361
01:40:58,648 --> 01:41:00,440
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1362
01:41:00,536 --> 01:41:02,200
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1363
01:41:02,296 --> 01:41:05,112
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

1364
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:08,217
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

1365
01:41:12,889 --> 01:41:14,329
Ah! Jeez!

1366
01:41:14,394 --> 01:41:15,417
Powell?

1367
01:41:16,217 --> 01:41:17,978
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1368
01:41:19,642 --> 01:41:21,274
I'm here, John.

1369
01:41:22,938 --> 01:41:25,850
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1370
01:41:26,426 --> 01:41:28,283
I want you to do something for me.

1371
01:41:28,379 --> 01:41:29,562
Um... ahem...

1372
01:41:31,035 --> 01:41:32,443
I want you to find my wife.

1373
01:41:32,538 --> 01:41:34,812
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

1374
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:38,140
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1375
01:41:39,675 --> 01:41:41,276
I want you to tell her that...

1376
01:41:47,932 --> 01:41:50,492
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

1377
01:41:50,588 --> 01:41:52,445
what a jerk I've been

1378
01:41:53,116 --> 01:41:54,333
but, um...

1379
01:41:55,933 --> 01:41:56,893
that...

1380
01:42:00,605 --> 01:42:03,229
that when things started
to pan out for her

1381
01:42:03,294 --> 01:42:07,166
I should have been more supportive.

1382
01:42:07,614 --> 01:42:08,446
And, uh...

1383
01:42:09,886 --> 01:42:12,703
I just should have been
behind her more.

1384
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,575
Oh, shit.

1385
01:42:19,135 --> 01:42:21,152
Tell her that, um

1386
01:42:22,015 --> 01:42:26,400
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1387
01:42:28,256 --> 01:42:31,584
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1388
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:35,968
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

1389
01:42:36,576 --> 01:42:42,529
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

1390
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:44,865
OK?

1391
01:42:45,761 --> 01:42:46,881
You got that, man?

1392
01:42:46,977 --> 01:42:49,186
Yeah, I got it, John.

1393
01:42:50,434 --> 01:42:52,066
But you can tell her that yourself.

1394
01:42:52,129 --> 01:42:56,482
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

1395
01:42:56,994 --> 01:42:59,491
I guess that's up to the man upstairs.

1396
01:43:02,755 --> 01:43:04,162
John?

1397
01:43:04,963 --> 01:43:06,371
John?

1398
01:43:06,819 --> 01:43:10,212
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

1399
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,772
John?

1400
01:43:12,868 --> 01:43:15,844
No, Al, listen.
Just lay off for a while.

1401
01:43:17,764 --> 01:43:20,421
I gotta go check on something.

1402
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:25,509
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

1403
01:43:25,573 --> 01:43:27,365
One minute to speak to them.

1404
01:43:27,461 --> 01:43:29,413
All right. Get back. Get back.

1405
01:43:29,509 --> 01:43:31,781
All right, look.

1406
01:43:31,846 --> 01:43:35,845
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

1407
01:43:38,342 --> 01:43:40,582
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

1408
01:43:40,646 --> 01:43:42,694
to speak to their parents.

1409
01:43:44,294 --> 01:43:45,383
All right?

1410
01:43:45,702 --> 01:43:47,751
All right. Come on. Come on.

1411
01:43:57,416 --> 01:43:58,728
What were you doing, Hans?

1412
01:43:59,495 --> 01:44:00,936
What were you doing?

1413
01:44:22,378 --> 01:44:25,482
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1414
01:44:28,747 --> 01:44:31,275
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

1415
01:44:31,338 --> 01:44:32,906
The roof is wired to...

1416
01:44:35,499 --> 01:44:36,491
John?

1417
01:44:38,795 --> 01:44:40,268
John!

1418
01:44:40,587 --> 01:44:41,867
John, come in!

1419
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:43,403
Did you get that?

1420
01:44:43,467 --> 01:44:46,347
Something about a double-cross.

1421
01:44:46,443 --> 01:44:48,652
Tell me about it.

1422
01:44:54,124 --> 01:44:56,269
We are both professionals.

1423
01:44:58,316 --> 01:44:59,917
This is personal.

1424
01:45:01,229 --> 01:45:02,541
Aww...

1425
01:45:22,543 --> 01:45:24,879
They're coming!

1426
01:45:25,391 --> 01:45:26,991
Choppers are coming.

1427
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,480
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1428
01:45:30,544 --> 01:45:34,480
Your mom and dad
are very important people.

1429
01:45:34,543 --> 01:45:36,432
They're very brave people.

1430
01:45:36,528 --> 01:45:40,368
Is there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?

1431
01:45:40,432 --> 01:45:43,473
Come home.

1432
01:45:51,601 --> 01:45:52,882
Mrs McClane.

1433
01:45:55,986 --> 01:45:59,186
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1434
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:04,210
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1435
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:06,834
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1436
01:46:32,725 --> 01:46:35,605
You should have heard
your brother squeal

1437
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:38,710
when I broke his fucking neck!

1438
01:46:41,846 --> 01:46:44,118
What do you figure the breakage?

1439
01:46:44,182 --> 01:46:46,262
I figure we take out the terrorists,

1440
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:49,206
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.

1441
01:46:49,942 --> 01:46:52,278
I can live with that.

1442
01:46:52,374 --> 01:46:53,686
Get this thing on the deck.

1443
01:46:53,751 --> 01:46:57,079
They're expecting transports,
not gunships.

1444
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,360
Move it! Come on! Move!

1445
01:47:10,456 --> 01:47:11,961
Come on! Come on!

1446
01:47:12,024 --> 01:47:13,240
Move it!

1447
01:47:14,393 --> 01:47:15,609
Go! Move!

1448
01:47:19,321 --> 01:47:20,249
Theo.

1449
01:47:20,762 --> 01:47:22,297
A little bonus for us.

1450
01:47:22,361 --> 01:47:24,281
Please, sit down. Sit down!

1451
01:47:24,346 --> 01:47:26,970
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1452
01:47:27,033 --> 01:47:29,434
McClane, I have some news for you.

1453
01:47:30,426 --> 01:47:31,674
McClane?

1454
01:47:42,683 --> 01:47:43,931
Move!

1455
01:47:46,491 --> 01:47:47,195
Come on!

1456
01:47:59,517 --> 01:48:01,725
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

1457
01:48:05,501 --> 01:48:06,525
Armed.

1458
01:48:06,973 --> 01:48:08,925
- The truck?
- The truck.

1459
01:48:15,806 --> 01:48:19,679
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

1460
01:48:19,774 --> 01:48:22,047
you're nothing but a common thief.

1461
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:24,638
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

1462
01:48:24,735 --> 01:48:26,239
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

1463
01:48:26,335 --> 01:48:28,255
you should be more polite.

1464
01:48:35,007 --> 01:48:37,056
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

1465
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,448
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

1466
01:49:02,146 --> 01:49:04,130
I don't like this, Sarge.

1467
01:49:11,523 --> 01:49:17,219
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

1468
01:49:18,691 --> 01:49:21,443
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

1469
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:49,606
Where's Holly?

1470
01:49:49,702 --> 01:49:51,110
Where's Holly Gennero?

1471
01:49:51,174 --> 01:49:53,223
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

1472
01:49:53,286 --> 01:49:55,046
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1473
01:49:55,143 --> 01:49:56,518
- They took her!
- Where?

1474
01:49:56,614 --> 01:49:57,767
The vault!

1475
01:49:57,863 --> 01:49:59,687
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

1476
01:49:59,783 --> 01:50:01,607
They just took her!

1477
01:50:01,831 --> 01:50:02,887
Get downstairs!

1478
01:50:02,983 --> 01:50:05,383
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1479
01:50:05,448 --> 01:50:06,983
Get down!

1480
01:50:07,048 --> 01:50:09,544
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1481
01:50:11,656 --> 01:50:14,408
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

1482
01:50:14,504 --> 01:50:16,136
Break left!

1483
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:23,753
Nail that sucker!

1484
01:50:31,529 --> 01:50:34,474
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1485
01:50:34,538 --> 01:50:37,546
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1486
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,420
What the fuck...

1487
01:50:59,308 --> 01:51:02,060
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

1488
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:04,909
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1489
01:51:14,509 --> 01:51:17,773
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1490
01:51:17,869 --> 01:51:19,950
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1491
01:51:20,014 --> 01:51:21,390
Blow the roof!

1492
01:51:24,494 --> 01:51:27,278
I promise I will never even think

1493
01:51:27,342 --> 01:51:30,223
about going up
in a tall building again.

1494
01:51:33,423 --> 01:51:35,663
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

1495
01:53:03,543 --> 01:53:05,943
Holy Christ!

1496
01:53:07,063 --> 01:53:09,592
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

1497
01:53:21,848 --> 01:53:23,544
Jesus fucking Christ!

1498
01:53:24,473 --> 01:53:25,561
Fuck!

1499
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:51,386
What the fuck is going on?

1500
01:53:53,211 --> 01:53:56,636
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

1501
01:54:04,636 --> 01:54:05,468
Shit!

1502
01:54:05,564 --> 01:54:07,356
All right!

1503
01:54:08,765 --> 01:54:09,917
Hey! Hey!

1504
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:12,573
Hang on, baby.

1505
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:14,141
Hang on, honey.

1506
01:54:15,165 --> 01:54:16,157
Oh, God.

1507
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:01,089
Hans!

1508
01:55:15,011 --> 01:55:16,675
Jesus.

1509
01:55:16,771 --> 01:55:19,874
Hi, honey.

1510
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,876
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

1511
01:55:44,325 --> 01:55:45,477
Put down the gun.

1512
01:55:47,109 --> 01:55:49,317
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1513
01:55:49,413 --> 01:55:52,325
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1514
01:55:52,421 --> 01:55:55,301
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

1515
01:55:55,366 --> 01:55:57,574
unless they think
you're already dead.

1516
01:55:57,638 --> 01:55:59,686
Put down the gun.

1517
01:56:09,735 --> 01:56:11,335
Nein. This is mine.

1518
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:16,200
You got me.

1519
01:56:16,296 --> 01:56:18,951
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

1520
01:56:19,047 --> 01:56:20,648
Americans... all alike.

1521
01:56:20,712 --> 01:56:24,520
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1522
01:56:24,616 --> 01:56:26,376
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

1523
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:28,169
Enough jokes.

1524
01:56:28,265 --> 01:56:31,017
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

1525
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:35,562
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

1526
01:56:35,657 --> 01:56:39,242
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1527
01:56:59,531 --> 01:56:59,979
Holly!

1528
01:57:05,836 --> 01:57:07,308
Happy trails, Hans.

1529
01:57:12,557 --> 01:57:14,125
- Aah!
- Holly.

1530
01:57:50,128 --> 01:57:51,920
I hope that's not a hostage.

1531
01:58:19,186 --> 01:58:23,026
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

1532
01:58:26,546 --> 01:58:28,115
Over here. It's a better angle.

1533
01:58:28,179 --> 01:58:30,035
Let's give them a hand.

1534
01:58:32,563 --> 01:58:35,508
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

1535
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:43,828
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

1536
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:09,814
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1537
01:59:54,138 --> 01:59:55,834
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1538
01:59:55,898 --> 01:59:57,754
Holly Gennero.

1539
01:59:58,459 --> 02:00:00,155
Holly McClane.

1540
02:00:00,219 --> 02:00:01,819
Hello, Holly.

1541
02:00:01,915 --> 02:00:03,771
You got yourself a good man.

1542
02:00:03,868 --> 02:00:05,788
You take good care of him.

1543
02:00:06,428 --> 02:00:07,867
McClane!

1544
02:00:07,963 --> 02:00:10,556
McClane, I want a debriefing!

1545
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:13,180
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

1546
02:00:13,276 --> 02:00:14,940
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

1547
02:00:15,036 --> 02:00:18,621
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

1548
02:00:57,344 --> 02:01:00,320
Two of you go inside
and see if there's anybody else!

1549
02:01:10,625 --> 02:01:13,121
No. This one's with me.

1550
02:01:22,626 --> 02:01:24,194
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

1551
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:26,723
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

1552
02:01:26,787 --> 02:01:28,674
what are your feelings?

1553
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:35,076
Well, well, well.

1554
02:01:35,139 --> 02:01:39,235
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1555
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:43,620
Did you get that?

1556
02:01:43,716 --> 02:01:45,636
Let me through.

1557
02:01:46,116 --> 02:01:49,508
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
