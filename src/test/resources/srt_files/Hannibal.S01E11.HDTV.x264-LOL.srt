1
00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:01,767
<i>Previously on Hannibal</i>

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:05,596
You're quite the topic of conversation
in the psychiatric circles.

3
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:08,169
The reason you failed to
capture the Chesapeake Ripper

4
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:10,242
is I already had him.
I did it.

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,562
Miriam Lass is dead. The Chesapeake Ripper
is making it very clear that someone is

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,415
plagiarizing his work.
Is it possible you

7
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,068
inadvertently planted
the suggestion in Gideon's mind

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,338
that the was the Ripper?
Psychic driving is unethical.

9
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:25,308
I have feelings for you.
I can't just have an affair with you.

10
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:26,156
Why?

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,330
I think you're unstable.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,359
You're the subject of a lot
of speculation at the Bureau.

13
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,464
Jack pushed you right up to the edge
and now you're pushing yourself over.

14
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,851
(Jack): What happened in there?
I saw the look on your face.

15
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:39,355
You must overcome these delusions
that are disguising your reality.

16
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,924
It's anti-nmda receptor
encephalitis.

17
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,394
Now that we have confirmed what it is,
it'll be easier to hide from him.

18
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:51,116
Someone who already doubts
their own identity

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,435
can be more susceptible
to manipulation.

20
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,771
Dr. Gideon is a psychopath.

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,107
Psychopaths are narcissists.
They rarely doubt who they are.

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,778
I tried to appeal
to his narcissism.

23
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,631
By convincing him
he was the Chesapeake Ripper.

24
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,396
If only I had been more curious
about the common mind.

25
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:17,326
I have no interest in understanding
sheep; only eating them.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,014
Kudal. A South Indian curry.

27
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,433
Made from sheep, of course.

28
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,519
In a coconut-coriander-
chili sauce.

29
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,825
It feels like a last supper.

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,829
You're not the only psychiatrist accused
by a patient of making them kill.

31
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,748
Poke around a psychopath's mind,

32
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:43,168
bound to get poked back.

33
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,489
What would you do
in my position?

34
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,426
Deny everything.

35
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:55,514
I thought psychic driving would have
been more effective in breaking down

36
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,001
his personality. Psychic driving
fails because its methods are

37
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:03,222
too obvious. You were trying too
hard, Frederick. If force is used,

38
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,842
the subject will only surrender temporarily.
Once a patient is exposed

39
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,895
to the method of manipulation,
it becomes much less effective.

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,231
When Dr. Gideon began

41
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:15,784
- to suspect he was being pushed...
- He pushed back.

42
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,071
The subject mustn't be aware
of any influence.

43
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:21,123
(Insects chirping)

44
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,462
(Breathing rapidly)

45
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,495
(Startled shouting)

46
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,666
(Catching his breath)

47
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,313
So, you get to
dress up and I don't?

48
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,315
This might affect how well

49
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,634
my testimony goes over
with the judge.

50
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,904
- Testimony speaks for itself.
- Frederick, don't look so worried.

51
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,108
- I forgive you your trespasses.
- What trespasses are those?

52
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,360
You made me kill the nurse.

53
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:24,246
I take responsibility for
killing my wife and her family.

54
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,314
- The nurse is your fault.
- I cannot

55
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,650
accept responsibility
for your actions, Abel.

56
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,820
<i>Au contraire.</i>
<i>It's why I'm suing you.</i>

57
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,790
You made me think I was
somebody else,

58
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,792
and now...

59
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:39,190
who knows what I'm thinking?

60
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,590
Dr. Gideon, you told me you
were the Chesapeake Ripper.

61
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,208
Dr. Chilton, you told me
I was the Chesapeake Ripper,

62
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,686
and that's what I'm
going to tell everyone.

63
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,307
See you in court.

64
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,166
You married?

65
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,804
You married?

66
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,757
You're married.

67
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,927
How long you married?

68
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,646
That long?

69
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,769
Regarding divorce...
not that you're getting one;

70
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:42,958
just I can see the clock
in your eyes...

71
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:44,943
Word of advice:

72
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:48,447
it's easier just to kill 'em.

73
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,782
Kill 'em, kill everyone
at the table.

74
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,885
Less paperwork.

75
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,421
Worked for me.
I'm doing ok.

76
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,075
Your wife is
probably fantastic.

77
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,961
My wife? Horrible.

78
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,264
So maybe I'm not supposed
to be in a relationship.

79
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,798
There's people like that.

80
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,587
How do you keep those whites
so clean? That's...

81
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,439
always amazes me.

So, does Abel Gideon

00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,912
the Chesapeake Ripper?

92
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,098
Abel Gideon is having

93
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:13,684
a difference of opinion
about who he is.

94
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:35,205
The man who escaped

95
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:38,375
from that van was not
in the same state of mind

96
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:41,128
when he did this.

97
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:43,380
He took a uniform,
police radio,

98
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,717
two 9mm handguns, pepper spray,
taser, and handcuffs.

99
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:49,219
Well, it's what he didn't take.

100
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,721
(Bev): He hung the organs

101
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,723
from the branch with vein
from the victims.

102
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:54,725
He even tied little bows
with some of them.

103
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,727
Yeah, it's really impressive.

104
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:00,197
The Chesapeake Ripper would
not have left the organs behind.

105
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,984
Well, if Gideon isn't
the Chesapeake Ripper,

106
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,869
he's certainly trying
to get his attention.

107
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,688
Local PD picked up
a foot trail leading

108
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,958
out of the woods. Boot soles are
consistent with the ones

109
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:12,943
- we found at the crime scene.
- How fresh are the tracks?

110
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,695
- Two, three hours old.
- Which direction they headed?

111
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:17,798
Back to Baltimore.

112
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,967
(Jack sighs.)

113
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,239
(Door opening)

114
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,942
I suppose this is
my fault too?

115
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,947
You did dodge a bullet.

116
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,449
Gideon's escape
foregoes a trial

117
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:38,536
and a very public humiliation
for you.

118
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,172
And now you are hosting
a private one.

119
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,174
Next you'll be accusing me

120
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,509
- of arranging his escape.
- No one's making

121
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,878
- that accusation.
- If we're tossing around

122
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,431
the blame, Dr. Bloom,
you're due your fair share.

123
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,934
You planted the idea that I was
unethically manipulating Gideon.

124
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,936
Well, according to Gideon,
you were.

125
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:59,056
- After you told him I was.
- You thought I was manipulating

126
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,675
him? He was manipulating you.

127
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,995
- You were pushing him.
- He gave me informed consent to treat him,

128
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,617
said that he was grateful
for my help

129
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,236
- in understanding who he is.
- What did you help him

130
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,689
- understand?
- He was not insane

131
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,375
when he killed his wife;
killing her drove him insane.

132
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,128
I did not convince him
that he was a serial killer;

133
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,431
I just reminded him of the fact.

134
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,916
Gideon is not
the Chesapeake Ripper,

135
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:29,253
although he might have thought
he was under your care, doctor.

136
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,572
Whether he is or he isn't
doesn't really matter

137
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,475
right now. If he thinks he is
or even if he's confused

138
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:37,478
- on that issue, he will kill again.
- I hope he does not,

139
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:40,064
I mean for your sake.
Cannot imagine

140
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:43,067
how you would sleep
with that on your shoulders.

141
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:47,238
(Chilton's voice distant) During those
three minutes, Gideon did horrible things.

142
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,406
How did you sleep
when Gideon killed your nurse?

143
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,393
What does Gideon want?

144
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,163
The last thing Abel Gideon
said to me is that he intends

145
00:11:56,198 --> 00:12:00,000
to tell everyone that he is
the Chesapeake Ripper.

146
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,406
Our fugitive is Abel Gideon.
Transplant surgeon.

147
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:07,958
Convicted in the first degree

148
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,011
in the murders of his wife
and her family.

149
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:14,832
Institutionalized at the Baltimore State
Hospital for the Criminally Insane,

150
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,251
where he killed a nurse
and claimed to be

151
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,253
the Chesapeake Ripper.
(Jack's voice becoming distant)

152
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,256
Dr. Gideon escaped this morning
after killing three people.

153
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,425
He is armed and dangerous. He is
believed to be...

154
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:27,528
(Jack's voice echoing)
In the first degree

155
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:31,598
in the murders of his wife and
her family. Institutionalized

156
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:37,371
at the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.

157
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:38,873
Insane.

158
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:41,458
(Jack's voice distant)
Escaped this morning.

159
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:45,713
He is armed, he is dangerous...
you escaped this morning.

160
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:47,665
He escaped this morning.
He is armed and he is

161
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,384
extremely dangerous.
You escaped this morning.

162
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:53,971
Institutionalized at the Baltimore State...
(Cacophony of Jack's voice)

163
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:57,374
What kind of crazy are you?!

164
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,512
You kill! You will kill again!
(Jack's voice echoing)

165
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,144
(Jack speaking indistinctly)

166
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,364
(People murmuring quietly)

167
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,406
Hannibal:
<i>What did you see?</i>

168
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,273
A thicket of antlers.

169
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:40,229
All I heard was my heart,

170
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:44,483
dim but... but fast,

171
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:47,886
like, um... footsteps

172
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,939
fleeing into silence.

173
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:56,629
I don't know how to gauge
who I am anymore.

174
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:59,081
I don't feel like myself.

175
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,417
I feel like I have been

176
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:04,637
gradually becoming different
for a while.

177
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,890
I just feel like somebody else.

178
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:10,376
What do you feel like?

179
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,698
I feel crazy.

180
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:18,701
(Will breathing shakily)

181
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,053
And that is what
you fear most.

182
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,058
I fear not knowing who I am.

183
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,068
That's what Abel Gideon's
afraid of, isn't it?

184
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,905
He's like a blind man.

185
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:45,327
Somebody got inside his head
and...

186
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,947
moved all the
furniture around.

187
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:51,517
I imagine Abel Gideon would
want to find

188
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:54,837
the Chesapeake Ripper
to gauge who he is.

189
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:57,056
And who he isn't.

190
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,091
Will.

191
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,114
You have me as your gauge.

192
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,390
<i>Gideon didn't leave</i>

193
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,892
a manifesto. We confiscated
all correspondence

194
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,795
from his outside admirers. We're
going through everything now.

195
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:19,793
Good.

196
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:23,582
Any secret communiqués or coded
messages written in bodily fluids

197
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,868
or anything else,
we'll find them.

198
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:27,569
You won't find anything.

199
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,321
Whatever's going on

200
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:30,839
with Gideon, it's in his head.

201
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:33,092
Well, there's not much left
in these heads.

202
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:37,012
All organ removal was done postmortem,
including the transorbital lobotomies.

203
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:39,581
It wasn't technically
a lobotomy.

204
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:42,518
He didn't remove any of the
brain; He just scrambled them.

205
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:45,554
Went in through the top
of the eye socket...

206
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,455
(Jack): Ok, ok.
Tell me something.

207
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,825
Why remove
all of the other organs

208
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,628
from the bodies
and leave them intact

209
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,613
and just scramble
the brains?

210
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:14,717
That's what they did to him.

211
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,785
What who did to him?

212
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:19,755
Dr. Chilton, every
psychiatrist and PhD candidate

213
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,757
who attempted any kind
of therapy,

214
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,726
pushed and prodded,
gave him tests, told him

215
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,227
who he was, who he wasn't.

216
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,796
All right. I want a list
of every therapist,

217
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:30,566
every doctor, any kind
of psychiatric professional

218
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,068
that worked with or talked to
Dr. Gideon.

219
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,239
Alana Bloom will be
on that list.

220
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,532
Are you my protective custody?

221
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,316
You heard?

222
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:52,037
I heard I get an armed escort
until Gideon's apprehended.

223
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,039
You'll have a real FBI agent,

224
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:56,658
not a teacher
with a temporary badge.

225
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,660
Too bad.

226
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:03,048
Would have been fun to cozy up with
your dogs in front of a space heater.

227
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:07,019
You don't need protective
custody to cozy up with my dogs.

228
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:10,973
Or me, for that matter.

229
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:16,445
Just need a little more, um...

230
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:19,698
stability on my part.

231
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,542
You're really warm.

232
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,578
Yeah, I tend to run hot.

233
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:38,867
They say stress raises
body temperature.

234
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:41,804
Maybe you should take
an aspirin.

235
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:44,790
Way ahead of you.

236
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:48,610
They're gonna kill Gideon,
aren't they?

237
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:56,535
Whatever happens to him has
nothing to do

238
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:58,403
- with you.
- Gideon can't be

239
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:00,472
completely responsible
for his actions

240
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,725
if he was subjected
to an outside influence.

241
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,111
What, like Chilton telling him
he's the Chesapeake Ripper?

242
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:09,498
Like me

243
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,584
telling him he's not in a state
of mind to know who he is.

244
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:18,006
Well, he's gonna want somebody to tell
him who he is, and I think he'll be

245
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,959
looking for the Ripper
to do that.

246
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:29,685
What do you think will happen if
Gideon finds the Chesapeake Ripper?

247
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,870
The Chesapeake Ripper will
kill him.

248
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,692
He took credit for his work.

249
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:40,546
The Ripper would
consider that rude.

250
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,652
(Cell phone ringtone)

251
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,862
Freddie Lounds.

252
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:59,948
Gideon: <i>My name is Paul
Carruthers. I'm a psychiatrist.</i>

253
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,301
<i>I read your article
on Abel Gideon.</i>

254
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:04,703
And I yours, Dr. Carruthers.

255
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,722
<i>So you're aware of my work?</i>

256
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:08,724
I found your paper

257
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:11,727
on narcissistic
personality disorder insightful,

258
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:14,897
especially as it pertains
to your opinions of Abel Gideon.

259
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:18,150
<i>Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you.</i>

260
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,152
You're calling
about his escape?

261
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:23,322
<i>Well, yes. I'd like
to collaborate</i>

262
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:26,491
<i>On an article for the "Journal
of Abnormal Psychology".</i>

263
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,877
You want a writing partner?

264
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:30,913
<i>Could we meet?</i>

265
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,052
Hello?

266
00:19:56,222 --> 00:19:58,390
Dr. Carruthers?

267
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:02,060
Ms. Lounds, come on in.

268
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,201
Now, you wrote
in your tattler archive

269
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,370
that the Chesapeake Ripper
once removed a man's tongue

270
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,905
and used it as a bookmark
for his Bible.

271
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:17,242
They call this
a Colombian neck tie.

272
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,746
What do you think?

273
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,249
Ee...

274
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:36,978
Dr. Paul Carruthers wrote an article for
the <i>Journal of Criminal Psychology</i> in which

275
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:40,648
he described Dr. Gideon
as being a pathological narcissist

276
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:42,346
who suffers from
psychotic episodes.

277
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,820
Let's hope he got some satisfaction
from being proved right.

278
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:49,307
I think this is about more than
just getting the Chesapeake

279
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,309
- Ripper's attention.
- Gideon's mind was

280
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,328
dissected by psychiatrists

281
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:57,532
and, as a surgeon, he is
applying his own skill set.

282
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:02,253
He gave you something better to
do with your tongue than wag it.

283
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:04,506
No, that's not how he died.

284
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,359
Drained him
till his heart stopped.

285
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:09,461
Got a little on his collar.
Other than that,

286
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,213
- didn't spill a drop.
- That's because it's all in here.

287
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,382
Four-and-a-half liters
all packed in ice.

288
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,521
"Please deliver
to the Red Cross."

289
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:22,557
- (Bev): That's considerate.
- He's peacocking for the Ripper.

290
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:25,810
This is like flowers and
chocolate before a first date.

291
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:43,711
How is this news already?

292
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:46,975
Somebody from the Baltimore PD must've
taken a picture with their phone and sold it

293
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:48,709
- to Tattlecrime.
- The photo was taken

294
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:52,787
before the blood was put on ice.
Dr. Gideon was still here.

295
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:57,258
He has Freddie Lounds.

296
00:21:57,293 --> 00:22:00,395
You might be working out
the emergency exits,

297
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,680
or at least considering them.

298
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:05,049
Let me just tell you
there are three.

299
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:08,937
They're all terribly
locked down.

300
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:12,607
Now, this relationship
between you and me,

301
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:15,243
this can do us both some good.

302
00:22:15,277 --> 00:22:17,445
I could write
a big story on you,

303
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,048
anything you want to say.

304
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:25,587
I did enjoy the article
you wrote about that poor nurse

305
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,589
who I killed,

306
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:30,592
but it didn't really seem
like genuine Freddie Lounds.

307
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,761
- Jack Crawford told me to write it.
- Of course he did.

308
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:37,829
- To flush out the Chesapeake Ripper.
- And flushed out he was.

309
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:42,103
That's why he waved
Jack Crawford's

310
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:44,105
dead trainee's arm
around his head

311
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,692
right here like a flag
in this very room.

312
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:50,361
Aren't you
the Chesapeake Ripper?

313
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:54,866
Miss Lounds, I might be
slightly fuzzy in this area,

314
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,199
but there's no need
to patronize me.

315
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:00,238
I'm sorry.

316
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:07,445
It's like remembering
something from your childhood,

317
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:09,947
and you're not sure

318
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:13,618
if it's your memory
or a friend's memory,

319
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:18,306
and then you realize sadly it's
just some photo in an old book.

320
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,461
You're waiting

321
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,047
for the Chesapeake Ripper
to come back here.

322
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:30,301
Let's hope he
gets the invitation.

323
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,571
There's one thing we know
about your writing:

324
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:36,441
he is an avid fan.

325
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,525
Dr. Carson Nahn.

326
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:56,244
He's the psychiatric attending
at Western General.

327
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:58,646
He interviewed Dr. Gideon

328
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:01,925
for the same psychopathy survey
I participated in two years ago.

329
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:04,552
Total frenectomy,
webbing under the tongue;

330
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:08,389
even the connective tissue all the way into
the throat is cut free and pulled through

331
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:11,109
for the, uh, desired effect.

332
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:12,610
(Jack sighs.)

333
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,596
Still no word
from Dr. Chilton?

334
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,898
He hasn't answered his phone
since yesterday,

335
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:18,616
didn't show up to work today.

336
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,618
Gideon wants
to lure the Ripper.

337
00:24:20,653 --> 00:24:24,522
He's going to offer up the man who
disrespected both their identities.

338
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,692
Every detail
of Dr. Carruthers' murder

339
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:30,461
as described meticulously
in Freddie Lounds' article

340
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:33,531
has been faithfully
reproduced except...

341
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,617
for one.

342
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:40,371
What's different about Carson?
Why amputate his arm?

343
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,890
(Jack): Did Freddie write
anything about this?

344
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:45,059
(Brian): Not that I know of,
no.

345
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:47,395
Abel Gideon didn't kill
this man;

346
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:49,564
the Chesapeake Ripper did.

347
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,733
You said the Chesapeake Ripper

348
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:56,237
would want to kill Gideon
for taking credit for his work.

349
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:58,573
Gideon isn't alone anymore,

350
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:02,527
and the Ripper isn't going
to risk exposure,

351
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:06,114
so, no, he's...
he's, um...

352
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:09,834
He's telling us
where to catch him.

353
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:14,255
Actually, he's telling you.

354
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,658
Me?

355
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:19,377
Where's the last place
you saw a severed arm, Jack?

356
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:31,222
With experience, I have found

357
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:33,958
surgeries are best performed
on a local anesthetic

358
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:37,729
or epidural
with the patient awake.

359
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:41,733
Reminds me there' a real person
here entrusting me with their life

360
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,435
rather than a lump of meat
that I'm about to reorganize.

361
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:47,104
And in this instance,

362
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:49,607
I would like to see the look
on your face.

363
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,660
Please... you're not
the Chesapeake Ripper.

364
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:55,079
You got inside my mind,
Frederick.

365
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:58,916
It's only fair
I get inside your belly.

366
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,252
This is of course
Freddie Lounds, who you know.

367
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:02,965
She will be assisting me today...
or assisting you...

368
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,955
by manually pumping the ventilator

369
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,859
should you stop breathing.

370
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:09,627
Oh, my God.

371
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:21,022
The real Chesapeake Ripper is
a collector

372
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,024
of surgical trophies.

373
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:25,393
I'm gonna leave him
a little gift.

374
00:26:25,427 --> 00:26:27,912
In fact, I'm gonna leave him
a gift basket.

375
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:54,389
You know, it is truly amazing

376
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,776
how many organs the body can offer up
before it really begins to suffer.

377
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,536
All right, stay awake now!
Come on, Frederick.

378
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,739
I'm gonna ask you
to hold a few things.

379
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:16,911
Hmm. What next?

380
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:27,219
(Jack):
I want you to wait outside.

381
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,335
That's probably best.

382
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:34,200
You look like hell, Will.

383
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:36,975
I feel like hell.

384
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,644
Actually, no, I feel...

385
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:42,147
Uh, fluid,

386
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:45,167
like I'm spilling.

387
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:49,588
Must have come down
with something.

388
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:52,657
I hope it's not contagious.

389
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:57,162
(Jack's voice distant)
This work that we do...

390
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,766
(Jack's voice normal) ...It will compromise
your immune system, if you allow it.

391
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,002
You've got to keep things in perspective.
You've got to keep yourself in perspective.

392
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,605
Well, myself is a little hazy
at the moment.

393
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,691
You've gotta start
taking better care of yourself.

394
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:13,395
- Build my resistance?
- You just can't take it all in.

395
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:18,850
You've got to let go
of as much of it as you can.

396
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:22,520
- You just gotta let go.
- You know, it's hard

397
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:26,325
to shake off something
that's already under your skin.

398
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:05,914
Mark.

399
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:47,623
Go!

400
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,105
- Clear.
- Clear.

401
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,856
No sign of Gideon.

402
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,698
Gideon's gone.

403
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:01,136
He's still alive.

404
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,122
I need medical in here now!

405
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:48,233
I was expecting
the Chesapeake Ripper.

406
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:53,105
Or are you he?

407
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:57,592
Turn around. Don't look at me.

408
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:07,219
You are looking a little peaky,

409
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:12,107
Mr. Graham,
if you don't mind my saying.

410
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:15,510
I may be crazy,
but you look ill.

411
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:18,747
Drive.

412
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,083
Who is your doctor?

413
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:33,445
I'm having a hard time
thinking.

414
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:36,064
(Will panting)

415
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:40,235
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I-I don't know what's real.

416
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,776
It's 7:27 pm.

417
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:50,716
You're in Baltimore, Maryland, and
your name is Will Graham.

418
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:51,744
No I don't care who I am!

419
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,366
Just tell me...

420
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,234
if he's real.

421
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,476
Who do you see, Will?

422
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:08,797
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

423
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:10,849
Who do you see?

424
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:18,756
I don't see anyone.

425
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,692
No, he's right there.

426
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:22,694
- There's no one there, Will.
- No, no, you're lying.

427
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:25,099
We're alone. You came here alone.
Do you remember coming here?

428
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:28,316
- No, please don't lie to me!
- Garret Jacob Hobbs is dead.

429
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,318
You killed him.
You watched him die.

430
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:33,288
- What's happening to me?
- Will,

431
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:35,957
Will, Will, you're having
an episode. I want you

432
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:39,661
to hand me over the gun. Will,
I want you to hand me your...

433
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:41,446
Will?

434
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:42,964
Will.

435
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:10,808
He's had a mild seizure.

436
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:14,613
That doesn't seem
to bother you.

437
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,433
I said it was mild.

438
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,509
Are you the man who claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper?

439
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:30,595
Why do you say "claimed"?

440
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,097
Because you're not.

441
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:33,582
You know you're not,

442
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:36,268
and you don't know much more
about who you are beyond that.

443
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:39,271
Are you the Ripper?

444
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:42,006
A terrible thing...

445
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:45,026
to have your identity taken
from you.

446
00:33:47,613 --> 00:33:49,564
Well, I'm taking it back,

447
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,067
one piece at a time.

448
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:55,704
You should see the pieces
I got out of my psychiatrist.

449
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:01,693
Alana Bloom was
one of your psychiatrists too.

450
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:03,395
Is that right?

451
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:07,215
Yes. Dr. Bloom.

452
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:14,773
I can tell you
where to find her.

453
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:28,728
(Hannibal):
Will can you hear me?

454
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:35,149
(Hannibal):
Repeat after me.

455
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:38,532
(Hannibal):
My name is Will Graham.

456
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:40,217
My name is Will Graham.

457
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:45,956
Raise both of your arms.

458
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,525
More.

459
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,528
More.

460
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:54,381
Good.

461
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:57,417
Although you may not feel
like it, I need you to smile.

462
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:09,062
Good. It wasn't a stroke.

463
00:35:09,096 --> 00:35:11,982
You may have had a seizure.

464
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,133
Tell me the last thing
you remember.

465
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,135
I...

466
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:18,655
(Will panting)

467
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,690
I was with Garret Jacob Hobbs.

468
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:28,832
You have a fever.

469
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:31,701
You were hallucinating.
You thought he was alive,

470
00:35:31,752 --> 00:35:34,588
- here in the room with you.
- I saw him.

471
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:37,657
He's a delusion
disguising reality.

472
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:41,378
Don't let that
let you slip away.

473
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:44,464
You killed
Garret Jacob Hobbs once.

474
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:46,016
You can find

475
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,051
a way to kill him again.

476
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:53,607
- Where are you going?
- Abel Gideon is still

477
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,775
at large.
He mutilated Dr. Chilton.

478
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,695
They found him
clinging to life.

479
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:00,864
I'm worried about Alana.

480
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:04,851
- Alana.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Will.

481
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,853
You're in no state to go

482
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:09,856
anywhere but the hospital.
I'll call Jack

483
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:11,825
and tell him where you are.

484
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:40,205
I have to make a phone call.
Can I ask you to step out?

485
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:22,145
I don't know if I will
ever be myself again.

486
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:25,949
I don't know if I've got
any "self" left over.

487
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:29,953
I spent so long thinking
I was him,

488
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:34,874
it's gotten really hard to remember
who I was when I wasn't him.

489
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:42,132
Who are you now?

490
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,218
Now I'm you.

491
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:49,506
We're both here,
looking at her,

492
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:53,727
just those kind of people that
shouldn't be in a relationship.

493
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:58,014
You and I are
already committed.

494
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:01,017
It's hard to be
with another person when you...

495
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:04,637
can't get out of
your own head.

496
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:07,357
I want to get out.

497
00:38:07,408 --> 00:38:09,359
Yeah, well,

498
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,828
we all want things
that we can't have.

499
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:15,832
But if I kill her

500
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:19,369
like he would kill her,
then maybe

501
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,206
I could understand him better.

502
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:27,927
I wonder if then you would finally
understand what you've become.

503
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:37,303
(Gunshot)

504
00:38:53,954 --> 00:38:56,573
They will be sewing up

505
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:58,575
Dr. Chilton until the morning...

506
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:00,460
That is, if he makes it
through the night.

507
00:39:00,494 --> 00:39:03,529
At least Will remains
in one piece...

508
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:05,381
for now.

509
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:11,888
His temperature is 105.

510
00:39:11,922 --> 00:39:14,591
White blood cell count is

511
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:18,728
twice normal, and they still can't
identify the source of his infection.

512
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:22,482
They will.

513
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:24,484
You seem confident.

514
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:27,103
I am.

515
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:30,273
Even with a temperature
of 105 degrees, Will was able

516
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:33,443
to bring Gideon down.
I told you, he'll be fine.

517
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:37,230
Jack...

518
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:40,934
I would recommend you suspend
his license to carry firearms.

519
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:43,448
You and I are just gonna have to
have a difference of opinion

520
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,252
about who Will is, doctor.

521
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:48,074
I know who Will is.

522
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,393
Will knows who he is.

523
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:52,345
Yes.

524
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:54,831
But our experiences shape us,
Jack.

525
00:39:57,434 --> 00:40:01,421
How is this experience going
to shape Will?

526
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:04,440
(Monitor beeping)
(Ventilator pumping)

527
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:27,997
(Birds singing)

528
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:35,054
Will Graham is troubled.

529
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:38,057
And that troubles you?

530
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:41,544
Beyond a professional concern
for a patient?

531
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:44,964
I see his madness
and I want to contain it,

532
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,966
like an oil spill.

533
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:50,103
Oil is valuable.

534
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:55,842
What value does Will Graham's
madness have for you?

535
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:59,562
You're suggesting I'm more fascinated
with the madness than the man?

536
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:01,397
Are you?

537
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:03,533
No.

538
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:10,907
He realized early on
that he saw things differently

539
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:14,677
than other people,
felt things differently.

540
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:17,680
So did you.

541
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:20,066
I see myself in Will.

542
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,852
Do you see yourself
in his madness?

543
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:27,840
Madness can be a medicine
for the modern world.

544
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:30,526
You take it in moderation,
it's beneficial.

545
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:33,930
You overdose and it can have
unfortunate side effects.

546
00:41:33,964 --> 00:41:37,450
Side effects can be temporary.
They can be a boost

547
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:39,869
to our psychological
immune systems to help fight

548
00:41:39,903 --> 00:41:42,622
the existential crises
of normal life.

549
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,208
Will Graham does not

550
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:47,744
present you with problems
from normal life.

551
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,066
No. He doesn't.

552
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,101
What does he present you with?

553
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:03,726
The opportunity for friendship.

554
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:06,579
He is still your patient,
Hannibal.

555
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:08,731
Where Will Graham
is concerned,

556
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:12,168
if you feel the impulse
to step forward,

557
00:42:12,202 --> 00:42:15,772
you must force yourself
to take a step back.

558
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:19,742
And just watch him
lose his mind?

559
00:42:19,777 --> 00:42:22,161
Sometimes all we can do
is watch.

560
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,901
