5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,045
Hello, priest.

Ragnar: Do you ever miss England?

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,383
- Athelstan: Sometimes.
Ragnar: Come with me.

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,684
We will need the help of all the gods,

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,719
<i>including yours.</i>

11
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,088
Siggy: Go and speak with your brother.

12
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,990
I ask only for the opportunity
to regain your respect.

13
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,992
Why should I ever trust you again?

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,394
Aslaug: I make this prophecy:
Your son will be born

15
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,529
with the image of the serpent in his eye.

16
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,899
I do not wish Jarl Borg to raid with us.

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,734
I thought we had an agreement?

18
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,535
Jarl Borg: Abandon your brother for good.

19
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,471
Oh! (Grunts in pain)

20
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,708
<i>Messenger: The Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.</i>

(Foliage crunching
underfoot, morning doves cry)

37
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:57,713
Ragnar: What is that place?

38
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,949
Athelstan: It's a
Christian church, a minster.

39
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,819
A large one. It may be Winchester.

40
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,988
Is it important?

41
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:09,725
If it is Winchester, Saint
Birinus is buried there.

42
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:11,760
It's a place of great pilgrimage.

43
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:13,929
And will there be treasure there?

44
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,950
(Chortles) Yes. A lot of treasure.

45
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,802
Floki: (Happy) Hmm!

46
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:25,039
(Grasses crunch underfoot)

47
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,215
<i>King Ecbert: There's no surprise to me</i>

48
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:36,184
that these Northmen have arrived in Wessex.

49
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:38,587
After I heard about their
raids into Northumbria,

50
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:41,127
I realized it was only a matter of time

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,124
before they came ashore here.

52
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,297
When I lived at the court
of the Emperor Charlemagne,

53
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,934
<i>these Northmen had already
emerged from their lairs</i>

54
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,502
<i>to attack parts of his empire.</i>

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,572
I was with Charlemagne's
party at a harbor town

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,574
<i>in Southern Gaul.</i>

57
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:03,176
<i>And as we sat eating supper</i>

58
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:06,113
<i>a fleet of pirates attacked the harbor.</i>

59
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,283
<i>There was some confusion
about their identity,</i>

60
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,817
but from the build of their ships

61
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,319
and their speed through the water,

62
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:16,623
the Emperor recognized
them at once as Northmen.

63
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,229
After a lightning attack...

64
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:24,898
(Sharp exhale)

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,201
<i>They made their escape.</i>

66
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,270
<i>The Emperor's men took up the chase,</i>

67
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:34,006
<i>but they were soon out-sailed.</i>

68
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:41,514
<i>And now it is our turn to
deal with these ruffians,</i>

69
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:43,849
these pagans.

70
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:49,021
<i>But deal with them we shall... </i>

71
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,524
And must.

72
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,195
Aethelwulf?

73
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:58,964
Yes, Father.

74
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,099
<i>King Ecbert: I put it in your hands</i>

75
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,301
to work with our
Ealdormen to raise an army.

76
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,069
In the meantime, we shall
send spies and others

77
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,205
to observe the size of the raiding party,

78
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:09,274
<i>and their intentions.</i>

79
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:12,043
These Northmen never like to
venture far from their ships

80
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:16,047
and they prefer not to be
drawn into pitched battle.

81
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:20,051
<i>Let us not be afraid, but rather watchful.</i>

82
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,227
(Retreating footsteps)

83
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,902
<i>(Bird cries out)</i>

84
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,850
<i>Sigvard: Lagertha!</i>

85
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:58,822
(Sheep bleat)

86
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,624
Why must I follow you up the fields?

87
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:04,027
You're my wife.

88
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,262
<i>You should be at my side,</i>

89
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,831
<i>especially when we have important guests.</i>

90
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,367
I will not stay to hear my son insulted.

91
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,402
<i>Sigvard: Your son should know his place.</i>

92
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,903
He continues to be resentful.

93
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:17,640
He refuses to accept or
acknowledge my love for him.

94
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,345
Lagertha: You don't love my son.

95
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,848
You don't love anyone, Sigvard.

96
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,649
You don't know how to.

97
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:30,219
(Hard slap) Aghhh!

98
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:39,395
Sigvard: Forgive me, Lagertha.
I'm an intemperate man.

99
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:50,839
I find it difficult to control myself.

100
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:54,810
But I have loved and
desired you after my fashion

101
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:58,346
and if your son will only meet me halfway,

102
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:01,283
I will make sure he has a good future.

103

00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:07,220
Bishop Swithern, a fine Christian.

329
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,594
King Ecbert: Praise be to God.

330
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,749
Lord Eadric: There are those
who ask why we did not do more

331
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,567
to protect our brothers and sisters

332
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,936
at such an important site.

333
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,739
Are there?

334
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,844
<i>My kingdom is very large.</i>

335
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:29,747
There are many important sites.

336
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:33,483
Could I protect all of them? No.

337
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:37,587
Did I want to discover where
the pagans would strike?

338
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:40,023
Yes.

339
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,025
For now I know where they are.

340
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,490
Bishop Edmund: So...

341
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:47,641
Bishop Swithern was a necessary sacrifice.

342
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,331
As a man of God,

343
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:53,537
I assumed he welcomed the
opportunity for martyrdom.

344
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:56,773
Or do you disagree?

345
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,289
<i>Bishop Edmund: Oh no, sire.</i>

346
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:00,677
All of the cloth would welcome martyrdom

347
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,511
in the cause of our faith,

348
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:04,747
service of our Lord Jesus Christ.

349
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:08,742
Good.

350
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:11,565
Because I'm going to offer you

351
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:14,994
precisely that same opportunity,

352
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,561
my Lord Bishop,

353
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:24,833
and, I trust, very soon.

354
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:35,844
(Nervous sigh)

355
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:39,314
Lord Eadric: (Sighs heavily)

356
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,249
(Water churns and splashes)

357
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:44,419
(Hammering)

358
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:54,629
<i>Warrior: Look at these, nice and strong.</i>

359
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:55,930
<i>Tight enough?</i>

360
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:58,733
I have something for you, Athelstan.

361
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:07,384
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

362
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:11,795
Are these not the images of your God?

363
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,283
I told you before, and
I will tell you again:

364
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:18,318
My God is Odin, the all father.

365
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:21,020
I know you told me.

366
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:24,658
Only... I don't believe you.

367
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:29,696
And this? Ragnar gave me this.

368
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:33,366
Wearing a dog-turd doesn't make you a dog.

369
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:36,569
Oh.

370
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:42,776
<i>I have something else for you.</i>

371
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,982
The hand of your holy man, I believe.

372
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:53,452
(Giggles)

373
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:56,264
Ragnar: So tell me,

374
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,583
how do you find England?

375
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:06,064
Horik: It is a pleasant
land, rich with treasure.

376
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:09,888
You are right. This land is rich.

377
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:14,973
But here... here is the real treasure!

378
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,675
(Inhales deeply)

379
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:20,578
Earth? Have you not seen?

380
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,514
Everywhere we go, there are crops.

381
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,849
There is food growing.

382
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,852
I am a farmer and the son of a farmer,

383
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,122
and this is what I understand.

384
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,659
Compared to our poor countries,
where it is hard to farm,

385
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:36,728
hard to live.

386
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,997
Here, it is easy.

387
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,401
If we lived here, we could feed everybody.

388
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,537
There would be no hunger.

389
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:50,007
I like your thinking,
but here is my question:

390
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,976
Will the Saxons simply invite us

391
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:54,411
to live among them, hmm?

392
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,149
<i>(Loud cheering and applause)</i>

393
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:03,754
(Music and applause fill the great hall)

394
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:05,556
- Man: Jarl Borg!
- Man 2: To your new bride!

395
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:07,157
(Applause)

396
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,627
Man 3: A fine choice this day!

397
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,028
Jarl Borg: Thank you!

398
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,398
(Loud cheering and applause)

399
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:21,872
<i>Man 4: A fine choice, my lord!</i>

400
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,941
<i>(Excited buzz of chatter and applause)</i>

401
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,179
(Quiets down)

402
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,489
So I am married for the second time.

403
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,590
As most of you know,

404
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:42,692
my first marriage lasted less than an hour,

405
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,562
because my own brother
poisoned the drinks that day.

406
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,164
Of course, the same thing
can never happen twice,

407
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,100
so let the wine be poured.

408
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,868
Men and women: (Cheering) Yeah! Here, here!

409
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:54,970
(Applause, cheering, banging on tables)

410
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:04,112
Now who will be the first
to drink in celebration?

411
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,151
I will.

412
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,761
No! No, I could not bear
it. Not a second time.

413
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,164
Let me taste the wine.

414
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,101
(Gulping)

415
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:30,638
(Uneasy silence)

416
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:37,845
It's quite all right.

417
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,547
Skol!

418
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,649
(Applause, cheering, banging on tables)

419
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:46,153
Jarl Borg: I have something
else important to say.

420
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,721
I don't wish to dampen the celebrations

421
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,858
but you all know that the
agreement between myself,

422
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:54,627
King Horik, and Ragnar
Lothbrok has been broken.

423
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,230
They have gone raiding
west without me, without us,

424
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:59,032
which is an insult not only to myself,

425
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,500
but to all of you,

426
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:02,802
<i>and now also to my wife,</i>

427
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,672
and to my wife's family.

428
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,874
(Murmurs of agreement)

429
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:10,577
I have to do something about this insult.

430
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:13,613
Frankly, I blame King Horik
more for what has happened,

431
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,981
<i>but at the same time,</i>

432
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:18,685
<i>consider what is happening
to Earl Ragnar's lands.</i>

433
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:21,120
He has abandoned them

434
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:24,923
to the care of his wife
and his drunken brother.

435
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:27,026
(Laughter)

436
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:28,594
In order to punish those

437
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:31,697
who have insulted me and my family,

438
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:33,732
I declare today that I will seek vengeance

439
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,934
against Ragnar Lothbrok.

440
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,871
By all our gods,

441
00:28:38,938 --> 00:28:43,675
I swear that we will seize all his lands

442
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,844
and that I will repay
his brother's treachery

443
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:47,145
with the axe.

444
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,147
<i>All: (Cheer in agreement)</i>

445
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,485

446
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:57,289
(Foliage rustles underfoot)

(Horses snort and whinny)

449
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:25,116
Bishop Edmund: Who can speak to us?

450
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:30,521
I can.

451
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:34,993
I have been sent here by Ecbert,

452
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,594
King of Wessex.

453
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:39,931
<i>The king regrets your attack</i>

454

458
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:54,945
Ragnar: Well, that depends.

459
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:59,684
Bishop Edmund: Upon what?

460
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:03,220
Ragnar: Upon what he'll
offer us to leave...

461
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:09,193
or what he'll offer us to stay.

462
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:13,496
Stay?

463
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:18,468
Ragnar: Yes, we want to
make peace with the king.

464
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:21,504
Peace.

465
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,610
(Tries to clear throat)

466
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:30,547
So we don't have to kill any more of you.

467
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:35,118
I will relay your message to the king.

No, of course not.

00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,276
I am the Earl here.

504

What would folk think if
I let my beloved stepson

505

Go back to the town.

522

Find anyone who can fight,

523

Aslaug: Jarl Borg?

529

Rollo: (Panting) I'm sure it is him.

530
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:18,233
Ragnar and King Horik broke
their agreement with him.

531
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,837
He has returned to gain his revenge.

Help with the barricades.

539
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:51,700
Ragnar has taken all of
the best fighting men.

- Lagertha?

Siggy, I need you to go

Find Princess Aslaug and her children

548

- And then what?
- Wait.

549
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,727
For what?

550
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:25,265
For whatever the gods have
decided is about to happen.

551
