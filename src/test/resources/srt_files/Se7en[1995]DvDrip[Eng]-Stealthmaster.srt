1
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,636
They were heard screaming at each
other for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:04,839
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,709
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:09,611
Yeah.

5
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,881
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:15,617
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:21,556
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:22,690
What?

9
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:24,325
The kid?

10
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:27,161
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:32,634
We'll be real glad when we get rid of
you, Somerset. Always these questions.

12
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:36,404
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

13
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:38,439
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

14
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:41,142
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

15
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,452
Detective Somerset?

16
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:54,656
I'm Detective Mills.

17
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:00,528
Just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

18
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:01,596
Look...

19
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:03,498
Mills?

20
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:08,436
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.

21
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:11,172
Not much time for
this transition thing.

22
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:15,510
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

23
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,444
Yeah.

24
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:19,247
Why here?

25
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:21,616
I don't follow.

26
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:24,452
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,089
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,528
Same reason as you. Or the reason
you had before you decided to quit.

29
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,632
You just met me.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,135
Maybe I don't understand the question.

31
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,972
It's very simple.

32
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,376
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

33
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:52,814
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

34
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:57,352
It'd be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

35
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,389
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

36
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:06,327
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?

37
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:10,565
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.

38
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,333
- Not here.
- I understand.

39
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:16,871
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,
do me the favor of remembering that.

40
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,519
SE7EN

41
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:17,218
MONDAY

42
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:21,089
MONDAY

43
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,097
Yeah.

44
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,632
Okay.

45
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,968
Say it again?

46
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:14,075
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

47
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,815
Serpico's got to go.

48
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,352
Well, you might want
to get rid of this little...

49
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,988
crusty, this eye, Serpico.

50
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,823
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

51
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:29,991
Good.

52
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,775
Coffee?

53
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,617
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

54
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,452
What time was death established?

55
00:07:57,552 --> 00:07:58,953
Like I said...

56
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:00,622
I didn't touch anything...

57
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,792
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

58
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:07,629
Wait. No one bothers
with vital signs?

59
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,567
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing
unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

60
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,904
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.

61
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:20,808
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up

62
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:23,244
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.

63
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,246
Thank you.

64
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,124
I wonder.

65
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,764
What was the point of the conversation
you were about to get into?

66
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:47,669
Don't know. How many times Barney Five
found dead bodies that weren't dead.

67
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,005
Drop it.

68
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:24,873
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

69
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,558
Better Homes and Gardens.

70
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:52,367
Spaghetti Sauce

71
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,137
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,839
No one.

73
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,576
Guy's heart must be the size...

74
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:03,011
of a canned ham.

75
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,249
If this isn't a coronary...

76
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:09,417
well...

77
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,519
I don't know.

78
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:29,938
Whoops.

79
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:38,947
How about that.

80
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,025
We had this case once...

81
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,962
guy dead on the ground...

82
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,864
knife in his back.
Murder...

83
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,232
right?

84
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:00,401
Fuck!

85
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,639
Anyway, big insurance policy involved,
yeah? So the guy...

86
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,207
took the tip of the blade...

87
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:08,676
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:11,779
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...

89
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,681
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:25,193
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:26,294
What?

92
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,632
Got a bucket here.

93
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,834
What's in it?

94
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,874
Oh God!

95
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,543
Fucking vomit.

96
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,180
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,183
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,423
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:59,160
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,895
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:04,065
You girls have got forensics
waiting outside.

102
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,667
We might not fit.

103
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,236
There's room. Light's the problem.

104
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,604
How are you?

105
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,907
Det. Mills, go help the officers...

106
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,509
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,413
What?

108
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:20,215
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,265
He's dead.

110
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,235
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,776
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,112
Nope.

113
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:57,385
I did door-to-doors and walked
the beat. I did that shit...

114
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,553
a long time.

115
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,456
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:04,425
"detective".
That's the same as yours.

117
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,795
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,232
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene...

119
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,903
not whether you were getting
enough time on the field.

120
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,070
Hey, man...

121
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,476
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.

122
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,250
He's been dead...

123
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,986
a long time, and not from poison.

124
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,488
Oh, man.

125
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:35,657
How can you let yourself go like that?

126
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:39,093
It took 4 orderlies just
to get him on the table.

127
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:47,001
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.

128
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,171
Look. See how big this stomach is?

129
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:53,107
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

130
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:56,344
Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

131
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:59,180
I see that, but it means
nothing to me.

132
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,783
Okay, he's got lines of distention...

133
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,451
across the duodenum.

134
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,153
The interior wall's ripped open.

135
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,290
This man ate till he burst?

136
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,295
He didn't really burst. Not all the
way. He was hemorrhaging internally.

137
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,198
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

138
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:20,468
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?

139
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,703
Yes and no.

140
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,773
What about these bruises here?

141
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,544
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,546
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:33,081
Pressed hard enough.

144
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,315
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,318
On the front, flush with the muzzle.

146
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:42,924
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,331
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving. Took his time too.

148
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,334
Coroner said it could have lasted
more than 12 hours.

149
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:56,738
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

150
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,674
and there was a point
when he passed out.

151
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,910
That's when the killer kicked him...

152
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,912
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

153
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,248
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

154
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:10,185
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

155
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:13,221
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

156
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:18,092
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy
and tortured him. Simple as that.

157
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,394
In the grocery bags...

158
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:22,997
we found 2 receipts. So,
the killer stopped and went back...

159
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:24,599
to the supermarket.

160
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,501
So?

161
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:31,372
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

162
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,441
- This is beginning.
- We've got...

163
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,376
one dead guy, not three.

164
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,611
No motive.

165
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,215
Don't start that big brain of yours...

166
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:41,883
cooking on this, alright?

167
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:44,285
I'd like to be reassigned.

168
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,621
Whoa.

169
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,957
What are you talking about?

170
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:50,959
This can't be my last duty.

171
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,694
It'll go on and on.

172
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:55,797
You're retiring in 6 days.

173
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,900
You've left unfinished
business before.

174
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,971
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible.

175
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,274
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.

176
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,076
It's his first assignment.

177
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:12,146
I knew it. This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

178
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:13,414
It's too soon.

179
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,818
I'm here. You can say that
shit to my face. Captain?

180
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,086
It's too soon for you.

181
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,154
Captain...

182
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:22,323
Can we talk in private?

183
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,825
This is a personal thing--

184
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,693
Just shut up, Mills.

185
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,595
I don't have anyone else...

186
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,999
to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...

187
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,968
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

188
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,606
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

189
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,941
Give it to me.

190
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:42,010
I'll put you on something else.

191
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,814
Go on, Mills, just go on.

192
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:56,124
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck...

193
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,959
cleaning up the fat man.

194
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:05,433
TUESDAY

195
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,570
TUESDAY

196
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:13,274
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!

197
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:15,176
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED

198
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:17,779
Quiet down.

199
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,115
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

200
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:23,184
Quiet down.

201
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,289
Here's how it'll work:

202
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,460
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

203
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:37,866
Ask those questions in a calm, sane,
orderly fashion or I will leave.

204
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,801
Detective? Detective?

205
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,836
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

206
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:51,713
I won't discuss the details of this
investigation, so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:12,567
What you got for me?

208
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,169
Nothing yet, boss.

209
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:20,642
Why don't you guys go get
a coffee, huh?

210
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:26,347
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...

211
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,017
Eli Gould was found murdered today.

212
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:33,555
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

213
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,028
That's ridiculous and offensive.

214
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:44,933
There is no conflict, and any claim
there could be is irresponsible.

215
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,535
Now hold on.

216
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:52,941
I just met with law enforcement
officials and they...

217
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:57,245
assured me that they have their
very best men on this.

218
00:18:57,712 --> 00:19:00,281
This will be the very definition...

219
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,084
of swift justice.

220
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,288
GREED

221
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,409
Pardon me, George.

222
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:33,915
Somerset.

223
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,149
Come in.

224
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:37,952
You heard the news?

225
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,420
Nope, haven't heard.

226
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:42,323
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

227
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:45,827
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

228
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,930
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

229
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,539
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

230
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:59,974
Mills is heading the investigation.

231
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,577
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,013
Don't do that, please?

233
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,084
Good for him.

234
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:11,586
What will you do...

235
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:13,755
with yourself out there, Somerset?

236
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:17,091
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

237
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:18,626
Don't you feel it?

238
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,862
Don't you feel that feeling?

239
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:24,265
You're not going to be a cop anymore.

240
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,100
That's the whole idea.

241
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,270
I don't think you'll leave.

242
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:32,207
Hell, you can't leave all this.

243
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,611
Guy's out walking his dog.

244
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:38,213
Gets attacked.

245
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,216
His watch is taken, his wallet.

246
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:42,617
And while he's lying...

247
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,285
on the sidewalk helpless...

248
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:47,789
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

249
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,160
This happened last night
about 4 blocks from here.

250
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,095
I read about it.

251
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,931
I don't understand anymore.

252
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:59,200
It's the way it's always been.

253
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:03,137
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.

254
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:05,306
I don't think you can deny that.

255
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,976
Maybe I'm wrong.

256
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,547
The coroner sent this down for you.

257
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:15,683
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach...

258
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,521
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...

259
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,322
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

260
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,161
They were...

261
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:28,463
fed to him.

262
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:08,997
Lord.

263
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,832
GLUTTONY

264
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:21,776
This was found behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.

265
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,779
"Long is the way

266
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:28,116
And hard, that out of hell
leads up to light."

267
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:29,450
It's from Milton.

268
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:31,653
"Paradise Lost."

269
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,188
Alright...

270
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,455
I'm confused.

271
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:36,991
It means that this is beginning.

272
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:38,293
GLUTTONY

273
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,461
This was behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:42,864
written in grease.

275
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:45,033
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

276
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,868
Gluttony...

277
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:50,538
greed...

278
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,143
sloth, wrath...

279
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,345
pride, lust...

280
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,147
and envy.

281
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:00,715
Seven.

282
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,716
Hold on.

283
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,619
This is not even my desk.

284
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,789
You can expect five more of these.

285
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:10,625
Wait a minute.

286
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,062
I can't get involved in this.

287
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:17,498
Somerset.

288
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:19,334
He wanted it.

289
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:22,170
Damn!

290
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,738
I'm all over it.

291
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,240
Where to?

292
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,412
Far away from here.

293
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:18,960
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.

294
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:20,728
Sit where you'd like.

295
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,830
How's everybody?

296
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,400
Hiya, Smiley.

297
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:28,336
George, the cards are getting cold.

298
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,238
Duty calls.

299
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:47,822
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...

300
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,058
I'll never understand.

301
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:53,094
All these books...

302
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,597
a world of knowledge right here...

303
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:56,831
and what do you do?

304
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,167
You play poker all night.

305
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:01,603
Hey, we got culture.

306
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:04,272
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

307
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,511
How's this for culture?

308
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,341
CHAUCER

You may want to check these books re:
deadly sins.

312
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,922
Dante's Purgatory
The Canterbury Tales

313
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,835
was crimson with his blood:

314
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:26,948
Even children slain!

315
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:48,870
You know, Smiley...

316
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:51,639
you'll really miss us.

317
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,876
I just might.

318

Fucking Dante.

323
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:59,007
Goddamn poetry-writing fagot
piece of shit.

324
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:00,608
Fucker.

325
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:13,288
Good work, Officer.

326
00:30:20,328 --> 00:30:22,063
Thank you, Lord.

327
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,573
Oh, oh, sorry.

328
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:34,976
I'll move in a second.

329
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:50,091
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.

330
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:50,992
Yeah?

331
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:30,665
Phone.

332
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:34,335
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

333
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,475
Mills.

334
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,377
Honey...

335
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,312
You okay? Something wrong?

336
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:49,184
You dingleberry, I told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

337
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:51,819
Yeah. Why?

338
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:55,890
Why?

339
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:01,896
Okay.

340
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,001
It's my wife.

341
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:08,536
Sorry?

342
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:11,472
She'd like to speak to you.

343
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:23,418
This is Detective Somerset.

344
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:28,189
Well, yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

345
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:32,193
I appreciate the offer, but...

346
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:37,031
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.

347
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,934
Yes, thank you very much.

348
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:42,270
Bye.

349
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,274
Honey, what...?

350
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:55,717
Well?

351
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,085
Sorry?

352
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:02,790
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

353
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:04,692
At my... How's that?

354
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:06,294
Tonight.

355
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:15,336
Hello, men.

356
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:16,638
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:20,875
That's Tracy. Tracy...

358
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:23,745
Hello.

359
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,614
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,884
Except your first name.

361
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:32,487
It's William.

362
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,490
Well, it's a good name...

363
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,591
William.

364
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:39,494
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:43,498
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

366
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,768
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.

367
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:50,338
Aw, good dogs.

368
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,341
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

369
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:05,954
Smells good.

370
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:10,291
Yeah, I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:13,294
Please have a seat, if you like.

372
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:17,365
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.

373
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:21,302
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

374
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:23,037
We're still unpacking.

375
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,209
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

376
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,213
Pretty hokey, huh?

377
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:34,883
You know something?

378
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:37,986
On our first date I knew he was...

379
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,554
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

380
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:43,391
He was the funniest guy I ever met.

381
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:49,297
Really.

382
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:54,836
It's kind of rare nowadays.

383
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:57,172
I mean, that level of...

384
00:34:57,238 --> 00:34:58,339
commitment.

385
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:04,579
Oh, don't worry.

386
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,415
I won't wear it to the dinner table.

387
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:10,351
No matter...

388
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:13,087
how often I see guns,
I just can't...

389
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:14,589
get used to them.

390
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,891
Same here.

391
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:29,871
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.

392
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:31,206
What the hell?

393
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:32,974
I was close once.

394
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,310
It just didn't happen.

395
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:37,312
It surprises me.

396
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,480
It really does.

397
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:41,916
Well...

398
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:47,555
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

399
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,891
Just ask your husband.

400
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,059
Very true.

401
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:53,228
Very, very true.

402
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:56,064
How long have you lived here?

403
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:57,999
Too long.

404
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:03,304
How do you like it?

405
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:06,407
You know...

406
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:09,244
takes time. Settle in...

407
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:11,980
it'll be good.

408
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,182
Well, you get numb after awhile

409
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:17,585
There are things to any city...

410
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:24,526
Subway.

411
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,028
It'll go away in a minute.

412
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:32,433
This real estate guy.

413
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:35,703
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.

414
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:39,874
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

415
00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:42,610
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.

416
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:47,382
Then I start wondering why he'll only
bring us here 5 minutes at a time.

417
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:49,350
We found out the first night.

418
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:52,120
The soothing, relaxing...

419
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:54,455
vibrating home, huh?

420
00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:04,299
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,408
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

422
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:18,546
I don't know why you're laughing.

423
00:37:22,383 --> 00:37:24,085
Alright, already.

424
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:30,325
He had to get into the building...

425
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:34,429
before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?

426
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,732
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

427
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,169
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.

428
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:45,673
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.

429
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:48,810
Laid low till the cleaning crew left,
then had...

430
00:37:48,877 --> 00:37:52,347
his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

431
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:53,681
Look.

432
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:56,551
Gould was bound, right arm free.

433
00:37:56,618 --> 00:37:58,786
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:02,657
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:03,992
A pound of flesh.

436
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:12,200
"One pound of flesh"

437
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,769
"No more no less
No cartilage...

438
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,037
No bone....

439
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,473
only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

440
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,874
Didn't see it.

441
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:23,011
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".

442
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:25,213
I tell you that chair was...

443
00:38:25,313 --> 00:38:27,982
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.

444
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,386
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time...

445
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,888
deciding which cut....

446
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:35,156
to make first.

447
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:37,158
Imagine it.

448
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:39,060
There's a gun in your face.

449
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:42,030
Which part of your body
is expendable?

450
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,399
The love handle.

451
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:47,502
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

452
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:52,207
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...

453
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:55,743
Look through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

454
00:38:55,844 --> 00:39:00,849
The trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

455
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:03,351
until it's an exhausted possibility.

456
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:05,386
I'll get another beer. Beer?

457
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:07,255
Wine, please.

458
00:39:16,197 --> 00:39:17,532
He's preaching.

459
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,434
Punishing.

460
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:24,439
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

461
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:27,408
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...

462
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:30,745
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...

463
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:34,516
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?

464
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:35,717
Yeah.

465
00:39:35,817 --> 00:39:38,253
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...

466
00:39:38,353 --> 00:39:42,824
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill
and check out all the sinners?

467
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:47,662
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.

468
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:51,099
But there pride comes first,
not gluttony.

469
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,667
For now let's consider...

470
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,737
the books as the killer's inspiration.

471
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:58,806
The sermons were about atonement
for sin.

472
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:01,276
These murders are like
forced attrition.

473
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:02,844
Forced what?

474
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:06,114
Attrition's when you regret your sins,
but not because...

475
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:10,084
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.

476
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:15,123
No fingerprints.

477
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,624
Nope.

478
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:19,794
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.

479
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:22,630
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,365
Which I don't get...

481
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,368
because the fucker
had to get back out.

482
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:32,540
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,845
In rape prevention, the first thing
they teach you is never cry for help.

484
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,314
Always yell, "Fire!".

485
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,815
Nobody answers help.

486
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:42,917
Holler "fire," they'll come.

487
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:44,719
That's fucked up.

488
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:47,555
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

489
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:53,895
You know what? Thank you for talking
this out, but I must sleep.

490
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:55,563
Walk the dogs.

491
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,166
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:02,237
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

493
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,841
Gould's wife. She was out of town
at the time.

494
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:10,245
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

495
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:14,349
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

496
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:24,859
What if it isn't what she has seen...

497
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:29,163
but what she's supposed to see
but hasn't had the chance?

498
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:31,032
Yeah, okay. What?

499
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:32,600
I don't know.

500
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:36,371
But that's the one thing.

501
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,151
I'll sign us in.

502
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:25,153
Must see Mrs. Gould.

503
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,261
Mrs. Gould?

504
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,970
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

505
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:44,472
I don't understand.

506
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:47,542
I need you to look at each photo...

507
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:49,677
very carefully.

508
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:53,348
Look and see if there's anything
strange or...

509
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:56,017
out of place, anything at all.

510
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,286
I don't see anything.

511
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:01,856
Please, I can't do this right now.

512
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,024
Okay.

513
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:05,693
It's got to be now.

514
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:07,695
There may be something we missed.

515
00:43:17,272 --> 00:43:18,473
Wait.

516
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,507
What?

517
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:20,642
Here.

518
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:27,215
This painting, it's upside down.

519
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,058
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

520
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,494
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

521
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:44,065
Nothing.

522
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,335
There's got to be something.

523
00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:00,915
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

524
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:06,855
What the fuck is that?

525
00:44:08,323 --> 00:44:09,757
Switchblade.

526
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,701
Goddamn it.

527
00:44:23,004 --> 00:44:25,440
There must be something.

528
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:32,714
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

529
00:44:40,622 --> 00:44:43,591
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:47,028
See this, this is us.

531
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:50,465
Just wait a minute.

532
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:56,571
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:45:02,143 --> 00:45:04,012
You're kidding me.

534
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:06,080
Call the print lab.

535
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:12,654
Oh, man.

536
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:17,592
Honestly...

537
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:20,261
have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:26,034
HELP ME

539
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:29,037
The swell pattern tells me
that they're not...

540
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,372
the victim's fingerprints.

541
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:43,618
I don't know, man.

542
00:45:43,685 --> 00:45:45,820
I say he's whacked enough.

543
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:48,756
It doesn't fit.

544
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,226
He doesn't want to stop.

545
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,393
Who knows.

546
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:56,631
Freaks out there doing their
evil deeds they don't want to do.

547
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:59,234
"The voices made me do it".

548
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,236
"Jodie Foster made me do it".

549
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,770
It can take...

550
00:46:02,837 --> 00:46:06,941
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to cross...

551
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,743
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:15,250
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

553
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:17,085
About catching this guy.

554
00:46:20,588 --> 00:46:23,191
Wish I still thought
the way you did.

555
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:28,029
Tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

556
00:46:28,963 --> 00:46:30,798
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:37,205
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples...

558
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:39,374
writing everything down...

559
00:46:39,474 --> 00:46:41,776
noting the time things happened.

560
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:44,212
That's all?

561
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:46,381
That's all.

562
00:46:46,447 --> 00:46:50,218
Putting everything into neat piles
and filing it away...

563
00:46:50,785 --> 00:46:54,289
on the off chance it'll be needed
in the courtroom.

564
00:46:56,991 --> 00:47:00,228
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

565
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:03,464
saving them in case we get rescued.

566
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:07,569
Bullshit.

567
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:14,108
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

568
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:18,913
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

569
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:25,486
Don't try to tell me you didn't
get that rush tonight.

570
00:47:26,654 --> 00:47:28,089
I saw you.

571
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,992
We're getting somewhere.

572
00:47:41,135 --> 00:47:41,169
THURSDAY

573
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:43,738
THURSDAY

574
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,176
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

575
00:47:48,543 --> 00:47:50,111
We got a winner.

576
00:47:56,317 --> 00:48:00,088
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

577
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:02,790
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

578
00:48:02,857 --> 00:48:06,528
He's got a long history
of serious mental illnesses.

579
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:09,264
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

580
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,800
Somewhere along the line
they fell short.

581
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:16,371
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery
and assault, spent time...

582
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:19,641
in prison for the attempted rape
of a minor.

583
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:23,545
His lawyer made sure that didn't
last long. By the way...

584
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:26,381
the lawyer was Eli Gould,
the "greed" victim.

585
00:48:26,781 --> 00:48:29,150
We'll stop this today,
ladies and germs.

586
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:33,721
Victor's been out of circulation for
awhile, but we've a residence for him.

587
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:36,324
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...

588
00:48:36,424 --> 00:48:37,992
Like our guy, does it?

589
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:39,127
You tell me.

590
00:48:40,328 --> 00:48:42,463
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

591
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:12,827
You ever take a bullet?

592
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:16,030
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock on wood.

593
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:19,434
I've only taken my gun out...

594
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:22,036
3 times wanting to use it.

595
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:23,771
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,039
Not once.

597
00:49:25,573 --> 00:49:26,407
You?

598
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:30,778
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,
but...

599
00:49:30,845 --> 00:49:33,448
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

600
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:35,617
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:37,886
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:40,788
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

603
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:45,960
We bust open the door looking for this
junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.

604
00:49:47,228 --> 00:49:49,130
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:52,901
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:58,973
It spun him like a top... no, Well,
more, you know, more like slow motion.

607
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,976
I remember...

608
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:05,246
riding in that ambulance...

609
00:50:05,346 --> 00:50:06,648
and, well...

610
00:50:06,714 --> 00:50:08,149
he died right there.

611
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,751
Right there.

612
00:50:10,652 --> 00:50:12,887
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:33,334
SWAT goes before dicks.

614
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,573
They love this.

615
00:51:39,507 --> 00:51:40,542
Police!

616
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:46,748
Clear!

617
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:12,874
Good morning, sweetheart.

618
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,945
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!

619
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,956
Get up, you sack of shit.

620
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,030
Oh, fuck me.

621
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:37,565
Dicks!

622
00:52:38,299 --> 00:52:40,401
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

623
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:44,906
Dicks!

624
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:53,481
Jesus.

625
00:52:53,581 --> 00:52:54,749
Victor?

626
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:57,252
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

627
00:52:57,318 --> 00:52:58,987
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?

628
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:00,421
Hearse, I'd say.

629
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:01,990
Call for forensics.

630
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:03,658
Get your people out.

631
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:05,493
No one touches anything.

632
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,896
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.

633
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,168
Sloth.

634
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,112
Aw, man.

635
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:25,446
Goddamn.

636
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,283
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.

637
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:38,126
This must be the first.

638
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:39,060
Look.

639
00:53:39,861 --> 00:53:42,363
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

640
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:46,134
I got a hair sample. I got a...

641
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:48,469
stool sample. I got piss. I got...

642
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:49,871
fingernails.

643
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:53,608
He's laughing at us.

644
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:55,977
You got what you deserved.

645
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,316
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!

646
00:54:02,383 --> 00:54:03,718
Guns down!

647
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:06,054
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

648
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:25,807
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.

649
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:30,678
We must forget our emotion.

650
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:35,750
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?

651
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,252
Are you listening to me?

652
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:38,820
Yes, I can hear you.

653
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:40,588
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

654
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:43,424
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.

655
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:44,859
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.

656
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,896
I got a fucking right to be here.

657
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:49,797
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.

658
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:51,799
I got your picture, man.

659
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:54,135
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.

660
00:54:54,202 --> 00:54:57,071
Detective Mills.
M-I-L-L-S. Fuck off.

661
00:54:57,138 --> 00:54:58,907
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!

662
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:02,143
How they get here so fucking quick?

663
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,813
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.

664
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:08,483
Hey man, I'm sorry.

665
00:55:10,552 --> 00:55:11,986
They piss me off.

666
00:55:12,053 --> 00:55:13,321
It's okay.

667
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:16,024
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

668
00:55:22,931 --> 00:55:28,203
1 year of immobility's right, judging
by the muscle and spine deterioration.

669
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:31,940
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

670
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:36,878
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep
the bedsores from infecting.

671
00:55:37,512 --> 00:55:41,616
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

672
00:55:41,683 --> 00:55:44,552
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

673
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:47,121
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

674
00:55:49,624 --> 00:55:50,558
Doc.

675
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:54,796
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

676
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:00,301
He'd die of shock right now if you
shone a flashlight in his eyes.

677
00:56:01,135 --> 00:56:05,974
He's had as much pain and suffering as
anyone I've encountered, give or take

678
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,644
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

679
00:56:10,044 --> 00:56:11,312
Good night.

680
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:25,994
Hello, William.

681
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,662
It's Tracy.

682
00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:29,297
Tracy?

683
00:56:29,931 --> 00:56:30,999
Everything okay?

684
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:34,269
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

685
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:35,470
Where's David?

686
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:38,840
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

687
00:56:38,907 --> 00:56:41,943
I'm sorry to call you like this.

688
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,511
Oh, it's all right.

689
00:56:44,512 --> 00:56:45,980
What can I do for you?

690
00:56:51,586 --> 00:56:53,621
I need someone to talk...

691
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:56,624
to. Do you think you could meet me...

692
00:56:56,691 --> 00:56:58,993
somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

693
00:56:59,928 --> 00:57:01,529
I don't understand.

694
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:05,633
I feel stupid calling, but...

695
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:10,038
you're the only person
that I know here.

696
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:12,006
There's no one else.

697
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:13,975
If you can...

698
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:16,544
just give me a call, okay?

699
00:57:16,611 --> 00:57:18,313
I have to go now.

700
00:57:19,113 --> 00:57:20,215
Good night.

701
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:21,316
Good night.

702
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:26,120
FRIDAY

703
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,723
FRIDAY

704
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:31,926
I mean...

705
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:34,596
you know this city so well.

706
00:57:35,496 --> 00:57:36,931
You've been here...

707
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:38,533
so long.

708
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:41,870
It can be a hard place.

709
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:45,006
I don't know why I asked you to come.

710
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:48,743
Why don't you talk to him about it?

711
00:57:49,143 --> 00:57:50,845
Tell him how you feel.

712
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:55,016
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

713
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,851
Especially now.

714
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,922
I'll get used to things...

715
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:02,190
you know?

716
00:58:02,257 --> 00:58:04,425
I wanted to talk to someone...

717
00:58:04,492 --> 00:58:07,195
who's lived here for a long time.

718
00:58:07,896 --> 00:58:12,734
I mean, upstate, it's
a completely different environment.

719
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:21,176
Did David tell you that I teach
fifth grade? Well, I did.

720
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:24,712
Yeah, he mentioned it.

721
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:30,952
I've been going around,
looking at schools...

722
00:58:33,188 --> 00:58:35,290
but the conditions here are...

723
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,125
horrible.

724
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,628
What about private schools?

725
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:44,065
I don't know.

726
00:58:46,034 --> 00:58:48,536
Tell me what's really bothering you.

727
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:53,741
David and I are going to have a baby.

728
00:58:58,813 --> 00:58:59,981
Oh, Tracy. I...

729
00:59:01,649 --> 00:59:03,084
I don't think I'm the one...

730
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:05,086
to talk to...

731
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:07,922
- about this.
- I hate this city.

732
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:14,262
I had a relationship once...

733
00:59:14,896 --> 00:59:17,165
it was very much like a marriage.

734
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:21,669
We got pregnant.

735
00:59:22,904 --> 00:59:25,073
This was a long time ago.

736
00:59:30,845 --> 00:59:33,848
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:40,355
Just a day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew...

738
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:41,956
about the pregnancy.

739
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:46,294
And I felt this fear...

740
00:59:46,861 --> 00:59:48,696
the first time ever.

741
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:52,634
I remember thinking...

742
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:56,704
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

743
00:59:56,771 --> 00:59:59,707
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

744
01:00:07,382 --> 01:00:09,717
I told her I didn't want to have it.

745
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:13,855
And over the next few weeks...

746
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:16,724
I wore her down.

747
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:21,496
I want to have children.

748
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:28,169
I can tell you now that...

749
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:31,406
I know... I mean...

750
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:35,243
I'm positive that...

751
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,012
I made the right decision.

752
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,249
But not a day passes
that I don't wish...

753
01:00:41,316 --> 01:00:44,018
that I had made a different choice.

754
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:49,090
If you don't...

755
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:50,258
keep...

756
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:54,762
the baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

757
01:00:56,831 --> 01:00:59,434
don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

758
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:04,105
but if you choose to have the baby...

759
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:06,274
then spoil that kid...

760
01:01:06,341 --> 01:01:08,109
every chance you get.

761
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:16,084
That's...

762
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,285
about...

763
01:01:17,352 --> 01:01:19,721
all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:26,861 --> 01:01:27,795
I must go.

765
01:01:28,796 --> 01:01:30,064
William.

766
01:01:37,138 --> 01:01:38,473
Thank you.

767
01:01:50,818 --> 01:01:53,154
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust

768
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:57,364
Victor's landlord said there was cash
in the mail box...

769
01:01:57,431 --> 01:01:59,099
the first of every month.

770
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:04,872
Quote:

771
01:02:05,372 --> 01:02:08,275
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

772
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:11,979
in apartment 306, and nobody
ever complained about him.

773
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:14,148
The best tenant I've ever had."

774
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:16,584
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.

775
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,652
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,387
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:23,190
I'm sick of this waiting.

778
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:24,425
This is the job.

779
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:27,361
Why aren't we out there?

780
01:02:27,428 --> 01:02:31,031
Why must we sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic...

781
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:32,566
does it again?-

782
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:35,736
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

783
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:38,506
Come on, he's insane. Look.

784
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:42,743
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

785
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,179
Yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

786
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:47,181
How's that?

787
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:48,616
I don't think so.

788
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,052
His luck'll run out.

789
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,055
He's not depending on luck.

790
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:02,429
We walked in there exactly 1 year
after he tied Victor to the bed.

791
01:03:02,496 --> 01:03:04,265
One year to the day.

792
01:03:04,331 --> 01:03:06,600
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

793
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,102
Oh, yes, we do.

794
01:03:09,236 --> 01:03:10,938
This note he left...

795
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:13,307
his first words to us.

796
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:15,976
"Long is the way, and Hard,
that out of hell...

797
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:17,378
Leads up to Light."

798
01:03:19,513 --> 01:03:21,115
Fuck him. So what?

799
01:03:21,182 --> 01:03:22,550
He's right, so far.

800
01:03:23,117 --> 01:03:27,621
Imagine the will it takes to keep
a man bound for a full year.

801
01:03:27,688 --> 01:03:30,124
To sever his hand and to use it...

802
01:03:30,191 --> 01:03:31,725
to plant fingerprints.

803
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:34,695
To insert tubes into his genitals.

804
01:03:34,762 --> 01:03:37,731
This guy's methodical, exacting...

805
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:40,067
and worst of all, patient.

806
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:42,069
He's a nut bag.

807
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:46,073
Because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

808
01:03:50,544 --> 01:03:51,745
You got money?

809
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:54,148
I got 50. Fifty bucks.

810
01:03:54,215 --> 01:03:56,650
I propose a field trip. Come on.

811
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:03,324
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...

812
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:07,328
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating
to the 7 deadly sins.

813
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:08,829
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

814
01:04:08,896 --> 01:04:11,932
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

815
01:04:11,999 --> 01:04:13,667
What are his interests now?

816
01:04:14,568 --> 01:04:16,270
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

817
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,339
- Where are we going?
- Library.

818
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,456
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--

819
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:37,024
Discount coupons.

820
01:04:37,925 --> 01:04:42,630
They must have had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

821
01:04:42,696 --> 01:04:45,799
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking...

822
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:47,001
we're dating.

823
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:49,136
Give me your money.

824
01:04:50,437 --> 01:04:54,909
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.

825
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,482
Somerset. How you doing?

826
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:04,485
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.

827
01:05:04,552 --> 01:05:06,987
It's not a problem. Sit down.

828
01:05:12,293 --> 01:05:15,496
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

829
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:18,799
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.

830
01:05:24,238 --> 01:05:25,506
About an hour.

831
01:05:27,808 --> 01:05:29,510
Yep. Help yourself.

832
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,848
That was money well spent.

833
01:05:35,149 --> 01:05:36,183
Yeah.

834
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:45,526
Alright.

835
01:05:45,593 --> 01:05:49,363
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

836
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,765
Good, 'cause I might punch you.

837
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:57,438
It's probably nothing, but even so,
it's no skin off our teeth.

838
01:06:00,474 --> 01:06:03,511
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

839
01:06:05,346 --> 01:06:06,614
Who, stinky man?

840
01:06:07,348 --> 01:06:12,219
For years, the FBI's been hooked into
the library system, keeping records.

841
01:06:12,286 --> 01:06:16,123
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

842
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:17,558
Look.

843
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,560
Certain books are flagged.

844
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:21,962
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...

845
01:06:22,363 --> 01:06:24,064
"Mein Kampf".

846
01:06:24,532 --> 01:06:29,403
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed to the FBI.

847
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,739
Wait. How is this legal?

848
01:06:31,805 --> 01:06:34,608
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.

849
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:40,080
You can't use the information
directly. It's just a useful guide.

850
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:45,152
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without an ID...

851
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:47,421
and a current phone bill. See?

852
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:51,125
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.

853
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:54,161
If you want to know who's reading...

854
01:06:54,228 --> 01:06:57,765
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

855
01:06:57,831 --> 01:07:00,334
the FBI's computers will tell us.

856
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:01,936
It could give us a name.

857
01:07:02,002 --> 01:07:05,105
Of a college kid writing
a term paper...

858
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:06,774
on 20th-century crime.

859
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:09,777
At least you're out of the office.

860
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:11,278
Get a haircut.

861
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:13,614
How do you know this?

862
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:14,515
I don't.

863
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:17,451
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

864
01:07:25,526 --> 01:07:27,862
"Divine Comedy".

865
01:07:27,928 --> 01:07:32,132
"History of Catholicism" A book
called "Murderers and Madmen".

866
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:35,703
"Modern Homicide Investigation".
"In Cold Blood".

867
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,372
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?

868
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:40,374
It's not what you think.

869
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,877
The Marquis de Sade.

870
01:07:43,377 --> 01:07:45,145
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

871
01:07:45,212 --> 01:07:47,815
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...

872
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,984
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.

873
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:52,419
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

874
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:54,488
Is that it?

875
01:07:54,555 --> 01:07:55,389
Yep.

876
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:58,759
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

877
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,594
Whatever.

878
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,397
We're sure about that name, are we?

879
01:08:03,464 --> 01:08:05,833
You were, you saw it. John Doe.

880
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,335
You want to go back, I'll go back.

881
01:08:08,802 --> 01:08:11,172
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

882
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:13,507
This is crazy.

883
01:08:13,574 --> 01:08:15,676
We'll just talk to him.

884
01:08:16,477 --> 01:08:19,513
"Excuse me, sir. Do you
happen to be a serial killer?"

885
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,518
You do the talking.

886
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:28,189
Put that silver tongue of yours
to work.

887
01:08:28,255 --> 01:08:29,924
You've talked to my wife?

888
01:08:33,928 --> 01:08:35,196
Retarded.

889
01:08:35,596 --> 01:08:37,598
Charlie's fucking Angels.

890
01:08:38,265 --> 01:08:40,100
A name off a computer.

891
01:08:44,104 --> 01:08:45,206
Mills.

892
01:08:56,116 --> 01:08:57,885
- You hit?
- No.

893
01:09:01,021 --> 01:09:02,957
He's going down!

894
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,075
Fifth floor!

895
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:43,664
Police. Is there a back way out?

896
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:45,499
Lock your door.

897
01:09:48,335 --> 01:09:50,604
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

898
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:17,464
Get down!

899
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:21,068
Get the fuck down.

900
01:11:58,098 --> 01:11:59,300
Goddamn it.

901
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:04,031
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.

902
01:14:44,532 --> 01:14:45,900
Where are you going?

903
01:14:45,966 --> 01:14:48,402
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

904
01:14:49,803 --> 01:14:51,972
What? He fucking shot at us.

905
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:53,474
You can't go in.

906
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:56,410
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

907
01:14:56,477 --> 01:14:59,313
Think about it. Think
how did we get here?

908
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,917
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.

909
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:06,754
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?

910
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:10,591
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.

911
01:15:10,658 --> 01:15:12,660
Just pay attention a minute?

912
01:15:13,227 --> 01:15:16,597
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

913
01:15:16,664 --> 01:15:19,500
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?

914
01:15:19,567 --> 01:15:22,603
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.

915
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,273
We need a reason to knock on
this door.

916
01:15:27,408 --> 01:15:28,843
Think about it.

917
01:15:30,411 --> 01:15:31,512
Okay?

918
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:35,449
Okay, okay.

919
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,953
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

920
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:40,788
When you're right, you're right.

921
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,730
Well...

922
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:52,633
no point in arguing anymore.

923
01:15:54,034 --> 01:15:55,836
Unless you can fix that..

924
01:15:58,372 --> 01:16:00,307
You stupid son of a ...

925
01:16:08,616 --> 01:16:10,718
How much money we got left?

926
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:13,187
So, yeah, I noticed...

927
01:16:13,254 --> 01:16:14,622
this guy going out a lot...

928
01:16:14,688 --> 01:16:18,359
when the murders were happening,
so I...

929
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,862
So you called Det. Somerset?

930
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:23,998
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

931
01:16:24,064 --> 01:16:27,001
was creepy and shit,
and one of the murders...

932
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:29,670
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.

933
01:16:30,404 --> 01:16:32,006
Got everything?

934
01:16:32,072 --> 01:16:34,074
Have her sign. You must sign.

935
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:36,143
Good.

936
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:38,579
You did good.

937
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:41,348
- I did what you said.
- Here.

938
01:16:41,415 --> 01:16:43,417
You get something to eat.

939
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:48,923
Everybody stay outside.

940
01:17:50,651 --> 01:17:51,752
Victor.

941
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:05,933
Wild Bill's Leather

942
01:19:44,265 --> 01:19:45,533
Fuck.

943
01:19:55,142 --> 01:19:57,545
LUST

944
01:20:05,019 --> 01:20:06,086
Somerset!

945
01:20:15,362 --> 01:20:17,565
- What?
- We had him.

946
01:20:18,299 --> 01:20:19,967
What are you saying?

947
01:20:20,034 --> 01:20:22,069
The fucking photographer in...

948
01:20:22,136 --> 01:20:23,237
the fucking stairs.

949
01:20:28,142 --> 01:20:30,144
We had him and we let him go.

950
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:38,752
You're sure this is him?

951
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:41,322
Yep. Good. Get it out.

952
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:46,427
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.

953
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:48,596
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.

954
01:20:48,662 --> 01:20:51,599
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

955
01:20:51,665 --> 01:20:54,268
We got his money. I like it.

956
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:56,770
Wait. You won't believe this.

957
01:20:56,837 --> 01:20:59,640
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

958
01:20:59,707 --> 01:21:02,576
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

959
01:21:07,348 --> 01:21:08,949
We could use some more men.

960
01:21:09,016 --> 01:21:10,184
I'm doing my best.

961
01:21:11,018 --> 01:21:14,355
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here...

962
01:21:14,421 --> 01:21:17,691
and each notebook
contains about 250 pages.

963
01:21:17,758 --> 01:21:19,527
What about the killings?

964
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:25,132
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
what a gross stage we dance on.

965
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,334
What fun, dancing and fucking.

966
01:21:27,401 --> 01:21:31,038
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

967
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:33,474
We are not what was intended."

968
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,476
Wait, there's a lot more.

969
01:21:36,777 --> 01:21:40,447
"On the subway today, a man came up
to start a conversation.

970
01:21:41,115 --> 01:21:44,985
He made small talk, a lonely man
talking about the weather and things.

971
01:21:45,052 --> 01:21:47,221
I tried to be pleasant...

972
01:21:47,288 --> 01:21:50,224
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

973
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:52,459
I almost didn't notice...

974
01:21:52,526 --> 01:21:54,895
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

975
01:21:55,462 --> 01:21:57,398
He was not pleased...

976
01:21:57,798 --> 01:21:59,834
and I couldn't stop laughing".

977
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:02,736
No dates.

978
01:22:02,803 --> 01:22:05,906
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

979
01:22:06,974 --> 01:22:08,976
Just his mind poured out on paper.

980
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:12,012
Looks like a life's work.

981
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:15,516
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still...

982
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,152
- take 2 months.
- I know.

983
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:28,262
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

984
01:22:31,832 --> 01:22:33,434
People, quiet!

985
01:22:49,683 --> 01:22:51,118
I admire you.

986
01:22:52,286 --> 01:22:55,556
I don't know how you found me,
but I was surprised!

987
01:22:56,624 --> 01:23:00,127
I respect you law enforcement
officers more every day.

988
01:23:00,194 --> 01:23:02,796
Well, I appreciate that, John.

989
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:04,899
- I tell you--
- No, listen:

990
01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:09,236
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

991
01:23:09,303 --> 01:23:14,308
I just had to call and express my
admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...

992
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:17,311
one of you, but I had
no choice, right?

993
01:23:17,811 --> 01:23:22,583
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to
say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

994
01:23:29,723 --> 01:23:30,824
Got it.

995
01:23:35,563 --> 01:23:37,164
Everybody back to work.

996
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,768
You were right.

997
01:23:41,569 --> 01:23:42,736
He's preaching.

998
01:23:45,172 --> 01:23:47,575
These murders are his sermons to us.

999
01:23:47,641 --> 01:23:50,511
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.

1000
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:55,115
Who's the blonde?

1001
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,021
Looks like a pro.

1002
01:24:01,388 --> 01:24:02,356
Maybe.

1003
01:24:02,857 --> 01:24:04,792
She caught John Doe's eye.

1004
01:24:07,094 --> 01:24:09,697
Wild Bills' Leather

1005
01:24:10,431 --> 01:24:14,034
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?

1006
01:24:14,101 --> 01:24:15,803
- Yeah.
- This man?

1007
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:18,873
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1008
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:22,843
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

1009
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,012
One sweet piece, actually.

1010
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:27,815
I thought he was a performance artist.

1011
01:24:27,882 --> 01:24:29,884
You know the sort of guy that...

1012
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:32,786
pisses in a cup on stage and then...

1013
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:34,288
drinks it.

1014
01:24:34,355 --> 01:24:35,422
Performance art.

1015
01:24:35,756 --> 01:24:36,957
Right.

1016
01:24:39,927 --> 01:24:42,229
I think I undercharged him.

1017
01:24:42,296 --> 01:24:44,498
- You made this for him?
- I've made...

1018
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:46,467
weirder shit than that.

1019
01:24:52,206 --> 01:24:53,707
They found the blonde.

1020
01:24:56,944 --> 01:24:58,379
The picture!

1021
01:24:58,445 --> 01:24:59,847
The picture!

1022
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:02,950
Fucking pigs.

1023
01:25:04,885 --> 01:25:07,821
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1024
01:25:07,888 --> 01:25:10,224
Get the fuck out of the booth.

1025
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:12,493
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1026
01:25:13,794 --> 01:25:15,229
Come on, this way.

1027
01:25:22,236 --> 01:25:26,340
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.

1028
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,590
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1029
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:54,602
Get this thing off me.

1030
01:25:54,668 --> 01:25:56,704
Oh God, get it off of me.

1031
01:25:58,939 --> 01:26:00,374
Get him out of here, now!

1032
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:03,577
I want to hear it again.

1033
01:26:03,911 --> 01:26:05,246
Tell me again.

1034
01:26:07,648 --> 01:26:10,885
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1035
01:26:14,722 --> 01:26:17,191
He asked me if I was married.

1036
01:26:17,258 --> 01:26:19,760
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1037
01:26:19,827 --> 01:26:22,096
The what? What?

1038
01:26:22,162 --> 01:26:24,765
The prostitute. Where was she?

1039
01:26:24,832 --> 01:26:27,334
Someone comes to your establishment...

1040
01:26:27,401 --> 01:26:31,338
they want to go downstairs,
get some oo-la-la. Whatever.

1041
01:26:31,839 --> 01:26:34,008
They got to come to you. Yeah?

1042
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:35,676
Yeah.

1043
01:26:35,743 --> 01:26:37,077
You didn't see anyone?

1044
01:26:37,912 --> 01:26:41,348
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1045
01:26:41,415 --> 01:26:45,853
Everybody that comes in there's got
to be a package under their arms.

1046
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,456
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1047
01:26:49,523 --> 01:26:51,525
She was just sitting on the bed.

1048
01:26:58,532 --> 01:27:01,135
Who tied her down? You or him?

1049
01:27:01,202 --> 01:27:03,637
Do you like what you do for a living?

1050
01:27:03,704 --> 01:27:05,706
All these things you see?

1051
01:27:05,773 --> 01:27:09,476
No, I don't.

1052
01:27:10,945 --> 01:27:13,047
But that's life, isn't it?

1053
01:27:17,384 --> 01:27:19,486
He had a gun. And...

1054
01:27:20,087 --> 01:27:22,156
he made it happen.

1055
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:26,994
He made me do it.

1056
01:27:27,294 --> 01:27:29,730
He put that thing on me.

1057
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:33,234
And he made me wear it.

1058
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,002
Then he...

1059
01:27:35,069 --> 01:27:36,904
told me to fuck her.

1060
01:27:38,739 --> 01:27:41,041
And I did. I fucked her.

1061
01:27:41,742 --> 01:27:43,410
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1062
01:27:43,477 --> 01:27:45,846
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1063
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:49,250
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1064
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:50,918
Fuck.

1065
01:27:53,754 --> 01:27:55,923
Oh, God. God.

1066
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:58,859
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.

1067
01:28:17,444 --> 01:28:19,213
This won't have a happy ending.

1068
01:28:20,347 --> 01:28:22,950
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1069
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:29,456
If we catch John Doe and he turns out
to be the devil...

1070
01:28:29,523 --> 01:28:31,525
if he's Satan himself...

1071
01:28:31,592 --> 01:28:33,894
that might meet our expectations.

1072
01:28:34,528 --> 01:28:36,030
But he's not the devil.

1073
01:28:37,464 --> 01:28:39,133
He's just a man.

1074
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,801
You know...

1075
01:28:41,535 --> 01:28:45,306
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1076
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:49,310
If you think you're preparing me
for hard time...

1077
01:28:49,376 --> 01:28:50,411
thanks, but...

1078
01:28:50,978 --> 01:28:53,247
But you got to be a hero.

1079
01:28:54,215 --> 01:28:55,983
You want to be a champion.

1080
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:59,153
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1081
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,489
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1082
01:29:02,556 --> 01:29:03,991
I want to know.

1083
01:29:08,662 --> 01:29:11,365
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1084
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:14,301
Go on.

1085
01:29:17,171 --> 01:29:20,508
I don't think I can continue to live
in a place...

1086
01:29:20,574 --> 01:29:24,345
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1087
01:29:24,411 --> 01:29:26,413
You aren't different or better.

1088
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,183
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1089
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,520
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1090
01:29:32,586 --> 01:29:34,522
Apathy is a solution.

1091
01:29:35,055 --> 01:29:40,961
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1092
01:29:41,028 --> 01:29:44,965
It's easier to steal what you want
than to earn it. It's easier...

1093
01:29:45,032 --> 01:29:49,637
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1094
01:29:49,703 --> 01:29:54,808
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.

1095
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,477
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1096
01:29:56,544 --> 01:30:00,047
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1097
01:30:00,114 --> 01:30:03,384
You can't afford to be this naive.

1098
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:05,219
Fuck off.

1099
01:30:05,286 --> 01:30:06,820
See, you...

1100
01:30:06,887 --> 01:30:08,822
You should listen to yourself.

1101
01:30:08,889 --> 01:30:10,991
Yeah. You say that...

1102
01:30:11,058 --> 01:30:13,561
the problem is people don't care.

1103
01:30:14,395 --> 01:30:16,497
So, I don't care about people.

1104
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:18,399
Nonsense. You know why?

1105
01:30:18,465 --> 01:30:19,900
You care?

1106
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:21,836
Want to know-- Damn right.

1107
01:30:21,902 --> 01:30:23,504
You'll make a difference.

1108
01:30:23,571 --> 01:30:26,073
Whatever. The point is that...

1109
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:29,076
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1110
01:30:29,143 --> 01:30:31,078
these things you say.

1111
01:30:31,145 --> 01:30:32,847
You want to believe them...

1112
01:30:32,913 --> 01:30:34,348
because you're quitting.

1113
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:41,021
And you want me to agree with you and
say "You're right, it's all fucked up.

1114
01:30:41,088 --> 01:30:45,259
It's a fucking mess. We should all go
live in a fucking log cabin."

1115
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,595
But I won't.

1116
01:30:48,362 --> 01:30:50,264
I won't say that.

1117
01:30:51,398 --> 01:30:53,868
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1118
01:30:57,771 --> 01:30:58,606
I can't.

1119
01:31:09,016 --> 01:31:10,551
I'm going home.

1120
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:19,894
Thank you, though.

1121
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:52,326
I love you.

1122
01:31:52,893 --> 01:31:54,428
So much.

1123
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:03,838
I know.

1124
01:33:04,064 --> 01:33:04,098
SUNDAY

1125
01:33:04,098 --> 01:33:06,333
SUNDAY

1126
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,602
What's your emergency?

1127
01:33:09,737 --> 01:33:11,272
Could you repeat that?

1128
01:33:12,506 --> 01:33:14,175
I've done it again.

1129
01:33:21,182 --> 01:33:23,784
PRIDE

1130
01:33:24,351 --> 01:33:25,786
What have we got?

1131
01:33:25,853 --> 01:33:27,855
Sleeping pills.

1132
01:33:29,023 --> 01:33:30,791
Glued to one hand.

1133
01:33:30,858 --> 01:33:32,359
Telephone glued to the other.

1134
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:35,329
You see what he did?

1135
01:33:36,263 --> 01:33:37,831
He sliced her up.

1136
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:40,134
Then he bandaged her.

1137
01:33:40,201 --> 01:33:42,469
Call for help and you'll live.

1138
01:33:42,536 --> 01:33:44,371
But you'll be disfigured.

1139
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,876
Or put yourself out
of your own misery.

1140
01:33:49,877 --> 01:33:51,145
Come on.

1141
01:33:51,212 --> 01:33:52,646
He cut off her nose.

1142
01:33:52,713 --> 01:33:54,481
To spite her face.

1143
01:33:54,548 --> 01:33:56,650
And he did it very recently.

1144
01:34:04,124 --> 01:34:05,226
Listen...

1145
01:34:06,227 --> 01:34:09,230
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1146
01:34:09,296 --> 01:34:13,167
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe...

1147
01:34:13,234 --> 01:34:16,337
or he'll kill 7 and this case
will never end.

1148
01:34:16,403 --> 01:34:19,740
Don't do me any favors. Thank you,
but I got it.

1149
01:34:19,807 --> 01:34:24,678
I'm asking to be your partner a few
more days. You'd be doing me a favor.

1150
01:34:35,656 --> 01:34:37,858
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.

1151
01:34:38,826 --> 01:34:42,029
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1152
01:34:44,832 --> 01:34:46,033
Detective?

1153
01:34:47,668 --> 01:34:49,370
After this I'm gone.

1154
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:52,907
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1155
01:34:55,776 --> 01:34:57,278
You're looking for me.

1156
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,182
Don't fucking move.

1157
01:35:01,248 --> 01:35:02,583
On the floor.

1158
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,785
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.

1159
01:35:04,852 --> 01:35:06,053
I know you.

1160
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,454
Now. Get down.

1161
01:35:08,022 --> 01:35:09,657
Get down on your stomach.

1162
01:35:09,723 --> 01:35:11,158
You piece of shit. Now!

1163
01:35:11,825 --> 01:35:13,594
All the way. All the way...

1164
01:35:13,661 --> 01:35:15,162
fucker. Down.

1165
01:35:15,229 --> 01:35:16,597
Faster.

1166
01:35:16,664 --> 01:35:18,832
Faster, fucker. Now.

1167
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:20,668
Nose on the ground.

1168
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:27,007
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1169
01:35:27,074 --> 01:35:30,244
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1170
01:35:31,946 --> 01:35:33,280
Goddamn it.

1171
01:35:35,516 --> 01:35:40,120
He cuts the skin off the tips of his
fingers. That's why we couldn't...

1172
01:35:40,187 --> 01:35:42,356
find 1 print in his apartment.

1173
01:35:42,423 --> 01:35:44,692
Seems he's done that for a while.

1174
01:35:44,758 --> 01:35:47,361
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1175
01:35:47,428 --> 01:35:49,530
So far everything is a dead end.

1176
01:35:49,597 --> 01:35:52,366
No credit history.
No employment records.

1177
01:35:52,433 --> 01:35:55,636
A 5-year old bank account
opened with cash.

1178
01:35:55,703 --> 01:35:58,038
We've tried tracing his furniture.

1179
01:35:58,105 --> 01:35:59,807
All we know about him...

1180
01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:02,376
is that he's independently wealthy...

1181
01:36:02,943 --> 01:36:04,311
well-educated...

1182
01:36:04,378 --> 01:36:05,813
and totally insane.

1183
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,315
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1184
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:12,887
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.

1185
01:36:12,953 --> 01:36:17,157
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:36:17,224 --> 01:36:18,392
There he sits.

1187
01:36:18,459 --> 01:36:20,828
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1188
01:36:20,895 --> 01:36:22,162
He's not finished.

1189
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:25,332
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1190
01:36:25,966 --> 01:36:28,002
You know what I'm saying.

1191
01:36:28,068 --> 01:36:32,072
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1192
01:36:32,139 --> 01:36:33,674
He wouldn't just stop.

1193
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:35,743
So what the fuck, man?

1194
01:36:35,809 --> 01:36:39,413
He's 2 murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1195
01:36:40,481 --> 01:36:42,349
We'll wait for his plea.

1196
01:36:45,753 --> 01:36:45,886
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1197
01:36:45,886 --> 01:36:50,424
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:36:50,491 --> 01:36:55,529
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them...

1199
01:36:55,596 --> 01:36:57,698
and only at 6 o'clock today.

1200
01:36:57,765 --> 01:36:58,899
Why us?

1201
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,202
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:02,603 --> 01:37:04,371
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:04,438 --> 01:37:08,709
If they don't accept this offer,
these bodies will never be found.

1204
01:37:08,776 --> 01:37:11,412
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,215
We've got him.

1206
01:37:14,281 --> 01:37:17,218
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1207
01:37:17,284 --> 01:37:19,787
He'll get his free room and board,
cable TV.

1208
01:37:19,854 --> 01:37:23,891
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?

1209
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:28,295
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit...

1210
01:37:28,362 --> 01:37:32,733
and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.

1211
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,034
I don't like it.

1212
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:36,036
The law requires me to serve...

1213
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:39,640
my clients and their interests
as best I can.

1214
01:37:39,707 --> 01:37:41,909
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1215
01:37:41,976 --> 01:37:43,477
My client informs you that...

1216
01:37:43,544 --> 01:37:46,247
if you do not accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1217
01:37:47,147 --> 01:37:48,582
Let him try it.

1218
01:37:49,283 --> 01:37:50,484
I'd like to see it.

1219
01:37:50,551 --> 01:37:54,488
We know with the extreme nature
of these crimes I'd get him off...

1220
01:37:54,555 --> 01:37:55,990
with such a plea.

1221
01:37:56,056 --> 01:37:58,626
I won't let this conviction slide.

1222
01:37:58,692 --> 01:38:02,663
If you do accept under
his specific conditions, he'll sign...

1223
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:05,499
a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1224
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,135
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1225
01:38:09,737 --> 01:38:11,338
Full confession.

1226
01:38:11,405 --> 01:38:12,606
I'm in.

1227
01:38:12,673 --> 01:38:14,508
It must be both of you.

1228
01:38:15,843 --> 01:38:18,112
If he were to claim insanity...

1229
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:21,015
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:38:21,415 --> 01:38:23,517
That he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:38:23,584 --> 01:38:26,620
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.

1232
01:38:26,687 --> 01:38:30,191
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned...

1233
01:38:30,257 --> 01:38:32,626
about finding and burying them.

1234
01:38:32,693 --> 01:38:34,862
If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1235
01:38:34,929 --> 01:38:36,597
The lab report came.

1236
01:38:36,664 --> 01:38:39,366
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1237
01:38:39,433 --> 01:38:42,970
They found blood from Doe's fingers,
blood from...

1238
01:38:43,037 --> 01:38:46,473
the woman who's face he cut off,
and blood from...

1239
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,142
a third party...

1240
01:38:48,209 --> 01:38:50,044
as yet unidentified.

1241
01:38:53,447 --> 01:38:55,816
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1242
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,354
Let's finish it.

1243
01:39:04,058 --> 01:39:07,094
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out...

1244
01:39:07,161 --> 01:39:09,496
I want you to expect it.

1245
01:39:11,398 --> 01:39:12,666
I will.

1246
01:39:15,469 --> 01:39:20,341
If I accidentally shaved off a nipple,
would it be covered by workman's comp?

1247
01:39:24,912 --> 01:39:26,347
I suppose so.

1248
01:39:27,982 --> 01:39:30,851
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1249
01:39:30,918 --> 01:39:33,721
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:39:34,755 --> 01:39:37,958
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1251
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:48,035
You know...

1252
01:39:49,503 --> 01:39:50,538
Yeah.

1253
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:57,611
What?

1254
01:41:07,748 --> 01:41:09,517
Will this wind hurt us?

1255
01:41:58,799 --> 01:42:00,034
Who are you, John?

1256
01:42:00,968 --> 01:42:02,403
Who are you really?

1257
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:04,405
What do you mean?

1258
01:42:04,471 --> 01:42:08,375
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1259
01:42:08,442 --> 01:42:12,079
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1260
01:42:12,146 --> 01:42:13,981
Stay on your left up here.

1261
01:42:17,985 --> 01:42:19,186
Where are we heading?

1262
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:21,655
You'll see.

1263
01:42:22,256 --> 01:42:25,526
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?

1264
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,429
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1265
01:42:28,495 --> 01:42:31,265
You've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1266
01:42:32,566 --> 01:42:34,935
Wanting people to listen...

1267
01:42:35,002 --> 01:42:36,270
you can't just...

1268
01:42:36,337 --> 01:42:38,772
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1269
01:42:38,839 --> 01:42:41,342
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1270
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:44,345
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1271
01:42:44,411 --> 01:42:46,013
But the question is:

1272
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,283
Why're you so special
that people should listen?

1273
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:50,851
I'm not special.

1274
01:42:51,852 --> 01:42:53,954
I've never been exceptional.

1275
01:42:54,588 --> 01:42:57,358
This is, though. What I'm doing.

1276
01:42:57,424 --> 01:42:58,592
My work.

1277
01:42:58,659 --> 01:43:00,327
Your work, John?

1278
01:43:00,394 --> 01:43:01,595
Yes.

1279
01:43:02,096 --> 01:43:05,099
See, I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1280
01:43:06,267 --> 01:43:07,668
That's not true.

1281
01:43:07,735 --> 01:43:11,539
No, it is true. And the funny
thing is, all this work...

1282
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:16,443
in 2 months, no one'll care,
or give a shit, or even remember.

1283
01:43:17,044 --> 01:43:19,547
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1284
01:43:20,548 --> 01:43:22,316
But when this is done...

1285
01:43:23,551 --> 01:43:25,019
when it's finished...

1286
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,355
it's going to be...

1287
01:43:31,225 --> 01:43:34,161
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1288
01:43:34,628 --> 01:43:36,897
But they won't be able to deny.

1289
01:43:38,299 --> 01:43:40,000
Could the freak be more vague?

1290
01:43:40,968 --> 01:43:42,636
As far as master plans go...

1291
01:43:43,304 --> 01:43:45,573
I really can't wait for you to see.

1292
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:47,408
It's going to be something.

1293
01:43:48,409 --> 01:43:51,245
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1294
01:43:51,312 --> 01:43:54,582
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1295
01:43:54,648 --> 01:43:56,116
Don't want to miss it.

1296
01:43:56,183 --> 01:43:57,852
Oh, don't worry.

1297
01:43:58,252 --> 01:43:59,520
You won't.

1298
01:44:01,422 --> 01:44:03,357
You won't miss a thing.

1299
01:44:30,117 --> 01:44:31,619
What's so exciting?

1300
01:44:32,686 --> 01:44:34,822
It's not too far now.

1301
01:44:42,029 --> 01:44:46,567
I've tried to figure something in my
head. Maybe you can help me out.

1302
01:44:48,335 --> 01:44:52,273
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are, do you know...

1303
01:44:52,706 --> 01:44:54,241
that you're insane?

1304
01:44:54,975 --> 01:44:56,877
Maybe you're reading...

1305
01:44:56,944 --> 01:44:59,079
masturbating in your own feces...

1306
01:44:59,146 --> 01:45:01,148
Do you just stop and go:

1307
01:45:01,215 --> 01:45:04,818
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1308
01:45:04,885 --> 01:45:07,588
You know? Do you guys do that?

1309
01:45:07,988 --> 01:45:10,991
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1310
01:45:11,058 --> 01:45:12,326
It's very comfortable.

1311
01:45:12,993 --> 01:45:16,163
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1312
01:45:16,664 --> 01:45:19,767
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1313
01:45:19,834 --> 01:45:21,001
Whatever.

1314
01:45:21,068 --> 01:45:23,337
I don't doubt that you believe that.

1315
01:45:24,071 --> 01:45:26,106
but it seems that you're...

1316
01:45:26,173 --> 01:45:28,275
overlooking a contradiction.

1317
01:45:28,342 --> 01:45:29,743
Meaning what?

1318
01:45:30,744 --> 01:45:32,346
Glad you asked.

1319
01:45:34,014 --> 01:45:35,783
If you were chosen...

1320
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:38,285
that is, by a higher...

1321
01:45:38,352 --> 01:45:40,287
power...

1322
01:45:40,354 --> 01:45:42,456
and if your hand was forced...

1323
01:45:42,857 --> 01:45:46,193
it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment.

1324
01:45:46,594 --> 01:45:49,129
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1325
01:45:50,197 --> 01:45:53,367
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1326
01:45:54,869 --> 01:45:56,036
John?

1327
01:46:00,941 --> 01:46:05,713
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me...

1328
01:46:05,779 --> 01:46:07,481
in a room without windows.

1329
01:46:08,349 --> 01:46:09,717
Isn't that true?

1330
01:46:10,284 --> 01:46:11,719
How'd you like to...

1331
01:46:11,785 --> 01:46:14,822
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1332
01:46:14,889 --> 01:46:16,657
I would never.

1333
01:46:16,724 --> 01:46:19,493
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1334
01:46:20,628 --> 01:46:23,664
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:46:23,731 --> 01:46:26,400
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:46:26,967 --> 01:46:29,837
I won't deny my own personal desire...

1337
01:46:29,904 --> 01:46:32,072
to turn each sin against
the sinner.

1338
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:36,343
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1339
01:46:38,312 --> 01:46:41,015
Innocent? Is that supposed
to be funny?

1340
01:46:41,749 --> 01:46:43,417
An obese man.

1341
01:46:43,484 --> 01:46:46,020
Disgusting man who could barely stand.

1342
01:46:46,086 --> 01:46:50,591
You'd point him out to your friends
so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1343
01:46:50,658 --> 01:46:55,095
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1344
01:46:55,829 --> 01:46:59,400
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1345
01:46:59,767 --> 01:47:02,870
This is a man who dedicated
his life...

1346
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:07,708
to making money by lying with every
breath he could muster to keep...

1347
01:47:07,775 --> 01:47:09,710
murderers and rapists...

1348
01:47:09,777 --> 01:47:11,445
- on the streets.
- Murderers?

1349
01:47:12,346 --> 01:47:14,582
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman...

1350
01:47:14,648 --> 01:47:17,551
so ugly inside that she
couldn't go on living...

1351
01:47:17,618 --> 01:47:19,954
if she couldn't be beautiful outside?

1352
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:24,391
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget...

1353
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:27,261
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:47:29,496 --> 01:47:31,966
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:47:32,032 --> 01:47:35,870
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1356
01:47:38,873 --> 01:47:40,574
But that's the point.

1357
01:47:41,976 --> 01:47:45,145
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:47:45,212 --> 01:47:46,747
in every home and we...

1359
01:47:47,214 --> 01:47:48,148
tolerate it.

1360
01:47:48,716 --> 01:47:51,485
We tolerate it because it's common.

1361
01:47:51,552 --> 01:47:52,987
It's trivial.

1362
01:47:53,554 --> 01:47:56,156
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1363
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,262
Well, not anymore.

1364
01:48:03,731 --> 01:48:05,599
I'm setting the example.

1365
01:48:07,168 --> 01:48:08,936
And what I've done will be...

1366
01:48:09,003 --> 01:48:10,337
puzzled over...

1367
01:48:10,838 --> 01:48:12,339
and studied...

1368
01:48:13,507 --> 01:48:14,942
and followed...

1369
01:48:16,744 --> 01:48:17,945
forever.

1370
01:48:18,679 --> 01:48:19,947
Yeah.

1371
01:48:21,182 --> 01:48:22,416
Delusions of grandeur.

1372
01:48:24,518 --> 01:48:26,287
You should be thanking me.

1373
01:48:26,754 --> 01:48:28,122
Why's that, John?

1374
01:48:28,189 --> 01:48:31,358
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1375
01:48:31,425 --> 01:48:35,362
Realize, Detective, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1376
01:48:35,429 --> 01:48:37,531
is that I wanted to be.

1377
01:48:37,598 --> 01:48:40,301
No. We would have got you eventually.

1378
01:48:40,367 --> 01:48:41,802
Oh, really?

1379
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:46,106
So what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1380
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:49,710
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die until...

1381
01:48:49,777 --> 01:48:52,213
you felt like springing your trap?

1382
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:54,215
What was the indisputable...

1383
01:48:54,281 --> 01:48:57,318
evidence you were going to use on me,
right before...

1384
01:48:57,384 --> 01:49:01,055
I walked up to you and put my hands
in the air?

1385
01:49:01,121 --> 01:49:03,324
John. Calm down.

1386
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:05,893
I remember us knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:06,794 --> 01:49:08,162
That's right.

1388
01:49:08,229 --> 01:49:11,565
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:18,639
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:18,706 --> 01:49:20,407
Okay. Sit back.

1391
01:49:20,474 --> 01:49:22,510
- I spared you.
- Sit back.

1392
01:49:22,576 --> 01:49:25,079
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1393
01:49:25,145 --> 01:49:27,348
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:49:27,414 --> 01:49:30,918
or should I say for the rest
of what life I allow you...

1395
01:49:30,985 --> 01:49:32,353
to have.

1396
01:49:32,419 --> 01:49:34,355
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1397
01:49:34,421 --> 01:49:35,990
Shut your fucking mouth!

1398
01:49:37,491 --> 01:49:41,929
You're no messiah. You're a movie
of the week. A fucking tee shirt...

1399
01:49:42,329 --> 01:49:43,864
at best.

1400
01:49:57,111 --> 01:49:59,446
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:49:59,513 --> 01:50:03,884
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:03,951 --> 01:50:08,556
Is that to say, John, that what
you were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:14,562
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:16,797 --> 01:50:19,233
Do you see those high-tension towers?

1405
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:21,135
That's where we're headed.

1406
01:50:21,202 --> 01:50:23,804
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1407
01:50:37,985 --> 01:50:40,821
There sure as shit is no ambush
out here.

1408
01:50:40,888 --> 01:50:42,990
No fucking nothing out here.

1409
01:50:43,824 --> 01:50:46,994
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.

1410
01:50:47,061 --> 01:50:49,163
I want you to go way up.

1411
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:52,600
In thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1412
01:51:54,562 --> 01:51:55,496
I'll get him.

1413
01:52:02,403 --> 01:52:03,571
Get out.

1414
01:52:04,471 --> 01:52:05,739
Slowly.

1415
01:52:06,473 --> 01:52:07,675
Stop.

1416
01:52:08,475 --> 01:52:09,743
Stay.

1417
01:52:12,913 --> 01:52:14,181
What do you got?

1418
01:52:15,749 --> 01:52:17,017
A dead dog.

1419
01:52:18,752 --> 01:52:20,487
I didn't do that.

1420
01:52:27,161 --> 01:52:28,362
What time is it?

1421
01:52:29,163 --> 01:52:30,030
Why?

1422
01:52:30,431 --> 01:52:31,832
I'd like to know.

1423
01:52:35,169 --> 01:52:36,270
7:01.

1424
01:52:39,507 --> 01:52:40,674
It's close.

1425
01:52:41,609 --> 01:52:42,877
Let's go take a look.

1426
01:52:46,514 --> 01:52:47,715
It's this way.

1427
01:53:36,163 --> 01:53:38,432
Down. Down. Down.

1428
01:53:40,167 --> 01:53:41,335
Watch him.

1429
01:53:42,903 --> 01:53:43,971
There he goes.

1430
01:53:45,072 --> 01:53:47,241
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1431
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:56,317
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1432
01:54:03,924 --> 01:54:05,459
A van's coming down the road.

1433
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:06,961
From the north.

1434
01:54:16,337 --> 01:54:20,307
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1435
01:54:26,113 --> 01:54:27,147
Get out!

1436
01:54:29,783 --> 01:54:30,818
Out!

1437
01:54:30,885 --> 01:54:33,053
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1438
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,388
Step away.

1439
01:54:35,122 --> 01:54:37,124
Turn around. Hands on your head.

1440
01:54:37,725 --> 01:54:38,959
What's going on?

1441
01:54:39,894 --> 01:54:41,061
Why are you here?

1442
01:54:41,128 --> 01:54:45,065
I'm delivering a package
for this guy, David.

1443
01:54:45,132 --> 01:54:46,500
Detective...

1444
01:54:46,567 --> 01:54:47,835
David Mills.

1445
01:54:54,975 --> 01:54:56,911
Get it. Slowly.

1446
01:55:09,557 --> 01:55:12,259
A guy paid me $500
to bring it out here.

1447
01:55:12,326 --> 01:55:14,528
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.

1448
01:55:15,095 --> 01:55:16,363
Put it down.

1449
01:55:17,498 --> 01:55:18,866
We got a box.

1450
01:55:18,933 --> 01:55:21,535
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1451
01:55:21,602 --> 01:55:23,237
Bomb squad. We got a box.

1452
01:55:23,304 --> 01:55:24,872
Face the van.

1453
01:55:25,606 --> 01:55:26,774
Hands up.

1454
01:55:34,515 --> 01:55:35,382
Turn.

1455
01:55:37,051 --> 01:55:38,385
Okay. Go.

1456
01:55:38,452 --> 01:55:39,954
Off you go. Go.

1457
01:55:42,156 --> 01:55:44,258
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1458
01:55:47,895 --> 01:55:49,330
He's headed north, along the road.

1459
01:55:49,396 --> 01:55:50,664
Have him picked up.

1460
01:56:00,341 --> 01:56:01,942
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

1461
01:56:08,516 --> 01:56:10,017
I'm going to open it.

1462
01:56:10,084 --> 01:56:13,287
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1463
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:33,807
It's blood.

1464
01:56:33,874 --> 01:56:36,477
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.

1465
01:56:36,544 --> 01:56:40,147
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1466
01:57:07,808 --> 01:57:09,343
California, stay away from here.

1467
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:12,012
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.

1468
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:14,148
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1469
01:57:15,082 --> 01:57:17,184
John Doe has the upper hand.

1470
01:57:18,752 --> 01:57:20,087
Here he comes.

1471
01:57:20,154 --> 01:57:22,089
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1472
01:57:22,156 --> 01:57:24,358
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.

1473
01:57:24,425 --> 01:57:25,626
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1474
01:57:27,161 --> 01:57:28,996
Do you hear me, Detective?

1475
01:57:29,063 --> 01:57:30,731
I'm trying to tell you how much...

1476
01:57:30,798 --> 01:57:33,300
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1477
01:57:34,235 --> 01:57:35,402
What?

1478
01:57:35,469 --> 01:57:36,670
Tracy.

1479
01:57:37,571 --> 01:57:40,174
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1480
01:57:40,241 --> 01:57:43,177
how easily a member of the press
can purchase...

1481
01:57:43,244 --> 01:57:45,179
information from the men
in your precinct.

1482
01:57:45,246 --> 01:57:47,081
What the fuck?

1483
01:57:47,147 --> 01:57:49,350
Throw your gun down!

1484
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:51,418
I visited your home this morning...

1485
01:57:52,253 --> 01:57:53,921
after you left.

1486
01:57:54,755 --> 01:57:56,557
I tried to play husband.

1487
01:57:57,091 --> 01:58:00,694
I tried to taste the life
of a simple man.

1488
01:58:00,761 --> 01:58:02,029
Throw it away!

1489
01:58:02,096 --> 01:58:04,265
It didn't work out.

1490
01:58:04,331 --> 01:58:06,100
So...

1491
01:58:06,166 --> 01:58:08,102
I took a souvenir.

1492
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:11,672
Her pretty head.

1493
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:19,046
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.

1494
01:58:19,113 --> 01:58:20,381
What's goin' on over there?

1495
01:58:20,447 --> 01:58:22,483
Would you... Put the gun down.

1496
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:23,951
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?

1497
01:58:24,018 --> 01:58:25,886
Because I envy your normal life.

1498
01:58:25,953 --> 01:58:27,121
Put the gun down, David.

1499
01:58:27,188 --> 01:58:29,056
It seems that envy is my sin.

1500
01:58:29,123 --> 01:58:31,058
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.

1501
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:32,560
What's in the fucking box?

1502
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,628
He just told you.

1503
01:58:34,695 --> 01:58:37,865
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!

1504
01:58:38,199 --> 01:58:41,368
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.

1505
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:46,874
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.

1506
01:58:46,941 --> 01:58:49,143
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1507
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:50,477
She's all right. You tell me.

1508
01:58:50,544 --> 01:58:51,745
Become...

1509
01:58:51,812 --> 01:58:52,913
wrath.

1510
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,148
Tell me she's all right!

1511
01:58:54,715 --> 01:58:56,250
If you murder a suspect, David...

1512
01:58:57,551 --> 01:58:59,653
you just throw it all away
and he knows it.

1513
01:59:00,287 --> 01:59:02,423
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!

1514
01:59:02,489 --> 01:59:04,758
She begged for her life...

1515
01:59:04,825 --> 01:59:06,827
and for the life of the baby
inside of her.

1516
01:59:25,346 --> 01:59:26,680
He didn't know.

1517
01:59:40,528 --> 01:59:42,196
Give me the gun, David.

1518
01:59:50,204 --> 01:59:51,805
If you kill him...

1519
01:59:53,274 --> 01:59:54,642
he will win.

1520
01:59:58,946 --> 02:00:00,814
Oh God!

1521
02:00:00,881 --> 02:00:02,316
Oh God!

1522
02:01:11,785 --> 02:01:13,387
Well, we'll take care of him.

1523
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:24,398
Whatever he needs.

1524
02:01:25,533 --> 02:01:27,101
Where you gonna be?

1525
02:01:29,803 --> 02:01:31,071
Around.

1526
02:01:35,543 --> 02:01:36,977
I'll be around.

1527
02:01:41,315 --> 02:01:43,651
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1528
02:01:43,717 --> 02:01:47,421
The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1529
02:01:48,989 --> 02:01:51,091
I agree with the second part.
