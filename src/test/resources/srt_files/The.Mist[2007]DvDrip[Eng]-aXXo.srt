00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,603
(Thunder crashes)

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,507
(Swing music playing)

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,169
(Rain falling)

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,702
(Music ceases)

6
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,018
BILLY: Whoa!

7
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,196
STEPHANIE:
All the food's gonna go bad!

8
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,135
Yeah, I drew up a list.

9
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,473
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

10
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,203
F*ck!

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,749
- Can you save it?
- No! No way!

12
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,411
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

13
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,751
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

14
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,414
see if they can extend my deadline.

15
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,319
STEPHANIE:
What choice do they have?

16
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,918
(David sighs heavily)

17
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:10,985
You kiddin'?

18
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,897
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,231
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

20
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,202
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

21
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,932
Just stupid, I guess.

22
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,997
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

23
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,009
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

24
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,510
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

25
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,136
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

26
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,374
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

27
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,041
Order in some new glass.

28
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,850
Oh, you know what?
That was your...

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,480
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

30
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,286
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

31
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,519
It's just stuff, though.

32
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,118
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

33
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,356
Yeah.

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,920
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,728
Hey, Billy, take it easy,
all right?

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,529
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

37
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,694
But you gotta come look.

38
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,762
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
Billy.

40
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,134
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

41
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,576
Whoa!

42
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,077
Whoa.

43
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,081
- Whoa.
- Come on.

44
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,083
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

45
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,745
- BILLY: Come on!
- (Stephanie chuckles)

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,811
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

47
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,553
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,652
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

49
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,718
No.

50
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,728
- Norton's tree.
- (sighs) Yeah.

51
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,273
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

52
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,502
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

53
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,566
That tree?

54
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,805
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

55
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,878
Look at that.

56
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,313
What is it, Daddy?

57
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,312
Mist.

58
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,759
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

59
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Coming off the mountain like that?

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,321
Two fronts meeting,

61
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,629
left over from the storm,
something like that.

62
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,192
You sure?

63
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,703
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

64
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,932
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

65
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,338
I'll take him to town with me.

66
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,807
Okay. Where you going?

67
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,970
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

68
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,138
Hon.

69
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,205
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

70
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,614
You know what he's gonna say.

71
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,710
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

72
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,585
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy

73
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,090
is enough to last me a lifetime.

74
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,820
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

75
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,883
Okay.

76
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,953
- That's all.
- Yeah.

77
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,795
(Norton grunting,
pulling chainsaw chain)

78
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,495
NORTON: Ohh!
Mother f*cker!

79
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,140
Aw, shit!

80
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,676
Ohh, you mother f*cker!

81
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,001
Cock sucker!

82
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,170
"Turn on.

83
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,444
"Full choke.

84
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,679
Pull five... choke."

85
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,615
I guess you've seen the...

86
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,183
boathouse.

87
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,593
Yeah, and...?

88
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,291
Nothin'.

89
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,698
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

90
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,758
That's all.

91
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,396
(scoffs)

92
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,963
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me.

93
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,176
Oh.

94
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,237
Shit. The 1980.

95
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,180
NORTON: I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

96
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,482
I don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of New York,

97
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,783
I just...
You know, top down.

98
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,584
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

99
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,147
Sincerely.

100
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,523
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

101
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,223
I hate to see it like that.

102
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,658
Okay, I'll tell you what,

103
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,534
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

104
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,163
- That okay?
- No problem.

105
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,502
So, uh, David...

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,683
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

107
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,295
DAVID:
Well, CMP's out in force.

108
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,797
Maybe we'll get our power back.

109
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,897
NORTON:
I know. Some storm, huh?

110
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,271
One for the books, yeah.

111
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,003
For a moment there last night,

112
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,511
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,639
WZON is off the air,

114
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,945
but Portland's still broadcasting.

115
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,006
Daddy, look.

116
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,917
Ah.

117
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,852
Guys from the base.

118
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,480
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

119
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,149
The Arrowhead Project?

120
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,983
Well, you're a local.

121
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,825
Any idea what they do up there?

122
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,387
Missile defense research.

123
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,296
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

124
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,356
Oh, sure.

125
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,835
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

126
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,998
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

127
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,837
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

128
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,503
Miss Tabloid.
(chuckles)

129
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,240
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

130
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,076
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

131
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,483
You know, real reliable stuff.

132
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,714
DAVID: Well, they're in a hurry.

133
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,454
Maybe their power's out too.

134
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,692
Huh. Still no signal.

135
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,968
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

136
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,736
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

137
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,608
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

138
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,668
- BILLY: Yeah.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,339
Here's a list.

140
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,746
- Sure.
- Okay?

141
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,011
Meet you guys in there.

142
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,075
Hold hands.

143
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,189
MAN: I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was your sister.

144
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,592
(pulsing tone)

145
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,597
(clicks phone cradle;
pulsing tone continues)

146
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,724
BOY: That looks so freaky!

147
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,789
Hmm.

148
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,597
(chatter)

149
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,234
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

150
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,869
You guys look jammed up.

151
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,074
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

152
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,481
Oh, no. What,
no backup generator?

153
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,041
Only to keep the food cold.

154
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,677
Everything else,
welcome to the Dark Ages,

155
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,846
and bring your checkbook.

156
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,413
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

157
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,926
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

158
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,554
Oh, my God.

159
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,120
OLLIE: (humorless chuckle)
The storm.

160
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,292
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

161
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,528
Crappy day, huh?

162
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,094
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

163
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,003
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

164
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,735
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

165
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,041
but I guess we'll have to make do.

166
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,506
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

167
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,309
Hey, champ.

168
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,820
Your wife should be a doctor.

169
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,052
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

170
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,924
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

171
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,157
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

172
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,220
Okay, done.

173
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,130
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

174
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,933
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

175
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,535
Oh, I don't know.

176
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,938
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

177
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,316
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

178
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,375
I guess not.

179
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,783
And that's a start, huh?

180
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,815
BUD: I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

181
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,884
The power outage got us too.

182
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,624
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

183
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,327
(indistinct conversation)

184
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,393
(chuckles)

185
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,170
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

186
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,235
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

187
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,648
(customers chattering)

188
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,585
BUD: I need some change
on register five.

189
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,246
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

190
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,586
BILLY: Hello, Ms. Reppler.

191
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,821
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.

192
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,556
How'd you hold up in the storm?

193
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,791
We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

194
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,025
right in my studio.

195
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,069
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

196
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,125
IRENE: Ouch.

197
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,695
- Yeah.
- IRENE: Sorry to hear that.

198
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,941
DAVID:
How'd you guys make out?

199
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,174
HATTIE: Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

200
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,080
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

201
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,812
IRENE: We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

202
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,878
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

203
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,483
but with funds being cut every year...

204
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,027
You'd think educating children

205
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,290
would be more
of a priority in this country,

206
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,457
but you'd be wrong.

207
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,660
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

208
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,399
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

209
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,465
(passing sirens wail)

210
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,679
(fire truck horn blares)

211
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,544
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

212
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,419
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

213
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,982
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

214
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,588
SOLDIER: Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

215
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,687
Check our papers.

216
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,755
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

217
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,821
I don't know why.

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,891
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

219
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,437
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

220
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,494
That's an order.

221
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,500
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

222
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,117
(Klaxon blares)

223
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,322
(Klaxon continues)

224
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,304
Oh, my God!

225
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,986
Something in the mist!

226
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,921
- (excited shouting)
- Something in the mist...

227
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,481
...took John Lee!

228
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,891
Dan, catch your breath.

229
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,826
Something in the mist took John Lee.

230
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,659
I could hear him screaming.

231
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,667
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

232
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,396
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

233
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,461
(Klaxon blares)

234
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,896
DAN: Don't go out there.

235
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,205
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

236
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,768
MAN: Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

237
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,337
Mister, no!

238
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,440
(police siren wails)

239
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,179
(police siren ceases)

240
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,622
(keys jangling)

241
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,165
(man screaming)

242
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,104
Please hold me.

243
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,173
- (Billy whimpers)
- It's okay, it's okay.

244
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,381
CORNELL: It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

245
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,549
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

246
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,416
MAN: (whispering)
What is it?

247
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,152
What's going on?

248
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,493
It's death.

249
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,558
Aah!

250
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,537
(crashing and rumbling)

251
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,596
(screaming and shouting)

252
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,484
(screaming)

253
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,320
(building girders groaning)

254
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,703
- (screaming and shouting)
- MAN: Stay down!

255
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,066
BILLY: Daddy!

256
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,234
(rumbling stops)

257
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,073
(woman coughing)

258
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,736
(woman weeping)

259
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,043
MAN: (faintly)
You okay?

260
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,516
(coughing)

261
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,750
That was an earthquake.

262
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,060
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

263
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,589
OLLIE: Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

264
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,967
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

265
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,905
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

266
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,069
MRS. CARMODY: No.
No, don't go out there.

267
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,942
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

268
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,039
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

269
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,949
NORTON: Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

270
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,010
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

271
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,487
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

272
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,925
I'm sorry, l... I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

273
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,894
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

274
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,657
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

275
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,221
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

276
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,961
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

277
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,400
WOMAN: You're not listening!

278
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,665
I can't stay here.

279
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,640
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only 8.

280
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,578
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

281
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,913
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

282
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,419
She's only 8.

283
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,925
For their sakes,

284
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,324
don't.

285
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,024
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

286
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,503
DAVID: (softly)
Shh. It's okay, pal.

287
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,199
Won't somebody here
see a lady home?

288
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,376
You?

289
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,048
You?

290
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,796
- DAVID: (softly) It's okay, buddy.
- You?

291
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,169
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

292
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,810
I hope you all rot in hell.

293
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,075
OLLIE:
Ma'am, please, wait until...

294
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,837
(soft weeping)

295
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,744
BUD: Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

296
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,482
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

297
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,218
Aisle three has medical supplies.

298
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,125
- (Billy crying)
- It's okay. It's okay.

299
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,890
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

300
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,953
Come on.

301
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,694
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

302
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,429
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

303
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,834
Come on!

304
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,895
Come on,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

305
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,305
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

306
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,865
All right, I know you want Mommy.

307
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,411
(very softly)
All right, just try to breathe.

308
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,810
Just try to breathe, okay?

309
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,246
(Billy crying)

310
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,146
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

311
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,878
- (Billy crying)
- It's all right.

312
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,582
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old.

313
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,455
AMANDA: He's in shock.

314
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,256
I think we all are.

315
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,693
IRENE: You haven't met.

316
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,597
Amanda Dunfrey.

317
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,826
She's new in town
as of this semester.

318
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,325
Teaches third grade

319
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,668
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

320
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,674
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

321
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,837
And David's an artist.

322
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,881
He does movie posters and such.

323
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,937
And me...

324
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:09,419
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

325
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,978
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

326
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,284
Boy settle down?

327
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,847
How is he?

328
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,984
Still hot.

329
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,550
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

330
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,493
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

331
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,088
Thanks.

332
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,655
DAVID: How's Dan?

333
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,564
His nose stopped bleedin'.

334
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,967
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

335
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,129
Can't believe the way he ran in here.

336
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,302
Never seen him like that.

337
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,675
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

338
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,608
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

339
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,743
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

340
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,912
You bet. Sally, you mind?

341
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,320
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

342
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,790
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

343
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,849
Daddy, don't go.

344
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,090
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

345
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,064
Mrs. Reppler's here,

346
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,124
and so is Mrs. Turman.

347
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,659
I'll be close by, okay?

348
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,331
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

349
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,396
Let me look at you.

350
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,267
Hmm?

351
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,139
HATTIE: Wanna lie down?

352
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,204
Yeah.

353
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,546
There you go.

354
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,282
NORTON: Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

355
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,789
but we have to be smart about it.

356
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,519
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

357
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,151
and find out what's happened.

358
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,718
MAN: Well, Howe gonna
do that, my man?

359
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,390
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

360
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,026
NORTON: I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

361
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,332
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

362
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,393
would be their top priority.

363
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,463
(machinery hums)

364
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,642
(David coughs)

365
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,344
(coughing)
Jeez!

366
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,893
(coughs)

367
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,034
Oh, shit.

368
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,032
- (sharp crack)
- Ow!

369
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,002
Shit!

370
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,346
(grunts)

371
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,512
God damn it!

372
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,578
Ow! Ow!

373
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,782
Bitch!

374
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,018
NORTON: It's obvious that we're...

375
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,084
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

376
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,790
MAN: Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

377
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,196
CORNELL: There ain't nothin'
natural about it either.

378
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,256
MAN: That's right.

379
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,997
MRS. CARMODY: It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

380
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,562
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

381
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,130
MAN: Ohh, f*ck, now.

382
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,869
MRS. CARMODY:
You've done that to yourself,

383
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,843
by a life of sin and dissolution.

384
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,889
(metal rumbling and creaking)

385
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,817
(rumbling and creaking cease)

386
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,160
(metal rumbling and creaking)

387
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,334
(creaking loudly)

388
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,852
Hey, whoa! David!

389
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,292
DAVID: Hey, you guys hear that?

390
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,262
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

391
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,196
No, no, I turned the generator off.

392
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,257
It... it was backing up.

393
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,270
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

394
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,970
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

395
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,807
back there in the dark.

396
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,370
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

397
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,975
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

398
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,917
No, only after.

399
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,251
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

400
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,382
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

401
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,120
JIM: No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be that away, Mr. Drayton.

402
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,253
You had a scare, no doubt.

403
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,991
What say we all go check it out?

404
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,498
Here.

405
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,436
JIM: Oooopf!
(chuckles)

406
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,496
Man.

407
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,668
It's pretty rank in here.

408
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,871
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

409
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,113
Go on, fire it up.

410
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,948
(generator whirrs to life)

411
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,124
JIM: (laughing)
All right!

412
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,287
Shut it off!

413
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,093
Holy crow, don't that stink!

414
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,432
MYRON: Something's
got the exhaust vent

415
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,128
plugged up from the outside.

416
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,637
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

417
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,195
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

418
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,433
No, no, you can't do that.

419
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,499
MYRON: Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

420
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,569
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

421
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,977
MYRON: Okay, I'll do it.

422
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,948
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

423
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,007
What, don't you think I can do it?

424
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,713
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

425
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,278
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

426
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,948
- J-Jim, right?
- JIM: Mm-hmm.

427
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,515
Myron? You guys are...

428
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,688
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

429
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,321
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

430
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,059
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

431
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,296
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

432
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,529
NORM: Like what?

433
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,738
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

434
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,297
Are you guys being wilfully dense?

435
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,707
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

436
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,441
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

437
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,346
I mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?

438
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,406
Anybody?

439
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,741
See?

440
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,014
(Jim chuckles)

441
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,114
Now, I know, I know...
you're a big shot artist

442
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,682
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

443
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,058
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

444
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,494
Hey, I didn't say that.

445
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,896
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

446
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,935
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

447
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,164
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

448
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,603
The food'll keep without it.

449
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,403
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

450
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,103
and you yell out
when you got enough room.

451
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,702
Yeah. Okay, good.

452
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,542
DAVID: Wait.

453
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,603
This is...

454
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,582
You guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

455
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,380
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

456
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,886
Would you just
shut the f*ck up already?

457
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,943
OLLIE: Norm!

458
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,013
JIM: Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

459
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,081
The next time
you got somethin' to say,

460
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,524
you count your teeth,

461
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,927
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

462
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,487
All right?

463
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,555
Come on, Myron.

464
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,294
- DAVID: This is crazy!
- OLLIE: Leave 'em be.

465
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,336
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

466
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,895
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

467
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,304
What's going on here?

468
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,137
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

469
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,201
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

470
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,303
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

471
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,870
- MYRON: Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

472
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,314
Norm, come on.

473
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,372
Don't, man.

474
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,684
(generator whirrs to life)

475
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,915
DAVID: It's a mistake.

476
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,689
Pussy.

477
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,293
Go up!

478
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,616
So...

479
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,181
any boogeymen?

480
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,750
(Jim laughs)

481
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,586
JIM: Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

482
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,723
Yeah, right.

483
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
(laughter)

484
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,958
MYRON: Norm.

485
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,730
Norm!

486
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,103
What the f*ck!

487
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,732
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

488
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,709
Get this friggin' thing off me!

489
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,507
Get it off! Help me!

490
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,375
Help me! Help me!

491
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,915
Aah! Aaahhh!

492
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,382
Jesus!

493
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,115
(Norm shouting)

494
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:06,619
There's more! There's more!

495
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,631
Somebody help me.

496
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,159
Somebody help me.

497
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,898
What the f*ck are you waitin' for?

498
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,940
(Norm crying and shouting)

499
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,678
Aaahhhh!

500
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,683
Hang on!

501
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,417
Aaahhhh!

502
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,592
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

503
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,425
Aaahhhh!

504
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,565
Oh, Jesus!

505
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,178
(Norm grunting and straining)

506
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,782
(monster sniffing)

507
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,255
MYRON: Aah!

508
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,758
Aah!

509
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,636
JIM: Shit! Oh, shit!

510
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,803
Oh, shit!

511
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,742
OLLIE: David, it's no good!

512
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,805
Aah!

513
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,374
DAVID: Start the generator.

514
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,012
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

515
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,722
Gaaahhhh!

516
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,566
(Norm screams)

517
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,123
(monster shrieks)

518
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,918
Hey, I'm sorry.

519
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,086
I mean, how the...

520
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,185
how the hell was I supposed
to know what you meant?

521
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,224
You said you heard something.

522
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,057
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

523
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,329
You should've said
what you meant better.

524
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,895
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or something.

525
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,339
You got that kid killed!

526
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,377
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

527
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,607
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

528
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,875
- Huh?
- David!

529
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,280
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

530
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,183
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

531
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,244
And I got his f*ckin' blood on me!

532
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,750
(groaning)

533
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,065
(David panting)

534
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,136
Okay, I'm done.

535
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,235
Okay.

536
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,806
What's next?

537
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,343
Kill the generator.

538
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,014
That's the first thing.

539
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,291
JIM: I'm sorry.

540
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,092
DAVID:
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

541
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,728
JIM: I'm... I'm sorry about the kid.

542
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,967
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

543
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,740
We oughta get out of here.

544
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,143
(coughing and retching)

545
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,412
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

546
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,782
Yeah, he's a f*ckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

547
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,687
What's your excuse, huh?

548
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,223
Get outta here.

549
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,126
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

550
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,433
Don't say anything, to anybody.

551
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,027
Not yet.

552
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,595
Not yet.

553
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,537
(generator whirrs)

554
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,606
(generator stops)

555
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,643
OLLIE: (softly)
Shit.

556
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,953
David? Need a little light here.

557
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,566
We have to tell 'em.

558
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:16,470
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

559
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,106
They won't believe us.

560
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,400
They have to.

561
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,743
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was here.

562
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,875
W-what we saw was impossible.

563
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,885
You know that, don't you?

564
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:29,942
I mean, what...

565
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,953
what do we say?

566
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,620
How do we convince them?

567
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,623
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

568
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,806
Oh, my God!
Are... are you all right?

569
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,367
DAVID: Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

570
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,776
W-what the hell happened?

571
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,644
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?

572
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,706
I need to deal with something first.

573
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,211
Please, I've got to...

574
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,018
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

575
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,957
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

576
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,016
Okay.

577
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,702
JIM: Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm.

578
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,135
Me too.

579
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,604
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

580
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,971
Look, we need to tell people.

581
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,533
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

582
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,376
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.

583
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,914
People need to know.

584
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,540
MYRON:
What about the out-of-towners?

585
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,381
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

586
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,683
- OLLIE: Brent Norton?
- JIM: That windbag?

587
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,485
He's an important attorney
in New York.

588
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,719
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

589
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,285
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or anywhere.

590
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,887
- MYRON: Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

591
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,900
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

592
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,731
W-wait. What do you mean
getting in?

593
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,827
You shut the loading door.

594
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,466
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

595
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,303
Jesus Christ.

596
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,689
NORTON: I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

597
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,250
DAVID: Um, listen...

598
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,092
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

599
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,826
(conversation continues indistinctly)

600
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,096
...they're... they're...
We saw tentacles.

601
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,606
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

602
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,166
Unh-unh.

603
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,735
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got...

604
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,142
Come here.

605
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,207
Tell him.

606
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,276
It's true.

607
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,529
Tentacles. Yeah.

608
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,197
Um, gentlemen, um...

609
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,004
I'm sorry, l...
I'm just not that stupid.

610
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,478
I mean, what do you take me for?

611
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,242
I'm shocked.

612
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,305
I'm shocked.

613
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,511
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless

614
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,577
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot.

615
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,316
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

616
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,358
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

617
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,415
I'll show you.

618
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,088
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor.

619
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,153
No.

620
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,926
No? What do you mean no?

621
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,161
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

622
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,398
and this pathetic attempt at a joke

623
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,406
has gone far enough.

624
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,466
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have...?

625
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,170
Oh, please! Please!

626
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,736
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

627
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,646
and you guys are backing him up.

628
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,377
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

629
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,647
You wanted to humiliate me
some more,

630
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,052
show me a rubber snake
while these... these hicks

631
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,454
stand around laughing their asses off.

632
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,786
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

633
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,724
- Hey, hey, f*ck...!
- JIM: Mr. Norton...

634
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,388
...I swear, you have
got us all wrong.

635
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,958
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

636
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,061
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

637
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,006
and I have seen you
talking behind my back.

638
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,843
Y'all stick together.

639
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,842
Well, don't I feel foolish?

640
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,407
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

641
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,976
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

642
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,215
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

643
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,689
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

644
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,350
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

645
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,987
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

646
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,122
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David...

647
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,530
Okay, my son's life.
Now, I need you.

648
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,162
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass.

649
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,297
All right, I'll drag you
back there if I have to.

650
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,362
Come here.

651
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,433
David, get your goddamn hands
off of me!

652
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,445
I'll sue your ass again!

653
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,777
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

654
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,338
This man assaulted me.

655
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,044
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

656
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,108
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

657
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,814
No.

658
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,289
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

659
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,417
(scoffs)

660
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,623
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

661
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,326
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

662
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,698
Okay.

663
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,761
BUD: W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

664
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,329
You're drinking?

665
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,897
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

666
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,004
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

667
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,979
Look, I'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you.

668
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,016
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

669
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,074
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

670
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,985
But in the meantime,
shut the f*ck up and listen.

671
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,018
This is Mr. David Drayton.

672
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,424
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

673
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,156
DAVID: go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

674
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,561
Listen, don't be scared.

675
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,722
It's okay.

676
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,926
Okay.

677
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,436
This is how it is.

678
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,940
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

679
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,174
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like Dan said.

680
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,235
That's right.

681
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,645
That's exactly right.

682
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,581
MAN: What kind of things?

683
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,641
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

684
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,517
I got knocked down.

685
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,751
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

686
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,419
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

687
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,155
me...

688
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,720
Norm, the bag boy.

689
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,288
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

690
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:19,097
...so Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

691
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,031
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

692
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,095
Took him?

693
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,766
What do you mean?

694
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,504
Just... killed him.

695
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,443
I mean dragged him off.

696
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:34,075
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

697
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,642
All we saw were tentacles.

698
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,589
(onlookers muttering)

699
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,580
WOMAN: Tentacles?

700
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,354
NORTON: Tentacles, he says.

701
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,024
Tentacles from Planet X.

702
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,431
It's a lie, you know.

703
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,629
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

704
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,932
It's a pile of shit.

705
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,496
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie.

706
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:57,562
It's lunacy.

707
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,136
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

708
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,907
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it.

709
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,969
Go look.

710
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,710
DAVID: (softly)
Over there.

711
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,885
What the hell is that?

712
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,398
(sizzling sound)

713
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,695
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

714
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,371
Yeah, just keep 'em in line.
Thanks.

715
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,055
Let me...

716
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,598
help these people.

717
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,499
Let me...

718
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,561
let me preach your word.

719
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,008
Let me shine your light,

720
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,567
'cause they're not all bad.

721
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,911
They can't all be bad.

722
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,854
Some can be saved, can't they?

723
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,685
Yes.

724
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,248
Some can be brought...

725
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,525
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace.

726
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,825
I have to believe that,

727
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,301
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

728
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,600
If I can save a few...

729
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,933
even one...

730
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,436
then my life will have counted
for something.

731
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,282
I will have pulled my weight.

732
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,719
I will have earned my place
at your side.

733
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,123
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

734
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,683
Hello?

735
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,798
(Mrs. Carmody sniffles softly)

736
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,073
What?

737
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,375
I just need to use the bathroom.

738
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,437
Oh.

739
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,050
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

740
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,584
Ma'am...

741
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,528
l... I just want you to know
that it's okay...

742
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,258
being scared, I mean...

743
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,891
and, well, if you need a friend...

744
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,401
you know, someone to talk to.

745
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,461
I have a friend...

746
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:18,439
God up above.
I talk to him every day.

747
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,500
Don't you condescend to me.

748
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:21,703
I'm sorry?

749
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,306
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

750
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,009
That's not what I was doing.

751
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,009
Well, I'll tell you what...

752
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,918
the day I need a friend like you,

753
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,049
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

754
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,559
Maybe you do believe this.

755
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,726
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

756
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,034
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

757
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,131
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

758
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,131
You're not arguing a case,

759
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,768
and you're doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are.

760
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,837
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

761
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,348
You still haven't fooled anyone.

762
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,474
OLLIE: Leave it alone, David.

763
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,245
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

764
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,310
even when their hair is burning.

765
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,878
Denial is a powerful thing.

766
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,945
Well, keep talking.

767
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,357
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

768
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,123
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

769
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,132
There's no defense
against the will of God.

770
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,395
There's no court of appeals in hell.

771
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,869
There's no defense here, either.

772
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,168
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

773
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,731
not even if you stack it
as high as you can.

774
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,334
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

775
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,403
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

776
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,508
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

777
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,247
Those who want to stack dog food,

778
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,879
knock yourselves out.

779
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,957
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

780
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,189
It should help.

781
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,594
Yeah, think so?

782
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,463
Duct tape and dog food bags.

783
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,002
That bad?

784
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,061
It's not good.

785
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,303
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

786
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,170
Open your eyes.

787
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,510
Let the scales fall away.

788
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,573
This has all been written.

789
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,418
Revelations, chapter 15:

790
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,820
"And the temple was filled with smoke

791
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,052
"from the glory of God

792
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,525
"and from his power,

793
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,086
"and no one could enter the temple

794
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,156
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

795
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,531
Well, what are you saying?

796
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,935
What are you proposing?

797
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,596
That we all prepare...

798
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,506
to meet our Maker.

799
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,735
JIM: Oh, prepare to meet shit!

800
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,303
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

801
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,281
so that it can waggle at both ends.

802
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,113
MRS. CARMODY:
The end time has come,

803
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,948
not in flames, but in mist.

804
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,009
JIM: Come here!

805
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,214
MYRON: Easy! Back off!

806
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,315
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

807
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,381
How about that?

808
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,950
Hey, there's no call for that.

809
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,588
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

810
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,428
MRS. CARMODY: I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

811
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,695
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

812
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,827
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

813
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,497
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away.

814
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,440
Things in the mist...
do you doubt?

815
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,499
Do you?

816
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,013
Then go out.

817
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,447
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

818
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,506
Shut up, lady.

819
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,447
For God's sakes.

820
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,682
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

821
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,156
They should be scared.

822
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,921
Oh, yes, they should.

823
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,453
Their beautiful, pure little minds

824
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,022
have been corrupted with lies.

825
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,089
Lies.

826
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,261
All this talk of a modern God,

827
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,033
or no God.

828
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,767
There is one God.

829
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,502
The God of the Israelites.

830
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:42,408
And he is a stern and vengeful God,

831
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,039
and we have been mocking him
far too long,

832
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,778
and now he demands
retribution in blood.

833
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,514
It is time to declare yourselves.

834
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,248
Take sides...

835
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,154
the saved and the damned.

836
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,717
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

837
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,627
- Blood!
- What?

838
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,687
Blood.

839
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,561
Little Normie was first,

840
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:07,696
and now God calls the rest of us.

841
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,261
The bill is due.

842
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,829
It must be paid.

843
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,900
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

844
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,467
to prove his love for God, so...

845
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,741
- Enough.
- (onlookers gasp)

846
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,354
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

847
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,889
A few more pennies in the jar.

848
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,983
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

849
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,391
l-I'm sorry everybody,

850
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,454
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

851
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,021
MRS. CARMODY:
They'll come for you.

852
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,558
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

853
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,006
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

854
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,065
See if they don't.

855
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,872
And when they do,

856
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,573
you will cry to God,

857
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:54,311
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

858
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,715
OLLIE: That's fine.

859
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,051
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

860
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,114
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

861
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,523
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

862
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,085
And you, bitch...

863
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,053
you hit me again...

864
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,226
if you dare.

865
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,897
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

866
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,442
Those of you who aren't local
should know

867
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,346
that Mrs. Carmody
is known in town for being...

868
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,405
unstable.

869
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,885
No shit.
What was your first clue?

870
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
SOLDIER: Shh.

871
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,324
Hi.

872
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,555
What's up, little dude?

873
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,428
How come your friends
don't come get us?

874
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:42,988
They got tanks and stuff, right?

875
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,833
Why can't you just call 'em?

876
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,063
Phones don't work.

877
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,900
But don't you got, like, a radio?

878
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,462
Hey, champ, what's going on?

879
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,668
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

880
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,734
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

881
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,801
But...

882
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,744
Shh. Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

883
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,804
SOLDIER: Yeah, sure thing.

884
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,315
SOLDIER #2:
Troop, off your asses.

885
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,444
- DAVID: You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

886
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,852
Oh, man, I don't either.

887
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,390
But you know what?

888
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,189
Maybe she's scared too.

889
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,184
You think?

890
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,720
You think Mommy's okay?

891
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,064
(sighs)
Billy...

892
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,099
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

893
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,162
Aw, hey.

894
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,336
Mommy loves you very much.

895
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,902
And I'll bet she's fine.

896
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,739
And I promise you,

897
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

898
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:39,953
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

899
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,457
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

900
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,293
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops

901
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,694
to make torches.

902
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,629
And we've got knives and stuff,
God knows.

903
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
This may be
a silly question, Bud, but...

904
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,934
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?

905
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,770
Here? No. Please.

906
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,570
This... this isn't Los Angeles.

907
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,303
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

908
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,137
I could try for it if you want.

909
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,478
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

910
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,539
Hold on.

911
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,520
This gun, um...

912
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,487
my husband's idea.

913
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,548
He's away on business a lot.

914
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,786
It's not even loaded.

915
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,487
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

916
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:19,550
AMANDA: Um...

917
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,666
DAVID:
You know how to use that?

918
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,327
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.

919
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,893
Hit the target a few times.

920
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,500
So, we got a gun.

921
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,509
Anybody know how to shoot it?

922
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:34,941
Well, I mean?

923
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,001
I do.

924
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:39,771
You?

925
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,683
(scoffs)
Ollie. Please.

926
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,925
Some target shooting.

927
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,188
State champion in '94.

928
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,127
- MAN: You're crazy if you go out there!
- NORTON: Let us pass!

929
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,131
Let us pass, please!

930
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,188
Let's just talk this thing through.

931
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,428
NORTON: We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

932
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,529
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

933
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,938
- Why don't we just sit down and just...
- What, and let you keep on talking?

934
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,101
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

935
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,304
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

936
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,368
AMANDA: Your people?

937
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,278
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

938
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,782
Now... now listen, everyone.

939
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,842
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

940
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,911
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

941
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,891
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

942
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,258
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

943
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,956
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

944
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,691
is to seek rescue.

945
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,556
We're going out.

946
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,296
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

947
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,534
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

948
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,733
Tie this around your waist.

949
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,972
What for?

950
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,139
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

951
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,373
I'll do it.

952
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,420
Are you throwing in with them?

953
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,581
Me? No thanks.

954
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,148
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

955
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,421
Gonna get somebody killed.

956
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,293
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

957
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,026
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

958
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,262
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

959
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,327
Son, you got brass balls.

960
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,103
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

961
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,163
Drive it back.

962
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,873
All right.

963
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,607
Just see they're paying out this line.

964
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,876
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

965
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,440
just so you understand.

966
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,507
DAVID: Yeah.

967
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,459
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

968
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:33,517
David...

969
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,796
there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

970
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,859
What if you're wrong?

971
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,427
Then, I guess...

972
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,466
the joke would be on me after all.

973
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,011
We're gonna send back help.

974
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,484
You'll die out there.
All of you.

975
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,430
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

976
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,097
I just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole

977
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,504
you make him out to be.

978
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,304
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

979
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,901
You just chat it over at your leisure.

980
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,554
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

981
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,868
Keep it loose.

982
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,315
DAVID: Nice and easy.

983
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,655
OLLIE: (low)
Keep going.

984
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,631
(onlookers murmur)

985
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,301
JIM: Look.

986
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,745
It's going.

987
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,980
They're doing good.

988
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,582
Aah! Aaahhhh!

989
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,819
(onlookers screaming)

990
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,189
(cord whistles sharply)

991
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,267
MAN: Put it down!

992
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,605
Ohh! Pull!

993
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,914
MAN: Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

994
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,748
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

995
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,097
(onlookers scream and shout)

996
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,154
Get it off!

997
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,565
Oh, my God.

998
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,209
(woman sobbing)

999
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,750
- JIM: Aw, sh...
- MRS. CARMODY: Blood!

1000
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,547
Awww, sh...!

1001
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,281
MRS. CARMODY'
Oh, my God!

1002
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,754
- (onlookers shouting)
- Oh, my God!

1003
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,057
(onlookers screaming)

1004
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,570
Cut the rope!

1005
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,276
Shut the door!

1006
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,075
Now do you see?

1007
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,578
Now do you believe?

1008
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,820
OLLIE:
About a half-hour of daylight left.

1009
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:33,922
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

1010
00:54:33,994 --> 00:54:35,325
We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.

1011
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:37,660
Yeah, check it out.

1012
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:40,256
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

1013
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,130
These batteries ain't topped up.

1014
00:54:42,202 --> 00:54:44,329
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

1015
00:54:44,404 --> 00:54:45,496
How quick?

1016
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,597
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

1017
00:54:47,674 --> 00:54:49,665
Okay, emergencies only.

1018
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:52,167
If something gets in the store.

1019
00:54:59,886 --> 00:55:02,480
(sighs) Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me.

1020
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:04,046
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

1021
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:08,458
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

1022
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:10,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

1023
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:12,462
Barely. How about you?

1024
00:55:12,532 --> 00:55:14,124
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

1025
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:16,863
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

1026
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,962
That's less than
five miles from here.

1027
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,700
How 'bout yours?

1028
00:55:20,774 --> 00:55:22,264
Well, they're out of town right now.

1029
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,904
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

1030
00:55:25,979 --> 00:55:28,743
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

1031
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:29,804
I hope so.

1032
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,308
So...

1033
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:35,913
how soon you shipping out?

1034
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:37,650
Uh, couple weeks.

1035
00:55:39,326 --> 00:55:40,816
Scared about going over there?

1036
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:43,218
(softly)
Yeah.

1037
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:50,059
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

1038
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:52,661
How come you never asked me out?

1039
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,231
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

1040
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:57,298
(chuckles)

1041
00:56:00,447 --> 00:56:02,005
So how come?

1042
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:06,282
I'm stupid, I guess.

1043
00:56:22,802 --> 00:56:24,793
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

1044
00:56:24,871 --> 00:56:26,099
Don't be. I just...

1045
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:29,405
I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?

1046
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:31,671
Some shitty locker room at work.

1047
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:34,340
Can we just stay in here
a while, then?

1048
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:37,407
I mean, just... just you and me.

1049
00:56:49,496 --> 00:56:52,021
DAN: The parking lot lamps
turned on.

1050
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:53,122
OLLIE: They're on a timer.

1051
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:55,190
Must be a different one
that's live.

1052
00:56:55,268 --> 00:56:57,964
DAN: Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

1053
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,903
get some electricity in here.

1054
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,635
That'd mean walking out the door.

1055
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,349
- Gaaaahhhh! God!
- (woman screams)

1056
00:57:16,222 --> 00:57:17,689
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1057
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:19,748
- OLLIE: David! David!
- (indistinct)

1058
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:23,117
WOMAN: you sure?

1059
00:57:23,196 --> 00:57:24,185
Look!

1060
00:57:47,287 --> 00:57:48,777
My God.

1061
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:05,794
Are those bugs?

1062
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:09,203
Not like any I've ever seen.

1063
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,371
MRS. CARMODY:
"They came out of the smoke,

1064
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:14,379
"locusts upon the earth,

00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,214
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power."

1067
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:23,778
(gasps)
Wow.

1068
00:58:23,857 --> 00:58:26,325
Look at those stingers.

1069
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:31,787
Dear God.

1070
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,460
Holy shit!

Myron, get the ones in the back!

1074
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:33,086
God, I think they're attracted to the light.

- OLLIE: Look out, look out, look out!

1076

The light! Douse the light!

Look out! Look out!

light, light, light!

the glass is gonna give!

Whoa!

Ugh!

Sally, look out!

No!

Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

1102
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:58,243
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

Let me see. Let me see.

You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1105
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:02,478
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

1106

Come on!

1107
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,717
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

1108

Aaahhhh!

1109

Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

1110

Shoot it! Shoot it!

I can't! I'll smash the window!

01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,704
Ohh! Ohhh! Kill it!

1124
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:05,107
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1125
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:11,777
(gasping)

1126
01:02:11,851 --> 01:02:13,819
MAN: Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

1127
01:02:13,886 --> 01:02:14,875
Come on.

1128
01:02:14,954 --> 01:02:16,751
(Sally groaning)

1129
01:02:16,823 --> 01:02:17,983
WAYNE: Sally!

1130
01:02:22,228 --> 01:02:25,891
(screaming and shouting)

1131
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:32,099
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

1132
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:40,912
(monster shrieking)

1133
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:44,180
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1134
01:02:49,555 --> 01:02:52,524
MAN: Bring torches.
We need torches at the window!

1135
01:02:52,592 --> 01:02:54,150
Plug that hole!

1136
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:02,356
Dad!

1137
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:09,969
Down! Down! Lay down!

1138
01:03:19,385 --> 01:03:21,683
(Mrs. Carmody gasping)

1139
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,179
Ohh.

1140
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,548
My life...

1141
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:32,086
my life for you,
your will be done.

1142
01:03:37,837 --> 01:03:39,828
(nervous titter)

1143
01:03:45,411 --> 01:03:47,572
- (screams and shouts)
- Daddy!

1144
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:49,911
Bugs! Daddy!

1145
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:01,482
(gunshot)

1146
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:02,994
(onlookers scream)

1147
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:05,087
(monster shrieks)

1148
01:04:05,164 --> 01:04:07,655
- Nooooo! Billy!
- Daddy!

1149
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:09,668
- Billy!
- Daddy!

1150
01:04:15,842 --> 01:04:18,834
(monster shrieking)

1151
01:04:22,682 --> 01:04:24,172
HATTIE: Billy!

1152
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,410
Dad!

1153
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:26,975
HATTIE: Billy, come back here.

1154
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:30,679
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

1155
01:04:30,757 --> 01:04:32,190
(monster shrieks)

1156
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:37,928
HATTIE: Billy!

1157
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,365
(gunshot)

1158
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:44,369
(onlookers scream and shout)

1159
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:08,157
MAN: Come on, let's move it!

1160
01:05:08,227 --> 01:05:10,218
MAN #2: Somebody please
come over here and help.

1161
01:05:10,296 --> 01:05:11,957
- (injured man screaming)
- MAN #3: Here's some tape!

1162
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:16,394
MAN #4: I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

1163
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:19,404
MAN #5: Hurry up with the blankets!

1164
01:05:19,472 --> 01:05:22,464
INJURED MAN:
It hurts so bad! Please!

1165
01:05:30,316 --> 01:05:31,977
INJURED MAN:
It hurts so bad!

1166
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:33,040
MAN: Block it up here.

1167
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,883
Get me some more bags!

1168
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:39,651
DAVID: Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

1169
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,355
WOMAN: She was right.

1170
01:05:42,428 --> 01:05:44,658
She said that
it would happen like this.

1171
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:46,822
She said that
they would come at night.

1172
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,831
She told us someone would die.

1173
01:06:02,281 --> 01:06:04,272
(monster snarling)

1174
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:10,610
(monster grunting and chewing)

1175
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,521
(grunts)
Mommy.

1176
01:06:17,129 --> 01:06:19,120
Ohh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1177
01:06:20,299 --> 01:06:21,698
It's okay, it was just a dream.

1178
01:06:22,802 --> 01:06:24,133
It's just a bad dream.

1179
01:06:25,304 --> 01:06:27,067
BILLY: I want my mommy.

1180
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:28,731
I know.

1181
01:06:28,808 --> 01:06:31,072
I know. Of course you do.

1182
01:06:31,143 --> 01:06:33,703
- Shh.
- BILLY: I wanna go home.

1183
01:06:33,779 --> 01:06:35,269
Just sleep.

1184
01:06:36,649 --> 01:06:38,310
Everything'll be better in the morning.

1185
01:06:44,991 --> 01:06:46,481
Think he likes you.

1186
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:51,586
(low) Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

1187
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:54,155
You have kids?

1188
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:55,427
No.

1189
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:57,662
I always wanted to, but...

1190
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:00,432
things haven't been working out.

1191
01:07:02,775 --> 01:07:05,744
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1192
01:07:06,946 --> 01:07:10,712
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that...

1193
01:07:10,783 --> 01:07:12,444
they shouldn't exist.

1194
01:07:13,953 --> 01:07:16,444
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1195
01:07:17,957 --> 01:07:19,185
You're not alone in that.

1196
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:21,682
We're all right there with you.

1197
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:24,558
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1198
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,589
OLLIE: David.

1199
01:07:29,669 --> 01:07:31,899
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

1200
01:07:49,822 --> 01:07:51,756
(sighs)
Joe.

1201
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:55,422
How you holdin' up, partner?

1202
01:07:55,494 --> 01:07:58,827
JOE: (labored)
David... is that you?

1203
01:07:59,932 --> 01:08:01,422
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

1204
01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:05,199
(low)
It's bad. He's bad.

1205
01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:07,899
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1206
01:08:08,908 --> 01:08:11,240
If you guys can't help me...

1207
01:08:12,445 --> 01:08:14,743
you... you gotta end it, okay?

1208
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:19,316
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1209
01:08:20,786 --> 01:08:23,311
- JOE: Right?
- No. No way.

1210
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:25,721
JOE: You can't f*ck with me
on this, bro.

1211
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,952
Not with me like this.

1212
01:08:28,027 --> 01:08:29,517
I'll do it.

1213
01:08:29,595 --> 01:08:32,359
(crying)
Just give me the gun.

1214
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:34,058
DAVID: Hey, hey. Shh.

1215
01:08:34,133 --> 01:08:37,227
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1216
01:08:37,303 --> 01:08:39,032
Joe, now, listen.

1217
01:08:40,106 --> 01:08:41,095
Pal...

1218
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:43,301
we're gonna work something out.

1219
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,071
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?

1220
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:46,202
Can we do that?

1221
01:08:46,278 --> 01:08:48,269
(Joe weeps softly)

1222
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,743
DAVID: Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1223
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,113
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

1224
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:02,082
Hattie.

1225
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:19,700
See anything?

1226
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,078
DAN: The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1227
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,139
Dawn's coming.

1228
01:09:26,152 --> 01:09:27,483
What's on your mind?

1229
01:09:27,553 --> 01:09:28,542
DAVID: It's Joe.

1230
01:09:30,456 --> 01:09:32,287
We don't get him
on some serious antibiotics,

1231
01:09:32,358 --> 01:09:33,518
he's gonna die of infection.

1232
01:09:33,592 --> 01:09:35,924
OLLIE: Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

1233
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:39,726
All... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

1234
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:42,666
You... you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

1235
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:44,669
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene...

1236
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:46,432
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1237
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,494
She knows where they keep it.

1238
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:48,733
Slow down.

1239
01:09:48,808 --> 01:09:50,469
You can't actually be thinkin'
of doin' this.

1240
01:09:50,543 --> 01:09:52,443
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

1241
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,978
We have to get out of here.

1242
01:09:55,147 --> 01:09:56,341
I mean permanently.

1243
01:09:56,415 --> 01:09:58,883
Why? We got plenty to eat!

1244
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:01,784
What happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1245
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:04,448
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1246
01:10:04,523 --> 01:10:07,515
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1247
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:09,720
We almost burned
the goddamn store down.

1248
01:10:12,031 --> 01:10:13,521
(soft footsteps approaching)

1249
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,332
It's Hattie.

1250
01:10:21,307 --> 01:10:23,969
(moving quietly)

1251
01:10:24,043 --> 01:10:25,203
DAVID: Here?

1252
01:10:25,277 --> 01:10:27,268
DAN: All right,
gently, now. Gently.

1253
01:10:27,346 --> 01:10:29,610
BUD: One... two... three.

1254
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:41,421
AMANDA: I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1255
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:42,825
lying there next to us.

1256
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:44,556
I thought she was sleeping.

1257
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:47,796
I got my 4-wheel drive.

1258
01:10:47,867 --> 01:10:49,459
It's out there.

1259
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:51,196
Y-you're talking about leaving?

1260
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:54,028
Well, we...

1261
01:10:54,105 --> 01:10:55,970
should hit the pharmacy first.

1262
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,338
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1263
01:10:57,409 --> 01:10:58,842
I mean, if we don't,

1264
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:00,902
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

1265
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:02,974
But after that...

1266
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:05,644
Iook, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1267
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:07,948
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1268
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,351
and try to get clear of this mist.

1269
01:11:10,322 --> 01:11:12,313
DAN: That's it?

1270
01:11:12,391 --> 01:11:13,722
That's the plan?

1271
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:15,692
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

1272
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,752
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1273
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,298
No, no, no. Amanda, think.

1274
01:11:20,366 --> 01:11:22,357
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

1275
01:11:22,434 --> 01:11:23,924
That's how much rope played out.

1276
01:11:24,003 --> 01:11:26,528
I'm parked half that distance
from here.

1277
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:28,596
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1278
01:11:28,674 --> 01:11:30,164
It could be
the entire eastern seaboard.

1279
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:32,403
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1280
01:11:32,478 --> 01:11:35,777
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1281
01:11:35,848 --> 01:11:37,679
DAN: We have one gun.

1282
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,741
- How many rounds?
- OLLIE: We got ten left.

1283
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:40,978
Ten rounds. Jesus.

1284
01:11:41,053 --> 01:11:42,680
Okay, so ten.

1285
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:45,680
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1286
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:47,783
I'll give you the best one.

1287
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:48,849
Her.

1288
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:51,352
Mrs. Carmody.

1289
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,297
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1290
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:57,028
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1291
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:58,092
He's right.

1292
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,502
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

1293
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:03,235
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

1294
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:04,799
Look, a few people maybe, but...

1295
01:12:04,877 --> 01:12:07,175
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

1296
01:12:07,246 --> 01:12:08,736
By noon, she'll have four more.

1297
01:12:08,814 --> 01:12:10,975
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1298
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,540
she'll have a congregation,

1299
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:16,110
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1300
01:12:16,188 --> 01:12:17,849
to make it all better.

1301
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:19,584
Hmm?

1302
01:12:19,658 --> 01:12:21,592
You, Amanda?

1303
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,922
My little boy?

1304
01:12:22,995 --> 01:12:24,587
DAN: He's right.

1305
01:12:24,663 --> 01:12:26,824
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1306
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,232
None whatsoever.

1307
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:30,791
I can't accept that.

1308
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:33,565
People are
basically good, decent.

1309
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:35,869
My God, David,
we're a civilized society.

1310
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:37,431
Sure, as long as
the machines are workin'

1311
01:12:37,509 --> 01:12:38,771
and you can dial 9-1-1,

1312
01:12:38,844 --> 01:12:41,711
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1313
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,771
you scare the shit out of them,

1314
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:45,680
no more rules,

1315
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:47,742
you'll see how primitive they get.

1316
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,516
You scare people badly enough,

1317
01:12:50,589 --> 01:12:53,080
you can get 'em to do anything.

1318
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:56,822
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1319
01:12:56,895 --> 01:12:58,055
or whatever.

1320
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:00,121
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1321
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:01,894
OLLIE: I wish I could.

1322
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:04,299
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

1323
01:13:05,304 --> 01:13:07,363
Put more than two of us
in a room, we pick sides

1324
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:09,999
and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another.

1325
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,672
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1326
01:13:13,746 --> 01:13:16,374
Oh, Jesus, that's just...

1327
01:13:16,448 --> 01:13:17,437
wrong.

1328
01:13:17,516 --> 01:13:20,076
DAVID: Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1329
01:13:20,151 --> 01:13:21,641
First things first...

1330
01:13:22,221 --> 01:13:23,210
the pharmacy.

1331
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:26,484
That'll be our test run.

1332
01:13:26,558 --> 01:13:27,547
Okay?

1333
01:13:33,165 --> 01:13:34,496
(sighs heavily)

1334
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:39,600
It's all right, Big Bill.

1335
01:13:39,672 --> 01:13:41,333
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

1336
01:13:41,407 --> 01:13:42,738
I don't want them.

1337
01:13:42,808 --> 01:13:44,469
I want you to stay here.

1338
01:13:44,543 --> 01:13:46,534
I won't be gone long.

1339
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,614
Just... just next door.

1340
01:13:49,682 --> 01:13:51,513
Hey, you'll be safe.

1341
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:54,107
Daddy...

1342
01:13:54,186 --> 01:13:55,676
Daddy, there are things out there.

1343
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:58,589
Things...

1344
01:13:58,657 --> 01:14:01,558
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

1345
01:14:03,129 --> 01:14:04,153
They'll wait.

1346
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:05,890
They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1347
01:14:05,964 --> 01:14:08,398
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

1348
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:09,957
they'll come and eat you up!

1349
01:14:10,035 --> 01:14:12,265
- Shh.
- Daddy, don't go!

1350
01:14:12,338 --> 01:14:14,329
(sobbing)

1351
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:22,807
I'll be back.

1352
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:25,411
Big Bill...

1353
01:14:25,484 --> 01:14:26,746
I promise.

1354
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:29,151
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

1355
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:31,747
All right?

1356
01:14:31,824 --> 01:14:33,883
Together, we're going home.

1357
01:14:34,893 --> 01:14:36,952
If something happens,
anything at all,

1358
01:14:37,029 --> 01:14:38,189
you cut and run.

1359
01:14:38,263 --> 01:14:40,891
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1360
01:14:40,966 --> 01:14:43,457
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

1361
01:14:44,503 --> 01:14:47,495
best as you can,
and long as you can.

1362
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:49,336
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1363
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:51,967
You... you get him out of here.

1364
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:53,375
You just keep drivin'.

1365
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:01,943
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1366
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,046
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1367
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:07,217
My boy is no concern of yours.

1368
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,554
Listen up.

1369
01:15:08,627 --> 01:15:10,618
We're going to the pharmacy.

1370
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:12,687
We're gonna bring back
some supplies.

1371
01:15:12,765 --> 01:15:16,132
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1372
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:18,362
- (onlookers murmuring)
- OLLIE: Listen, folks, listen!

1373
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:20,428
We're not gonna take any chances.

1374
01:15:20,506 --> 01:15:21,996
If there's any trouble,

1375
01:15:22,074 --> 01:15:24,065
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

1376
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:27,477
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1377
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:29,036
WOMAN: She's right.

1378
01:15:29,115 --> 01:15:30,776
You'll make 'em notice us.

1379
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:32,111
You'll make 'em come.

1380
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:35,815
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1381
01:15:35,888 --> 01:15:37,753
Lady, this what you call
'well enough"?

1382
01:15:37,823 --> 01:15:39,313
You wanna stop us?

1383
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,881
You better explain to Bobby here

1384
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:43,223
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1385
01:15:43,295 --> 01:15:45,456
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

1386
01:15:45,531 --> 01:15:47,260
You'll die out there, young man.

1387
01:15:47,332 --> 01:15:50,392
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1388
01:15:50,469 --> 01:15:53,632
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1389
01:15:53,705 --> 01:15:56,572
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1390
01:15:56,642 --> 01:15:58,633
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1391
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,907
- ONLOOKERS: No!
- MRS. CARMODY: No! No! No!

1392
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,971
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1393
01:16:04,049 --> 01:16:06,483
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1394
01:16:06,552 --> 01:16:08,213
This kind of pride and defiance of...

1395
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:09,948
(onlookers gasp)

1396
01:16:10,022 --> 01:16:11,717
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1397
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,655
You old bitch!

1398
01:16:17,196 --> 01:16:20,290
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1399
01:16:20,365 --> 01:16:22,026
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1400
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,931
And I got lots of peas.

1401
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:26,596
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1402
01:16:26,672 --> 01:16:28,401
How 'bout it, Army?

1403
01:16:28,474 --> 01:16:29,964
Any help from the armed forces?

1404
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:31,031
I'll go.

1405
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:34,969
IRENE: Jim Grondin.

1406
01:16:35,047 --> 01:16:36,537
I had you in school, didn't I?

1407
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:38,583
Yes'm, me and my sister Pauline.

1408
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,311
Pair of underachievers.

1409
01:16:40,385 --> 01:16:41,613
After you, Jim.

1410
01:16:42,688 --> 01:16:44,087
Yes, ma'am.

1411
01:16:44,155 --> 01:16:45,486
Oh, shit.

1412
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:47,957
DAVID: That it?
That's everybody?

1413
01:16:48,026 --> 01:16:49,516
Everybody that's goin'.

1414
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:51,620
- MAN: Yep.
- Okay.

1415
01:16:51,697 --> 01:16:54,757
DAVID: Single file,
one by one, all right?

1416
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:56,562
Let's get this thing over with.

1417
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:58,692
Let's go.

1418
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,601
- MAN: After you.
- IRENE: Yes.

1419
01:17:03,642 --> 01:17:04,631
Stay together.

1420
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,679
(onlookers murmuring)

1421
01:17:07,746 --> 01:17:09,646
MRS. CARMODY'
You know what?

1422
01:17:09,715 --> 01:17:11,205
Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.

1423
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:12,978
- MAN: Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1424
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,122
DAVID: Save the batteries.

1425
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:10,199
DAVID: (low)
Shit.

1426
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:12,266
They left the doors propped open.

1427
01:18:13,612 --> 01:18:15,136
OLLIE: (low)
Think something got in?

1428
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:19,640
DAVID: Let's just...
get what we need,

1429
01:18:19,718 --> 01:18:21,117
get the hell outta here.

1430
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:22,676
OLLIE: Yeah. Let's do that.

1431
01:18:22,754 --> 01:18:25,587
IRENE: (low) The meds
are over at the end there,

1432
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:27,147
in the cubicle.

1433
01:18:44,242 --> 01:18:45,573
(loud, sharp crash)

1434
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:48,977
DAVID: Will you not do that?

1435
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:51,038
JIM: (low)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1436
01:18:51,116 --> 01:18:53,084
DAVID: (exasperated)
Oh, God.

1437
01:19:17,776 --> 01:19:19,107
Where's that Silvadene?

1438
01:19:19,176 --> 01:19:20,666
It's over behind David.

1439
01:19:20,746 --> 01:19:22,577
In the fridge. Check there.

1440
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,153
Silvadene. Got it.

1441
01:19:30,722 --> 01:19:32,781
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

1442
01:19:32,858 --> 01:19:34,348
- OLLIE: Penicillin.

1443
01:19:34,426 --> 01:19:35,916
OLLIE: (normal volume)
Any strong antibiotics.

1444
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:36,983
Yeah.

1445
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:41,165
Pain meds like
Vicodin or OxyContin.

1446
01:19:41,233 --> 01:19:42,723
- DAVID: Shh!
- OxyContin!

1447
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:46,232
Hydrochloride?

1448
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,729
DAVID: Penicillin.

1449
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,641
(soft scurrying sound)

1450
01:20:01,019 --> 01:20:02,008
Guys.

1451
01:20:05,891 --> 01:20:07,518
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

1452
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:12,385
What?

1453
01:20:12,464 --> 01:20:14,591
(soft scurrying sound)

1454
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:16,224
DAN: Somethin' f*ckin' weird.

1455
01:20:25,804 --> 01:20:27,635
Oh, God.

1456
01:20:27,806 --> 01:20:29,103
Oh, God!

1457
01:20:29,175 --> 01:20:33,134
No. Oh, no.

1458
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:34,974
Oh, nooooo.

1459
01:20:35,047 --> 01:20:36,605
Oh, f*ck!

1460
01:20:38,483 --> 01:20:40,451
IRENE: Look.
There's another one.

1461
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:43,283
- OLLIE: Oh, my God.
- JIM: No, no, no.

1462
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:45,721
Oh, no, no.

1463
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,454
Guys, let's get out of here now.

1464
01:20:50,529 --> 01:20:52,394
- Aaaahhhhhh!
- OLLIE: Holy shit!

1465
01:20:52,464 --> 01:20:53,795
(Jim screaming)

1466
01:20:56,368 --> 01:20:59,030
JIM: Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

1467
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:03,474
M. P '... I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Help me!

1468
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:05,635
IRENE: Good Lord!
Help him!

1469
01:21:06,645 --> 01:21:09,876
(M.P. groaning)

1470
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:12,917
DAVID: Son of a bitch!

1471
01:21:12,984 --> 01:21:14,576
This stuff ain't comin' off!

1472
01:21:15,587 --> 01:21:17,987
Oh, man!
He's glued to this f*ckin' post!

1473
01:21:18,056 --> 01:21:19,887
(hoarsely)
It's our fault.

1474
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,017
It's all our fault.

1475
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:23,561
DAVID: It's really stuck.

1476
01:21:24,563 --> 01:21:25,825
(groaning)

1477
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:29,890
M. P '... God, I can feel 'em!

1478
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,993
I can feel 'em!

1479
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,560
(groaning)

1480
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,572
WAYNE: Oh, my God!
Jesus!

1481
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:44,306
Oh, my God.

1482
01:21:44,383 --> 01:21:46,874
Ohh! l...

1483

1485
01:21:50,422 --> 01:21:52,913
Aah! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1486
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,720
(monster shrieks)

1487
01:21:56,195 --> 01:21:58,186

1488
01:21:58,263 --> 01:21:59,252
Ohh!

01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,701
(M.P. groans)

1491
01:22:06,772 --> 01:22:08,103
Aah! Aah!

1492
01:22:08,172 --> 01:22:09,400
DAN: There's another one!
Hit it!

1493
01:22:11,309 --> 01:22:13,607
- Aah!
- What the hell is that stuff?

1494
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,543
Ollie! One over there!

1495
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:17,206
Ollie, there!

1496
01:22:17,282 --> 01:22:18,977
Got it!

1497
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,541
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1498
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,485
- (monster squeals)
- Shit!

1499
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,379
DAN: See 'em?

1500
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,223
- Aah! Aaaahhhhh!
- Bobby!

1501
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,786
Bobby!

1502
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,094
(monster shrieking)

1503
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:37,896
(Bobby screaming)

1504
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:40,460

1505
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,268

1507

(gunshot)

1508
01:22:44,676 --> 01:22:46,439
IRENE: Let's get out of here!

1509
01:22:46,511 --> 01:22:48,342
(screaming and shouting)

1510
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:50,779
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1511
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:55,581
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1512
01:22:55,654 --> 01:22:56,985
I got him, I got him.
Hold on.

1513
01:22:58,323 --> 01:22:59,756
DAVID: Pull it tight!

1514
01:23:01,326 --> 01:23:02,953
OLLIE: Look! Look!

1515
01:23:03,028 --> 01:23:05,656
Aaahhh! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1516
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:08,863
Ohhhhhh!

1517
01:23:08,934 --> 01:23:10,629
Gaaahhhh!

1518
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:12,329
DAVID: Light!

1519
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,393
Light!

1520
01:23:13,472 --> 01:23:15,997
- (monster shrieks)
- God!

1521
01:23:19,109 --> 01:23:22,272
JIM: We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1522
01:23:22,347 --> 01:23:24,815
WAYNE: Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1523
01:23:25,383 --> 01:23:26,850
DAVID:
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1524
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:34,614
(monster shrieks)

1525
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,563
DAN: Let's get out of here!

1526
01:23:40,565 --> 01:23:43,659
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1527
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:44,895
DAVID: Come on!

1528
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:51,103
(loud crash)

1529
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,102
Oh, my God!

1530
01:23:55,814 --> 01:23:57,475
Ollie! Ollie!

1531
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:01,885
(dry fires)

1532
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,853
WAYNE: Kill it! Kill it!

1533
01:24:14,566 --> 01:24:15,555
F*ckers!

1534
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:16,725
Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1535
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,463
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1536
01:24:19,538 --> 01:24:21,369
Drayton, come on,
come on, come on!

1537
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:22,929
Come on, Drayton,
he's dead!

1538
01:24:23,008 --> 01:24:23,997
Come on!

1539
01:24:53,138 --> 01:24:55,129
(onlookers scream)

1540
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:56,536
JIM: Open the door!

1541
01:24:56,608 --> 01:24:58,098
(shouting and screaming)

1542
01:24:58,175 --> 01:24:59,369
MAN: Where's Bobby?

1543
01:24:59,444 --> 01:25:00,433
Daddy!

1544
01:25:01,947 --> 01:25:02,936
MAN: Close up the doors!

1545
01:25:03,048 --> 01:25:04,037
Hurry up!

1546
01:25:04,116 --> 01:25:05,674
What happened?

1547
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,480
JIM: They're dead!
They're all dead!

1548
01:25:08,553 --> 01:25:11,044
(Jim crying hysterically)

1549
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,684
(crying hysterically)

1550
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:20,921
(Billy crying softly)

1551
01:25:25,437 --> 01:25:27,428
MRS. CARMODY:
...expiation, because we have seen

1552
01:25:27,505 --> 01:25:30,030
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

1553
01:25:30,108 --> 01:25:34,135
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1554
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,203
obscenities and profanities

1555
01:25:36,281 --> 01:25:38,613
of such nightmare proportions.

1556
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:42,517
And for these evil,
lurking spirits,

1557
01:25:42,587 --> 01:25:44,578
and for these evil people...

1558
01:25:44,656 --> 01:25:45,987
How long was I out?

1559
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:47,456
Most of the day.

1560
01:25:48,526 --> 01:25:51,017
You just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep.

1561
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:52,757
Just passed out, is more like it.

1562
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:54,298
MRS. CARMODY:
What will stop this Great Whore?

1563
01:25:54,366 --> 01:25:56,459
Just shut down for a while.

1564
01:25:56,534 --> 01:25:57,523
Sorry.

1565
01:25:57,602 --> 01:25:58,967
MRS. CARMODY'
How will it end?

1566
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:00,026
CROWD: Expiation!

1567
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:02,733
MRS. CARMODY: Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1568
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,502
DAVID: How's Joe?

1569
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:07,977
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1570
01:26:08,546 --> 01:26:10,377
We were just too late.

1571
01:26:10,448 --> 01:26:11,779
MRS. CARMODY:
I told you this would come!

1572
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,250
DAVID: Oh, God,
I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1573
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:15,650
AMANDA: No dream.

1574
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,915
She's getting people whipped up.

1575
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:20,753
That poor girl is dead,

1576
01:26:20,825 --> 01:26:23,191
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1577
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,422
She's got 'em believing
she's a psychic,

1578
01:26:25,497 --> 01:26:27,158
she has a direct line with God.

1579
01:26:27,232 --> 01:26:29,723
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1580
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:32,099
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

1581
01:26:34,839 --> 01:26:38,138
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1582
01:26:38,209 --> 01:26:39,540
I'm in.

1583
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,579
DAVID: No. Sorry.

1584
01:26:41,646 --> 01:26:45,480
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

1585
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,539
I won't...

1586
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,314
do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1587
01:26:49,387 --> 01:26:50,854
You might want to reconsider that.

1588
01:26:50,922 --> 01:26:53,083
MRS. CARMODY:
What will... what will keep these evil,

1589
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:54,319
these abominations at bay?

1590
01:26:54,392 --> 01:26:55,882
What will keep them away?

1591
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,952
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1592
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,429
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

1593
01:27:00,498 --> 01:27:02,398
- Expiation!
- What are we talking about?

1594
01:27:02,567 --> 01:27:05,058
- Expiation!
- Say it again like you mean it!

1595
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,433
Expiation!

1596
01:27:06,504 --> 01:27:11,498
Welcome to Sesame Street.
Today's word is "expiation."

1597
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:13,601
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1598
01:27:13,678 --> 01:27:16,340
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

1599
01:27:16,414 --> 01:27:19,406
His mind's just snapped.
Gone.

1600
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,974
Hasn't even been two days.

1601
01:27:22,087 --> 01:27:23,577
Not even two days.

1602
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,249
CORNELL: I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

1603
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:28,986
OLLIE: I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1604
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:32,393
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1605
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:34,728
DAN: It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

1606
01:27:34,799 --> 01:27:36,289
It'll be your call.

1607
01:27:38,269 --> 01:27:40,794
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1608
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:42,863
(Carmody's followers applaud)

1609
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:45,205
MRS. CARMODY:
Who will save them? No one.

1610
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:48,370
The rocks will not hide them.

1611
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:51,210
I want some idea
of what we're up against.

1612
01:27:51,282 --> 01:27:52,943
I want to know what this mist is.

1613
01:27:54,285 --> 01:27:55,445
I want to talk to the soldiers.

1614
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,010
Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1615
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:59,318
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1616
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,722
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

1617
01:28:01,793 --> 01:28:03,454
The situation was insane.

1618
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,325
He said he was sorry.

1619
01:28:05,396 --> 01:28:07,387
Wasn't that the word
he used..."sorry"?

1620
01:28:07,465 --> 01:28:09,456
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1621
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,092
AMANDA:
What did he mean by that?

1622
01:28:11,169 --> 01:28:13,660
That's what we're gonna find out.

1623
01:28:13,738 --> 01:28:15,399
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1624
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:16,770
MRS. CARMODY'
Verse 17!

1625
01:28:16,841 --> 01:28:19,332
"...poured out his vial into the air,

1626
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:21,310
"and there came a great voice

1627
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:24,109
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1628
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:26,674
"'It is done! It is done! '

1629
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:29,982
"And there were voices
and lightning,

1630
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,114
and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

1631
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:35,852
MRS. CARMODY'
Yes! Come to me!

1632
01:28:35,927 --> 01:28:37,087
WAYNE: What?

1633
01:28:37,162 --> 01:28:39,392
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1634
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:41,728
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

1635
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,792
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1636
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:50,931
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1637
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:53,443
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1638
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:55,274
That's not what the M.P.
said in the pharmacy

1639
01:28:55,346 --> 01:28:57,177
before the spiders
came out of his skin.

1640
01:28:58,716 --> 01:29:00,479
They're not in the store.

1641
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:03,715
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1642
01:29:03,788 --> 01:29:04,777
...because you know.

1643
01:29:04,856 --> 01:29:07,017
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

1644
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:08,353
Yes? Tell us.

1645
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,656
Here is an old man
who has seen!

1646
01:29:10,728 --> 01:29:12,889
Yes, he has seen!

1647
01:29:12,964 --> 01:29:13,953
MAN: Amen.

1648
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:15,522
MRS. CARMODY'
And I want to say,

1649
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,727
do I want to walk with you

1650
01:29:17,802 --> 01:29:20,464
into my Father's hands?

1651
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:22,028
Morales.

1652
01:29:23,074 --> 01:29:24,063
Donaldson.

1653
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:27,733
Guys...

1654
01:29:30,081 --> 01:29:31,571
It's the only place they can be.

1655
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:33,608
WAYNE: What?

1656
01:29:33,685 --> 01:29:35,118
OLLIE:
Couldn't just disappear.

1657
01:29:35,187 --> 01:29:38,179
WAYNE: Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are...

1658
01:29:38,256 --> 01:29:40,383
(sharp gasp)

1659
01:29:45,263 --> 01:29:46,753
I didn't think they'd do it.

1660
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:49,391
They said they would do it,
and I just...

1661
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,628
I told them what
the M.P. said at the pharmacy,

1662
01:29:51,703 --> 01:29:52,863
and they swore they'd do it.

1663
01:29:52,937 --> 01:29:54,598
I just... I didn't think they would.

1664
01:29:54,672 --> 01:29:55,661
Jesus.

1665
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,937
It's the Arrowhead Project,
isn't it?

1666
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:02,605
This mist, it's some kind of, what,
military f*ckup?

1667
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,170
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1668
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:07,116
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1669
01:30:07,184 --> 01:30:08,173
Get in there!

1670
01:30:08,253 --> 01:30:11,245
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1671
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:14,814
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1672
01:30:14,893 --> 01:30:17,384
Those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,

1673
01:30:17,462 --> 01:30:19,862
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1674
01:30:19,931 --> 01:30:21,421
They knew it all along!

1675
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,330
- He's crazy. He doesn't know...
- Get on your knees!

1676
01:30:23,401 --> 01:30:24,732
- (shouting)
- MAN: Stay out of it, Drayton!

1677
01:30:24,802 --> 01:30:26,793
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1678
01:30:26,871 --> 01:30:28,236
All about the Arrowhead Project

1679
01:30:28,306 --> 01:30:30,365
and all that secret shit
up on the mountain.

1680
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:31,908
That's what brung it down on us.

1681
01:30:31,976 --> 01:30:34,103
That's what brung down
the wrath of God!

1682
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:35,167
MRS. CARMODY: Oh!

1683
01:30:36,981 --> 01:30:38,915
Private Jessup.

1684
01:30:40,818 --> 01:30:41,978
It wasn't me.

1685
01:30:42,053 --> 01:30:44,385
I'm just...
I'm stationed up there.

1686
01:30:44,455 --> 01:30:45,854
I'm not responsible...

1687
01:30:45,924 --> 01:30:47,585
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1688
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:49,650
Most of you people know me.

1689
01:30:49,727 --> 01:30:52,218
You stop your chicken shit whining

1690
01:30:52,297 --> 01:30:54,925
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1691
01:30:54,999 --> 01:30:56,557
Now you tell us!

1692
01:30:58,569 --> 01:30:59,763
Tell us.

1693
01:30:59,837 --> 01:31:02,499
Look, look. Okay, okay.

1694
01:31:02,573 --> 01:31:04,006
I heard stuff.

1695
01:31:04,075 --> 01:31:05,372
Stuff?

1696
01:31:05,443 --> 01:31:07,434
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1697
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:12,546
Like how they, um,

1698
01:31:12,617 --> 01:31:14,710
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1699
01:31:14,786 --> 01:31:17,619
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,

1700
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:20,180
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1701
01:31:20,258 --> 01:31:21,748
a window...

1702
01:31:21,826 --> 01:31:24,420
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1703
01:31:26,631 --> 01:31:29,361
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1704
01:31:29,434 --> 01:31:31,299
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1705
01:31:31,369 --> 01:31:33,894
Oh, the scientists!
Yes, the scientists!

1706
01:31:33,972 --> 01:31:36,099
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1707
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:37,972
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1708
01:31:38,042 --> 01:31:41,375
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

1709
01:31:41,446 --> 01:31:43,437
I didn't understand the half of it.

1710
01:31:45,383 --> 01:31:46,907
It ain't my fault!

1711
01:31:46,985 --> 01:31:48,043
Oh.

1712
01:31:49,154 --> 01:31:52,487
Ain't. His. Fault.

1713
01:31:52,557 --> 01:31:55,082
- (angry murmuring)
- No, no, no.

1714
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:56,524
Ain't nothin'

1715
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:59,188
ever anybody's fault.

1716
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:01,595
But he denies it.

1717
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:04,157
He points the finger,

1718
01:32:04,235 --> 01:32:07,329
this Judas in our midst.

1719
01:32:07,405 --> 01:32:08,394
CROWD: Judas!

1720
01:32:08,473 --> 01:32:10,338
David!

1721
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:12,638
You! You!

1722
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:14,644
Don't you know by now?

1723
01:32:14,712 --> 01:32:16,805
Don't you know the truth?

1724
01:32:16,881 --> 01:32:19,475
We are being punished.

1725
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:23,111
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1726
01:32:23,186 --> 01:32:27,452
For going against
his forbidden rules of old!

1727
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:29,015
Walking on the moon!

1728
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:30,583
Yes! Yes!

1729
01:32:30,661 --> 01:32:33,562
- Or... or splitting his atoms!
- MAN: Amen!

1730
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:36,031
Or... or... or stem cells

1731
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,364
and abortions!

1732
01:32:38,436 --> 01:32:41,405
And destroying the secrets of life

1733
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:44,737
that only God above has any right to!

1734
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,299
Amen! Amen!

1735
01:32:46,377 --> 01:32:48,937
MRS. CARMODY:
Yes, I know! It is true!

1736
01:32:49,013 --> 01:32:51,504
And now we are being punished.

1737
01:32:51,582 --> 01:32:54,574
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

1738
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:57,314
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1739
01:32:57,388 --> 01:33:00,983
and star Wormwood blazes!

1740
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:02,390
And it is his fault!

1741
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,793
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1742
01:33:05,863 --> 01:33:08,855
They did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1743
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:09,922
No!

1744
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,196
- (angry shouting)
- MACKEY: Get over there!

1745
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:13,862
DAVID: No!

1746
01:33:13,938 --> 01:33:15,565
MACKEY: Judas!

1747
01:33:16,874 --> 01:33:17,863
OLLIE: Jim!

1748
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:20,410
Kill him! String him up!

1749
01:33:23,481 --> 01:33:25,142
Stand up, you coward!

1750
01:33:25,215 --> 01:33:26,204
Unkh!

1751
01:33:26,284 --> 01:33:29,651
(scattered applause)

1752
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,880
Jesus!

1753
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,086
DAVID: No!

1754
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,559
Aaaahhhh!

1755
01:33:36,627 --> 01:33:38,788
MACKEY: Expiation!

1756
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:40,455
- No!
- MAN: Stab him!

1757
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,967
- Aaahhhh!
- Expiation!

1758
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:46,765
Feed him to the beast!

1759
01:33:46,838 --> 01:33:48,772
Expiation!

1760
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,799
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1761
01:33:54,312 --> 01:33:55,973
No, no! No!

1762
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,641
Aaaaahhhhh!

1763
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,947
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

1764
01:34:06,591 --> 01:34:09,185
Aaahhhh!

1765
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,785
(crowd screaming and shouting)

1766
01:34:16,434 --> 01:34:18,925
(groans)

1767
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,800
Aaahhhh!

1768
01:34:21,873 --> 01:34:25,309
(weeping)

1769
01:34:26,377 --> 01:34:27,867
(groaning and gasping)

1770
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,270
(door locks)

1771
01:34:31,349 --> 01:34:33,374
Aah! Aaahhh!

1772
01:34:33,451 --> 01:34:36,443
Aaahhhh!

1773
01:34:37,622 --> 01:34:39,613
Aaahhh! Aah!

1774
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:42,022
(monster roars)

1775
01:34:58,709 --> 01:35:00,108
Please.

1776
01:35:01,111 --> 01:35:03,102
(onlookers scream)

1777
01:35:04,315 --> 01:35:06,146
(distant monster roars)

1778
01:35:10,755 --> 01:35:13,417
MRS. CARMODY:
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1779
01:35:14,926 --> 01:35:15,915
Tomorrow...

1780
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:19,752
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

1781
01:35:29,107 --> 01:35:30,267
BILLY: (softly)
Daddy.

1782
01:35:31,943 --> 01:35:33,103
Daddy.

1783
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:46,787
(softly)
Sorry I left you, pal.

1784
01:35:49,127 --> 01:35:50,788
I'll never leave you again.

1785
01:35:52,129 --> 01:35:53,289
Promise?

1786
01:35:54,699 --> 01:35:58,396
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1787
01:35:58,469 --> 01:36:01,905
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1788
01:36:01,973 --> 01:36:03,702
Tell me.

1789
01:36:05,409 --> 01:36:07,741
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

1790
01:36:11,415 --> 01:36:13,576
Ever. No matter what.

1791
01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:16,743
I promise.

1792
01:36:19,991 --> 01:36:21,788
I love you, Daddy.

1793
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,759
I love you, Billy.

1794
01:36:24,762 --> 01:36:26,093
More than anything.

1795
01:36:55,793 --> 01:36:56,953
(softly)
It's dawn.

1796
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,233
Hey, pal,
you ready to go home?

1797
01:37:05,303 --> 01:37:06,668
Come on.

1798
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:12,065
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1799
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:14,634
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1800
01:37:14,712 --> 01:37:16,009
Okay.

1801
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,811
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1802
01:37:19,884 --> 01:37:22,216
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1803
01:37:22,286 --> 01:37:24,811
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1804
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:26,049
Let's go.

1805
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:51,642
Stealing food now?

1806
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,911
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1807
01:37:59,224 --> 01:38:00,885
Please stand aside.

1808
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,853
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

1809
01:38:04,929 --> 01:38:06,260
Won't allow it?

1810
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:08,992
It's against God's will.

1811
01:38:09,066 --> 01:38:11,193
Don't you know that by now?

1812
01:38:11,268 --> 01:38:15,830
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1813
01:38:15,906 --> 01:38:20,343
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?

1814
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:26,739
What's the matter with you?

1815
01:38:30,087 --> 01:38:31,520
Don't you believe in God?

1816
01:38:32,523 --> 01:38:34,081
No one's interfered with you.

1817
01:38:34,157 --> 01:38:36,751
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1818
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:38,158
You heard him.

1819
01:38:39,764 --> 01:38:43,757
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1820
01:38:45,035 --> 01:38:46,024
They...

1821
01:38:46,103 --> 01:38:50,039
people who refused to bend
to the will of God,

1822
01:38:50,107 --> 01:38:52,701
and claim it privilege.

1823
01:38:52,777 --> 01:38:55,769
Sinners in pride.

1824
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:57,837
Yes, haughty.

1825
01:38:57,915 --> 01:38:59,542
Privileged!

1826
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:03,884
They mock us. They mock our...
our God, our faith,

1827
01:39:03,954 --> 01:39:07,390
our values, our very lifestyle.

1828
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:09,619
They mock our humility

1829
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,524
and our piousness.

1830
01:39:11,595 --> 01:39:14,758
They piss on us and laugh.

1831
01:39:18,002 --> 01:39:19,663
It's from them

1832
01:39:19,737 --> 01:39:23,264
the blood of human sacrifice
must come.

1833
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,308
From them...

1834
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,970
- Come on.
...the blood of expiation.

1835
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,034
JIM: Come on.

1836
01:39:29,112 --> 01:39:30,670
You try it.

1837
01:39:30,748 --> 01:39:32,079
F*ckin' try it!

1838
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:33,616
Come on!

1839
01:39:33,684 --> 01:39:35,914
- MAN: Get 'em!
- We want the boy.

1840
01:39:35,986 --> 01:39:37,248
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1841
01:39:37,421 --> 01:39:39,514
- Yeah!
- You get back!

1842
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:40,522
The boy!

1843
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:43,957
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1844
01:39:44,028 --> 01:39:46,360
(screaming and shouting)

1845
01:39:47,998 --> 01:39:49,329
Grab him!

1846
01:39:50,935 --> 01:39:52,800
And get the whore too!

1847
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:54,337
Grab her!

1848
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,839
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1849
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,397
(gunshot)

1850
01:39:58,476 --> 01:40:00,137
(onlookers gasp and fall silent)

1851
01:40:07,718 --> 01:40:09,811
(gunshot)

1852
01:40:09,887 --> 01:40:11,821
(onlookers scream)

1853
01:40:11,889 --> 01:40:13,720
MAN: Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

1854
01:40:20,631 --> 01:40:22,292
l... I killed her.

1855
01:40:24,468 --> 01:40:25,457
Thank you, Ollie.

1856
01:40:27,638 --> 01:40:28,900
Let's go.

1857
01:40:29,974 --> 01:40:33,171
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

1858
01:40:35,646 --> 01:40:37,341
WOMAN:
You killed her!

1859
01:40:37,414 --> 01:40:39,746
You murdered her!

1860
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,810
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,

1861
01:40:44,889 --> 01:40:46,516
not if there'd been any other way.

1862
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:48,080
That's why I said thank you.

1863
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:49,319
Okay.

1864
01:40:49,393 --> 01:40:51,725
Okay, then...
let's go!

1865
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:53,626
(sharp thud)

1866
01:40:53,697 --> 01:40:54,686
Get up, Myron!

1867
01:40:54,765 --> 01:40:56,027
Come on! We gotta go!

1868
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,089
My ankle!

1869
01:40:57,166 --> 01:40:59,657
(women sobbing softly)

1870
01:41:05,576 --> 01:41:07,703
Okay. All the way down!

1871
01:41:08,746 --> 01:41:10,373
Where are they?

1872
01:41:10,447 --> 01:41:12,278
Bud! Myron!

1873
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:13,373
Ambrose!

1874
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,042
I think I broke it!

1875
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:16,676
Come on! Come on!

1876
01:41:16,754 --> 01:41:18,244
AMANDA: We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

1877
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:19,550
IRENE: They're lost!

1878
01:41:21,091 --> 01:41:23,059
(Amanda gasping)

1879
01:41:27,264 --> 01:41:28,891
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ollie!

1880
01:41:28,966 --> 01:41:31,526
- Ollie!
- (monster roars)

1881
01:41:31,602 --> 01:41:33,593
Aaahhhh!

1882
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,605
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1883
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:37,698
- Oh!
- Aaahhh!

1884
01:41:38,809 --> 01:41:42,870
(screaming and shouting)

1885
01:41:42,947 --> 01:41:46,747
(Ollie screaming)

1886
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:50,609
AMANDA: Ohh!

1887
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,088
Aaah! Aaaahhhh!

1888
01:41:55,492 --> 01:41:57,551
Aaah! Aaaaahhhhh!

1889
01:42:11,275 --> 01:42:12,606
IRENE: All that screaming!

1890
01:42:13,777 --> 01:42:16,075
DAN: Are they out there?
Can they see us?

1891
01:42:16,145 --> 01:42:18,773
(honks car horn)

1892
01:42:25,956 --> 01:42:28,356
Let me... let me in!
Let me in!

1893
01:42:28,425 --> 01:42:32,418
(screaming)

1894
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,290
(screams die)

1895
01:42:42,806 --> 01:42:44,296
Are we going?

1896
01:42:51,148 --> 01:42:52,410
- No.
- Yeah.

1897
01:42:52,483 --> 01:42:54,576
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1898
01:42:54,652 --> 01:42:55,983
- Daddy.
- David.

1899
01:42:56,053 --> 01:42:57,987
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

1900
01:42:58,055 --> 01:42:59,818
- David!
- Daddy!

1901
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:01,380
Get back in the car!

1902
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:03,119
- Daddy!
- David!

1903
01:43:03,192 --> 01:43:04,557
(screaming)

1904
01:43:04,628 --> 01:43:06,721
(monster shrieking)

1905
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:15,132
Oh, my God!

1906
01:43:15,204 --> 01:43:16,501
Aaahhh!

1907
01:43:16,573 --> 01:43:17,904
(shrieking)

1908
01:43:17,975 --> 01:43:19,966
AMANDA:
Oh, my God!

1909
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:41,119
We gotta go.

1910
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:45,025
(engine starts)

1911
01:45:31,107 --> 01:45:32,938
(distant monster roars)

01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:40,272
(distant monster roars)

1913
01:45:40,351 --> 01:45:42,319
DAVID: I told her I'd fix it.

1914
01:45:45,722 --> 01:45:47,656
Frontwindow...

1915
01:45:47,724 --> 01:45:49,055
broken open.

1916
01:45:52,796 --> 01:45:53,956
Tree.

1917
01:45:56,133 --> 01:45:57,122
My...

1918
01:45:58,201 --> 01:45:59,532
grandfather's tree.

1919
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:09,875

01:46:14,585 --> 01:46:17,918
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry.

1921
01:46:33,003 --> 01:46:33,992
DAVID: Let's, uh...

1922
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,500
see how far this...

1923
01:46:39,276 --> 01:46:41,471
fuel takes us, huh?

1924
01:46:44,615 --> 01:46:46,606
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

1925
01:47:50,614 --> 01:47:52,104

DAN: Well...

1934
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:07,339
we gave it a good shot.

1935
01:50:08,785 --> 01:50:10,275
Nobody can say we didn't.

1936
01:50:12,289 --> 01:50:13,984
Nope.

1937
01:50:14,057 --> 01:50:15,888
Nobody can say that.

Well...

1942
01:51:48,151 --> 01:51:49,675
We got, uh...

1943
01:51:54,157 --> 01:51:55,146
four.

1944
01:51:59,829 --> 01:52:00,818
Four bullets.

1945
01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:06,925
But there's five of us.

1946
01:52:17,447 --> 01:52:19,210
I'll figure something out.

They're... they're dead.

01:56:37,106 --> 01:56:38,596
For what?
