PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval forces</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

2
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:12,373

GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand, this</i>

7
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:22,915
<i>REAGAN:</i>
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,682
<i>We will make no distinction.</i>

9
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,014
REPORTER:

<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

11
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,182
This was an act of terrorism.

12
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,682
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

13
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,375
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

15
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:38,175
...until something stops him.

16

<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

19

BRODY:
<i>He's gone.</i>

Does it really matter
how it happened?

39

It does to me.

You and Carrie

He was my guard.

What can I do for you, Sergeant?

<i>with my torturer, sir.</i>

Correct.

Find this man.

Raqim Faisel.

66

What's going on, Saul?

67

Hamid's dead.

68
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,429
Suicide.

How the hell is that possible?

70
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:48,029
Razor blade fragment.

71
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:49,563
Left wrist.

72
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,630
What? Where did he get that?

73
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:54,897
SAUL:
What the hell?

74
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,196
Not only did Brody contrive
to get himself in the room,

75
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,796
he orchestrated Hamid's suicide
and he warned Dr. Faisel.

76
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,429
And we-- you and I--
let it happen.

77
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:04,897
I think you should leave now.

78
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,263
With pleasure.

(grunting)

94
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,530
MAN:
Calm down!

95
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,029
Calm down. Calm down.

96
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,930
SHOOTER: How is such a massive
fuck-up even possible?

97
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:57,930
Please, explain that to me.

98
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,830
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:01,463
ESTES: Hamid probably brought
the razor blade with him.

100
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,663
The heel of one of his
shoes was peeled back.

101
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:04,963
It's also conceivable that
he found the razor blade

102
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:06,429
somewhere in the safe house.

103
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,963
One of our sweepers
might have missed it.

104
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,897
There is another possibility.

105
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:15,296
Someone on our side
could have given it to him.

106
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,997
ESTES:
Th-That's a stretch.

107
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,663
CARRIE:
Why?

108
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,363
ESTES: You actually think
someone on the SEAL team

109
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,997
gave Hamid a piece
of broken razor blade?

110
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,730
Or maybe you think
I did it, or Saul.

111
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,129
I certainly don't
think you did it.

112
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,563
I'm just saying, we
should polygraph

113
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:28,730
everyone who came into
contact with Hamid.

114
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:31,663
Ask each one of them directly
about the razor blade.

115
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:33,229
I've written up a list.

116
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:35,029
We're talking about 11 people,

117
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,963
including the SEAL team
that brought him here.

118
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,963
She's right.

119
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:40,830
We can't rule out
the possibility

120
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,763
of a mole.

121
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,763
What if Raqim Faisel
was warned by the same person

122
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:46,930
who gave Hamid the razor blade?

123
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,329
SHOOTER:
Faisel?

124
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,363
The guy that bought the house
by the airport?

125
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,997
You want to connect him to this?

126
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,596
He disappeared
just as we moved in.

127
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,863
Coincidence?

128
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:57,863
Or did he know we were coming?

129
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,329
Oh, good Christ.

130
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:04,329
Look, if nothing more,
let's cover our asses.

131
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:06,696
11 polygraph tests.
What's the big deal?

132
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,863
I'll go first.

133
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,897
Take care of the polygraphs.

134
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,997
(door closes)

135
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,630
Don't you ever do
that to me again!

136
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:26,730
You disagree with me, fine,
but make it a sidebar!

137
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,563
Well, you heard
what the man said.

138
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:32,663
Set up the polygraphs!

139
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,396
And get me Faisel!

140
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:36,429
Yes, sir.

141
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,029
What a surprise.
Sergeant Brody's on this list.

142
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,229
Well, it's not my fault

143
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,830
Estes let him in
the room with Hamid.

144
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:49,963
Expected to find
your resignation

145
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,496
on my desk this morning.

146
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,062
I had a much better
idea, don't you think?

147
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,263
I should forget
the things you said?

148
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:55,563
Yes, please.

149
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:59,096
He's right, you know.

150
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,463
You embarrassed him in there.

151
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:01,997
Who gives a shit?

152
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,329
Saul, we're gonna get Brody.

153
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,830
He'll never pass
the polygraph test.

154
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,229
We'll see.

155
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:09,930
I'll bet you
everything I've got.

156
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,096
Everything. Including
my <i>Monk's Dream,</i>

157
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,263
signed by Thelonious himself.

158
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:15,730
I prefer Coltrane.

159
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:18,496
Not so fussy.

160
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:34,229
Okay, uh, here.

161
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,263
So, uh, the tables
will go right here,

162
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,496
the chairs around the tables,

163
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,563
and then just
throughout the yard, okay?

164
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:41,329
All right.

165
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,530
Yeah, okay.

166
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,630
JESSICA:
Damn it you two.

167
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,563
The memorial
is in a half an hour.

168
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:53,263
You're supposed to be ready.
Get dressed.

169
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,530
DANA: Ma, this little creep
keeps hogging the bathroom!

170
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,630
Chris, let your sister

171
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:57,897
use the bathroom, please!

172
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,496
(door closes)

173
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,029
You okay?

174
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:05,296
Not exactly looking forward
to seeing Helen Walker.

175
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,329
Kind of got on my high horse
when she remarried.

176
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,196
Why?

177
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,196
I was waiting for you
to come home.

178
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,830
I guess I figured
she could do the same.

179
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,463
I had no right.

180
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,930
Do you know
what you're going to say?

181
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,096
At the service?

182
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,830
No.

183
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,463
Well, just be honest.

184
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:30,396
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.

185
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,830
We should hurry.

186
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,463
(sighs)

187
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,463
Here.

188
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,162
You look very handsome,

189
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:08,196
Sergeant Brody.

190
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,329
MAN: Is your name
Carrie Mathison?

191
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:30,696
Last time I checked.

192
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,029
Yes or no, please.

193
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,763
Yes.

194
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,596
Do you work for
the Central Intelligence Agency?

195
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,062
Yes.

196
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,563
Regarding the questions
you'll be asked today,

197
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,129
do you intend
to tell the truth?

198
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:42,129
Yes.

199
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,029
Are you married?

200
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,796
No.

201
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,696
Have you ever been married?

202
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,129
No.

203
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,796
Do you have children?

204
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,196
No.

205
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:54,897
Did you ever commit
a minor traffic violation?

206
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,463
Yes.

207
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,963
Are you now in Mississippi?

208
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,863
No.

209
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:03,429
Have you ever revealed
any classified information

210
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:05,630
to anyone without
proper security clearance?

211
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:07,229
No.

212
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,596
Have you ever taken
any illegal drugs?

213
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,329
Yes.

214
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,296
Have you taken
any illegal drugs

215
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,796
since joining
the Central Intelligence Agency?

216
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,696
No.

217
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,096
Did you pass a razor blade
to Afzal Hamid?

218
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,963
No.

219
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,796
Okay.

220
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,229
Here we go.

221
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,696
All ready, sir?

222
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:59,129
Um, is your name David Estes?

223
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:01,663
Yes.

224
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:05,096
Do you work for the Central
Intelligence Agency?

225
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,263
Yes.

226
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,296
Are you married?

227
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,963
You know, I was married,
but I cheated on her,

228
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,696
so that kind of soured things.

229
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,162
Is that a no?

230
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,329
No.

231
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,363
No. Okay.

232
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,730
Uh, do you have children?

233
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:29,563
Yes.

234
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,229
Not that they're talking to me.

235
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,863
Did you pass a razor blade
to Afzal Hamid?

236
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:37,329
No.

237
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,229
Find anything?

238
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:49,696
Eight million fingerprints,

239
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,930
a man's belt from Macy's--
size 32--

240
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,496
couple of takeout
food containers

241
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,263
from a local
Chinese restaurant.

242
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,496
Condoms.

243
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,596
Condoms? What else?

244
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,997
A six-pack of diet Coke
in the refrigerator.

245
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,196
That's it?

246
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,196
Interview the neighbors?

247
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,563
In progress.

248
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:09,997
Her?

249
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,429
GALVEZ:
Not yet.

250
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,563
(sighs)

251
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,596
I apologize for all
the commotion, ma'am.

252
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,196
We'll be out of your hair soon.

253
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:22,730
Oh, this is very exciting.
(chuckles)

254
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,963
It's not often we get
a murderer living

255
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:27,263
in the neighborhood.
Murderer?

256
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,363
That's what Marilyn
across the street said--

257
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,696
a cold-blooded murderer

258
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,630
raped and strangled
some poor girl

259
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,696
over in Fairfax County.
Whew! Lock your doors tight tonight.

260
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,730
Oh, I will.

261
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,530
Mr. Jawdal moved in
about, uh...

262
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:44,296
three weeks ago?
That's right.

263
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,363
Anything you can tell me
about him?

264
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:49,363
He was very quiet and polite.

265
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,596
They pretty much
kept to themselves.

266
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,229
They?

267
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,296
He and his wife.

268
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,930
- What happened? - I don't know. Someone must
have found out about the house.

269
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:00,930
How?
I don't know.

270
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:01,930
Where are we going?

271
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,897
Someplace safe.
Says who?

272
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,296
This is nuts.

273
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:09,596
There's no one there.

274
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,997
Yeah? How do you know?

275
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,329
I know. Relax, okay?

276
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:13,930
We're fine.
Fine?

277
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,730
Are you kidding me?
We're not fine.

278
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:16,830
We're fucked!

279
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,196
(sighs)

280
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,196
Raqim?
What?

281
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:33,129
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this.

282
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,429
You didn't drag me into it.

283
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,196
Okay?

284
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,863
I dragged myself into it.

285
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,496
I am a victim of
your fabulousness.

286
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,496
Are you saying I'm fabulous?

287
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,696
Yes, I am.

288
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,897
You are so full of shit.

289
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:11,363
WOMAN: <i>I asked all of you
here</i> <i>today to help me</i>

290
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:15,296
say good-bye
to my former husband,

291
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,329
Tom Walker.

292
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,630
This has been a...

293
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,863
(laughs):
very difficult...

294
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:27,863
eight years.

295
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:32,663
And now finally we can...

296
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:36,596
give Tom the farewell
he deserves.

297
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:49,029
Tom, uh, always said
that Nick Brody

298
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,162
was his closest friend.

299
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,162
And Nick was with Tom

300
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:55,496
when he died.

301
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,696
Nick.

302
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,496
(blows landing, grunting)

303
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,796
Tom Walker was a good man.

304
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:39,830
A true Marine...

305
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,596
and the best shot
I ever encountered, bar n...

306
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,796
Sorry.

307
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:50,596
Sorry.

308
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:03,796
Tom was the opposite
of pretentious,

309
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,596
whatever <i>that</i> is.

310
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,530
Humble?

311
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:13,029
He just wanted to get the job
done and get back to his family.

312
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,563
(sniffles)

313
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,796
Staff Sergeant Calhoun?

314
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:49,263
CALHOUN:
Present!

315
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,463
BRODY:
Private First Class

316
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,630
Fernandez?

317
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,296
Present!

318
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,429
Private First Class Wakefield?

319
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,463
Present.

320
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:00,663
Captain Faber?

321
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,429
Present!

322
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,696
Private First Class Green?

323
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,763
Present.

324
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:09,229
Corporal Walker?

325
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:17,630
Corporal Thomas Walker?

326
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,296
Corporal Thomas...

327
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:28,162
Patrick...

328
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,696
Walker.

329
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,062
(sighs)

330
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:57,429
Good service.
Yeah, it was really good.

331
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,229
Will you excuse me?

332
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,396
I'll be back in a minute, all right?
Mm-hmm.

333
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,796
Okay.
Okay? All right.

334
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,363
CARRIE:
Sergeant Brody?

335
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:18,530
Yeah?

336
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:21,363
Hey. That must
have been hard.

337
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,663
Yeah.

338
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,563
Hey, I hate to do
this right now,

339
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:25,730
but my bosses

340
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,363
kind of insist.

341
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:31,062
We need you to come out to
Langley to take a polygraph.

342
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,530
Why?

343
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:34,796
I'm afraid that's classified.

344
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,429
Can you come out today?

345
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,363
Is this to do with Hamid?

346
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:40,763
I can't say.
I'm sorry.

347
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,463
Well, I got to go
back to the reception.

348
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,263
They're having it at my house.

349
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,696
Oh, um...

350
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,129
how about tomorrow?

351
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:51,263
10:00 a.m.?

352
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:52,596
Okay.

353
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,162
Okay.

354
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,429
Faisel's got a woman with him--
maybe a girlfriend,

355
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,263
maybe a wife,
maybe just a cohort.

356
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,329
She's Caucasian,
mid-20s,

357
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:13,496
blond hair, blue/green eyes,

358
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,963
depending who you talk to.

359
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:17,329
Caucasian?
Yep.

360
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,496
What do we know about her?
Nothing.

361
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,830
We lifted a bunch
of fingerprints

362
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,630
from the house--
we're hoping at least

363
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:25,062
one of them will be hers and that we'll
be able to I.D. her.

364
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,263
Hey, can we change gears
for a second?

365
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,096
When this is all over,

366
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,730
I'd like to go
back to the field.

367
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:34,329
I thought you were
done with the field.

368
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,530
Mira's been offered a job

369
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:36,963
heading up
the Red Cross in India,

370
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,663
and Ed Welles retires
in a few months,

371
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:40,129
so, you know, I thought...
You thought

372
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,463
you'd end
your illustrious career

373
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,997
as the New Delhi Station Chief.

374
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,930
Who said anything about
ending my illustrious career?

375
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:49,863
I'll take it up
to the seventh floor.

376
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,763
Thanks.

377
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:55,630
Sir.
Yeah?

378
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:56,630
Faisel's license plate.

379
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:57,763
Toll booth on I-70
caught it.

380
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:58,863
Where on I-70?

381
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,530
20 miles west of Baltimore.

382
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,496
SAUL: When?
WOMAN: Five hours ago.

383
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,329
Well, if they stayed on I-70,
they should be somewhere

384
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:05,630
around Columbus, Ohio, by now.

385
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:06,997
Alert the Ohio State Police.
We also

386
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,796
have a photo
of Faisel and the girl

387
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,963
SAUL: Run her face through the databases.
Also see if

388
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,129
that fancy new face-recognition
software gets us anything.

389
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:16,229
Also try and match her face to anyone
who popped up because of fingerprints.

390
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,863
Raqim?

391
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:45,096
We're here.

392
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:47,663
This is it?

393
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:50,162
You sure?

394
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:53,363
This is where they
said we'd be safe.

395
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:26,062
FAISEL: They said
they'd meet us here?

396
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,863
They said to sit tight
and they'd contact us.

397
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,863
(insects chittering)

398
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:17,730
Wait! Don't open the door.
FAISEL: What?

399
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:20,363
- Why? Why? - Don't open the door. Close
that, close that gently.

400
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:22,730
Gently.

401
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:24,796
Get back in the car.

402
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:31,997
(engine starts)

403
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,630
(tires screech)

404
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,263
(panting) Oh, fuck,
oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

405
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,263
We're okay.
Oh, fuck. You keep saying that!

406
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,329
Because it's true!

407
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:48,763
You sure there was a bomb?

408
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:50,263
I could see the trigger--
pressure-released.

409
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,830
Open the door and boom-- very
simple and very effective.

410
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,897
What? How do you
know this shit?

411
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,796
They... they-they
trained me.

412
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,029
They trained you?!

413
00:21:58,062 --> 00:21:59,930
You never told me that!
Does it matter?

414
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,129
Yes, it does matter!

415
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,863
We are supposed to be
in a relationship!

416
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:05,496
We are supposed to be
honest with each other!

417
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,963
We should turn ourselves in.

418
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:09,029
And spend the rest of our
lives being interrogated

419
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,463
in some offshore
torture chamber?

420
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,463
We haven't actually
broken any law.

421
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,997
They can't hold us forever.
Tell that to the guys in Guantanamo.

422
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,363
(panting)

423
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,463
We got to get rid of this car.

424
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:21,630
(exhales)

425
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,196

holding on to
Brody, that's all.

You didn't want to let him go.

And see?

444
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:08,162

00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,997
ALL:
To Tom Walker.

457
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:43,830
What went on over there, Nick?

458
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,830
How'd you and Walker get hit?

459
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:49,162
Well...
(clears throat)

460
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,062
...we were dug in.

461
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,663
You know, uh, next thing I know,

462
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:58,029
we're taking fire
from all sides and, uh...

463
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,329
and we ate dirt and prayed.

464
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:01,997
They were waiting for you.

465
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,229
Somebody screwed up.

466
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:05,329
Somebody always screws up.

467
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:07,196
Rear echelon motherfuckers.

468
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:08,463
Mm-hmm.

469
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,863
You are so full of shit, Brody.

470
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,096
Lauder, shut the fuck up.

471
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,696
No, no,

472
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,463
I think it's important

473
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,963
to state for the record,

474
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:24,930
in case anybody's wondering,
which they're not...

475
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,129
but hey,

476
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:31,696
the record's
the record--

477
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,096
Brody is full of shit.

478
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:37,530
Right up to his
fucking eyeballs.

479
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:40,396
It's always good sharing
a beer with you, Lauder.

480
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,630
Exactly when did Wild Man Brody

481
00:24:42,663 --> 00:24:44,463
become a dick-
sucking war hero,

482
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:47,263
trotted out by the brass

483
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,763
so all the fucking
morons in this country

484
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:52,663
could have something
to feel good about,

485
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:54,796
so they'd stop asking:
What's the point,

486
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,096
what the fuck are we even
doing in Iraq and Afghanistan?

487
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,229
And when did you,
who once told me

488
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:04,997
you just wanted
to come back in one piece,

489
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:08,496
become the Boy Scout poster
boy for fucking recruitment,

490
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,796
suckering another
couple thousand boys

491
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,596
from fucking Indiana

492
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,296
and the Bronx to go out and get

493
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:17,963
their fucking legs blown off?

494
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,496
What happened to you?

495
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,830
Here's my question:

496
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:30,563
how come Walker died
and you came back alive?

497
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,496
What's that about?

498
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,196
Huh, what's that about?

499
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:39,196
Luck, Lauder,

500
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:41,997
that's what
it's all about--

501
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:43,496
good luck and bad luck.

502
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,363
I'm glad you brought up
the subject of luck.

503
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:47,730
Mike, you got anything

504
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:50,196
to say about that, you being
an expert on luck and all?

505
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:51,963
You're such an asshole.

506
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:54,963
Can I be honest?

507
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:56,863
I'll be honest.

508
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:58,096
Why not?

509
00:25:58,129 --> 00:25:59,863
We're all compadres, right,

510
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:03,563
brothers in arms
and all that crap?

511
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,396
While you were away,
there's not a man here

512
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:08,630
who didn't want to bend
your wife over the sink

513
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:10,029
and fuck her up the ass.

514
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:12,730
You son of a bitch.

515
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:16,229
(punching)

516
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:18,563
Come on, come on.

517
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:21,129
(grunting)

518
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:31,496
You were my friend.

519
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,296
(grunting)

520
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,029
(panting)

521
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:45,329
Brody.

522
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:46,763
Brody.

523
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:59,296
Fuck.

524
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:02,296
(tires screeching)

525
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,463
Meet Aileen Margaret Morgan.

526
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:08,296
28 years old, brown hair,
sometimes dyed blondish,

527
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,496
blue eyes, five-
five, 110 pounds.

528
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,530
This photo was
taken six years ago

529
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:15,363
when she was arrested
protesting outside

530
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,863
a G-8 meeting in Edinburgh.
The one to the right

531
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:20,830
was taken six months ago for
her current driver's license.

532
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:22,997
Somehow she made the journey
from Connecticut schoolgirl

533
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:24,296
to terrorist's girlfriend

534
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,863
involved in a plot
against America.

535
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,129
How?

536
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,696
Why?

537
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,196
Dig into her history.

538
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:32,029
Where did she grow up,
where did she go to school,

539
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:33,997
who were her friends, where
and when did she meet Faisel?

540
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,363
All of it.
Anything more about the car?

541
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:37,029
I want every cop

542
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:38,630
on the eastern seaboard
looking for that damn thing.

543
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:40,029
Sir?
Yeah.

544
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:41,329
I'm sorry to bother you,
but it's...

545
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:43,196
What?
Spit it out, spit it out.

546
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,496
It's time, sir.

547
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,863
Anybody know what
he's talking about?

548
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,796
I think it's time
for your polygraph.

549
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,162
Polygraph?

550
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:52,162
I don't have time
for a fucking polygraph.

551
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:53,730
It's all right, Saul,
you'll be fine.

552
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:55,296
If anything comes up,
I'll come and get you.

553
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:57,496
You're not gonna miss
anything important.

554
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:01,329
Please help me out here.

555
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,196
This is how we're
going to get Brody.

556
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:07,596
Look for any contacts overseas,
especially in the Middle East.

557
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,029
School, exchange programs,

558
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,596
graduate school,
kibbutz, anything.

559
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,897
This is
the polygraph room, sir.

560
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,162
Oh, is that right?
Hello, Larry.

561
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,396
Hello, Saul.

562
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,563
How's everything?
Oh, just peachy.

563
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:21,429
Okay.

564
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,997
Would you hold that for me?

565
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,997
Thank you.

566
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:32,930
Could you hold this
for me right here?

567
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,930
Born December 25, 1983,
Houston, Texas.

568
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,429
Father is Owen Robert Morgan,

569
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:41,730
mother is
Abigail Sarah Lifeliter.

570
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:45,897
RAKOR vice president.

571
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,396
He ever work in
the Middle East?

572
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:50,463
Saudi Arabia, 1991 to '96.

573
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,463
Looks like he's a pretty big
deal in the oil business.

574
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:57,096
Okay, so we've got
a rich American girl

575
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:58,796
living in Saudi
Arabia for five years

576
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,429
between the ages
of eight and 13.

577
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:05,429
When did Faisel leave Saudi
Arabia to study in the States?

578
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:07,463
1995.

579
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,963
So they overlapped
by four years.

580
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,463
(sighs)

581
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:16,830
What happened, Aileen?

582
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,930
What did you see?

583
00:29:20,963 --> 00:29:23,162
Is your name Saul Berenson?

584
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,296
For Christ's sake.

585
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:28,730
Is your name Saul Berenson?

586
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:30,229
(sighs) Yes.

587
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:32,162
Saul, calm down.

588
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,596
We've been through this before.

589
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,963
Take a deep breath,
think of something pleasant.

590
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:37,997
Okay?

591
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:42,496
Okay.
Okay.

592
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,496
Uh, do you live
at 413 Circle Drive,

593
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,530
Washington, D.C.?

594
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,029
Yes.

595
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:51,329
There we go.

596
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:53,496
Much better.

597
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,296
Do you work for the
Central Intelligence Agency?

598
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:57,596
Yes.

599
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,530
Is your office
on the fifth floor?

600
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:02,329
Yes.

601
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:04,196
Are you planning
on telling the truth today

602
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:07,763
about Afzal Hamid
and the razor blade?

603
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:10,263
Yes.

604
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:14,162
Did you pass Afzal Hamid
a razor blade?

605
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:16,129
No.

606
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,897
Saul.

607
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,363
You got to relax
or we'll be here all night.

608
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:22,963
I can't be here all night.

609
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:25,162
We've got an emergency
going on out there.

610
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,530
The real world will not wait

611
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,997
for these bureau-
fucking-cratic idiocies.

612
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,630
(sighs)

613
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,630
We'll finish it tomorrow.

614
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:34,196
(sighs)

615
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,296
Saul.
(door slams)

616
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:38,630
Where'd she go after Princeton?

617
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:40,029
Jordan-- the Peace Corps.

618
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:41,696
How long?
Two years.

619
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,563
Do any traveling
while she was there?

620
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,630
Uh, Egypt, Lebanon--
oh, here we go--

621
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:49,563
SaArabia, March 22
to March 30, 2004.

622
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:52,229
Any overlaps with Faisel?

623
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:54,897
March 26 to 27, 2004.

624
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,997
Faisel visits his grandmother.

625
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,429
Aileen Morgan and Raqim
Faisel met somewhere

626
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:01,563
between 1991 and 1996

627
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:02,897
in Saudi Arabia.

628
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,930
They reacquainted themselves
there March 26 to 27,

629
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:07,596
also in Saudi Arabia.

630
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,296
They were childhood friends.

631
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:15,663
That was fast.

632
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:18,463
I got to go back,
finish tomorrow.

633
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:20,763
I figured you might
need me out here.

634
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,897
(sighs)

635
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:30,696
A naive, weak-willed American
rich girl falls madly in love

636
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,029
with a Saudi engineer
who happens to be a terrorist.

637
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:37,029
Sacrifices all to be with him
and help fulfill his mission,

638
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,630
whatever the fuck that is.

639
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,429
Sound convincing?

640
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:43,997
Why hasn't she cracked

641
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,496
at least a little bit,

642
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,863
called her parents,
run away, something?

643
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:52,663
Things are getting
pretty hairy for an amateur.

644
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,296
Maybe we've got it backwards.

645
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,530
Maybe she's the one
driving this.

646
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:01,897
She's the terrorist?

647
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,530
(phone rings)

648
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:12,229
Carrie here.

649
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,496
It's me--

650
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,897
Brody.

651
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,563
Yeah, y-y-you gave me
your number.

652
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,963
Should I hang up?

653
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:22,596
What's wrong?

654
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,963
(sighs)

655
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:27,029
I can't do the polygraph
tomorrow.

656
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:28,897
Why not?

657
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,930
I just can't, I'm a mess.

658
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:33,596
I've had the worst fucking day.

659
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,096
I could tell them my name
and it would sound like a lie.

660
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,229
Where are you?

661
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:44,429

667
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:05,563
Uh, I'll have
whatever he's having.

668
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:07,162
Bourbon, straight bourbon.

669
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,997
Okay.

670
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,496
What's the difference,
I always wondered.

671
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,830
Straight's been aged for two
years in charred oak barrels.

672
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,830
Ugh, still tastes

(both chuckle)

674
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,196
What happened to your hand?

675
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,196
I decked my best friend.

676
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:30,830
Ouch.

677
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:32,630
Hurts like a motherfucker,
excuse my French.

678
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:35,363
Uh, I was talking
about your friend.

679
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,563
Don't--
he's an asshole.

680
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:39,663
Want to tell me about it?

681
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:44,029
You ever been married
by any chance?

682
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:46,229
Nope.
Why not?

683
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:51,029
It just hasn't felt right
quite yet.

684
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,296
Or as important
as what I do for a living.

685
00:33:56,863 --> 00:33:59,463
Plus the guy I was seeing
when I left for Iraq decided

686
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,930
I wasn't worth the wait.

687
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:03,463
Nice.
Eh, I can't say I really blame him.

688
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:05,296
I mean...
(laughs)

689
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:07,696
...it's not like I was
Little Miss Faithful over there.

690
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,930
(chuckles)

691
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,630
Hey, if you don't slow down,

692
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:13,796
I'm never gonna be
able to catch up.

693
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,129
How come, when I met you
at the safe house the other day,

694
00:34:16,162 --> 00:34:18,196
you pretended like we hadn't
bumped into each other

695
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:20,329
at the, uh, support group?

696
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:22,897
Oh, that.

697
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,763
Yeah, that.

698
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,796
You mean aside from the fact
that I'm not supposed

699
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,530
to get help from counselors
outside the agency?

700
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:32,129
Is there another reason?

701
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:36,563
I don't know.

702
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:42,663
Standing there
that night in the rain.

703
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:46,963
I figured, who else had to know?

704
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:51,596
What?

705
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,863
(laughs)

706
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,563
I like it when
life is like that.

707
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,496
Like what, wet?

708
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:03,863
Heightened somehow.

709
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,096
When I was a girl, my friends
and I used to play chicken

710
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,830
with the train on the tracks
near our house,

711
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:15,229
and no one could ever beat me,
not even the boys.

712
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,496
(clicks tongue)

713
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,496
(sighs)

714
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,563
(slurring):
I can't stand the Wizards.

715
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:32,563
What kind of name is that anyway
for a basketball team--

716
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:33,997
the Wizards?

717
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:36,596
What are they, like,
magicians in hoods?

718
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,863
(both laughing)

719
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:39,329
Redskins?
(gasps)

720
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:41,162
I love the Redskins.
Me, too.

721
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,763
No, I grew up on the Redskins.

722
00:35:42,796 --> 00:35:46,196
My father thought
he <i>was</i> a Redskin.

723
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,196
He used to take me to games
in the freezing cold.

724
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:51,129
One time we wore sleeping bags.

725
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:52,463
(laughs)

726
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:55,296
We climbed in, we zipped 'em up.

727
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:56,763
All you could see was our eyes.

728
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:58,129
You have great eyes.

729
00:35:58,162 --> 00:35:59,763
Thank you.

730
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:01,029
Kind of secretive.

731
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:03,530
Ah, comes with the job.

732
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,730
Secretive eyes--
it's a requirement,

733
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,062
Yeah?
Really.

734
00:36:08,096 --> 00:36:09,596
Oh, Jesus, we drank too much.

735
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,863
Yeah, we did.

736
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,096
Oh, I hope I don't puke.

737
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,363
You're gonna puke?

738
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:15,096
No.
You all right?

739
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,530
I'm half Irish.
The Irish don't puke?

740
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:20,696
(laughing): Nah, only when we have
to salute the British.

741
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,096
(both laughing)

742
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:29,296
(laughter)

743
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,696
This is me.

744
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,263
Want to know
what it's all about?

745
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,930
The polygraph?

746
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,930
I thought that was classified.

747
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,796
It is.

748
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,229
Hamid's dead.

749
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:51,129
Someone slipped him
a razorblade in the safe house.

750
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:53,530
Slit his wrists.

751
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:58,830

I just do.

807

For how long?

808
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:32,296
I-I don't know.

809
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,830

810
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:36,329
I don't know.

811
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:39,229

812
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:41,463

Sounds perfect.

824
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:49,796
Come on. We're late.

825
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:54,263
Come on.

826
00:41:59,763 --> 00:42:02,196
Have a good day at school,
sugar bunny.

827
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,830
Right.

828
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:07,997
JESSICA:
Dana.

829
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:19,363
(car doors close)

830
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:21,830
(car engine starts)

831
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,663
LARRY:
Did you go to college?

832
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:29,363
SAUL:
Yes.

833
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:31,329
LARRY: Did you major
in Political Science?

834
00:42:31,363 --> 00:42:33,229
SAUL:
Yes.

835
00:42:33,263 --> 00:42:37,930
Have you ever sold secrets
to an agent of another country?

836
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:39,396
SAUL:
No.

837
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:40,830
LARRY:
Are you married?

838
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:44,663
No, not really.

839
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,596
LARRY:
Yes or no?

840
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:53,396
I don't know, Larry.

841
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,229
Okay?

842
00:42:57,263 --> 00:42:59,830
Maybe yes, maybe no.

843
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:01,229
Technically?

844
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:04,229
Technically, yes.

845
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:07,696
LARRY:
Did you give

846
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,029
Afzal Hamid a razorblade?

847
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:12,429
No.

848
00:43:13,663 --> 00:43:16,029
That's it.

849
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:18,396
You're free.

850
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,129
Oh.

851
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:26,863
I hope I never see you again.

852
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:28,796
Oh, you will.

853
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,229
Thanks, buddy.

854
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:37,496
(sighs)

855
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:41,763
(sighs)

856
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:47,563
Trouble at home.

857
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,463
It'll blow over.

858
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,096
Brody next?

859
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,129
Brody's next.

860
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:54,897
Assuming he shows up.

861
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,596
This is it, Saul.

862
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,463
Finally.

863
00:43:58,496 --> 00:43:59,930
Let's hope.

864
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,997
LARRY: Come on in,
Sergeant Brody.

865
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:28,496
Just stand over here.

866
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,997
This won't take long.

867
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:31,997
Can you just, uh,
take your jacket off?

868
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:34,630
You can put it on
the chair there.

869
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:39,596
(sniffles)

870
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:42,363
SAUL:
Oh...

871
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:44,830
(sighs)

872
00:44:48,196 --> 00:44:50,196
(exhales)

873
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:56,997
LARRY:
Okay.

874
00:44:57,029 --> 00:45:00,062
Now, just relax

875
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:02,863
and answer all the questions

876
00:45:02,897 --> 00:45:06,396
honestly, yes or no.

877
00:45:06,429 --> 00:45:07,863
All set?
Mm-hmm.

878
00:45:07,897 --> 00:45:09,897
Okay.

879
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,129
Is your name Nicholas Brody?

880
00:45:13,162 --> 00:45:14,696
Yes.

881
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,263
Are you a member
of the U.S. Marine Corps?

882
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:18,596
Yes.

883
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,096
Do you intend
to tell the truth here today?

884
00:45:21,129 --> 00:45:22,930
Yes.

885
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:25,429
Have you ever sold secrets
to a foreign government?

886
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:27,062
No.

887
00:45:27,096 --> 00:45:29,229
LARRY: Have you
ever been arrested?

888
00:45:29,263 --> 00:45:33,396
BRODY: Yes.
I borrowed my dad's Pontiac one time.

889
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,229
I was 15 years old.

890
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:38,596
Have you ever been
arrested for a felony?

891
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,263
No.

892
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:43,162
Have you ever killed a man?

893
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:44,830
Yes.

894
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:48,062
Did you pass Afzal Hamid
a razorblade?

895
00:45:48,096 --> 00:45:49,062
No.

896
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:50,963
Do you live at

897
00:45:50,997 --> 00:45:52,796
3319 West Chapman Street?

898
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,463
BRODY:
Yes.

899
00:45:54,496 --> 00:45:56,196
LARRY: Are you
sometimes called Nick?

900
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:58,196
BRODY:
Yes.

901
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:00,096
LARRY: Is Boston the
capital of Massachusetts?

902
00:46:00,129 --> 00:46:01,763
BRODY:
Yes.

903
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:03,296
LARRY: Do you know Afzal Hamid?

904
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,730
BRODY:
Yes.

905
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,463
LARRY: Did you
meet him in Syria?

906
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:08,596
Yes.

907
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,396
Did you slip him a razorblade?

908
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:12,196
No.

909
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:14,563
Ask him again.

910
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:17,763
Did you slip

911
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:20,229
Afzal Hamid a razorblade?

912
00:46:20,263 --> 00:46:23,496
No.

913
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:29,229
Ask him if he's ever been
unfaithful to his wife.

914
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,630
Go on, ask him.

915
00:46:34,663 --> 00:46:38,363
LARRY: Have you ever been
unfaithful to your wife?

916
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:43,496
No.

917
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:49,730
Okay, Larry, wrap it up.

918
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:52,563
Thank you, Sergeant Brody.

919
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:53,763
That it?
We all done?

920
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:55,296
LARRY:
We're all done.

921
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:56,830
He's lying.

922
00:46:56,863 --> 00:46:58,630
He passed the polygraph.

923
00:46:58,663 --> 00:47:01,029
Same one you and I take
and flub every time.

924
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:02,463
Or at least I do.

925
00:47:02,496 --> 00:47:04,596
(sighs)

926
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,263
It's... It's over.

927
00:47:08,296 --> 00:47:10,196
Man is clean.

928
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:12,663
Saul...

929
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:17,630
You can't deny the facts--

930
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:19,429
what we just
witnessed--

931
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:21,663
just 'cause you find
them inconvenient.

932
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:23,029
(sighs)

933
00:47:27,296 --> 00:47:29,663
So...

934
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:33,029
now we know

935
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:36,029
that Sergeant Brody's
been faithful to his wife.

936
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,296
Question:

937
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,897
Why do we care?

938
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,396
What was that all about?

939
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,796
(sighs)

940
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,496
Get in.

941
00:48:16,796 --> 00:48:19,162
(car door bell dings)

942
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,229
(tires squeal)

943
00:48:26,263 --> 00:48:36,393
