to see Kevin more than me.

You're making me
very anxious right now.

It's okay to be anxious.
It's normal.

Everything's going to be
unfamiliar for both of you.

And who knows what he's seen?
Who knows what he's done?

He's a surgeon.
He wasn't in combat.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,033
He saw the same things
there he saw here.

109

it's all about daddy.

he's not used to
listening to a woman.

115

It's just the idea
of coming home

and finding a little
hole in his life

117
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,018

for the first time.

122

He'll know how to do that.

123
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,964
You're right.

124

Do you really want a cake?

00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,455
So it starts with Ken Cosgrove

161
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,523
climbing out of the muck
and walking on dry land.

162
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,725
He says a bunch of nice stuff
about Ginsberg and you.

163
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,795
I told him not to use the word
genius about either of us.

164
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,831
Ahem, a woman
and her secrets--

165
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,633
Oh, the things
she'll never tell,

166
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,369
like how long
it took her to get ready

167
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,103
or the reason she's smiling.

168
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,804
A good-looking woman
at a party.

169
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:42,240
And where she got
the incredible shoes.

170
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:43,741
Another woman, not too catty,

171
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,311
says, "I love your shoes.
Where did you get them?"

172
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,347
We hold on five seconds of her showing
off the shoe from the calf down,

173
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,982
and this girl's legs
will be spectacular.

174
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,184
And, yes, you can
come to casting.

175
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,751
( Coughing )

176
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,259
That's plenty.

177
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,761
Are you kidding?
I'm ready to take off here.

178
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,631
I just wanted to hear the tone
of your voice so I can make sure

179
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,833
it's not as annoying
as it is in everyday life.

180
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,234
- ( Snickers )
- It's called a regional accent.

181
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:12,935
And believe it or not,
you've got one, too.

182
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:14,470
We can't all sound
like Walter Cronkite.

183
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:16,072
Do you like this?

184
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,007
I never saw boards
for the Cinderella thing.

185
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,509
Well, you killed it,
and for good reason.

186
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,010
Cinderella and shoes
is a cliche.

187
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,978
- You could have TB.
- Sleeping beauty?

188
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:24,613
Snow white?
Nothing worked?

189
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:27,416
They're more about
necrophilia than shoes.

190
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,884
It's footwear.
Don't make that mistake.

Gail: <i>Somebody wants

Jesus, is that him?

197
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,020
Holy crap, look at him.

198
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,357
Joanie, I'll get that.

199
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,394
You have your hands full.

200
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:18,163
We thought your flight might
be late because of the strike.

201
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:21,066
Yeah, we picked up
some folks in Honolulu

202
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,302
who had been stranded,
but everything was fine.

203

Gail, go get the brownie.

I don't think we have any film.

You know what?

206
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,581
I'll take Kevin
and go get some,

207
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,849
so you two can visit a spell.

208
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,320
Okay, that's a good idea.

209
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:45,156
You have supplies in case you
have to be gone for a while?

210
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:47,390
I have everything.

211
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,562
And so do you, Greg.

212
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,540

I'm sorry about this morning.

223
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,593
It couldn't be avoided.

224
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,302
It was a long time ago
and I was unhappy.

225
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,772
Because you were married.

226
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,441
It's fine.
It's just embarrassing.

227

Why should you be embarrassed?

228
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,613
Seriously?

229
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,749
Because you're
married to me now.

230
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,152
And after Allison
and faye Miller

and who knows how many more...

232

I was divorced.

And now you're not.

00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:39,262

of careless appetite--

You can't blame that on Betty.

I tell you, let it go.

237

- You brought it up.
- No, I didn't.

238

You did.

239
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,606
And all I can think
is you feel guilty,

240
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,508
which makes it worse
than I thought.

241

I married you.

there until you eat it.

- You did your part.

Nobody lied to anybody.

to terms with that.

00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:56,870
I need to store up
as much of you as possible.

320
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:04,534
And yes, you can
come to casting.

321
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:05,803
Michael: <i>And you think
it sounds good,</i>

322
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,604
wait till you see it in print.

323
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:14,410
"You'll never tell.
They'll never be able to."

324
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,114
I don't know.
What do you think, Mr. Butler?

325
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,483
I think Ken was right--
You're a genius.

326
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,885
( Coughing )

327
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,021
Square-on strategy.

328
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,656
I think the boys
did a good job.

329
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:30,025
The girl should be
European-looking.

330
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:31,994
Maybe get a French girl.

331
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,695
Great.

332
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:35,297
So?

333
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,066
Sold.

334
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,973
I have to tell you, young
man, you really know women.

335
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,942
I've never heard that before.

336
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,812
This really gets
inside their heads.

337
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,479
Well, to tell you the truth,

338
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,115
they confuse me.

339
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:56,450
I mean, I keep thinking
about Cinderella.

340
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,618
We were going to come in here
and talk about Cinderella,

341
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,287
<i>but it's too dark.</i>

342
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,955
Really?

343
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,556
We were kind of hoping for it.

344
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,158
Nah, I don't think so.

345
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,328
I mean, she's running down
this dark side street.

346
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,895
And it's outside a castle,

347
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,799
so it's got those walls
and the cobblestones.

348
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,634
And she's running,
but she's only got

349
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,936
this one incredible shoe
for her incredible gown,

350
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,272
so she's hobbling,
wounded prey.

351
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,073
She can hear him behind her,

352
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,976
<i>his measured footsteps</i>
<i>catching up.</i>

353
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,748
She turns a corner.
Those big shadows.

354
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,116
And she's scared.

355
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,052
And then she feels
a hand on her shoulder

356
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,254
and she turns around.

357
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,056
And it doesn't matter
what he looks like.

358
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:43,961
He's handsome, at that moment
offering her her shoe.

359
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,863
<i>She takes it.</i>

360
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,167
She knows she's not safe,
but she doesn't care.

361
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,536
I guess we know in the end

362
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,405
she wants to be caught.

363
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,074
See? It's too dark.

364
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:03,747
Why don't we do that?

365
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,548
The man said sold.

366
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,183
You wanted Cinderella anyway.

367
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,318
- You forgot that.
- No, I said it was a cliche.

368
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,886
That's because you thought
they wouldn't like it,

369
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,755
but in your heart
you knew it was good.

370
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,290
In my heart I'm on the verge of
throwing you in front of a cab.

371
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,158
Okay.

372
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,561
So however proud of yourself
you're feeling right now,

373
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,131
just know that everything I'm
saying has "or else" after it.

374
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,367
Don't do that again.

375
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,903
Think of those ideas
in front of me.

376
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,372
Don't do that again.
( Coughs )

377
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,440
I gotta make a call.

378
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,245
He's such a decent guy.

379
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,548
You know you almost
got fired just now.

380
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,216
I don't think
you're right about that.

381
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:44,751
I'm positive.

382
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,022
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>Mr. Draper is on line one.</i>

383
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,291
Hello. How'd it go?

384
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,492
Good.
What are you up to?

385
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,795
I'm keeping your chair warm.

386
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,231
So I'll swing by
and get you in an hour?

387
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,764
Well, why don't
you just go home,

388
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,366
climb into bed?

389
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,303
- Really?
- <i>Yes.</i>

390
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,204
I only need another
couple of hours.

391
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:06,739
And, Don,

392
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,707
<i>no smoking.</i>

393
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,625
( Coughing )

394
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,767
( Sighs )

395
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,074
Mohawk says that LBJ is scared

396
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,976
of forcing the mechanics
to arbitration

397
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,576
because he has
midterm elections

398
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,711
and he's worried about
losing the labor vote.

399
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,714
- That's good news.
- Yes, it is.

400
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,150
The strike's going to go on for
at least a couple more weeks

401
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,319
and Mohawk can sop up
all the extra routes.

402
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,989
So they want us to walk
them through the campaign

403
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,690
first thing Monday morning.

404
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,758
- A phone call will do.
- The campaign, of course.

405
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,527
We're ready to go.

406
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,264
Have a good weekend.

407
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:15,104
Damn it.

408
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:21,942
Good night everyone, Clara.

409
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,711
<i>Good night,</i>
<i>Mr. Campbell.</i>

410
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:27,581
<i>( Laughter )</i>

411
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,650
Where's Ginsberg?

412
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:32,753
He's probably everywhere after
Don scattered his ashes.

413
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,056
Apparently he went haywire
in the presentation downstairs.

414
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:37,491
I don't care.
Call him.

415
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:39,159
I just did.
He's not home.

416
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:41,495
- Is he coming back?
- You know what?

417
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:43,963
I'm going to go
out there and find him.

418
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,732
I'm going to start
the whole world

419
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,402
and then I'm going to
eventually check my apartment.

420
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:55,674
What are you doing tonight?

421
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,976
I don't know.
What did you have in mind?

422
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,046
Are you drunk?
Get your feet off that desk.

423
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,050
I need you to work up
something for Mohawk.

424
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,518
Oh, I'm sorry.

425
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:09,187
For Mohawk, your, quote,
"man" is Ginsberg.

426
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:12,257
Let's say you were
to do this for me

427
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,926
and on Monday you explain
to Ginsberg and Campbell

428
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,494
that I asked you to...

429
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:19,664
Only I asked you
sometime last week.

430
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:24,368
Do you have a brief?

431
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:27,871
- Did Ginsberg have a brief?
- I never told Ginsberg, okay?

432
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,640
You have to remember that.

433
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,876
- You know about the airline strike, right?
- Yes.

434
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,744
Why is Mohawk still flying?

435
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,880
Because even though all the
other mechanics are on strike--

436
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,647
Boo-hoo, they need more
wrenches or something--

437
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,083
Mohawk's mechanics
have a side deal,

438
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,317
so they have to keep working.

439
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,119
They must love that.

440
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:44,687
Yeah, well, they're going
to love the overtime.

441
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,289
American airlines
is taking everything big

442
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,424
and giving their northeast
corridor to Mohawk.

443
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,293
( Sighs ) So what do you want?

444
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,860
How about something like

445
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,930
"Mohawk, breaking the strike
one flight at a time"?

446
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:58,567
Or maybe "Fly over
the picket line with Mohawk"?

447
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:00,669
Hey, Trotsky,
you're in advertising.

448
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,772
Fine. So what's
the angle?

449
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,275
Campbell or I had this idea that
it would be something about,

450
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,578
you know, how times are tough

451
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,580
and you can't get anywhere.

452
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,816
So thank God Mohawk is
offering emergency service.

453
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,884
You don't want to use the word
emergency with an airplane.

454
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,153
I don't want to do any of this.
I'll see you Monday.

455
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,155
Hold on a second.

456
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:24,592
You want me to work up an entire
corporate image campaign for $10?

457
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,793
I can make you do it for nothing.
I'm the boss.

458
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,729
You're right

459
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,732
the work is $10,
the lie is extra.

460
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,100
Incredible.

461
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,768
What do you make
a week, sweetheart?

462
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,704
Mm, you don't know, uh?
That's helpful.

463
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,606
You know, I could fire you.

464
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:43,009
Great, there are some
portfolios in Joan's office.

465
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:44,644
Maybe you could find
somebody tonight.

466
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,478
Why are you doing this to me?

467
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,413
Because you're being
very demanding

468
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,750
for someone who has
no other choice.

469
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,885
- <i>( Sighs)</i>
- Dazzle me.

470
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,787
Fine.

471
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,421
How much you want?

472
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:57,790
How much you got?

473
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,031
- $400.
- Give me all of it.

474
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,000
Jesus!

475
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,169
It better be good.

476
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,171

at me and he said,

I know she's coming home.

637
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:28,101
I'll be gone.
I promise.

638
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:30,569
Andrea.

639
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,944
I can feel you against me.

640
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:41,480
Remember that night
at Lincoln Center

641
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:44,315
when you took me back
to the loading dock?

642
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,852
Your wife was waiting inside.

643
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,979
So it's just me,
my brother, who's 19,

644
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:18,414
and my mother,
who says she's 39.

645
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:21,184
- Like Jack Benny.
- ( Both laugh )

646
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:24,120
- Is your brother in school?
- No. He delivers furniture

647
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:27,456
and argues with my mother
about joining the army.

648
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:30,426
Mm.

649
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:34,263
You were saying something in the
taxi about Don and I cut you off.

650
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,198
No, I was finished.

651
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:41,103
You can talk to me.

652
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:44,372
I was his secretary, you know?

653
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,175
You were?

654
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,610
- So how did you--
- I didn't even ask for it.

655
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:51,446
Sometimes they drag
the secretaries in

656
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,481
for focus groups to try things

657
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:56,484
and I was discovered...

658
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:59,321
Like Esther Blodgett.

659
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:01,255
( Laughing )

660
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,091
Oh, God, I'm really drunk.

661
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,994
Y'all drink a lot.

662
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:09,896
( Laughing )

663
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:16,236
So what were you going to say?

664
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,038
I was going to say--

665
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,973
Go ahead.
You can talk.

666
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,809
- I'm trying to.
- Oh.

667
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,344
( Laughing ) I'm sorry.

668
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,379
I was going to say
I hope you won't

669
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,981
tell Mr. Draper
about me sleeping there.

670
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,050
You two talk sometimes.

671
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,254
Nah.

672
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,356
We have to stick together.

673
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:43,228
I know we're not really
in the same situation,

674
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:46,231
but I was the only one
like me there

675
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:47,766
for a long time.

676
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,838
I know it's hard.

677
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,106
I appreciate that.

678
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,550
Do you want to be a copywriter?

679
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:09,786
No. I like my job.

680
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:13,690
Yep.

681
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,158
You're right.

682
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:19,863
Copywriter's tough,

683
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,931
especially for a woman.

684
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,003
Do you think I act like a man?

685
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,241
I guess you have to a little.

686
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,947
I try, but...

687
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,282
I don't know
if I have it in me.

688
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,587
I don't know if I want to.

689
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:10,076
( Gasps )

690
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:13,178
I'm sorry.
I can't sleep.

691
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:16,114
Well, you cannot sneak up
on someone my age,

692
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:17,917
especially in this house.

693
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:20,653
I'm scared.

694
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,255
Can I sit with you?

695
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:24,990
Only for a bit.

696
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,297
What's that for?

697
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,634
Why are you scared?

698
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:38,402
I read the newspaper.

699
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,971
Oh, honey.

700
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:42,173
Did you pull it
out of the trash?

701
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,974
Why did that man do that?

702
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:48,311
Well, probably because
he hates his mother.

703
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:51,715
- I don't understand what happened.
- What happened?

704
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:57,153
Those girls got ready for bed

705
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:00,490
and there was
a knock on the door,

706
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,959
and a handsome man was there.

707
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,327
And maybe one of them knew him,

708
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,396
but probably not

709
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:13,068
<i>because he was probably</i>
<i>just watching them from afar.</i>

710
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:17,672
All those young,
innocent nurses

711
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,542
in their short uniforms

712
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,811
stirring his desire.

713
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:24,579
For what?

714
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,481
What do you think?

715
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,550
You're old enough to know.

716
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,519
Why didn't they run away?

717
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:32,653
Because they were scared.

718
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,756
They probably thought,
"He can't rape nine of us."

719
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:40,093
- Why not?
- You just can't.

720
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:43,531
They didn't know it was going
to be worse than that.

721
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:48,535
They didn't know what
was in store for them.

722
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,438
Now I'm really scared.

723
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:54,774
It's not going to happen,

724
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:58,077
not while I've got
my burglar alarm.

725
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,114
How am I going to sleep?

726
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,284
Get the water.

727
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,120
What's that?

728
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,722
It's Seconal.

729
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,997
Do you know how to take a pill?

730
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,368
- ( Kevin crying )
- You two stop it.

731
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,604
Damn it, Joanie!

732
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,505
- Stop it.
- Gail, out!

733
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,375
Take him out of here!

734
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,143
- <i>( Pounding )</i>
- <i>Open this door</i>

735
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,946
or I will kick it down!

736
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,480
Who goes back?

737
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,150
I will throw a parade
for you every day

738
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,153
- to thank you for preserving freedom.
- It's done.

739
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,322
Well, you can't make a
decision like that without me

740
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,458
and you have never
understood that.

741
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,460
If this was World War II and the
Japs were still attacking us,

742
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,127
you'd say,
"Yes, of course!"

743
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:55,464
Soldiers wanted to come home
from world war ii also!

744
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:58,634
I've got my orders,
you've got yours.

745
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:07,076
- Where are you going?
- To meet the boys for a drink.

746
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,243
He just needs
to blow off steam.

747
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,678
Don't get involved, mother.

748
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,615
You're a military wife.
You make sacrifices.

749
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,717
Someone's Kevin is over there and he's
going to get hurt and Greg won't be there.

750
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,686
But our Kevin is right in
there and he doesn't care.

751
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:21,855
It's a year.
You can do it.

752
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:24,591
- I'll help.
- No.

753
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,192
Go lie down.

754
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,294
You don't even know
how tired you are.

755
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,727
I hope you don't
mind the couch.

756
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,662
Since my roommate moved
to the other room,

757
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,264
I just have a pile
of Abe's clothes.

758
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:44,932
This is perfect.

759
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,935
Well, good night, then.

760
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,684
I-- I'll just--
I'll throw these out.

761
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,586
Thanks.

762
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,426
Good night.

763
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,970
I'll see you later.

764
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,972
No, you won't.

765
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,708
Don't argue with me.

766
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,610
I have to get out of here.

767
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:33,445
Hotel next time?

768
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,648
No next time.

769
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,615
That was a mistake.

770
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:40,985
A mistake you love making.

771
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:46,457
I'd better not see you again.

772
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:48,726
You're not going to ruin this.

773
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,862
You loved it.

774
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,430
And you'll love it again

775
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,131
because you are
a sick, sick--

776

783

What's going on?

784
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,140
Where's Sally?

785
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,376
Sally?

How are you feeling?

789
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:05,454
Where were you?

790
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,390
I was right there.

791
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:11,594
You're burning up.

792
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:15,864
No, last night.

793
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:20,068
I was waiting for you.

794
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:22,103
I came right home.

795
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,207
You were a mess.
I was really worried.

796
00:43:31,914 --> 00:43:33,981
You don't have
to worry about me.

797
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,588
Okay.

798
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:57,136
There are some scrambled
eggs in the bowl

799
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,372
and I made flapjacks.

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,107
Just coffee.

801
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,476
- Where's Kevin?
- You slept a long time.

802
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,177
He was awake and went
back to bed already.

803
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:07,246
I barely slept at all.

804
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:16,221
I've been thinking
about it and...

805
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,657
I want you to go.

806
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,925
I'll put this away.

807
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,597
I'm glad you came around.
It's only a year.

808
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:31,335
No. I want you to go
and never come back.

809
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,639
Damn it, Joanie.
They need me.

810
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,775
Well, then, it works out,
because we don't.

811
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm very important there.

812
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,812
I have 20 docs and medics
who rely on me.

813
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,347
They look to me
for my skill and leadership.

814
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:49,752
I'm glad the army
makes you feel like a man,

815
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,155
because I'm sick
of trying to do it.

816
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,357
The army makes me feel
like a good man.

817
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,928
You're not a good man.

818
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,863
You never were,
even before we were married,

819
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,666
and you know
what I'm talking about.

820
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:19,146
If I walk out
that door, that's it.

821
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,419
That's it.

822
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:46,206
It's over.
