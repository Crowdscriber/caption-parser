1
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,274
Fucking-A.

2
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,267
Yeah, shit is good.

3
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,566
Here. Next time we re-up, though...

4
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,067
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?

5
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,367
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.

6
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:56,166
-Same with the jumbos?
-Yeah, better get more of those, too.

7
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,165
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?

8
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,165
What up? Can't call it.

9
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:13,764
-How's our package?
-How's it look? Shit is good.

10
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,765
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?

11
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,964
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...

12
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:25,664
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.

13
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,364
-You heard?
-You want us to fuck them up?

14
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:29,664
No, dawg.

15
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,963
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.

16
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:37,963
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...

17
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,763
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.

18
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,163
You heard me, right?

19
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,263
All right.

20
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:53,662
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?

21
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,062
Fall back, young 'un.

22
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:58,961
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?

23
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,662
Hey, String.

24
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:07,761
I heard you, man, I did.

25
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,660
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.

26
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,260
You like the new product we selling?

27
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,861
It make sense now?

28
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,359
-Where are we at with our Boss Man?
-We should be up on his phone soon.

29
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:32,360
-The PC is there, no question.
-We get up on his cell phone, he's done.

30
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,760
We'll ID him, no problem.

31
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,359
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.

32
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,859
Sobotka's cell phone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.

33
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,059
This is the other way to go.

34
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,259
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.

35
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,458
But still, if he's changing up
on his cell phone....

36
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:51,958
Over the last week or so...

37
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:55,658
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...

38
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:58,357
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.

39
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,057
First of all...

40
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,457
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.

41
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,557
-E-ton.
-Whatever.

42
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:10,556
Our madam, Miss llona Petrovna.

43
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,757
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...

44
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:18,857
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.

45
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:22,456
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.

46
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:29,856
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.

47
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,855
And lookit. Two locations only...

48
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:35,555
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.

49
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,055
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.

50
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:41,554
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.

51
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:45,254
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.

52
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:47,155
-Or a tag number.
-It's totally cool.

53
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:50,754
-Where did you even get this stuff?
-DEA for the trackers.

54
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:54,653
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.

55
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:58,354
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.

56
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:01,353
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.

57
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,450
What the fuck, Frank?

58
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,550
You might as well
start posting them things, right?

59
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:48,850
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.

60
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:56,649
It ain't personal, Ott.

61
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,649
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.

62
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,649
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.

63
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:06,949
It ain't about that, kiddo.

64
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,648
Ott, listen to me!

65
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:20,347
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?

66
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:23,547
I.B.S.?

67
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:28,147
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.

68
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:33,046
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.

69
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,447
And in my heart of hearts...

70
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:40,246
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.

71
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:47,746
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.

72
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:52,446
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.

73
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:57,545
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...

74
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,545
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.

75
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:01,745
A surveillance van?

76
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:04,945
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's l-don't-know-where.

77
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:07,444
The last picture was from Seattle...

78
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:10,044
but I got prints...

79
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,444
from two other places, see?

80
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,344
You reported the van stolen, right?

81
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:21,043
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...

82
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:23,743
would reflect poorly on the department.

83
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:27,742
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...

84
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:31,543
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.

85
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:37,243
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.

86
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:41,042
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...

87
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,241
back across town where they belong.

88
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:47,042
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so....

89
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:50,142
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...

90
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:53,042
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.

91
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,041
Walk, nigger.

92
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,540
Yo, what's up, soldier?

93
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,540
-Looking maybe to do something here.
-With him? This motherfucker?

94
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,441
-Looking maybe to do something here.
-With him? This motherfucker?

95
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,240
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.

96
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,540
-Fuck y'all, nigger.
-Look, what did he say?

97
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,839
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.

98
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:19,340
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?

99
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,839
That'll work.

100
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,739
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.

101
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,339
That's what's up, see?

102
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:30,038
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.

103
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:31,438
What? Get the fuck out of here!

104
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:33,639
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...

105
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:37,138
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?

106
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,238
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...

107
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:42,537
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.

108
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:45,737
-Believe that.
-All right, nigger. Whatever, man.

109
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,038
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.

110
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:59,037
-Where do you want it?
-There's good.

111
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:03,536
Easy.

112
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:10,535
-We could help you set it up.
-You have a surveillance to cover?

113
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:22,035
-I got that feeling again.
-Like they don't think we're potty trained.

114
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:27,035
-Can I help you?
-FBl. Lt. Daniels?

115
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:30,035
He's in his office.

116
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:35,534
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.

117
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,333
How could you have known?

118
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:41,733
-There was the wingtips.
-And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.

119
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,734
-Tight asses.
-Definitely.

120
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:52,533
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.

121
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,133
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.

122
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:00,933
You listening to this fool?

123
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:04,232
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...

124
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:07,532
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...

125
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:09,731
while the Westside do sherry?

126
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,832
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.

127
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:18,131
-Butchie, talk to this fool.
-For me, leastways...

128
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,631
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:

129
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,930
-Frank Matthews.
-Pee Wee Matthews?

130
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,030
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them ltalians.

131
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,430
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.

132
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,530
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?

133
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,830
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.

134
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,030
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.

135
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:46,729
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.

136
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,129
Excuse me.

137
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:54,529
What say, Omar?

138
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:56,928
Ain't no thing.

139
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,228
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.

140
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,727
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?

141
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:10,427
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.

142
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,127
It's for my people.

143
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,926
A little something for a rainy day.

144
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:35,026
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.

145
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,026
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?

146
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,625
Back off to what?

147
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,225
Later, Butch.

148
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,825
Stay, boy.

149
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:26,422
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.

150
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,922
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.

151
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,120
Nicely done.

152
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,320
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.

153
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,220
-Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
-Will you get in the goddamn car already?

154
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,420
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!

155
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,119
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.

156
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,618
Where the fuck you going with this?

157
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,118
Greece. Athens, Greece.

158
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:31,618
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.

159
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:34,217
So they don't look at the union.

160
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,117
Welcome aboard, chief.

161
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,214
Is that you?

162
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:43,012
I thought you were gonna go shopping.

163
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,813
-Me?
-Yeah.

164
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,612
We round-the-clock with surveillance.

165
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,912
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?

166
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:57,211
When do we get to that part?

167
00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:01,211
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?

168
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:05,111
You try being me like this.

169
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,510
Something wrong?

170
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:37,309
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?

171
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:01,807
-Almost $4,000.
-I know it is.

172
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:05,907
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.

173
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:09,607
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.

174
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:13,506
-And you saved all that?
-He gave me a bump, too.

175
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:16,006
I'm pulling down $700 a week.

176
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,406
You don't believe me?

177
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:23,906
Christ.

178
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:29,005
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.

179
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,803
You know what I'm saying, dawg?

180
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,302
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.

181
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:12,202
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."

182
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:15,702
-Gentlemen.
-What's up, my brother?

183
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:20,202
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?

184
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,901
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...

185
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:27,801
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.

186
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.

187
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:36,600
-Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
-That name ring out, but so do mine.

188
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,300
And you are?

189
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,400
Cheese, man.

190
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,400
Mr. Cheese. I see.

191
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,900
-And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
-Who do I work for?

192
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,400
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?

193
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,600
Hell, yeah.

194
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,299
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.

195
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,799
-This nigger serious?
-Let me be emphatic.

196
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:03,299
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.

197
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,199
-What?
-Hold on now.

198
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:10,298
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?

199
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:14,698
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.

200
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:17,398
Second of all, I don't give a fuck....

201
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,297
Get off me, get off!

202
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:28,697
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.

203
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:33,996
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:

204
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:35,696
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...

205
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:39,096
1 20-grain hot street load
of my own creation.

206
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:43,296
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:

207
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:48,596
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?

208
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:52,295
Let's go.

209
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,695
Good day to you, sir.

210
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:08,194
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.

211
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,594
As far as I can see...

212
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,394
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.

213
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:16,894
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.

214
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,694
But I want one thing on record.

215
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:22,393
As of 9l1 1,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:

216
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,293
it's waterfront corruption.

217
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:26,993
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.

218
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:28,593
This case is bigger than the union.

219
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:31,193
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.

220
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:34,293
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.

221
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:37,892
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.

222
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:47,791
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.

223
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:50,891
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.

224
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,491
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.

225
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:57,090
See what leads that might generate.

226
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,391
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?

227
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,290
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.

228
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,390
Shoulder do hurt.

229
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:16,490
But this here work just fine.

230
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,389
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.

231
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:25,389
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.

232
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:32,188
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.

233
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:35,688
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.

234
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:39,387
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.

235
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:43,487
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...

236
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:47,288
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.

237
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:50,287
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.

238
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:54,087
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.

239
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:55,587
Put a bounty on him.

240
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:58,287
Let some bushwacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.

241
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:01,286
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?

242
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:05,486
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.

243
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:13,685
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.

244
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,285
Only, he won't take contract money.

245
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,783
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.

246
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:52,283
No problem.

247
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,083
I got the three on the left.

248
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,082
Fuck you, assholes.

249
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:05,982
-How you doing?
-How you doing, buddy?

250
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:08,281
The Samsung S221 . You got that?

251
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:10,781
I don't see it.

252
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,881
Doing the old inventory, are we?

253
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:21,981
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.

254
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,880
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.

255
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,881
-You get the cars off?
-Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.

256
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:31,880
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.

257
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,379
Not here.

258
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:36,179
In my office.

259
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,979
Forgive me, but how am I to know...

260
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,679
you did not ship them empty?

261
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,878
I just don't know. Let me see.

262
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:53,979
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...

263
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:58,078
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.

264
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:01,778
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.

265
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:03,778
Or you know what I could do?

266
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:06,678
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...

267
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:09,077
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.

268
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:11,377
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.

269
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:13,077
-They are what I order?
-Yes.

270
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:16,077
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.

271
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:18,277
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?

272
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,377
Outside? Now?

273
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:24,776
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.

274
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,075
Wait one.

275
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:48,575
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.

276
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:52,274
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.

277
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:56,874
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.

278
00:26:56,974 --> 00:26:58,674
No!

279
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:03,573
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.

280
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:05,974
You listen to me.

281
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:08,774
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.

282
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:12,273
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?

283
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:14,872
You don't play me like that. You don't.

284
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:30,772
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.

285
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:32,071
Malaka!

286
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,771
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka, " yes?

287
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,171
Now you know malaka with dress.

288
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,266
Please.

289
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:07,565
Malaka.

290
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:19,164
Can you hear me?

291
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,864
Ifyou can talk, please stay on the line.

292
00:30:57,657 --> 00:31:00,157
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.

293
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,457
-It's easier that way.
-Yeah?

294
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:05,756
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.

295
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:11,856
-Come on.
-Don't push me, man.

296
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,056
Rod.

297
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:25,555
Got it.

298
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:29,456
Here. Hold on to that.

299
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:33,255
I know this one.

300
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:50,554
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.

301
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:54,454
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.

302
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:57,554
Didn't say what that might be?

303
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:02,152
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.

304
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,452
No. It don't feel right.

305
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,452
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.

306
00:32:12,552 --> 00:32:17,052
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.

307
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:20,451
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.

308
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:24,051
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...

309
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:28,151
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.

310
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:31,251
-"Parley"?
-That's all he says he's looking for.

311
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:37,051
I'll talk to him.

312
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:41,250
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...

313
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:44,950
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?

314
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,550
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.

315
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:54,149
-They're the one got hurt the last time.
-Then there was a reason to meet.

316
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:59,249
-This time feel different.
-I hear you.

317
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:03,149
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...

318
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:06,148
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...

319
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:09,048
Omar being Omar.

320
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:13,548
If it ain't putting you out none...

321
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:17,548
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.

322
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:21,847
Hayward.

323
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:35,947
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.

324
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:46,245
-Thanks.
-Sure.

325
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:09,244
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.

326
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:15,344
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?

327
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:19,443
It's what's gonna play in court.

328
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,943
Can I change something?

329
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:28,243
Yeah.

330
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:37,142
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.

331
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,741
Yeah, it's only one.

332
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:44,241
-You know, you typed "said" here, see?
-"Said"?

333
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:55,141
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."

334
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,741
It was more begging.

335
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,840
You know? Double G, he's begging me.

336
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,540
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?

337
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:17,039
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.

338
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:45,337
Quiet. No one in or out of there.

339
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:04,136
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.

340
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:07,836
Waves lapping gently against the boat.

341
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:15,535
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?

342
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,135
But a detail like this....

343
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:22,135
That's what I'm asking.

344
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:25,834
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?

345
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,934
I mean, at home with the kids.

346
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,134
Until now, not much came up.

347
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,634
But now, say something comes up.

348
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:40,434
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?

349
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,833
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.

350
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:47,533
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.

351
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:51,333
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.

352
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,632
But you wouldn't miss it?

353
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:58,332
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?

354
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:04,632
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

355
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:12,031
-Thanks.
-It's no problem.

356
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,131
You wanna make a phone call to someone?

357
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:19,531
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.

358
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:22,130
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?

359
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,830
How about family?

360
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:45,529
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...

361
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:49,529
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.

362
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:52,728
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.

363
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:54,528
That's a lot of cans.

364
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:57,128
A hundred and ten, actually.

365
00:37:57,328 --> 00:38:01,428
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?

366
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,228
As many as it takes.

367
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:09,328
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.

368
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:14,327
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.

369
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:21,526
Anything from that shithole of a diner?

370
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:24,226
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.

371
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:27,526
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.

372
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:29,726
I'm going back on the water.

373
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:33,525
One meet and we're on this guy.

374
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:15,623
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.

375
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,822
-The Greeks again?
-Who else?

376
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,322
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.

377
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:28,721
-Uncle Frank.
-Nicky boy, just in time.

378
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:31,721
-Uncle Frank.
-What? What happened?

379
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,421
-What the fuck is it this time?
-He shot....

380
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:40,421
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.

381
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:43,121
-Last night, they're saying.
-Shot?

382
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:46,221
-He shot?
-Fucking Christ!

383
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:50,320
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.

384
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,620
-The Greeks?
-Double G.

385
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,420
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.

386
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,720
They're saying he walked in there.

387
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,119
-He went in.
-Why was he there?

388
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:04,219
-Where the fuck were you?
-Uncle Frank, I didn't know.

389
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,819
What didn't you know?

390
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:09,219
-What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
-I don't know.

391
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:12,318
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

392
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:13,019
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

393
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,318
You're his father.

394
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:28,117
1,1 25 kilograms.

395
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:30,917
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...

396
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:34,518
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.

397
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,717
I just wish I had good news for you.

398
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:43,116
You told me this was a local effort.

399
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:47,716
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.

400
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:49,416
My hands are tied.

401
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,116
They're on you with wiretaps.

402
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:57,916
Several phones, several addresses.

403
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:17,114
Stefanos.

404
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:26,813
Have the boy go to Eton.

405
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:29,214
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.

406
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:32,513
-You're not calling?
-No phones. No more phones.

407
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:36,612
Adieu, my friend.

408
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:49,712
They forgot your fries.

409
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:52,211
No, they forgot your fries.

410
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:55,612
-My fries are right in here.
-Those are my fries.

411
00:41:56,212 --> 00:42:00,211
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.

412
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,111
Go ahead.

413
00:42:04,211 --> 00:42:07,211
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.

414
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,111
What? You think I'm fat?

415
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,910
There's our boy.

416
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,310
-Lester, Eton's on the move.
-We got it.

417
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:29,609
-No need for an eyeball follow, right?
-No need.

418
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:32,309
A fine fucking kettle of fish.

419
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:36,108
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.

420
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:39,008
-And sure enough....
-Major?

421
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:43,108
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.

422
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:45,708
You let me down.

423
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:49,308
-Major, we can talk in my office.
-Lieutenant.

424
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:52,408
It's Lieutenant, right?

425
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:55,208
I gave you a simple assignment:

426
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:58,407
that fellow, the one in the corner.

427
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:02,307
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.

428
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:06,007
Good digs, people...

429
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:08,606
everything you needed.

430
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:11,006
And what did you give me?

431
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:14,706
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.

432
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:18,305
-Major, you're going to get--
-Roland, get your shit.

433
00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:20,706
You want to do it your way, fine.

434
00:43:20,905 --> 00:43:23,805
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.

435
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:30,804
-Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
-I got.... There's work....

436
00:43:31,405 --> 00:43:34,705
-You said--
-Get your narrow ass back to the district...

437
00:43:34,805 --> 00:43:37,605
before I slap you with insubordination.

438
00:43:39,204 --> 00:43:40,904
Move, shitbird!

439
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:45,804
Jesus!

440
00:44:06,302 --> 00:44:09,402
Detective, my office.

441
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:55,399
Base to 1 1-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.

442
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:57,799
Copy that. We're on it good.

443
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:09,798
We're on the Boss.

444
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:11,998
My God.

445
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:16,897
-He shoots both?
-He kills George, right there in the store.

446
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:20,498
-Leaves the boy to bleed.
-For what?

447
00:45:22,497 --> 00:45:24,697
An argument over a few cars?

448
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:28,197
-That little Polack?
-He's crazy, that one.

449
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,097
The police have him now.

450
00:45:35,596 --> 00:45:37,397
The police still there?

451
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:40,796
Go to the store.

452
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:45,095
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...

453
00:45:45,196 --> 00:45:46,896
you clean it up.

454
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,496
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.

455
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,695
Everything.

456
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:59,195
And the phones are dead.

457
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:07,894
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.

458
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:11,493
1 1-34 to Surveillance.

459
00:46:12,094 --> 00:46:14,393
-Standing by.
-We got our man.

460
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:18,194
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...

461
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:21,093
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.

462
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:23,793
Copy your description.

463
00:46:25,093 --> 00:46:27,793
1 1-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.

464
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:30,493
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.

465
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:31,592
Copy.

466
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,292
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?

467
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,092
Same thing you always do.

468
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:41,291
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.

469
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,590
That's our guy, right?

470
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:03,291
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?

471
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:13,989
I need to get with Vondas.

472
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,990
Who's that?

473
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,488
Spiros. Where is he?

474
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:27,488
I don't know no Spiros.

475
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,587
-No shit.
-He just up and clocked him?

476
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:50,987
-Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
-Even us suits.

477
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:53,187
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.

478
00:47:53,387 --> 00:47:55,986
-Where's Prez now?
-Daniels took him home.

479
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:59,186
-I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
-You never know.

480
00:47:59,286 --> 00:48:02,786
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...

481
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:05,186
gives him immunity or something.

482
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:09,086
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.

483
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:16,785
-Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
-They're definitely dumping phones.

484
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:26,085
When you use a cell phone and
press "send," where does the call go to?

485
00:48:26,185 --> 00:48:28,884
-Why are you asking?
-The Boss Man at Fort Howard.

486
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:31,284
He tosses the cell phone we're up on, right?

487
00:48:31,384 --> 00:48:35,183
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.

488
00:48:35,283 --> 00:48:36,783
Text messaging.

489
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:42,083
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?

490
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:44,883
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.

491
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:49,282
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?

492
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,982
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?

493
00:48:52,082 --> 00:48:54,583
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?

494
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,782
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cell phones?

495
00:48:57,882 --> 00:49:01,382
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.

496
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:03,782
What you need is another variable.

497
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:08,081
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.

498
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:12,381
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.

499
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:16,981
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?

500
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:21,380
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.

501
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,680
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?

502
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,880
There must be Verizon, MCl, AT&T, Sprint....

503
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,180
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.

504
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:41,979
Lamar?

505
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,279
-Where's my Harper's?
-Say what?

506
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:46,978
Harper's. The new issue.

507
00:49:47,078 --> 00:49:50,178
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...

508
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,378
-and a new something else.
-I did not forget to tell you Harper's.

509
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:57,977
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.

510
00:49:58,077 --> 00:50:01,678
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.

511
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:05,277
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.

512
00:50:07,077 --> 00:50:10,477
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?

513
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:14,677
A nigger with a library card.

514
00:50:17,177 --> 00:50:20,676
All damn day, he just sit there reading.

515
00:50:21,976 --> 00:50:24,776
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.

516
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:27,675
-That's real muscle, right there.
-True that.

517
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:32,375
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?

518
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,775
That's what we need to ask ourselves.

519
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:38,375
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...

520
00:50:38,776 --> 00:50:41,674
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?

521
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,874
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid lnc...

522
00:50:55,974 --> 00:50:58,573
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.

523
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:00,173
It's on McNulty then.

524
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,073
11-35, you got the 20?

525
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:06,073
-I'm on the spot right now.
-Go.

526
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:11,173
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 1 1 .727.

527
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:15,772
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.

528
00:51:18,572 --> 00:51:22,172
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.

529
00:51:22,672 --> 00:51:25,371
Identified a cell phone using time and GPS.

530
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:28,271
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...

531
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:31,271
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.

532
00:51:36,871 --> 00:51:38,271
Just a subpoena?

533
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:42,071
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.

534
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:43,770
With a search warrant...

535
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,471
you can get two months of text messages.

536
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,170
You got two months of text messages
in this file?

537
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,370
I do, if you've got a warrant.

538
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:56,669
Tell you what, friend.

539
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,970
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.

540
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,469
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...

541
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:04,969
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.

542
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:06,869
Exigent circumstances.

543
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,769
Thanks, brother.

544
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,068
Fuck me.

545
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:23,267
Nothing's easy.

546
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:29,668
-What's up?
-They've dumped their phones.

547
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:33,567
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.

548
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,467
They sent that Greek mess over as email.

549
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:40,166
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.

550
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:41,267
Got it.

551
00:52:44,466 --> 00:52:45,766
Shit.

552
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:01,565
Hey, Prissy.

553
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:05,165
Thought you'd be here.

554
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:31,063
Fucking Ziggy.

555
00:53:31,963 --> 00:53:34,063
When didn't he do dumb shit?

556
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:38,363
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?

557
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:42,762
We all pooled our money.

558
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:45,662
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.

559
00:53:45,762 --> 00:53:47,862
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.

560
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:50,962
We told him specifically:

561
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:53,561
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and....

562
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:58,261
Southern Comfort for me.

563
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:05,161
What did fucknuts get?

564
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,060
Fucking Boone's Farm.

565
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,560
He said that's what the college kids drank.

566
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:20,059
But we did it up. Right here.

567
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:30,059
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...

568
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,258
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.

569
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,458
What the fuck did he say?

570
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:53,057
"College kids ain't shit!"

571
00:55:19,956 --> 00:55:21,456
Goddamn, Zig.

572
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:43,254
-Yeah?
-Beadie, it's Kima.

573
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:46,654
We're gonna take the Boss out.

574
00:55:46,754 --> 00:55:50,753
-Raids? Tonight?
-You got somewhere to drop the kids off?

575
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:54,353
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.

576
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,753
All right, we'll see you soon.

577
00:55:57,853 --> 00:56:01,053
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.

578
00:56:13,052 --> 00:56:15,651
The judge wants to know how much longer.

579
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:16,951
We're close.

580
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,851
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.
