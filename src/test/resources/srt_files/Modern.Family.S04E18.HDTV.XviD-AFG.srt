1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:05,038
So we're gonna change that one.

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,454
I'm back.

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,908
Okay, let me see,
let me see, let me see!

4
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:12,047
You guys are want to, um...

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,832
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,921
I love it!

7
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:18,140
All clear.

8
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,138
Okay, so--

9
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:23,188
So good! It is so good!

10
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:25,032
For the last few months,

11
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,167
Cam and I have been redoing
a house together

12
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:27,998
that we're gonna flip,

13
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,035
and I have to say,
it has been goin' great!

14
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,825
We make an amazing team.

15
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,353
- Yeah. The key is trust.
- Absolutely.

16
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:37,626
The key is, I let Claire
think she's in charge.

17
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:40,520
I hide what I want in something
bigger and more expensive.

18
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,270
Then when she rejects that,

19
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:45,527
we "compromise"
on what I wanted all along.

20
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,562
I call my method "the Trojan horse."

21
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:50,142
You know how I got Lily?
I asked Mitchell for triplets.

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,301
- Okay.
- Uh-huh?

23
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,822
You are going to love

24
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:54,694
what I found
for the kitchen countertops.

25
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:57,923
It's from Carrarra, Italy.

26
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,110
It's where Michelangelo
got the marble to make the "David."

27
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:04,547
Oh. Now we know why the "David"
couldn't afford any clothes.

28
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:05,990
Okay, well, uh...

29
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,464
I also found this one.

30
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,320
It's not as nice,
but it's less expensive.

31
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,452
Well, it's still over budget, but...

32
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,481
I guess it's okay.

33
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:16,982
- Mm.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,767
By the way, we couldn't get
the powder room fixtures you wanted.

35
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:19,561
What? Why?

36
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:23,769
Well, they're 23%,
or $982, over the budget.

37
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,045
Keeping in mind, that space
is only 12% of 1,462 square feet.

38
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,761
Whenever I need to rein
in Cam's spending,

39
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:33,736
I employ something that I like
to call "the number dump."

40
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:37,359
So... unless you wanna cut 16%,

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,022
or $1,764 from somewhere
in the flooring budget,

42
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,791
we've gotta find another 4% overall.

43
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,966
Yeah. No, as long as they're pretty,
it's fine. It's fine.

44
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,822
Yesterday, I accidentally
said "eleventy-five."

45

47
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:03,807
So everybody knows how hard
I worked on that project.

48
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:04,787
I mean--

49
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:09,629
Hey, wait. What are you doing?

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,076
Trying to put the sugar
back in the thing.

51
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:12,445
Well, just go get the broom.

52
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,781
I'll eat it for a dollar.

53
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,699
What did I say about
eating things for money?

54
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,685
Charge the most.
Then people will think you're worth it.

55
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,319
That's right.
That's at least $5.

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,550
- Hey, he said a dollar.
- Broom.

57
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:23,617
Hey, dad, I can't find my scarf,

58
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:25,089
and the closet light's burnt out.

59
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,911
- So just change it.
- I can't reach it.

60
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,224
Oh, if only there was
some magical way

61
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,423
of getting up closer to the ceiling.

62
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:33,231
Okay, now you just
sound like Dylan.

63
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:35,133
- I'm saying get a step stool.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

64
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,947
One thing at a time, okay?

65
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,340
What is happening?

66
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm sweeping.

67
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:40,427
No, you're not sweeping.

68
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,030
You're just spreading it all around.

69
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,276
It's gonna cost more if
you want me to eat it now.

70
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:46,136
That's when it hit me--

71
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,825
my daughters know nothing
about home care and maintenance.

72
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,573
I don't want 'em to be dependent.

73
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:52,258
It's up to me to show them
what a modern,

74
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,372
self-sufficient woman looks like.

75
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,857
Careful. Keep that up,

76
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:02,271
he'll have to hit "numero dos"
when he calls the DMV.

77
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,162
By the time he's old enough to call,

78
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:06,030
it will be "numero uno."

79
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,872
Ay, there he is.

80
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:10,347
Manny, why did you
have breakfast alone outside?

81
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,162
I felt like eating
breakfast alfresco.

82
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,504
Does that mean
he had his pants off?

83
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,143
Because if I can't, he can't.

84
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:19,033
Jay, he's been eating outside
on his own all week.

85
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,730
Do you think that he feels left out

86
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:22,819
because of all
the attention I give Joe?

87
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,105
You know, I've been
wondering the same thing.

88
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,476
Tell you what-- why don't
I have some father-son time

89
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,779
with Joe this afternoon

90
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,613
and give you some time with Manny?

91
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,346
Ay, that's so sweet.

92
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,173
You can take Joe to his baby class.

93
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,057
Gloria, I think he already
knows how to be a baby.

94
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,441
I love you,
but I can't laugh at that again.

95
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:41,213
Manny, how about
I pick you up after school,

96
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:43,023
and we both have a special day?

97
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,251
Well, I did talk to Jay

98
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,052
about getting some tickets
for this reading.

99
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,064
What reading?

100
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:48,026
Seriously?

101
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,516
The stage reading of "Moby Dick"?

102
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,862
I told you about it last night.

103
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,338
I have zero recollection of this.

104
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,310
I knew I shouldn't have
poured you that second scotch.

105
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,693
Sorry, buddy,
but I already committed

106
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,663
to spending the afternoon with Joe

107
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,509
so you and your mom
could have more time together.

108
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,774
Hey, maybe she can take you.

109
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,450
- Can we, mom?
- Of course, mi amor.

110
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,626
It's your special day.
We'll do whatever you want.

111
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:07,730
Great. This is gonna be
four hours you'll never forget.

112
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:10,770
Hey, buddy.
Looks like it's just the dos of us.

113
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:15,128
Why do I feel that
you did something shifty?

114
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:15,946
I have no idea.

115
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,827
But I gotta say,
it's not your best quality.

116
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,038
All right, sweetie,
you have a good day.

117
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,526
Watch me play handball, daddy.

118
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:24,455
Oh, okay.

119
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,667
Next!

120
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:28,089
That's Milo. He beats everybody.

121
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,978
Next loser!

122
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:33,932
- He's mean.
- Yeah, I'm gettin' that.

123
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,830
Next!

124
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,902
Another girl?

125
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,457
Hey, sweetie? Sweetie?

126
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,185
You're gonna do great, okay?

127
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:44,852
If you say so.

128
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,114
Next!

129
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,704
Uh, Milo?
That-- that was my fault.

130
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:48,802
I distracted her,

131
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:49,872
so maybe she could just go again?

132
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,982
No do-overs. Next!

133
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:54,703
Well, I'm next, and I would like
to give her my turn.

134
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,866
No switcheroos.
Are you playing or not?

135
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,900
- No.
- Chicken. Next.

136
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,165
I hate bullies.
I've hated them my whole life.

137
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,315
I hated them when they
were named Scott Dworkin

138
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:07,236
or Greg Pechenko
or Katie Greenwald.

139
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,827
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna play.

140
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,556
But, daddy, he's really good.

141
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:13,544
Well, I'm really good, too.

142
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,362
- But it's a sport.
- I got this.

143
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,580
You done talking?

144
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,275
You know, it's really appropriate
that we're at a school,

145
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,235
because I'm about
to teach you a lesson.

146
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,281
Next!

147
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:27,009
All right.
Sorry, sweetheart.

148
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,491
Here, I'll walk you to class.

149
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,242
No, thank you, mister.

150
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:31,291
But...

151
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:37,777
Whatcha doin'?

152
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:40,596
I think I have an idea.

153
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:48,908
Okay. Every house needs
a "wow" factor, right?

154
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,619
- Mm... - What is the one
thing this backyard is missing?

155
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,725
- A qualified buyer?
- Now don't be silly.

156
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:56,916
No. A water feature
with a fire element.

157
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,132
Oh, God, no.

158
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,960
No, no, please.
Now just imagine--

159
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,694
this entire back wall

160
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,264
cascading into a reservoir
that erupts into flames

161
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,371
on the quarter hour.
How does that sound?

162
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:09,193
Like we need a white tiger.

163
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,408
Maybe I'm being a little ambitious.

164
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,456
So let's just do a couple
dancing water fountains,

165
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,468
- call it a day.
- No, wait. Cam, Cam, Cam.

166
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:15,960
That's gonna still put us, like,

167
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:17,555
$3,500 over our landscape budget.

168
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,158
Right now, we're
40-12 percent higher

169
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,199
than I thought we'd be at this point

170
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,133
because Smitty added
that 8% surcharge.

171
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:24,230
I'm sorry--
Did you just say 40-12 percent?

172
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,021
Mm, no, I didn't.

173
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:26,567
Yes, you did.
You do this all the time.

174
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:29,495
You just throw numbers at me
to frighten and confuse me.

175
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:31,598
And here I thought we were
working so well together,

176
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,139
and you're just being manipulative.

177
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,254
What about you, Cam?

178
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,159
Pitching these crazy,
over-the-top ideas

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,213
just so you can slip in
what you really want.

180
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:41,477
Oh, how dare you accuse me
of Trojan horsing you.

181
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,970
You have a name for it?

182
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:44,044
No, I mean--

183
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,642
You know what?
I will not stand here

184
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,471
and be accused by the likes of you.

185
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:48,788
And if there was a door here, missy,

186
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,245
I would slam it your face.

187
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:53,473
Oh-ho! I thought we weren't
flaming till the quarter hour!

188
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,851
Gloria and Manny
left me alone with Joe,

189
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:04,516
and it was great...
for about 20 minutes.

190
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,820
Then the little bugger
turned on me.

191
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,669
I tried everything
to calm him down--

192
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,412
Bouncing. Bottle.

193
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,269
Brightly colored objects.

194
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:13,847
Bigger bottle.

195
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,161
So I did the old
"put him in the car" trick.

196
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,464
But I could still
hear him out there.

197
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:18,544
I'm just kidding.

198
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:20,216
I drove him to his little class,

199
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:22,430
but he dozed off
right before we got there.

200
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:25,024
Or he took a page from
the Jay Pritchett playbook--

201
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:28,970
saw the crap he was in for
and pretended to be asleep.

202
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,897
Mr. Pritchett?

203
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:32,603
- Yeah.
- Rachel Lissy.

204
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:34,327
Claire's friend from
High School, remember?

205
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,200
How could I forget?

206
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,684
You knocked down
my mailbox with your K-car.

207
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,442
Again, I apologize.

208
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,963
- How you doin'?
- Couldn't be better.

209
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:42,879
I've been married for 15 years,

210
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,416
two great boys over there.

211
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:47,492
Cooper! Unhand your brother!

212
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,495
I'm taking them
to the James Bond movie,

213
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:54,288
and they don't want me
to sit with them.

214
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,359
I miss babies.

215
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,560
Oh, they're a lot of fun, huh?

216
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,952
- So nice to see you.
- Nice seeing you.

217
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:01,740
Great kids.

218
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,292
Ugh! No, you're not!

219
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,965
Joe, I found a better way
for us to bond...

220
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:12,138
James Bond.

221
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:15,607
My dad taught me everything
there is to know

222
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:16,981
about maintaining a home,

223
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,453
and today,
that tradition continues.

224
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:21,982
Voila! Light bulb changed.

225
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:25,262
Hey, I have an idea.

226
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,288
Let's get to know the house, huh?

227
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,253
Hey, I have an idea--

228
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,653
let's lock him in.

229
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,888
Okay. Let's go over
this baby right here.

230
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,208
What are we lookin' at, huh?

231
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,943
Photosynthesis?

232
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,437
In a sense, yeah.

233
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,518
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

234
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:44,337
Uh, photosynthesis
converts carbon dioxide

235
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:45,622
into food for plants,

236
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:49,564
this water heater converts
cold water into hot.

237
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,484
What converts this
conversation into over?

238
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,947
Girls, you need
to learn these things.

239
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:55,268
You might find yourselves
living alone at some point.

240
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,081
I long for the day.

241
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,591
Okay, we're just gonna start with
something really basic, all right?

242
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:03,847
I am turning the pilot light off.

243
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:05,407
These things go out occasionally.

244
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:07,231
- Why?
- I don't know. No one knows.

245
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:08,611
Let's just say gremlins do it.

246
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:11,065
But if it happens to you,
what do you do?

247
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,275
- Call a guy.
- Or a girl.

248
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:13,860
Oh, my God,
we're literally in a closet,

249
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,489
- and you just said that.
- Focus.

250
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,196
You don't call anyone.
To re-light the pilot,

251
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:19,702
turn the valve to "pilot,"

252
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:21,829
you press it down
to begin the flow of gas,

253
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,406
you wait a few seconds...

254
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:25,845
Where you guys from originally?

255
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,186
And you just press the igniter.

256
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,259
There you go.

257
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,914
That's odd.
Why is it not working?

258
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:35,100
Oh, I got it.
Why don't we just fill it up

259
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,781
with hot water from the tap?

260
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,324
Found another light that's out.

261
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,933
Claire and I were at a stalemate
on the water feature.

262
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:45,705
So I brought in
an experienced professional

263
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,154
to help break the tie.

264
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,411
Pam also happens to be a friend

265
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:52,041
and a fellow gay parent
at Lily's school.

266
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:55,218
Am I trying to stack
the deck against Claire here?

267
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,977
No. I would never be so...

268
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:00,126
genius.

269
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:03,816
Hi.

270
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,649
Oh. Oh, Claire, this is Pam.

271
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,583
- Pam, Claire.
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

272
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:10,043
- You, too.
- Pam is a licensed contractor.

273
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,495
- Done a lot of houses.
- Uh-huh?

274
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:13,350
I thought it'd be nice
to bring in a third party

275
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,618
that's objective, to help
settle the fountain dispute.

276
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,813
Oh. Objective, right.

277
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,796
Well, my son does
go to school with Lily,

278
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:21,789
but believe me, that is not
gonna sway my decision

279
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,084
- any more than the fact
that you are beautiful. - Hmm?

280
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,616
Thank you. You are, too.

281
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:27,593
Thank you.

282
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:29,205
Let me grab your cans.

283
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:30,534
Your paint cans.

284
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,018
There you go.

285
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,211
So...

286
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,886
Hey, what's the matter, Joe?

287
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:44,976
Hey, that's a boy.
That's a boy.

288
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:48,463
Come here. There you go.

289
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,761
Here you are. There you go.

290
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,961
There you go.

291
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,722
You know, I'm happy
to take him outside

292
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,639
- until he stops crying.
- Oh, no, I wouldn't want you to miss this.

293
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,823
It's fine. Once Daniel Craig
put his shirt back on,

294
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,014
- I lost interest.
- Are you sure?

295
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:01,623
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

296
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,698
Here-- just go ahead.
Attaboy.

297
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,805
Attaboy.
Thank you very much.

298
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,100
I'll be right outside.

299
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,048
- Okay.
- Shh!

300
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:09,981
You shush, Nathan!

301
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,131
Stupid thing!

302
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,749
Dad, we've been
standing here forever.

303
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,991
Can't we just call the guy?

304
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,859
No. There is no guy.
I'm the guy.

305
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,585
Here's what I need you to do.
Run to the hardware store,

306
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,906
get me a T6 torx screwdriver.

307
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,365
- What?
- Just ask the guy.

308
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,469
I thought there was no guy.

309
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,487
There is one there!

310
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:27,695
- Could be a girl.
- Eh?

311
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:28,924
Just go!

312
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,619
I didn't need a torx screwdriver.

313
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,072
I've always wanted one, though.

314
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,402
But I needed them
out of the house,

315
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,402
so... I could... call... a guy.

316
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,970
Dad, help me.

317
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,450
Are we gonna do that thing again

318
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,187
where you try on different outfits
like in "Pretty woman"?

319
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,342
Hey.

320
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,743
Saw you sinkin' some
J's back there, huh?

321
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,944
Box and one. Cover two.

322
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,036
Sh-Shaq-a-hack? Am I right?

323
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:55,977
Not even close.

324
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,856
- What's up?
- Well, word has it

325
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:00,154
that you were a pretty good
handball player back in the day.

326
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,593
Yeah. And Neil Armstrong was
a "pretty good" trumpet player.

327
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,040
I see you spent a lot
more time on the court

328
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,021
than you did in the classroom,

329
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,786
so clearly, I've come
to the right place.

330
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,669
Look, I need you to teach me
everything you know.

331
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,839
How come it's so important?

332
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,705
Well, there's this kid,

333
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:14,245
and he's been kind of bullying
Lily and all her friends.

334
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:15,506
And I tried to teach him.

335
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,677
I tried to put him in his place
on the handball court,

336
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:19,263
and I lost.

337
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,865
And I-I could just see
the disappointment in Lily's eyes.

338
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,881
Like there's any emotion
in those eyes.

339
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:25,241
Are you gonna help me or not?

340
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,150
- Okay.
- Yes!

341
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:29,879
But I need you to give it 105%.

342
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,643
Ah, no.
It's 110%, buddy.

343
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:32,996
That's impossible.

344
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:35,594
Yes.
I think the fountain's a little pricy.

345
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,666
But you know what? It's gonna
more than make up for itself

346
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,608
when a family comes in here

347
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:41,760
and falls head over heels
in love with this home.

348
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,959
Okay, that's a valid point.

349
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,891
It is a bit of an empty
space out there.

350
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:45,532
Thank you.

351
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,068
Well, I mean,
I see what you're saying.

352
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,262
Sorry. It's hot in here, right?

353
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,770
Oh, well, you know, that happens
to women of a certain age,

354
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,115
like with my mom.

355
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:55,948
Are you kidding?
What are you, like, 35?

356
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,588
What are you, like,
an angel sent from heaven?

357
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,979
I see what you're saying.

358
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,675
I just feel that we might be pricing
ourselves out of the market.

359
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,683
If a family wants to come in here,

360
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,132
and--and build
themselves a fountain,

361
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,005
they can do so themselves.

362
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,398
That's true.

363
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:14,009
Um, okay, well, you know, Pam,

364
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,399
- um, there are lots of families
like... ours... - Mm-hmm.

365
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,229
Moving to this neighborhood
for the schools.

366
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,763
P.S., saw Connor's art project--
gorgeous.

367
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:25,651
Talent runs in the family.

368
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,725
Anyway, I'm just saying
I think a family would respond

369
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,343
to having a little drama
in the backyard.

370
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:37,631
I think Pam's made it pretty clear
what she likes. Am I right?

371
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,078
Well...

372
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,700
Oh, no.

373
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:43,302
Now my shirt is all see-through.

374
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,411
And so are you.

375
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,588
Please tell me you are
not falling for this.

376
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:50,131
I'm not, but I am enjoying
this little show tremendously,

377
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:51,372
so thank you.

378
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:55,147
Yeah. As for my professional
opinion on the fountain,

379
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:56,133
don't do it.

380
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,286
I mean, if you were
gonna live here yourself,

381
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:01,420
I'd say go for it.
But it's too expensive for a flip.

382
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,136
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

383
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:04,217
Thank you.

384
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:06,765
- Cam?
- Fine.

385
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:07,959
Lesbians.

386
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,837
I can't believe I just went
garter shopping with my son.

387
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:15,498
When you find a better way to keep
my socks up, let me know.

388
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,200
Hey, as long as we're in the mall,

389
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,343
you wanna stop in the baby class
to see Jay and Joe?

390
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:21,331
No. They need this time
to make a connection.

391
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,697
It's not like mother and son,

392
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,923
that the bond is naturally strong.

393
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,952
Hey, isn't that Joe over there?

394
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,747
No, that's some weird baby.

395
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,065
He's not perfect
like my little Joe.

396
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,610
But he's got the same blanket.

397
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,224
Gloria.
What are you doing here?

398
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,591
You gave our baby to a stranger?!

399
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,525
She's not a stranger.
She's Claire's friend.

400
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:47,870
- Shh!
- Shut up, Nathan!

401
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:49,152
Gloria!

402
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,089
The gas is on, dad.

403
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,385
I can see the spark
from the igniter.

404
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,350
I don't know what it is.

405
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,149
- That's your thermocouple.
- Oh.

406
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:02,988
You get a little sediment in there

407
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,578
or some rust,
and you're done for.

408
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,061
The thermocouple. Of course.

409
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:07,374
Why didn't I think of that?

410
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,743
Thanks, dad. I-I shouldn't be
buggin' you with this stuff.

411
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,488
Are you kiddin' me?
I love to help.

412
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,312
Makes me feel like
you still need me.

413
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,498
Of course I need you.

414
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,089
You're the best
when it comes to this.

415
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,368
Anything else you need fixin'?

416
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:18,488
Yeah, actually,

417
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:20,792
I've been havin' a little
trouble with my thumb.

418
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,601
Oh, the old thumb.
That's simple.

419
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:26,745
Just push it back in and
make that popping sound.

420
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:30,154
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
- There you go.

421
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,930
Hey, make sure you tell Claire
how pretty she looks tonight.

422
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:36,104
A woman needs to hear that.

423
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,534
You do the same with mom.

424
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,634
No, your mom's a little tired
of hearing how pretty Claire is.

425
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,211
Good one!

426
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,170
All right. Love you.

427
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:45,340
Love you, too.

428
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,312
Dad, we're home.

429
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,773
Hey.

430
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:52,077
That was the least fun
I have ever had shopping ever.

431
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:53,022
Here.

432
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:57,143
Honey, that's a torque wrench,
not a torx screwdriver.

433
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,964
Okay, you're just screaming now.

434
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,339
Can't you just go get it?
You're the best at this stuff.

435
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,389
Yeah, plus the car
is doing something funny,

436
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,444
and there's a light
on the dashboard

437
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,117
that looks like
a little genie lamp.

438
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:08,667
My kids are helpless,
but maybe that's okay.

439
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,891
Because years from now when
they have their own houses,

440
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,444
they'll call me on
their hologram phones

441
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:15,005
and say, "help me, dad.
You're my only hope."

442
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,577
And I'll be the happiest
father in sector 7...

443
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,969
Or sector 12,
if we're doing really well.

444
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,399
I don't know why
your mom's so mad.

445
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:23,747
Maybe it has something to do

446
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,020
with giving your son away
to a complete stranger.

447
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,237
You're next.

448
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,180
And what were you two
doing in the mall, anyway?

449
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,510
I thought you were
seeing "Moby Dick."

450
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,606
It was sold out.

451
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,139
Maybe that's how
you can make it up to her--

452
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,919
take me to the "Moby Dick"
reading tomorrow.

453
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,984
Nice try.

454
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:37,757
Doing something selfless
for her other son

455
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:39,430
could make up for
your monumental blunder.

456
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,946
Maybe flowers or jewelry.

457
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:42,284
I like to throw money
at the problem.

458
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,652
Hello, pretty lady.

459
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,006
What do you wanna do for dinner?

460
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,821
How about we exchange
the baby for a cheese pizza?

461
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:50,006
- Is this about today?
- I'll call for those tickets.

462
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,293
You were supposed to spend
quality time with the baby.

463
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:56,213
Joe was asleep. He didn't even
know he missed the puppet show.

464
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,549
It was the baby class!

465
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,391
Okay, call it what you want.

466
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,144
I saw a hippie with
a frog on his hand.

467
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,454
And for your information,

468
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,482
I'm takin' Manny
to that reading tomorrow.

469
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,580
Now you're just trying
to dig yourself out of a hole

470
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:08,506
because you know that
you were caught in a lie.

471
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,930
- So here's something-- 
- Not now, Manny.

472
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:10,842
Oh, let him talk.

473
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:11,665
I called the theater,

474
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,675
and they have tons of tickets
for tomorrow's show.

475
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,522
And it turns out today's show
wasn't sold out, either.

476
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:17,242
- Ay, Manny, not now.
- Let him talk.

477
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:18,589
Mom, why'd you say it was sold out?

478
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,906
Yeah. Why'd you say it was sold out?

479
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:23,066
It was a mistake.
This is not my first language.

480
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,293
I don't understand
English very goodly.

481
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,662
Don't play that card.

482
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,691
You didn't wanna go
any more than I did.

483
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:32,283
Fine. I lied,
but I earned that lie.

484
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,425
Ay, Manny, I am so sorry.

485
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:37,191
But you know that I am always
trying to do everything

486
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:39,360
for everybody in this family.

487
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:41,147
But you.

488
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:44,039
You only do what's good for you.

489
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,754
Let me tell you something,
Jay Pritchett--

490
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:48,074
when it comes to raising kids,

491
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,430
you get what you give.

492
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,637
Well, you rattled
that off pretty goodly.

493
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:58,934
You don't have to do this, daddy.

494
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,224
I know, but daddy really
wants to do this, okay?

495
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,904
No, no, no.
No, what do you think you're doing, Sadie?

496
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:04,371
No cutsies. Come on.

497
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:05,715
Next.

498
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:06,867
Hello, Milo.

499
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:09,113
Hello, one of Lily's dads.

500
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,669
All right, let's make
this interesting, okay?

501
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,154
If I win, the new rule is this, okay?

502
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:15,441
No player can play more
than three times in a row

503
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,722
without getting back in line

504
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:18,025
and letting the other kids play.

505
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:20,475
- What if I win?
- Then I'll give you $20,000.

506
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,468
- You're on.
- All right. Let's do this.

507
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:28,009
Yes! Whoo!

508
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,348
One point for me.

509
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,013
One point for me.
That's right.

510
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,830
Milo, the ball's over here.

511
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:36,195
Nah, nah.
Doesn't count. It was out.

512
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:38,550
Aah! Little too high for you, huh?

513
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,993
Three bounces to the wall
makes you a lo-ser,

514
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:43,780
makes you a lo-ser

515
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:46,877
Final point.
I get this, I win.

516
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,689
Oh, sweet lord Jesus.

517
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:54,053
Whoo! Yes! Yes! Winner!

518
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:56,110
Cham-pi-on! Cham-pi-on!

519
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:58,330
Cam's gonna be doing
drop-offs for a while.

520
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:00,051
We got a letter.

521
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,358
I'm sure you're both wondering

522
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,256
why I summoned you here tonight.

523
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,362
I now present to you
the "wow" factor.

524
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:11,060
Cam...

525
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:15,923
I cannot believe
that you went rogue.

526
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:18,202
Uncool.
I am with Claire on this.

527
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,900
You'll soon see why.

528
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:21,748
Prepare your senses...

529
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,360
for dancing waters.

530
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:27,941
- Wow.
- Wow.

531
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,198
Factor.

532
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:31,504
Now imagine a prospective buyer,

533
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,681
so entranced by the aqua ballet,

534
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:37,087
they're compelled instantly
to make a rich offer.

535
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,801
I've even stocked the pools

536
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,682
with fish of gold.

537
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,074
They're just goldfish,

538
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,741
but they're--
they're right here.

539
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:48,591
This is...
this is really impressive, Cam.

540
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:49,623
What did you spend?

541
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,686
Quite a bit, actually,
but I don't wanna get into that.

542
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:54,079
Let me turn this up
to eleventy-five.

543
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,363
- Wow.
- Wow.

544
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,517
Factor.

545
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,486
Hey, Cam, are fish of gold

546
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,217
supposed to swim
backwards like that?

547
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:05,698
No, not to my knowledge, no.

548
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,269
Yeah, it's kind of like they're all--

549
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,947
they're gathering
towards that thing.

550
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:10,260
- It's like a-- 
- Oh, no!

551
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,799
- Ew! Ew!
- You're killing them!

552
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,368
Claire! Unplug it!

553
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:18,693
It's half a fish!
That's a half a fish!

554
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,496
There are certain queer
times and occasions

555
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:23,080
in this strange,
mixed affair we call life...

556
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,993
when a man takes
this whole universe

557
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:26,963
for a vast practical joke...

558
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:31,335
Though the wit thereof
he but dimly discerns...

559
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,663
Tick-tick-tick,
tick-tick-tick-tick,

560
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,420
"boom-boom" goes the dynamite,

561
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,234
"boom-boom" goes the dynamite!

562
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,951
And more than suspects
that the joke

563
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:40,840
is at nobody's expense but his own.

564
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,208
- All right. Close your eyes.
- Why?

565
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,732
- Just trust me.
- Okay.

566
00:20:58,349 --> 00:20:59,887
- Ow!
- Never close your eyes on the court!

567
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,770
- But you told me--
- Don't let me get in your head!

568
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:04,468
Pop 'em! Pop 'em all before
they hit the ground! Go!

569
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,011
I don't really understand how...

570
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,041
Make a fist with
your thumb on the side.

571
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,756
Now bring your thumb to the front.

572
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,023
Okay, now do it again.

573
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:15,042
Ha! You just spelled "ass"
in sign language.

574
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:18,435
Okay. Close your eyes.

575
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,495
It's okay. We're off the court.

576
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,342
You're never off the court!

577
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:27,621
