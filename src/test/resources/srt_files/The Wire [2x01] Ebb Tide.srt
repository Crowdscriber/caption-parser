Sync'd by Mothman

1
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,503
Freezing my balls off.

2
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:26,404
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.

3
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:28,805
Spring, huh?

4
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:33,804
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.

5
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:37,405
-Citywide to Marine Unit.
-7672. Go ahead.

6
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,805
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.

7
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:45,306
What's the location, Citywide?

8
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:50,107
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.

9
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,207
10-4, we're responding.

10
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,609
My father used to work there.

11
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,810
-Beth Steel?
-In the shipyards there, yeah.

12
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,310
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.

13
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,311
'73 for my dad.

14
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,811
-Party boat?
-Pretty one, yeah.

15
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:34,011
-More than one engine, right?
-Probably an electrical problem.

16
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,513
Is that a police boat?

17
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,714
How are you tonight? Good to see you.

18
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,314
Henry, how are you?

19
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,615
-Drink?
-No, thanks.

20
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,316
-You're the Captain?
-Yeah.

21
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,316
-Harbormaster?
-No, City Police.

22
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:18,617
-So you're dead in the water?
-Think it's the starter.

23
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,717
-You're not a mechanic, are you?
-Me? No.

24
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:23,917
I can't tell the aft from the stern.

25
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:26,517
Best I can offer you is a tow line.

26
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:30,317
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.

27
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,218
-10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
-That'll work.

28
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:38,018
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?

29
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:39,419
Lot of partying going on now.

30
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:42,219
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.

31
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,619
You're in the shipping channel.

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,321
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.

33
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,536
...because you see what I'm saying, right?

34
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:07,034
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.

35
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:08,235
I didn't care.

36
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,235
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.

37
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:12,635
I honestly didn't.

38
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:15,936
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.

39
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:20,237
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...

40
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:24,237
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.

41
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:28,138
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.

42
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,639
Major, you want this stuff where?

43
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:33,638
Just in here.
Up against the wall over there.

44
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:37,339
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...

45
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,938
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.

46
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,339
Easy. Everything breaks.

47
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,740
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...

48
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,740
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.

49
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,841
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.

50
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:57,842
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.

51
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,341
We were on it.

52
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,841
-Look at that. It's the dove.
-Right.

53
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,842
-So what do you think?
-What do I think?

54
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:15,343
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.

55
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,544
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...

56
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:23,244
and because he has City Hall's ear...

57
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,644
you're gonna make Sergeant.

58
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,744
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...

59
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:33,145
where, because I'm your father-in-law...

60
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:37,845
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.

61
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,546
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.

62
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,646
I don't want to make rank.

63
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,546
I want to work cases. Good cases.

64
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:49,747
Roland.

65
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,047
Listen to me.

66
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:59,847
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.

67
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:02,547
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...

68
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:05,549
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.

69
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,749
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...

70
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,849
you might actually have a career
in this department.

71
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,950
-This radio ain't working that well.
-We're losing it.

72
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,251
-We're losing the station, man.
-What you mean?

73
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,251
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.

74
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:34,551
-Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
-The radio in Philly is different?

75
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,752
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?

76
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:38,952
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?

77
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:42,953
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.

78
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:46,054
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.

79
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,754
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.

80
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:57,554
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.

81
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:01,654
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.

82
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:04,655
-This a Philly station?
-How the fuck would I know?

83
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:10,255
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.

84
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,257
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.

85
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,159
So far they on it.

86
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:44,966
Ahoy, matey.

87
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:48,267
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.

88
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:51,167
-Now I know who they talking about.
-Come on board, man.

89
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,468
-Come on, I wanna show you.
-Fuck, no.

90
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,667
-What's the matter?
-The Bunk can't swim.

91
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,068
I ain't too good at floating, either.

92
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,668
So what brings you to the water's edge?

93
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,568
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.

94
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:07,768
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.

95
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:11,369
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.

96
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,969
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.

97
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,670
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?

98
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,971
-Well, he's not to starboard.
-That's port, fool.

99
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:27,272
-How the fuck would you know?
-Come on.

100
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,572
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.

101
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,471
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.

102
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:36,571
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.

103
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:40,072
-What for?
-For betting that you'd ride the boat.

104
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,573
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...

105
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:47,474
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.

106
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:50,174
-Ain't the same up there without your ass.
-No?

107
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,674
Better, actually.

108
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,174
Hey, come on, now.

109
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,173
The canal gets dredged...

110
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:01,175
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.

111
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:03,074
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.

112
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:05,675
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...

113
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,475
to even get them talking about that shit?

114
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:10,776
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.

115
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,976
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.

116
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,876
-You got a 100 ships right there.
-That's break-bulk, Nat.

117
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:19,077
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.

118
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,977
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.

119
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:24,878
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.

120
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:27,777
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...

121
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:31,778
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.

122
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:35,678
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...

123
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,379
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.

124
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:42,979
-Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper--
-Fuck the canal.

125
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
I'm going to the District Council.

126
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.

127
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,580
-You feel me?
-Nat, calm the fuck down.

128
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,281
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.

129
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,680
Nat, listen to me. If we--

130
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,081
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...

131
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:03,382
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.

132
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:07,782
Damn, Frank.

133
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:14,283
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.

134
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:17,883
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.

135
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:18,984
For your information...

136
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:22,384
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.

137
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:25,984
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...

138
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,984
and he chose to depart.

139
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,285
-Blue steel, gentlemen.
-For Christ's sake.

140
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:40,286
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.

141
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:31,592
-Nicky boy, you working today?
-As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.

142
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:35,192
Attaboy. Make the family proud.

143
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,493
First day they give me in two weeks.

144
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,992
-Is Ott around?
-On his ass as usual.

145
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:45,293
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.

146
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,494
Hey, Nick.

147
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:58,394
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.

148
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,095
-Today?
-Tomorrow.

149
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,596
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.

150
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,896
All right.

151
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:09,095
-Yo, Frank.
-What's up?

152
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:12,896
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.

153
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,098
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.

154
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,898
-Hold your horses.
-You fucking goose.

155
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:33,298
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.

156
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:34,799
How we doing?

157
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,098
-Ain't a problem, Chief.
-The fuck it ain't.

158
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,499
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...

159
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,699
-and Tweety Bird here lost the can.
-It ain't lost.

160
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,500
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?

161
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
-It's either in Bay 7, or--
-Bay 7 is empty, man.

162
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,701
Or it ain't. In that case...

163
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:59,502
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.

164
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:00,701
Jesus fucking Christ.

165
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:03,401
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.

166
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,002
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.

167
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:08,302
And you.

168
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:12,003
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.

169
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,102
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.

170
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,103
Later for you, goofus.

171
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:22,204
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.

172
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:24,304
-He ain't fired, man.
-No?

173
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,004
That's his father.

174
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,706
How fast you need this?

175
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:47,507
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.

176
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:55,908
Officer Burns.

177
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,007
Detective.

178
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:04,609
I heard they posted you down here.

179
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,809
But, I mean, you know, damn.

180
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,509
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?

181
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,009
So what brings you downstairs?

182
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,410
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.

183
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,511
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and llene Nathan wanted to be ready.

184
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:24,310
You give him my love.

185
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,211
-Who?
-Bird.

186
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:33,911
-No evidence.
-What do you mean, no evidence?

187
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:38,212
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...

188
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,113
"Four, Right rear." It says that.

189
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:41,913
-So?
-No such thing.

190
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:45,613
BB has 1 2 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?

191
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,014
No evidence.

192
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:58,414
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.

193
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:03,415
-Fuck me.
-...that's of an entirely different breed....

194
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,515
Fuck.

195
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:17,718
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.

196
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,717
But it is a sort of a warning system.

197
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,718
They here.

198
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:07,923
Franoosh, you made it.

199
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:10,523
Right, Father. Got you covered here.

200
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,822
Come on.

201
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,223
You wanna see your window?

202
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:30,225
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.

203
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,825
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.

204
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:41,425
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.

205
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:45,226
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.

206
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:46,926
Anything I can do.

207
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,327
-I need some face time with the Senator.
-Barbara?

208
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,527
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.

209
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,127
We got nothing but problems, Father.

210
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,528
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...

211
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,629
and the grain pier's been down for a year.

212
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:04,529
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.

213
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:08,428
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.

214
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:11,328
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?

215
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:15,229
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.

216
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,130
And what's more...

217
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,631
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...

218
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,830
to get that window up there.

219
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,732
How long since your last confession?

220
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,432
I'll see you, Father.

221
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,532
This shit might be somewhere else, man.

222
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:41,633
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.

223
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,833
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.

224
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,133
You see any shit come up out of there?

225
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,134
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.

226
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:52,334
-All right.
-You seen it.

227
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,235
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.

228
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:56,835
And fuck what you're saying.

229
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,435
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.

230
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:00,635
Yo, check it again.

231
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:03,535
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.

232
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,235
Nigger, what you say?

233
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,836
-I said check it again, God damn it!
-Whoa, chill.

234
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:11,436
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.

235
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,437
What the fuck is going on today, man?

236
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,038
Taking their time, ain't they?

237
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:38,539
What the hell is going on?

238
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,540
Come on, man.

239
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,740
Damn!

240
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,641
-Ain't anywhere in this section either.
-Start on the next row.

241
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:55,241
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.

242
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,740
You're right.

243
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:01,541
-We could be here all night.
-Right again.

244
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,642
So that's overtime, right?

245
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:15,343
Fuck me. I still cannot type.

246
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,544
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.

247
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,344
-Yeah?
-Dumb as a box of rocks.

248
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,744
-Who?
-White boys.

249
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:27,544
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.

250
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:30,045
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.

251
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:31,445
You know what he says?

252
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:34,245
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"

253
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:38,146
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.

254
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:41,346
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.

255
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:43,647
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:

256
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:46,047
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"

257
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:48,848
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...

258
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:50,946
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.

259
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:55,147
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...

260
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,748
Iike even it out for them.

261
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,948
-Affirmative action.
-Leave no white man behind.

262
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:04,149
-What the fuck do you want?
-I need you to do the seizures.

263
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:07,550
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?

264
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,250
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?

265
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,350
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.

266
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,250
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.

267
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,350
That's a fucking hassle.

268
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,151
You want the property, do the paperwork.

269
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,151
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.

270
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:26,251
No?

271
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:29,352
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?

272
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:31,451
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.

273
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,552
You taking doors?

274
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,252
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.

275
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:38,653
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.

276
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:46,253
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.

277
00:22:46,953 --> 00:22:49,954
-You're a housecat now?
-I made a promise.

278
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:53,254
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...

279
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:56,455
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.

280
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:59,855
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.

281
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:02,955
-Let me know what?
-You're fucking whipped.

282
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,056
-Whipped?
-Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.

283
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:07,656
I kid you not.

284
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:15,656
So....

285
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,057
So?

286
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:26,658
So where do we find Omar?

287
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:29,558
Who?

288
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,558
-He say anything else?
-No.

289
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,560
Just to come back. All of us.

290
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:46,159
How he say it?

291
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,460
You know, he just said it.

292
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:56,161
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

293
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,263
Shit.

294
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:39,566
-They holding to it?
-So far.

295
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,267
All right.

296
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,168
They got the times right?

297
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,569
How about the mileage?

298
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,569
All right.

299
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:11,369
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

300
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,070
-You never saw him out the car?
-No.

301
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,070
-You stayed with him the whole time?
-Every minute.

302
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:22,971
How long before he came out
the parking garage?

303
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:26,772
-How long was he on his own?
-Not enough time to do shit, String.

304
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,871
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.

305
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:30,171
Chill.

306
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:37,372
-This shit is fucked up.
-Look--

307
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:38,772
You follow the directions?

308
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:41,272
-I did just like you told me.
-Wrote down the mileage?

309
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,973
-Yeah.
-Let me see.

310
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:48,574
See, right there.

311
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:58,574
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.

312
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,475
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.

313
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:06,076
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.

314
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:31,578
You got answers?

315
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,179
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...

316
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,379
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?

317
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,080
You hurt your foot?

318
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:45,780
-My foot?
-You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.

319
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,981
-You was on us the whole time?
-Who, me?

320
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:56,281
Y'all had people following us.

321
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,482
So where it at?

322
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:08,383
You know, you should take me with you.

323
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,983
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...

324
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,984
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?

325
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:19,484
-Zig, these guys are real.
-What, I ain't real?

326
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:29,585
Six degrees.

327
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,085
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...

328
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,486
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...

329
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,986
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.

330
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:40,486
-Christ, them wooden shovels.
-Yeah.

331
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:43,686
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?

332
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,986
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.

333
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:48,486
-Kaboom.
-It's more like kaput.

334
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:52,287
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.

335
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,588
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?

336
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:58,988
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...

337
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:02,389
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.

338
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:04,789
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.

339
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:08,490
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.

340
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,689
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.

341
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,390
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.

342
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,090
-Ain't never gonna be what it was.
-No, indeed.

343
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,890
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.

344
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:25,291
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.

345
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:28,692
You know, I'd do it with one arm...

346
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,992
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.

347
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:32,892
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

348
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:35,293
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

349
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:37,692
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.

350
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:39,992
Christ, here we go again.

351
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,593
Bring out pretty boy.

352
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:46,993
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.

353
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:49,493
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?

354
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,194
That boy ain't right.

355
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,595
It was just me...

356
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:55,695
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...

357
00:28:55,795 --> 00:28:58,695
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.

358
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:02,996
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.

359
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:05,795
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.

360
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:10,896
Talking trash about 1514.

361
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:14,797
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.

362
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:18,797
Come on.

363
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:22,798
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?

364
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,298
You wanna know why?

365
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,598
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...

366
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:30,198
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.

367
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:32,298
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.

368
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,499
God damn it, Ziggy.

369
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,998
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.

370
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:41,400
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.

371
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,500
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?

372
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,900
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.

373
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,302
Fucking Ziggy, man.

374
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:34,012
-Bring her in the boat?
-Hell, no.

375
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:38,113
-She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
-What's the plan then?

376
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:41,713
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.

377
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:45,214
-What's she look like?
-What do you mean?

378
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:48,413
-How long you think she's been in?
-She's fresh.

379
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:52,914
-Legs are broke, though.
-Probably a jumper from the bridge.

380
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:28,818
All right, Ma. Shit.

381
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,119
Kitchen's closed.

382
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,020
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.

383
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,220
What ship?

384
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,921
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.

385
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,621
That makes two ships at North Point.

386
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:01,322
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.

387
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:03,423
That still is no excuse.

388
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:17,324
Good morning, Mom.

389
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:22,125
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.

390
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:27,325
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.

391
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:31,425
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.

392
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:12,730
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?

393
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,030
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.

394
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,831
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.

395
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,731
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...

396
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:25,531
in three districts and four firehouses.

397
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,932
-And to what do we owe such generosity?
-A surprise.

398
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:32,031
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.

399
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:34,232
A memorial. Let me see that.

400
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:39,232
To Polish police and firefighters.

401
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:45,134
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.

402
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:48,334
-For the nave?
-Yeah, for the nave.

403
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:58,034
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.

404
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:01,735
-The rectory?
-The upstairs hallway.

405
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,436
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?

406
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,536
-I can match it.
-Offerings are confidential, Stan.

407
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:12,337
-And as you can see--
-I can go as high as $4,000.

408
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:15,637
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.

409
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:19,737
More than $4,000? From the docks?

410
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:22,538
How the hell....

411
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:25,438
I'm sorry, Father.

412
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:29,738
-Who came to you with the offer?
-Francis Sobotka.

413
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,439
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?

414
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,139
-It was from his local.
-The Checkers?

415
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,740
-They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
-It's a parish of givers, Stan.

416
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,840
Maybe you talk to Frank.

417
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,440
Work it out somehow.

418
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:49,241
Yeah, we'll talk.

419
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:57,842
Major?

420
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:20,444
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.

421
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:21,744
Ray, how you been?

422
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:24,044
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.

423
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:26,845
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.

424
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,446
-Fish your wish, huh?
-Jumper, probably.

425
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:35,546
-This close to the bridge.
-Probably, yeah.

426
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:37,646
-Pretty, though.
-She is, yeah.

427
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,346
I go into the men's room this morning.

428
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:41,947
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.

429
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:43,447
Bunk Moreland.

430
00:36:43,547 --> 00:36:46,947
-How'd you know?
-Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.

431
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:05,449
-What's happening, man?
-What's up, Fam?

432
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:06,549
All right.

433
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,550
-You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
-Not a goddamn word, man.

434
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,550
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.

435
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,251
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?

436
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:21,851
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.

437
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,951
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.

438
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,852
-Who?
-Tank, Country.

439
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:31,052
-How long that motherfucker been home?
-A month.

440
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:34,953
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.

441
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,153
All right.

442
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:40,453
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?

443
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:43,453
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.

444
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,254
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.

445
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,954
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.

446
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:52,154
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?

447
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,955
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?

448
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:59,055
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.

449
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:03,256
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker--

450
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:06,757
-And the day you get out this motherfucker.
-That's right.

451
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:09,256
Exactly.

452
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,456
-What's up?
-How you doing?

453
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,756
-Coming from the hiring hall?
-I'm working the Atlantic late today.

454
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:18,557
-How's it looking for Local 47?
-You're shit out of luck.

455
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:20,857
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.

456
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:23,358
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...

457
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,258
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.

458
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,958
-Half a day, huh?
-Seniority sucks.

459
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:32,660
-Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
-Yeah, you got that right.

460
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,859
-I'm out of here.
-Yeah, I'll see you.

461
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:38,159
-The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
-Just getting up now, fuck-face?

462
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:40,560
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.

463
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,160
-No fucking way.
-Bacon and eggs, baby.

464
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,660
You going down to see the Greek, right?

465
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,361
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.

466
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,061
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?

467
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,762
Come on. Let's go.

468
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:04,462
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.

469
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,965
-Nicky, from the docks.
-Spiros.

470
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:31,065
How are you? Good?

471
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:35,266
-Who's your friend?
-This is Zig, my uncle's kid.

472
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,566
-Your uncle? Frankie?
-Yeah.

473
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,266
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.

474
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,067
So you must be the Greek.

475
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:50,568
Well, I'm Greek anyway.

476
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:55,369
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?

477
00:39:55,868 --> 00:40:00,168
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.

478
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:03,469
-Shit, you're Russian, right?
-No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.

479
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,769
-It's the same difference, though.
-No, you're wrong.

480
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:10,870
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?

481
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,970
Sergei.

482
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,470
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.

483
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:18,971
Boris and Natasha?

484
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:22,072
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

485
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,471
-You want some coffee, pie?
-No, I'm good.

486
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:28,271
-Actually, what kind of pie you got?
-Hey, Zig.

487
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,472
Shut the fuck up, huh?

488
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,074
Malaka.

489
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:47,574
No, it's cool. He's cool.

490
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:51,674
-That's Frank's kid?
-Yeah.

491
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:53,474
He's in the Union, you know.

492
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:57,074
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.

493
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:08,277
-Same deal, same rate.
-All right. Who's driving?

494
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,477
Again?

495
00:41:14,077 --> 00:41:15,777
You want to mix it up a little more.

496
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:18,777
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.

497
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,778
You trust a man, you stay with him.

498
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:27,478
-Okay.
-All right.

499
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,278
Boris it is.

500
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,279
-Sergei.
-Yeah, whatever.

501
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,479
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.

502
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,380
-How's the open-face turkey?
-It's shit. Let's go.

503
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,580
See you guys later.

504
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:47,080
-Bullwinkle?
-Polacks.

505
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,781
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.

506
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:54,881
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.

507
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,784
You seen my nephew anywhere?

508
00:42:11,884 --> 00:42:15,884
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.

509
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,486
-Hey, Frank.
-Hey, darling.

510
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:39,287
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?

511
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:40,686
I don't know.

512
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:44,587
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.

513
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,388
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.

514
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:50,987
Okay. Y'all have a good one.

515
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:58,189
You let her fuck with you like that?

516
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,789
She's all right. I like her.

517
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,791
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 1 1 . It's right on the bottom.

518
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:22,791
-You working the light, ain't you?
-I'm on it, yeah.

519
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:26,892
-Did they say anything else?
-No. Just that it's the same money to us.

520
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,292
Let's go.

521
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:33,893
All right, Uncle Frank.

522
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,392
-Winona.
-Jimmy, where you been?

523
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,695
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.

524
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:54,796
-You owe me $10.
-Fuck you.

525
00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:58,495
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.

526
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:02,695
-I told him where you didn't wanna go.
-Yeah, and they sent me there.

527
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:05,496
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.

528
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:07,296
What can I tell you?

529
00:44:08,596 --> 00:44:12,297
-Where's Bunk?
-Out on a call with Crutchfield.

530
00:44:13,897 --> 00:44:16,498
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?

531
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:20,198
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.

532
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:22,298
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.

533
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:24,599
What about the defense wounds?

534
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:28,099
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.

535
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,999
You missed the defense wounds?

536
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,498
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.

537
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,799
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.

538
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:37,399
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.

539
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:40,699
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.

540
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,700
But then that's just me.

541
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,500
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?

542
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,800
Have fun.

543
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,501
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.

544
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,102
On the County?

545
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:57,901
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.

546
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:01,102
-You sold them on that?
-Rawls did.

547
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,502
He called up the Colonel and said:

548
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:06,402
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."

549
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:10,704
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.

550
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:13,704
Something you never learned.

551
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:16,604
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.

552
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:22,105
A little to the right!

553
00:45:22,905 --> 00:45:24,704
Good, bring her down!

554
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,309
It's there whenever they want it.

555
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,810
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...

556
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,710
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.

557
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,811
-I thought Roberto would be here.
-Not likely.

558
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:18,811
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.

559
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:25,512
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.

560
00:46:26,612 --> 00:46:28,412
That's why we didn't do the business?

561
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:32,912
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...

562
00:46:33,012 --> 00:46:35,313
that could further complicate the situation.

563
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:38,714
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...

564
00:46:38,814 --> 00:46:42,014
-'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
-Sometimes.

565
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:45,914
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.

566
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:48,614
And you decide to change the pattern.

567
00:46:49,114 --> 00:46:50,214
He took our money?

568
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:53,414
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.

569
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:56,415
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.

570
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:59,016
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...

571
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,616
for Roberto's predicament.

572
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:05,917
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...

573
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:07,617
are coincidental.

574
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:09,617
-But right now--
-Listen to me.

575
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:11,916
He was the first to know that we took a hit.

576
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:14,217
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...

577
00:47:14,317 --> 00:47:16,717
and all the documents from the case.

578
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:21,418
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.

579
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:26,419
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...

580
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,120
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.

581
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,820
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...

582
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:39,620
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation....

583
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,820
You understand our position, I'm sure.

584
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:53,921
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...

585
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:56,122
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.

586
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:57,223
I ain't blind.

587
00:47:57,322 --> 00:47:59,522
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.

588
00:47:59,622 --> 00:48:02,123
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.

589
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:04,423
Our asses are hanging out here.

590
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:17,824
-Yeah?
-Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.

591
00:48:17,924 --> 00:48:19,524
-Shit.
-Yeah.

592
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:22,125
-Where's Sergei?
-He's parked at the end of the lot.

593
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:24,825
-What's he waiting for?
-I got no fucking idea.

594
00:48:24,925 --> 00:48:28,025
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.

595
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:30,126
-I'll look into it.
-Yeah.

596
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:34,026
Okay, I understand.

597
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:59,329
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.

598
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:13,137
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.

599
00:50:13,837 --> 00:50:17,238
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.

600
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:19,138
You like to think so.

601
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:22,938
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.

602
00:50:23,738 --> 00:50:27,739
You big, nasty detective. Come here.

603
00:50:28,338 --> 00:50:31,039
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.

604
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:44,341
-All this?
-I'm just getting started.

605
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:46,841
$1000 for the doctor.

606
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:50,841
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.

607
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,642
There's gotta be a better way.

608
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:57,041
That would be on you, sweetheart.

609
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:00,442
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.

610
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:04,343
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.

611
00:51:04,443 --> 00:51:07,643
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.

612
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:39,247
Sergeant.

613
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:42,548
Your floater's come back.

614
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:46,447
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.

615
00:51:46,547 --> 00:51:48,447
-No fucking way.
-Yeah.

616
00:51:48,848 --> 00:51:51,648
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...

617
00:51:51,748 --> 00:51:54,249
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.

618
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:57,849
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.

619
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,549
McNulty.

620
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:04,650
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.

621
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,050
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.

622
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,850
-Cocksucker.
-Motherfucker.

623
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:33,153
The count is right. What's on the shelf?

624
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:37,153
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.

625
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:40,153
I checked the stash, and we way low.

626
00:52:40,254 --> 00:52:42,253
-Moe Man taking our shit.
-What he holding?

627
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:45,454
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.

628
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:47,055
I'm gonna fuck him up.

629
00:52:47,155 --> 00:52:49,254
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.

630
00:52:49,354 --> 00:52:52,055
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...

631
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:54,255
than just thumpin' on niggers?

632
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:57,356
-What Moe supposed to be holding?
-38, thereabout.

633
00:52:57,555 --> 00:53:00,356
-Ain't you the damn fool?
-But then we low.

634
00:53:00,456 --> 00:53:03,457
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.

635
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:07,256
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.

636
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:09,656
He on top of everything.

637
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:13,457
Go back to your spot, man.

638
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,259
Fucking McNulty.

639
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:30,059
The Prince of Tides.

640
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:43,175
-Brother, you feeling strong today?
-Yeah.

641
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,875
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.

642
00:55:47,774 --> 00:55:50,574
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.

643
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:54,575
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?

644
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:57,575
-What?
-Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.

645
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:01,776
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.

646
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:55,482
-It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
-There's a dozen of them.

647
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:57,282
Dead? They're dead?
