3
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,300
Do I look overdressed, Vince?

4
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,000
You gotta dress like
they're pulling you out of your day.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,100
Get all suited up,
you look fucking desperate.

6
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,600
- Is your name Vince, asshole?
- You look good, Johnny.

7
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,500
Besides, why would you listen to a guy...

8
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
who's only worn sweats
since the eighth grade?

9
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,000
I know things.

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,700
- Ari.
- Welcome.

11
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Koppelman bar mitzvah is in Ballroom 3,
by the way.

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,000
- I knew it, I look desperate.
- I'm kidding, you look amazing.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're fucking old school.
Where's he going?

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
He's going downstairs
to Adam Davies' office, third floor.

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,300
Thanks a lot, Ari, I appreciate it, man.
Turtle, roll with me.

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,700
- Come on.
- All right.

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,800
Good luck, bro.

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,500
- Thanks, man.
- Break a leg.

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
You have a good weekend?
You ready for this?

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
What?

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
What are we doing here, Ari?

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm pulling out the big guns.
Showing you the power of this agency.

23
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,900
- It's just a meeting, right?
- No, it's not just a meeting.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,200
- It's not, then what is it?
- It's a fucking experience.

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,400
Gentlemen, welcome to mecca.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,500
Big opening, baby. $18.6 million!

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,300
This is what happens
when your movie opens huge. $18.6 million.

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Excuse me, honey, do you know
where I could find Adam Davies?

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,200
- Yeah, two down on the left.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,000
You got any bagels or anything at all?

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I want to start by saying
you could not be in a better position...

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,300
and we are so fucking proud of you.

33
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,800
We got a lot of stuff to get to.
Start us off, Trish.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
{y:i}Koresh, a gritty feature version
about the FBI's take down...

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
of the Branch Davidian leader.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,500
The studio's interested in Vince
for either David Koresh...

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
or the young, out-of-control FBI agent.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
- Director status?
- They are out to Milos Forman.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
Milos Forman's a genius,
you see {y:i}Cuckoo's Nest?

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,300
- No, I did the play in high school.
- All right.

41
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,500
- And he was great, I saw it.
- I sucked.

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,400
All right, check this out.

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,500
Is there anymore of that tuna tartare?

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,700
Absolutely. Keep it going, what do we got?

45
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
{y:i}The Last Wasteland.

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,100
James Gray scripted a smart tale
about the American worker...

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,000
but set against a post-apocalyptic
underwater society in 2050.

48
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,000
They're talking to Charlize Theron
for the female lead.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,700
- She's great, we loved {y:i}Monster.
- She's hot.

50
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,000
Put a check next to that.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,100
Charlize has a statue,
let's get Vinny a statue.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,700
So what, are they redoing your office?

53
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
I haven't been assigned an office yet.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Adam Davies' office.
He's in a meeting, can he return?

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,300
When I read the e-mail
that Vincent Chase's brother...

56
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,600
needed an agent, I assumed
it must be his younger brother.

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Biologically, I'm older,
but I think we play around the same age.

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,000
What have you been doing lately, John?
You working at all?

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I've been working steady for
the last twelve years, minus the last three.

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,800
I'll fight for you. But I can't lie.

61
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,200
It's not gonna be easy
to get you back in the game.

62
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,800
Back in the game?

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
I am the fucking game, pal.

64
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Come on, Turtle, let's go.

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
Back in the game.

66
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,200
Some pretty good ideas, though.

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,200
What the {y:i}American Taliban:
{y:i}The John Walker Lindh Story?

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Did it happen?

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
It was one idea, but it happened.

70
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,900
Listen, I'm tired of this.
I've asked you 10 times now.

71
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,300
Why isn't the deal for
{y:i}Queens Boulevard done yet?

72
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Because there is no offer.
Why is there no offer?

73
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,000
There's no money.
No money means it's not a real movie.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Which means they're just
a bunch of words on a page.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
- Yeah, but they're good words.
- Great words.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,900
These scripts that you're talking about,
they could be good, and they could suck.

77
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,100
- They could suck, Ari.
- This we know is good 'cause this we lived.

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,900
You know what? E's right.

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
We should just focus on {y:i}Queens Boulevard.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,500
You know what they feed people
on an indie set, Vinny?

81
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,700
Nothing. No trailer.
They tell you to go sit on an apple box.

82
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,000
You ever try to bang an extra
on an apple box?

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,500
- Lf anybody could do it, Vince could.
- I do have great balance.

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,300
Look, okay. We threw out, what, 10 ideas?

85
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,000
Ari, stop, you're not listening to me.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Look at me.
We want to do {y:i}Queens Boulevard.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,200
Sit down, do what you got to do,
call who you got to call...

88
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
stop the agenting bullshit,
and get us a fucking offer.

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Damn.

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
My boy's blossoming.

91
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,400
- Good work, E. Way to keep him on his toes.
- What did he do?

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,800
He had Ari freaking.
I thought he was going to cry.

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I had to straighten him out a bit.
I'm tired of his bullshit all the time.

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,200
- You the man!
- Johnny, how did your meeting go?

95
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Wake up, Drama.
They're asking how your meeting went.

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,000
This guy, with no office...

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,700
no assistant,
answering his own fucking phone...

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
is willing to hip pocket me.

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Can you believe that shit?

100
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,300
You want to fire Ari, Vince.

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,700
Fredo is angry.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm serious, Vince,
the guy does nothing for you.

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,400
All right, what are you so upset about?

104
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
You asked him to help me
with representation.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
The best he can do is Adam Davies?

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
- You serious, Drama?
- You know what, Johnny's right, E.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,600
I asked Ari to help him and he sets him up
with a glorified assistant.

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,500
- I'm actually semi-upset.
- Thanks, Vince.

109
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
At least you're dressed up
for tonight, Drama.

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,500
- We still have to go to this thing?
- It's for Shauna, we have to go.

111
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,200
This fucking art, man. Fuck art.

112
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,900
What are we? Come on.

113
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,300
It's a very nice of you to show up.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,500
- What is this crap?
- He's Shauna's client, so be nice.

115
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
Why, is he retarded?

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,800
This piece evokes all of the emotions...

117
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,300
from what I call a discombobulated man.

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,300
This is emotional dyslexia.

119
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,300
This is emotional confusion.

120
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,000
And what is emotional confusion, you ask?

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,700
It's like running naked
through a cornfield backwards at midnight.

122
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,600
That was beautiful, Gary.

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,000
You know...

124
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,800
this kind of reminds me
of Jason Pollock's early work.

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,900
He employs a similar technique.
Pointillism, they call it.

126
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
- How do you know?
- I read for {y:i}Basquiat.

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Nice try, Drama, but first of all
his name is Jackson Pollock...

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
and his work was called
abstract expressionism.

129
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,700
Pointillism's a style using points of color,
this is neither.

130
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,800
- Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I took art history in college.

131
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,700
- Yeah, community college, loser.
- At least I went to college.

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
- I was working.
- Schmucks.

133
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,300
What?

134
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,300
Do you like the work or not?

135
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,700
- Phenomenal.
- Fabulous.

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Sweet stuff.

137
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,900
- Gus.
- Johnny Drama.

138
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,800
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

139
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,600
- Good, what are you doing?
- I'm working.

140
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
- Glad to have the job.
- Get out of town.

141
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Gus, I can't believe this.

142
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,800
You were the second lead
in {y:i}Cornelius and Son.

143
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,400
- I was only a recurring.
- That was nine years ago.

144
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Your brother's doing great.

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Yeah, everyone gets their moment.

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,700
This catering company is really cool.

147
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,400
Most of the waiters are actors.
They're really flexible when it comes to...

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,000
going on an audition, or getting a job,
a commercial or something.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
That's cool, man.

150
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,400
So, you know, if you want
to make a few extra bucks.

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,800
- Yeah. Thanks, Gus.
- Shrimp puff?

152
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,800
- What the fuck did you say?
- Shrimp puff.

153
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
No, I'm good.

154
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,000
- Shauna.
- Josh.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,300
I want the most expensive piece
your boy's got.

156
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,900
You're a doll. Gary is going to be thrilled.

157
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,800
You know Josh, we share some clients.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,000
- What's up, E?
- How you doing, Josh?

159
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,500
- He gave us {y:i}Queens Boulevard.
- I rep the writer.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,700
Yeah, he's a hack.

161
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
- I'm kidding, I loved it.
- Come on!

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,700
- Emily, how you doing?
- I'm pretty good, how are you?

163
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
Great, you kidding me?

164
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,200
You guys know each other?

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah, we both started
in the mailroom together.

166
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
Remember that, Josh?

167
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,700
Guys, I'm having a little bash
at my place in Malibu this Saturday.

168
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,000
It's gonna be off the hook,
you guys should come.

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
Yeah, any girls gonna be there?

170
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,800
The only girls in this town
who won't be there are the ugly ones.

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
You're so gross.

172
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,900
We'll be there.

173
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Great. E., see you then. Vince.

174
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,000
Eric, Ari would freak
if he knew you were going...

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
to a party at Josh Weinstein's.

176
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
- Why? It's a party.
- No, you have to tell him.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
- Lf you don't tell him, I have to.
- So tell him.

178
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
You're going, too, we have plans
on Saturday night, remember?

179
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,300
- Man, that was chilling.
- What?

180
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,700
- I just got offered a job.
- Nice, buddy, what's it for?

181
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, as a fucking waiter.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
I don't know, Drama,
that's a lot of responsibility.

183
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,700
- Maybe you should try out busboy first.
- Eat shit, Turtle.

184
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,000
Why don't you serve it to me, motherfucker.

185
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,300
My bad.

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
- Where am I going?
- Ivy, you're 20 minutes late.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,900
- Ari, I need to talk to you about something.
- Walk with me.

188
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,600
Vince and the guys will be partying
at Josh Weinstein's.

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,900
- Who's Josh Weinstein?
- He's your old assistant.

190
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,200
I have many old assistants.

191
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,300
Two before me, after Jackie, before Jared.

192
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
My "J" phase,
I think I fired him for stealing pens.

193
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,800
- Why do I care about Josh?
- Now he's an agent at Triad.

194
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,400
And he's the one who gave
the boys {y:i}Queens Boulevard.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,100
That's why no more guys.
You fire a guy and you create a rival.

196
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
You fire a woman
and you create a housewife.

197
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,700
That's sweet, you're still late.

198
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,400
Hold all my calls,
get mini-Vince on the phone.

199
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
- Hello?
- Hey.

200
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,900
Saturday, grab the boys,
I got the floor seats.

201
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,600
- Really?
{y:i}- Yeah, $2,400 a pop.

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,500
You're gonna be sitting on Jack's lap.

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,700
Guys, Ari's got floor seats
for the Lakers on Saturday.

204
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,300
- Who they playing?
{y:i}- Who they playing?

205
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Playing the Wizards, it'll be a great game.

206
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,600
- Wizards.
- Fuck that, bro.

207
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,800
- No go, Ari. Thanks, anyway.
{y:i}- They're playing the Cavs Sunday night.

208
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
- That's King James.
- Get us tickets for that.

209
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
Vince wants floor seats for Sunday.

210
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,900
Let me ask you something.
Should I be worried about this little party...

211
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,400
you guys are going to
over at Josh Weinstein's house?

212
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,700
You should be worried about floor seats
for the Lakers on Sunday.

213
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I want you to go to that party on Saturday.

214
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Represent the agency.
Let Vince know that my army's everywhere.

215
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,700
Ari, I don't want to get in the middle of this.

216
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,100
You are in the middle of this, like it or not.

217
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,300
You want to be a hero?
You want a medal or are you a coward?

218
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,100
Stop the hippie shit, strap on a helmet,
start shooting.

219
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,200
This is Malibu. I want you to storm
that beach like it's Normandy.

220
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,900
This is great, right?

221
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,600
If you were at Ari's house right now,
you'd be changing diapers.

222
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,900
I can't believe Busey's here.

223
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,600
$12,000 you got to pay him, Turtle?
When you gonna get it to him?

224
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,500
Busey's a lunatic, you better pay him.

225
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,500
He beat up the gaffer on {y:i}Point Break
just for cutting in on the lunch line.

226
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,600
I heard that.

227
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Some shit goes down,
you guys got my back, no?

228
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Sorry. No, I don't mess with Busey.

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Pussies.

230
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,500
Don't worry, Turtle, I got your back.
I'll put Busey on his ass.

231
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
No doubt, Drama.

232
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,700
Can I be straight with you?
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Ari.

233
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,700
He's been like a grandfather to me.
But he's trying to kill this deal.

234
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,600
Yeah, how's that?
He said he never got an offer.

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,900
They made an offer. I spoke to Scott Wick.

236
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,600
You gotta step in
or this movie's gonna go away.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
I took a couple of bad hits.

238
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,500
Made a movie in Spain that tanked,
then I got divorced.

239
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,900
Cunt took half my money...

240
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,100
and the rights to my only
viable book property.

241
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,000
I started drinking.
Finally pulled myself out of the gutter.

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,900
Needed something more stable,
got into this.

243
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,800
So you like what you're doing?

244
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,600
You like being a waiter?

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah, asshole, I love serving crab cakes
wearing a fucking monkey suit.

246
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,300
Drama, I'm freaking, man.
I keep thinking Busey's behind me.

247
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,000
Relax, he's an old man.
He'll probably split soon.

248
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
You're on his calls all day.
I mean, is it true? Did we get an offer?

249
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Eric, don't put me in this position, okay?

250
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,900
- What position?
- He's my boss.

251
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,600
What if he's your boss? Who cares?
Is he more important than whatever we are?

252
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't ask me that.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Fine. I'll ask Ari, then.

254
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
Eric, if you call Ari, I'm leaving. Right now.

255
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,100
I can't.

256
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,400
- Honey, our kid is bored out of his mind.
- You know what?

257
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,000
- He's having no fun at his birthday party.
- What are you doing? Filming him.

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
How about if he does a trick,
how about that?

259
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Light himself on fire,
the kids will notice him, know what I mean?

260
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,000
- Lf I kicked him in the head...
- Excuse me, Mr. Gold.

261
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,800
Jeff Kahn.

262
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
- How's it going?
- Good.

263
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I'd like you to have my head shot.

264
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,000
Thanks. It's my kid's birthday,
if you don't mind.

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, no, that's great.

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,500
I totally understand, it's cool.
Why don't you take my reel?

267
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,400
- It's got a lot of good stuff.
- Thank you.

268
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,600
- I'm doing a showcase, actually.
- Hello?

269
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,100
Why are you trying to shut down
{y:i}Queens Boulevard?

270
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,000
- What are you talking about?
- I know Scott Wick made an offer.

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
Scott Wick tell you that?

272
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,000
No, I spoke to our new agent.
Josh Weinstein, motherfucker.

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,900
- I'm doing a showcase...
- Where do you think you're going?

274
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,500
They just flew in a liver,
I gotta do the transplant.

275
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,200
- Where do you think I'm going?
- You are such an asshole.

276
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm the asshole
that pays for your art lessons...

277
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,700
gets celebrities
to attend your charity events...

278
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,600
- and supports your deadbeat brother.
- Little agent boy...

279
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
you better be back here for the cake.

280
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Okay.

281
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
Gary?

282
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Gary.

283
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,000
Gary.

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
- Turtle?
- Yeah.

285
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,400
Listen, I just wanted to come over
and apologize to you...

286
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,100
for breaking your sculpture the other night.
It was an accident, and I'm sorry.

287
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,900
I just leaned up against it.

288
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,000
- It was kind of an accident...
- Listen.

289
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,500
I could snap your sternum with one blow
from my forehead to your chest...

290
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,300
I could raise my head up
and loosen your teeth.

291
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Knock you down, grab you by the lip...

292
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,300
pull you up, and tell you I'll be right back.

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,300
While we're here, we're all looking
for the art within ourselves.

294
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,800
Gravity, inertia, and physics...

295
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,100
it's like a round robin.

296
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,600
I'm cleansing you.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
In the name of art,
and everything art stands for.

298
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,800
Remember this, art is only the search,
it's not the final form.

299
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,300
You know you're burning these?
You're burning the nutrition out of them.

300
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,300
- I'll have one of those.
- Don't eat that, Vince, it's garbage.

301
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
I like them burned.

302
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
- Aren't you Johnny Chase?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,300
We're huge fans of {y:i}Viking Quest.

304
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,000
You girls are too young
to have seen {y:i}Viking Quest.

306
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,700
We watch it all the time
on the sci-fi channel.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,900
- What was your favorite episode?
- My favorite episode...

308
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,200
remember when you were
frozen for 30 years?

309
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
And then you woke up
and your wife was remarried.

310
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
- That was great.
- That was awesome.

311
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,000
{y:i}The Thawing.
Your favorite episode is {y:i}The Thawing?

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,100
Yeah.

313
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,900
Take a hike, honey.

314
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,300
- What?
- You heard me, I said beat it.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,300
Let's go.

316
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,000
What the hell are you doing?

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
{y:i}The Thawing was Turtle's favorite episode.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,900
- It was a setup.
- Come on, we were only joking, man.

319
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,700
What's wrong with you?

320
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,800
It's over, bro.
I'm gonna be working the grill at Chili's.

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,500
Come on. It's gonna work out.

322
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,000
Thanks, bro.
I'm gonna go take a walk down the beach.

323
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,000
- Keep it right out here, I won't be long.
- You got it, sir.

324
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,800
Where's Weinstein?

325
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,300
- Anyone seen Josh Weinstein?
- He's outside drinking mimosas.

326
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,600
There you go,
the motherfucking host of this shindig.

327
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,000
After that he does the movie
and gets the Oscar.

328
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,800
That's how it went. Hey, Ari.

329
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,500
- That's a great story.
- How you doing? Crashing parties now?

330
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
You know Joshie, here?

331
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I don't know if you guys know,
but he used to be my assistant.

332
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,500
- That was a long time ago.
- Fourteen months, that ain't that long.

333
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,800
He used to make the best hazelnut latte.

334
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
He was like a chemist in there working,
just like Mommy made.

335
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,700
- It was fantastic.
- Ease up, man, it's a freaking party here.

336
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,000
Does your boss know
that you're using his house?

337
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,700
'Cause I put a call into him.
He and I went to school together.

338
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,300
I helped him cheat on his economics final.

339
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,100
That's how he got his degree,
he owes me big time.

340
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,300
- You called my boss?
- Absolutely.

341
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,300
You know what other class
I took at Harvard? Business ethics.

342
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,900
I don't steal other people's
motherfucking clients.

343
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,200
But in your case,
I'm going to make an exception.

344
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,100
I'm going to take everyone.

345
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,800
Your B-level sitcom stars,
your Reality TV writers.

346
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,900
When I'm done with you,
you'll be repping sideshow freaks.

347
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,100
You need Jojo the dog-faced bitch boy?

348
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,700
Call Josh Weinfuck,
the lightweight, pen-stealing fuckface.

349
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,100
That's awful.

350
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Now, where's my boy, Vinny Chase?

351
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Look what the tide dragged in.

352
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,700
Fucking beach houses, man.

353
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Pieces of shit. If they were in town,
they'd be condemned.

354
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,900
Nice view, though.

355
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,100
I hate the beach, I hate the ocean,
I hate the sand. I love sharks.

356
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,400
I just signed the girl
that got her arm ripped off.

357
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,500
Gonna be the one-armed Marlee Matlin.

358
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
So what are you doing here?

359
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,900
Okay, I think it's the height of stupidity
to follow head-on with {y:i}Queens Boulevard.

360
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,100
- That's the God's honest truth.
- That's all we ever asked for, Ari.

361
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,700
I don't want to show you my hand.
I'm working for you.

362
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
This thing turns out to be
the next {y:i}My Big Fat Greek Bitch...

363
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,000
makes $500 million,
why shouldn't you get rich?

364
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,300
I like rich.

365
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,900
Ask the people that didn't
get back in on the {y:i}Passion.

366
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,800
Jesus ain't gonna save them.

367
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,400
Are you telling me, man-to-man, you're
not trying to fuck up {y:i}Queens Boulevard?

368
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm not going to answer that again.

369
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,600
We appreciate your honesty, okay?

370
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,700
- Don't get used to it.
- Don't worry, I won't.

371
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,200
You do this, the next one's a studio picture.

372
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,500
- We'll discuss it, I'll think about it.
- No.

373
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Franchise, baby, all right?

374
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,900
With a lunch box, we're gonna get you
the whole action figure...

375
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,200
with a huge cock for me.

376
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,500
- All right?
- It's very tempting.

377
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,800
- I love you.
- Right back at you.

378
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,700
Drama, call Adam Davies back.

379
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,600
Come on, the guy's barely an agent.

380
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,800
Barely an agent got you
three auditions next week, jackhole.

381
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Call him.

382
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Thanks, Ari.

383
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,800
Three auditions.
Guess I don't have to be a waiter.

384
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Gary Busey.

385
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,700
How are you, man?
Good to see you, baby, it's Ari.

386
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
- Ari.
- Yeah.

387
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,200
You worked craft service
on {y:i}Lethal Weapon I?

388
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
I did not.
I used to represent you, remember?

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
I know you.

390
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,400
You are a gut maggot, with no guts.

391
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,300
You're gonna spin off this planet.
I love it, keep at it.

392
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,800
- Okay, Ari.
- God bless you.

393
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
God bless you.

394
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,700
What direction is that?

395
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,200
That's east, you idiot.

396
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
It's west, idiot.

397
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,000
I mean in New York, it's east.

398
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,200
- West, Turtle.
- Either way, it's fucking beautiful.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,126
