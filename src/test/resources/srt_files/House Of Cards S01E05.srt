1
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,292
What do you think of Darren Jarvis?

2
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:58,042
- At CBS?
- He wants me to be a correspondent.

3
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,500
Not worth your time.

4
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,250
What about Greer Fisher at MSNBC?

5
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,125
Stick to writing.

6
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,875
Do TV on the side.

7
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,292
You're more than a talking head.

8
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:11,667
- How about Slugline?
- What's Slugline?

9
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:15,042
If I said Politico wanted
to hire me, what would you say?

10
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,292
I would say that that peaks my interest.

11
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,375
Six months from now, Slugline will be
what Politico was a year and a half ago.

12
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,667
Everyone at Politico reads it, because
Slugline's breaking stories before they are.

13
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,375
I wonder why I've never heard of it.

14
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,542
Everyone's a free agent.
They write whatever they want,

15
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,667
wherever they are.

16
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:31,958
Most people write from their phones.

17
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,667
Well, if freedom and exposure
are what they're offering,

18
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,292
I would say that is a meeting
worth taking.

19
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,458
This Hammerschmidt thing is blowing up.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,542
I think he might get fired.

21
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,083
There's gotta be 1,000 tweets here.

22
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,542
People defending me, people trashing me.

23
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,958
There's even a hashtag--
"gozoe."

24
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,625
Mmm.

25
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,792
Mmm.

26
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,792
Hey!

27
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,750
We mustn't leave any trails.

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,208
All of my contacts are in there.

29
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,292
Then it's time for you
to get some new contacts.

30
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,167
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone.
I'll get you two, in fact.

31
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,292
One for work and a burner for play.

32
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,500
Expect them this afternoon.

33
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, and go, Zoe.

34
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:54,083
Sync & corrections by Addic7ed.com
www.addic7ed.com

35
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,042
The reporter?

36
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,625
Yes.

37
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,833
Just this once?

38
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm not sure.

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,542
What does she offer us?

40
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,333
A mouthpiece when we need one.

41
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,958
She's been very useful so far.

42
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,958
- What does she want?
- Access.

43
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,708
A seat at the table.

44
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,875
Sounds like she's getting
the better side of the bargain.

45
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,667
She can be controlled.

46
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,375
Are you sure?

47
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,083
She can.
I promise you.

48
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,875
Okay. If you say so.

49
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,000
- The moment you want me to end it--
- I know, Francis.

50
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,958
I should get ready for work.

51
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,167
Hey.

52
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,292
Didn't think you'd be in till later.

53
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:20,833
This is your agenda for the day.

54
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,792
Here's your schedule
for the rest of the week.

55
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,958
These are papers that need
to be approved or signed.

56
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,583
Over here are your one-sheets
for committee meetings

57
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,167
and briefs on upcoming
legislative action.

58
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:33,042
I filled Ashley in. She can cover
until you find a replacement.

59
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,625
Christina...

60
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,583
What?

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,917
Thank you...

62
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,958
for getting all this in order.

63
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:01,042
Ashley can call me if you have any
questions about what's on your desk.

64
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,167
Is he here yet?

65
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,625
I put him in your office.

66
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,583
Marty Spinella, head lobbyist
for the teachers' union.

67
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,208
He wants to rip my head off
and peel it like an orange.

68
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,875
Why? Because I lied to him.
But what choice did I have

69
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,250
when the truth would've ended the
conversation before it began?

70
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,042
- I'll call you back.
- Marty.

71
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,667
You fucking lied, Frank?

72
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,625
No, no. You lied
to my fucking face?

73
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,500
- Marty, I did not lie.
- Did not--

74
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,417
We spent the whole weekend in that room

75
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,125
pouring over this bill line by line,

76
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,500
and nowhere did it say anything
about collective bargaining.

77
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,750
Let's calm down and sit down,
and we will discuss this.

78
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,792
I will explain everything
that's going on,

79
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,125
and we will talk it out
no matter how long it takes.

80
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,042
No, no more. This is
gonna be a very short meeting,

81
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,958
'cause only one of two things
are gonna happen:

82
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,042
Either you assure me right now
that amendment is out,

83
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:57,042
or I'm walking out that door and I'm
gonna start launching missiles.

84
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,292
The amendment was never intended
to stay in the bill.

85
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,208
It was just there for leverage,
that's all.

86
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,458
You threatened to cut federal funding
from union school districts?

87
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,292
That's not a poker chip, Frank.
That's a goddamn dirty bomb.

88
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:12,458
Look, the amendment
is not staying in the bill.

89
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,417
I just need you to work with me
on performance standards.

90
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:19,375
Performance standards?
Are you fucking kidding me?

91
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,208
You agreed that they were already out!
You can't just put them back in!

92
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,917
- Marty, look--
- I have a reputation to uphold!

93
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:27,333
I am the one that made the
union reps stay here for you

94
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,708
while you were in Gaffney playing
with your fucking Peachoid!

95
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,625
- Marty-- - You tell me right now!
Is that amendment in or out?

96
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,458
There is a middle ground here, Marty.

97
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,708
We just have to find it.

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,083
I take that as a no.

99
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,250
Okay.

100
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,583
Marty, do not start a war
you know you're gonna lose.

101
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,333
You fuck me, I fuck back.

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,833
Stamper!

103
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,042
Marty and I have
a good working relationship.

104
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,125
Or used to.
You can see he has a temper,

105
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,042
but I can usually cut through
that and reason with him.

106
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:08,625
But I may have pushed him
too far, which is worrisome.

107
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,000
Friends make the worst enemies.

108
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,542
- How'd it go?
- What did you hear?

109
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:18,042
- A lot of "fucks."
- Well, that pretty much says it.

110
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,583
Let's think this through.

111
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,542
We've got the D.N.C.
leadership meeting.

112
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,417
- What? - I'd say you could skip it,
but Birch just dumped it on us.

113
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,708
- When?
- It's here in 12 minutes.

114
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,708
Why here and not
the D.N.C. headquarters?

115
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,167
The D.N.C. is doing renovations.

116
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,583
They're gonna be green energy efficient.

117
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,792
Oh, that's a charming use
of party funds.

118
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,167
We've only been in this space
about three months.

119
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,458
It's cool.

120
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,458
Not exactly the Herald, is it?

121
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,292
Have you been to those offices?

122
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:45,500
Yes. Wrist-slitting
was in order.

123
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,250
So, who else is courting you?

124
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,958
- A few people.
- You mean everyone.

125
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,208
There were a lot of e-mails
this morning.

126
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,208
That's not surprising.
You're having a moment.

127
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,083
People are interested.
I'm one of them.

128
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,458
But if eight minutes passes
on anything, I get bored.

129
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,292
In eight minutes, I can be bored with
you, unless you keep me interested.

130
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,750
I think you can.

131
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,458
And I think this is the place for you to
keep the rest of the world interested too.

132
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,458
It's your call.
I won't chase you.

133
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,833
I'm definitely tempted.

134
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,833
Take as long as you want to look around.

135
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,208
E-mail me your figure. I'll
call you back with a counter.

136
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,958
This is our top priority--
Ohio,

137
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,125
Florida, and Pennsylvania.

138
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,583
We need all of them, or Walker's
a one-term president.

139
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,958
Pennsylvania is why he picked
Matthews as a running mate.

140
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,583
But now we have to find a replacement.

141
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,833
The special election is this November.

142
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,542
Patricia Whittaker,
D.N.C. chair.

143
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,083
A rare example of someone
whose head is in the game

144
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,833
instead of up their backside.

145
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,125
Competence is such
an exotic bird in these woods

146
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,208
that I appreciate it whenever I see it.

147
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,125
This also affects the house.

148
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,125
The new governor
will oversee redistricting.

149
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,833
We lose seats here, that means we could
lose our majority in Washington.

150
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, the R.N.C. is backing Jack Swofford,
ex-Mayor of Pittsburgh.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,500
He's got statewide name recognition
and campaign machinery in place.

152
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,458
It's been three months,
and we don't have dick.

153
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,208
What about the A.G.?
Ben Pluckett?

154
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,792
No. Ben's got his eyes
set on the senate in '14.

155
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,917
Which he'll lose because he botched
a sex offender sting last year.

156
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,083
- There's always McHolland.
- He's 78.

157
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,500
When's the last time he held
office, when Carter was president?

158
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,375
Reagan, but same difference.

159
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,167
He has dignity, he has gravitas.

160
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,208
If you need someone
to fill Matthews' shoes--

161
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,667
You can't fill Jim Matthews'
shoes, so we shouldn't even try.

162
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,875
- We need a fresh face.
- The state has a weak bench.

163
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,375
Let's go through all the
sitting Congressmen one by one

164
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,792
and see if anybody sticks out
from the crowd.

165
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,542
All right.
I got the list right here.

166
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,125
Okay. Go ahead.

167
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,167
Pennsylvania's first district,
Peter Russo.

168
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,000
Cross him off. He's no good.
No experience, no chops.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,792
Okay, moving on. Second
district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

170
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,875
Nah, Gwen's too controversial.
Very vocal on abortion.

171
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,917
- And Caroline?
- She's good.

172
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,833
- And the boys?
- All fucking four of 'em?

173
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,000
You feed 'em.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,542
You got any pictures on your phone?

175
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:56,000
Come on. Let's cut the shit,
Pete, will ya?

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,625
What are we gonna do about the shipyard?

177
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,667
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.

178
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,875
Yeah, and why didn't you testify?

179
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,125
We're talking 12,000 jobs here.

180
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,542
My hands were tied, Paul.
People wanted it closed.

181
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,417
- I was under a lot of pressure.
- From who?

182
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,500
People high up the food chain.

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,000
- There was nothing I could do.
- That's bullshit!

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,875
You go back to BRAC.
You talk to the D.O.D.

185
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,042
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy.
You do something.

186
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,458
It's not gonna happen.

187
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,875
- Okay. Why not?
- I told you. It's political.

188
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,208
So I'm supposed to go back to the shipbuilders'
association and say what now exactly?

189
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,208
That they're out of work because
Pete Russo's playing politics?

190
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,542
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

191
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:38,375
We're the ones who got you fucking
elected in the first place.

192
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,958
Now you're gonna turn your back on us?

193
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,958
You should go.

194
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,917
Seriously?

195
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:51,292
I just got here.
You're kicking me out now?

196
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:54,292
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you!

197
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,083
I thought we grew up together.

198
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:02,500
But this guy
sitting behind his big desk...

199
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,750
I don't even know who the fuck he is.

200
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,500
Where's the Pete Russo who knew how to throw
a punch when his back was against the wall?

201
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,917
That guy was my friend.

202
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,667
Every teacher in the country
a month before school ends?

203
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,583
Doesn't need all of them.
15, 20 states, that's all.

204
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,750
The A.F.T. and the N.E.A.
can't agree on anything.

205
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,792
You underestimate Marty Spinella.

206
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,167
So which one do we target?

207
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,250
We have a better chance
with the N.E.A.

208
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,292
You think Chuck Sloan will bite?

209
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,917
Cooperate-- we'll give your people
protection and a place at the banquet.

210
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,625
Fight us, we break you. He'll bite.
Get him on the phone.

211
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,250
It's after 2:00.

212
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,458
Spinella is potentially mobilizing

213
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,542
the largest teachers' strike
in United States history.

214
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,417
- Nobody's sleeping.
- I'll call him right now.

215
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,500
I'm sorry.
Are we being too loud?

216
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,042
A little.

217
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,125
- What are you working on?
- The gala.

218
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,875
There's so much to do.

219
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,458
- Did Nancy send you my list?
- She did.

220
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,000
- What'd you think?
- It's a good list.

221
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,250
Thanks for inviting them.

222
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,583
Is something wrong?

223
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,458
It's still not anywhere near
what Remy brought to the table.

224
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,958
Sancorp offered 1.5 million,
Francis.

225
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,417
I'm adding up the numbers, and
we're only at half a million.

226
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,583
- I got Chuck on the phone.
- In a minute.

227
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,750
- I can make more calls.
- Enough to raise a million-five?

228
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,250
I can at least get us closer.

229
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,917
I'm going to bed.

230
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,208
Don't move any of this around.

231
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,292
Claire, we made the decision
to turn Remy down.

232
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,042
No one forced you.
I thought we were okay on this.

233
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,625
You're right.

234
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,917
Good night, Francis.

235
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,125
This is Adam. Leave a message.

236
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,500
Hi, Adam. It's me.
I know it's late,

237
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,292
but, well, I was really just calling

238
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,583
to thank you again for the photographs.

239
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,708
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

240
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,125
I hope you're well.

241
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:04,333
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

242
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,625
I hope you're well.

243
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,417
Right this way,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

244
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,292
He's here.

245
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,792
Good afternoon, Tom.

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,375
Legal?

247
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,333
Did you say it, or didn't you?

248
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:51,375
To you and to anyone who asks,
yes, I did.

249
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,250
Do we really need them?

250
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,167
Not unless I should expect a fight.

251
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,792
You shouldn't.

252
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,167
Give us a few moments.

253
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:16,542
It's not what you called her, it's
that you let her leave the building.

254
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,833
I know how to run a paper, Margaret.

255
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,583
What I don't know how to do is run a paper
staffed with people I can't control.

256
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,458
Was she really out of control?

257
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,792
To my understanding, she simply
turned down a new position.

258
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,417
It's her attitude.
It's the way she turned it down.

259
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,833
Did you think to ask her
what she'd rather do instead?

260
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,833
- Is it my job to pander to all my employees--
- My employees.

261
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,625
And if they have something to offer
that you don't, yes, it is your job.

262
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,000
We've been through this, Tom.

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,250
The paper's operating at a loss.

264
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,542
We need people like Zoe.

265
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,042
I'm very aware

266
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,042
of how much we're hurting, Margaret.

267
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,292
Staff reductions, dip in circulation.

268
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:53,792
Each one of those faces

269
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,375
and every subscriber we lose,

270
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,833
they keep me awake at night.

271
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,000
Now, I won't argue
the business side of things.

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,458
It's neither my place
nor my area of expertise,

273
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,750
but know this--

274
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,667
Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs,

275
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,375
enriched media,

276
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,500
they're all surface.

277
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,208
They're fads.

278
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,292
They aren't the foundation
this paper was built on,

279
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:20,292
and they aren't what will keep it alive.

280
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,417
We have a core readership

281
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,625
that thirsts for hard news.

282
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:30,292
Those are the people I work
80 hours a week for.

283
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,250
And I won't be distracted
by what's fashionable.

284
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,042
That's your resignation letter.

285
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:47,333
Hand it to the lawyers on the way out.

286
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,417
I'll give you some privacy.

287
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:54,375
No, no, stay.
It'll be quick.

288
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,292
We'll get a drink.

289
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,167
We're going to launch
right here in Washington.

290
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,750
We'll see how Congress likes it

291
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,875
when the streets are teaming

292
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,458
with unsupervised school kids.

293
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,958
Then we'll phase out
the rest of the country.

294
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
Everybody hold on for one minute.

295
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,208
What's up?

296
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,875
The N.E.A. is out.

297
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,958
- Hang on.
- What?

298
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,208
They pulled out.

299
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,167
Why?

300
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,375
He wouldn't say.

301
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,917
Hold on for one more minute.

302
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,583
Chuck Sloan-- get him
on the phone right now.

303
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,750
I've got him right here.

304
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,167
- Is he muted?
- Yes.

305
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,958
Hey, Chuck.
It's Marty.

306
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,792
Listen, you can't do this.

307
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,250
If we don't stay united now,
we don't have a--

308
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,208
You hired me to represent
your interests, right?

309
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,333
How can I possibly lobby
for the teachers

310
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,750
when Congress sees us splintering

311
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,500
before we even put up
a unite--

312
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,333
All right.

313
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,583
Did Underwood get to you?

314
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,583
Whoa, Frank is dishonest
and manipulative.

315
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,333
You've seen that he's lied
to us already.

316
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,125
Wait-whoa-whoa-whoa, Chuck,
Ch-Ch-Chuck?

317
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,375
Chuck!

318
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,625
Son of a bitch!

319
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,083
- Where are you?
- I'm at the office.

320
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,458
- False.
- You don't believe me?

321
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,667
- Not for a second.
- Where are you?

322
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,875
- About to walk into a meeting.
- With who?

323
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,375
Someone I have to punish.

324
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,542
- Give me a name.
- No name.

325
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,458
What did this person do wrong?

326
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,792
Lie to me.

327
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,792
How will you punish him?

328
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,542
What makes you think it's a him?

329
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:29,625
Hold on.
I have to take this.

330
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,875
Where are you?

331
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,125
Me?
I am not at the office.

332
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:41,083
You're going to give me
a new one of these every week?

333
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,458
Well, I--

334
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,500
I can't continue to--

335
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,917
Not without protection.

336
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,292
Nobody tells me when to work
and when to play.

337
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,750
I'm not being unreasonable, Zoe.

338
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,583
If you can't trust me,
we should be doing this at all.

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,625
Well, then, how do we
establish our trust?

340
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,500
I have been very discreet.

341
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,292
Oh, professional discretion, yes,

342
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:07,583
but this is new territory.

343
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,500
You have a camera on your phone.

344
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,958
Pictures...

345
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,292
The kind I wouldn't want
my father to see.

346
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,583
Well, I'm going to need more than that.

347
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,667
Lie back.

348
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,375
Use your imagination.

349
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,875
I want everything packed for tomorrow.

350
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,542
- We checked already, dad.
- Oh, did you?

351
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,417
Those are my pink Nikes
on the kitchen counter?

352
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:22,375
And you, Autobot, what is Optimus
Prime doing under my bed?

353
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,083
He better transform himself

354
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,500
into your backpack before you
have to leave tomorrow.

355
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,042
Hey, dad?

356
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,583
Is Christina coming back?

357
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,667
Um, I don't think so, buddy.
No.

358
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,583
Oh, I liked her.

359
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,625
Me, too.
She's cool.

360
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,375
Yeah, she is cool.

361
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,417
And you guys gotta brush your teeth

362
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,917
and then check the rooms again,

363
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,500
and then it's time for bed.

364
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
Got it, pumpkins?

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,042
Dad, you know I hate it
when you call us pumpkins.

366
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,875
Go before I turn you into a pie.

367
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,292
Peter Russo.

368
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,250
He's a drunk.

369
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,667
He is at the moment,
a very functional one.

370
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,125
Imagine if he was sober.

371
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,875
Even so, you run him for governor,

372
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,417
people are going to dig into his past.

373
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,750
Well, we turn that into
an asset, not a liability.

374
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,000
Here's who I was.
Here's who I am now.

375
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,833
You saw how they dismissed him
in three seconds

376
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,042
at the leadership meeting.

377
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,917
Patty Whittaker
is very open-minded,

378
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,917
and I am very persuasive.

379
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,042
You think Russo even wants it?

380
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,292
Any kid who's made it
from the streets of South Philly

381
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,500
to the Capitol Rotunda is ambitious.

382
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
We just need to tap into that,

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,625
surround him with the best people

384
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,750
and then build the machine
and push the go button.

385
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,375
So you think he could win.

386
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,333
I think he can be a contender.

387
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,000
Okay, let's say we pull off
a miracle and he wins.

388
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,583
What do we gain by it?

389
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,042
Isn't it better to be holding
the reins in this race

390
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,750
than watching from the stands?

391
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,042
You wife is on the phone.

392
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,958
Put her through in here.

393
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,583
I understand that Pennsylvania's
important for redistricting--

394
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,167
No, no, no, this isn't just
about this race, Doug.

395
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,042
Expand your thinking.

396
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:16,667
Who else is from Pennsylvania?

397
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,125
No, no, no, not in Congress.

398
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,375
The executive branch.

399
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,375
The vice president.

400
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,458
Hello, my dear. Nancy had my tux
dry-cleaned so I won't embarrass--

401
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,917
The Cotesworth cancelled on us.

402
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,125
I'm leaving right now.
I'll come get you.

403
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,167
I've got to go.

404
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,333
What's going on?

405
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,667
The hotel, for tonight's gala.

406
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,458
They refused to let Claire
into the ballroom

407
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,708
because their employees are union.

408
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,000
Spinella.

409
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,333
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants,

410
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,000
but to go after my wife?

411
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,333
No class.
Meet me at the Cotesworth.

412
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,958
You got it.

413
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,167
Why can't we just move it
to another place?

414
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,750
I looked into that.
Everything's booked.

415
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,542
You have to reserve these
things weeks in advance.

416
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,917
I've got Stamper online looking
for another venue somewhere.

417
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,167
Francis, the delivery trucks
are already at the Cotesworth.

418
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,500
I can't have people showing
up at a different place

419
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,917
in case they don't get the email.

420
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,500
This is my fault.
I feel awful.

421
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,833
There's a half a million
on the line here.

422
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,625
I realize that.

423
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,292
And I can't keep having my work

424
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:14,667
take these hits on behalf of yours.

425
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,542
It's more than just an inconvenience.

426
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,708
I know.
We'll solve it.

427
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:27,833
- Hey, I just got your email.
- What did you think?

428
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,292
You don't have to send me
things before you post.

429
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,042
Oh, I thought you might want
to take a look.

430
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,375
The goal here is
for everyone to post things

431
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,125
faster than I have
a chance to read them.

432
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,875
If you're satisfied with the
article, just put it up.

433
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,250
- Okay.
- Are you satisfied?

434
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,333
I think so.

435
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,042
Okay, you are or you aren't.

436
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:45,375
Whatever hoops the Herald made
you jump through--

437
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,208
- I know.
- ...Let them go.

438
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,333
It's okay to be opinionated, Zoe,

439
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,750
and it's okay to go outside
to get your hands dirty.

440
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,583
You're no longer tied to a desk.

441
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,750
Or that pillow, for that matter.

442
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,125
I'm not going to post it.

443
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,875
Midterm predictions--
they're not news.

444
00:24:58,875 --> 00:24:59,917
They're bullshit.

445
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,458
Well, I agree.

446
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,917
I can do better.

447
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,542
I think you can.

448
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:08,167
Feel free to blow my mind.

449
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,083
If we do this event,
the whole staff walks out.

450
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,708
I've got 300 guests--

451
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,792
You signed a contract with my wife.

452
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,375
We'll refund your wife's organization

453
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,250
and pay for whatever the costs
of moving the event

454
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,167
to a more appropriate venue.

455
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,750
And we would have to refund a half
a million dollars in donations.

456
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,333
Can you pay for that, too?

457
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,458
Because I'm pretty sure there's
cause for damages here.

458
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,667
I truly apologize, sir.

459
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,042
Who's your boss?

460
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,583
I spoke with the owners,

461
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,208
and they authorized me to do
what I think is best.

462
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,208
And do they realize
that they are shutting the door

463
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,625
on 41 members
of the United States Congress?

464
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,750
Yes, sir, they do.

465
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,083
I had to make a very hard judgment call.

466
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,292
Well, I seriously question
your judgment.

467
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,375
You know, word travels fast
in this town.

468
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,625
All those luncheons
and conventions and dinners.

469
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:59,250
It's going to be a shame to
lose all that work. Isn't it?

470
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,583
Congressman, you are absolutely right,

471
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,125
but if my staff walks out,
I--

472
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,333
Please understand
the predicament I'm in.

473
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,542
I got an idea.

474
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:09,125
I know what we're going to do.

475
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,042
Honey, they're not going
to let us have it inside.

476
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,542
We're going to have it right here
on their front steps, picnic style.

477
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:15,875
What do you need from me?

478
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,375
I need your manpower.

479
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,625
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

480
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,958
Okay, everybody, stop what
you're doing, and listen up.

481
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,917
Yeah.

482
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,792
Oh, hey, Frank.

483
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,458
- How soon?
- About three hours.

484
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,500
- How many people we talking?
- Just 300.

485
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,542
The florist is going to send
over whatever he has.

486
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:41,708
Great.

487
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,250
Francis, where are we with food?

488
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,875
I've got hotdogs, pizzas,
and soul food coming,

489
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,208
maybe something else.

490
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,958
Girls, here's what I want.

491
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,583
I want four bars, two on each level.

492
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:53,042
The food can go there.
The silent auction goes here.

493
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,250
Oh, and cancel the string quartet.
Let's get a DJ.

494
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,375
Doug, how are we on booze?

495
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,667
- Kegs are on the way now.
- Great.

496
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,458
Oh, and call Denise at the office

497
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:02,000
and have her bring every
donation envelope she can find.

498
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,792
Okay, messages, people.

499
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,417
Congressman Russo's office.

500
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:12,208
Yes, can you hold one minute?
Thank you.

501
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,042
Congressman, people keep
calling about the shipyards.

502
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,500
We don't know what to tell them.

503
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,792
We just say we'll give you the message.

504
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,375
- Keep saying that.
- Here they are,

505
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,958
the messages and all the emails
we've gotten, too.

506
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,000
You want me to--
Have a good night.

507
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,125
Who did we reach?

508
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,333
Herald, The Times, USA Today.

509
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,458
All right, I want affiliate
stations and cable news.

510
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,708
I want satellite trucks out there.

511
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,833
I want this on live TV.

512
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,125
Okay, I'm on it.

513
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,417
You can't do this here.

514
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,750
Zoe, 8:00 P.M. tonight,
Hotel Cotesworth.

515
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,042
Benefit for my wife's charity.

516
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:44,750
No, wash your face
and let your hair down.

517
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,333
This is work and play.

518
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,875
See you.

519
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,333
I can tell you right now
I'm going to need two dozen.

520
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,125
Paul, I'm going to need those
by tomorrow, okay?

521
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,750
Your guests are your problem,
not mine, Julian.

522
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,750
I'll close the gate.

523
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,333
You know, I'm no expert in fire code,

524
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,250
but I would imagine that
locking your guests in

525
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,500
is a bigger violation than
having them walk around us.

526
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,042
This is trespassing on private property.

527
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,208
You're breaking the law.

528
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,250
Right, okay.

529
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,958
Let me get Barney Hull
on the phone here for you.

530
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,083
Here you go.

531
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,125
It's ringing.

532
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,500
Who's Barney Hull?

533
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,292
The police commissioner.

534
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,125
No? Okay.

535
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,875
You'd rather talk to him
in person, that's great.

536
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,208
He's coming to the party.

537
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,125
I'll be sure to introduce him to you.

538
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,833
Thanks for your hospitality.

539
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,417
Bar comes over here.

540
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,833
Put all that booze that way.

541
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,458
What do you want me to do?

542
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,167
I can't lock the gates, and they've
got the police on their side.

543
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,667
Unbelievable.
Hold on.

544
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,000
Cassandra,

545
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,125
I need 200 teachers

546
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,333
at the Cotesworth Hotel right now.

547
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,625
I need a full picket.

548
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,125
200? I don't know
if we can get that--

549
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,875
I don't want to hear it.
Just get it done.

550
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,625
I don't give a fuck if they're
teachers or not, frankly.

551
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,167
Just get me 200 bodies.

552
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,083
You know, call the teamsters.
Maybe they'll help us.

553
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,750
We'll give them glasses if we have to.

554
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,875
Tell the guys to look smart.

555
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,333
Charlie, get off the phone.

556
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,417
I need signs right now,
at least a hundred.

557
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,000
You know what?
Let them set it up.

558
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:16,792
It's actually better for us that way.

559
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,542
This way they can't hide from us.

560
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,667
You've put me in a terrible situation.

561
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,292
Oh, you did?

562
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:25,500
...British accent.

563
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,250
Thank you very much for all your help.

564
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,792
Much appreciated.

565
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,292
Here, we got
the signs right here.

566
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,708
Let's hand them out fast.

567
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,125
Everybody single file
right down the street.

568
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:50,958
This way, that way.
Okay?

569
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,417
Well, at least he spelled it right.

570
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,000
Teachers protesting

571
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,708
the education reform and achievement act

572
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,000
have descended upon the Hotel Cotesworth

573
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,167
in Washington, D.C.

574
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,042
Union lobbyist Martin Spinella

575
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,417
organized the demonstration.

576
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,417
Teachers deserve respect!

577
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,000
Teachers deserve respect!

578
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,167
Now, I knew you'd show up.

579
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,417
You bring that beautiful wife
of yours? Hello...

580
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,833
Pleasure.
Thank you for coming.

581
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,042
Come on in.
The drinks are on the house.

582
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:31,792
Felicity.

583
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,625
Spinella got us shut out by the union,

584
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,708
so we had to have the party
out here on the steps.

585
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,500
I'll take you up to a bar right now.

586
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,667
Thank you for coming.

587
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,583
Thank you. Welcome.

588
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,500
Teachers, yes!
Unions, yes!

589
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,042
Hi. Great.

590
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,208
Thanks again so much for coming.

591
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,958
Adam's here.

592
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,958
You came.

593
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:52,750
Looks wonderful.

594
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,375
You're going to have to move over,

595
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,458
because I have to serve
this wonderful couple myself.

596
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,958
This is fabulous.

597
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,750
Only Claire could've thought of this.

598
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,917
I don't suppose you have
anything single-malt back there.

599
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,875
Frank, it's worth every penny
to see you on keg duty.

600
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:11,500
Well, then don't you think this is
worth just a few extra pennies?

601
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,208
Oh, let's break out
the checkbook, Charles.

602
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,917
Did you RSVP?

603
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,833
I assumed it didn't matter.

604
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,125
It doesn't.

605
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,833
I'm glad you're here.

606
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,708
When I heard your message.

607
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,792
You know, I shouldn't
have left that, Adam.

608
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:27,958
Why not?

609
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,125
Maybe we should talk at some point.

610
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,250
Make that check with
a lot of zeroes, won't you?

611
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,750
There we are.

612
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,208
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

613
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,250
Cheers.

614
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,833
I'm going to ask a huge favor
of you since you're here.

615
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,042
You want to put me to work.

616
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:53,708
Yes, please.

617
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:57,417
- My pleasure.
- Come.

618
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,167
So these are
some wonderful photographs

619
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,083
- by an amazing photographer--
- Gillian.

620
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,583
Adam Galloway, nice to meet you.

621
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,958
And this is the photographer himself.

622
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,667
Freddy.

623
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,667
I just wanted to thank you so much.

624
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:16,750
Such a success.

625
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,625
My pleasure.
My pleasure.

626
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,708
He's the best.

627
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,083
I see Adam's here.

628
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,625
I didn't know he was coming.

629
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,167
- Well, guess what I got.
- What?

630
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,917
Another check from the Holburns

631
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,500
for $60,000.

632
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,208
Come on, praise me like you should.

633
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,625
If Frank Underwood and
the United States Congress--

634
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,417
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm with Slugline.

635
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,750
...Dismantle the
rights of the American teacher?

636
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,625
Unions, yes!
Teachers, yes!

637
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,542
Hi.
Why do you protest here?

638
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,458
And Congress has to take this seriously.

639
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,500
We're here for the teachers.

640
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,667
We're here.

641
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,208
Thank you.
Thank you.

642
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,250
We're not asking for the world,

643
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,292
and Congress needs to step up
and get this done.

644
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,833
Excuse me.

645
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,875
That dress looks familiar.

646
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:19,500
It's the one I wore to the symphony.

647
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,375
Oh, yes, mutual admiration society.

648
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,208
That's right.

649
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,375
So what do you have for me?

650
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,833
What do you mean?

651
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,750
Well, you're surrounded
by Washington's elite.

652
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,167
Are you saying you've overheard nothing

653
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,833
that could be useful to either of us?

654
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,292
I'm covering the protest.

655
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,208
The rest of the world
is covering the protest.

656
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,708
You may not have noticed,

657
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,583
but you're the only journalist
inside the party.

658
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,000
I've been feeding you plenty.

659
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,625
Information is a two-way street,
Miss Barnes.

660
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,958
- Hello.
- Claire, this is Zoe Barnes.

661
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,375
You met her one night at the house.

662
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,417
Yes, I remember.

663
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,125
You work for the Herald, right?

664
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,208
Not anymore.

665
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,583
I actually work at Slugline now.

666
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,792
I've heard of it.

667
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:54,250
You read it, don't you, Francis?

668
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,792
Religiously.

669
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,667
Well, you seem like a very
ambitious young woman.

670
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,833
I like that.

671
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,542
Doing my best.

672
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,792
It's good to see you again.

673
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,250
Please enjoy yourself.

674
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,583
I will. Thank you.

675
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,125
Take care, Miss Barnes.

676
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,417
...On the steps,

677
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,583
and she looks gorgeous,

678
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,167
but really she's thinking,

679
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,750
when can I go the fuck home?

680
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,500
- I'm off.
- Already?

681
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,958
I've done my duty, I believe.

682
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,333
Oh, you know me.

683
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,208
Always have to be the first
to leave a party.

684
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,500
How much did you raise?

685
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,667
$750,000.

686
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:55,875
80 of that was your photographs.

687
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,292
Fantastic.

688
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,292
Write a check for 250,
we'll break a million.

689
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:03,917
Nice try.

690
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,708
Thank you for coming.

691
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,500
And everything that you did.

692
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,708
Call me sometime.

693
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,417
I will.

694
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,958
So what does a clean water gala

695
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,375
have to do with teachers' unions?

696
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,792
Well, we have
over 50 members of Congress

697
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,250
gathered in one place.

698
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,000
But the fact that
these members of Congress

699
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,708
are promoting pouring money
out of the country

700
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,458
while neglecting their teachers at home

701
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,042
is precisely the problem.

702
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:36,917
But this is private money,
not public tax dollars, so...

703
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,667
But we're not protesting the cause.

704
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,750
We're protesting the Congressmen
and women themselves.

705
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,542
Are these even teachers picketing?

706
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,750
Well, sure, some of them.

707
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,000
And some of them
are people in--

708
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,042
Excuse me.

709
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,500
Frank.
What are you--?

710
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:51,750
Don't take the food.
We'll feed you later.

711
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,708
Marty, you know that old saying.

712
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,167
The most dangerous spot in the world

713
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,625
is to come between
a teamster and free food.

714
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,917
Don't take the food.
We're feeding you later.

715
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:02,083
- I'll take it.
- She'll take it.

716
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,833
Who else is hungry?

717
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,750
- There you go.
- Pass it back.

718
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,875
Plenty more coming, guys.

719
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,708
I know you've all
been out here for hours.

720
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,083
Thank you, Freddy.

721
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:17,375
The best ribs in D.C.

722
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,625
Marty, come on.

723
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,708
You said your piece.
You got on the news.

724
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,125
Come and enjoy yourself.

725
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,500
I respect you, Claire.
You know I can't do that.

726
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,417
Doesn't matter what side you're on.

727
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,667
Everybody's got to eat.

728
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:26,750
You can have a plate of ribs.

729
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:27,750
Yes, you can. Come on.

730
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,000
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

731
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,292
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.

732
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,667
You can do it.
Come on, Marty. Come on.

733
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,250
Thank you, I can't.
Thank you. Thank you.

734
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,542
Freddy's.
You should go to Freddy's.

735
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,750
Several dozen union sympathizers

736
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,833
led by labor lobbyist Martin Spinella

737
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,583
attempted to disrupt the gala.

738
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,333
They need to step up to the plate

739
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,417
and take care of our teachers
and our children.

740
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:56,083
The protest dissipated
when fundraiser attendees

741
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,917
offer food and drink to picketers.

742
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:59,875
Doesn't matter
what side you're on.

743
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,125
Everybody's gotta eat.

744
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,667
Turn it off.

745
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,167
It is unclear whether
the protest will continue.

746
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,458
What now?

747
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:17,125
Call the union leadership
and the chapter presidents.

748
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,917
See if they're ready
to pull the trigger.

749
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,417
If they are, we strike
at midnight tomorrow.

750
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,875
You were extraordinary.

751
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,292
Tomorrow, people who weren't there

752
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:55,042
are gonna lie and say they were.

753
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,292
What are you reading?

754
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,208
She can write.

755
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,125
She can.

756
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,292
And you can raise money.

757
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:12,333
Always for a good cause.

758
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,708
Thank you.

759
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,792
Wait in the car, please.

760
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:39,250
Hold on.
I know who that is.

761
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,000
Hello, Peter.

762
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,958
I am starving.
I forgot to eat.

763
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,917
Would you like something, Peter?

764
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,708
No. Thanks.

765
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,833
You should eat.

766
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,292
Don't fight. She'll win.

767
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:00,458
I will.

768
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,625
Okay. Yes.

769
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,917
You want some coffee?

770
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,458
Yes. Thanks.

771
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:08,667
Do you have any children?

772
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:13,500
Two.
A son and a daughter.

773
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,250
Married?

774
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,875
Divorced.

775
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,500
What are their names, your kids?

776
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,625
Um, Sarah, she's 11,

777
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,167
and Kevin is eight.

778
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,250
Do you have any pictures?

779
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:34,708
Fuck!
I lost my phone.

780
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,750
I--sorry. I should--
uh, I gotta go.

781
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,875
Peter, sit down.

782
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,333
You're gonna enjoy your sandwich,

783
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,542
have some coffee, and stay the night.

784
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:47,000
Milk and sugar?

785
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,750
Black.

786
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,917
Some fresh towels.

787
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,833
There should be soap and toothpaste,

788
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,250
everything you need in the bathroom.

789
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:57,083
Thank you so much for doing this.

790
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,333
Oh, it's nothing.
Sleep well.

791
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,792
What's going on, Peter?

792
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,833
Talk to me.

793
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,917
You think fresh towels changes anything?

794
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:26,833
Changes what?

795
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:30,500
The shipyard.

796
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,458
If I was home and you pulled that shit,

797
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,500
I'd beat the fuck out of you.

798
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,958
I would crack your skull
on the pavement.

799
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,500
That's why I came over here today,

800
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,750
to fuck you up for what you made me do.

801
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:45,583
I don't care how nice
you're being to me.

802
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,792
I don't give a shit.

803
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,125
I'm gonna wake up tomorrow...

804
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,542
and all these people...

805
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:00,792
all my friends...

806
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:03,667
are still fucked.

807
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,583
And I'm still fucked.

808
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:11,542
You fucked all of us.

809
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:14,625
But I'm gonna get blamed for it.

810
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,833
So now I have to carry
that weight on my shoulders.

811
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,875
You fucked me, Frank.

812
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,167
I shouldn't have let you do it,
but I did.

813
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,792
Are you done now?

814
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,958
Get up.

815
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,083
- No.
- I said get up.

816
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,417
And follow me. Now.

817
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,583
Get in.

818
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,250
Take off your clothes and get in.

819
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,583
Do it. Now.

820
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:49,125
There was a D.N.C. meeting
earlier this week.

821
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,625
About the governor's race.

822
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,167
Your name came up
as someone we might want to run.

823
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,667
Aspirin. Go ahead.

824
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,292
Everyone in that room wanted
to cross you off the list.

825
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,875
I said no.
I stuck up for you.

826
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:07,750
I said, "Peter Russo,
he's got potential.

827
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:12,000
He's young. He's capable.
He's going places."

828
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,792
I made them keep you in contention.

829
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,833
You're still on that list.

830
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,833
You show up at my house
in the middle of the night,

831
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:25,042
drunk, to whine,
to try to shift the blame on me

832
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,875
instead of taking responsibility

833
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,375
for yourself and your own actions.

834
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,000
Maybe they were right in that meeting.

835
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,458
Maybe you are worthless.

836
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,667
I'm the only person
who believes in you, Peter,

837
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:45,167
but maybe that's one too many.

838
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:47,875
The hot water will open up
your capillaries.

839
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:50,375
The aspirin you just took
will make your blood thinner.

840
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:52,333
It's up to you, Peter.

841
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,625
Oh, and if you do decide
to take the coward's way out,

842
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,875
cut along the tracks, not across them.

843
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,500
That's a rookie mistake.

844
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:21,000
Morning.

845
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,625
Morning.

846
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,833
You need a lift to the hill?

847
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,542
I should go home and change my clothes.

848
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:28,875
No, no, we'll drop you.

849
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,750
Want some coffee?

850
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:43,417
Frank...

851
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,917
One month.

852
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,208
Hmm?

853
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,625
One month sober.

854
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,958
I can give you that.

855
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,625
Not for me. For you.

856
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,708
Has the seed been planted?

857
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,667
Only Peter can answer that question.

858
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,625
He has a choice.

859
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:14,125
Will he wither or will he thrive?

860
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,833
Only time will tell.

861
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:30,292
