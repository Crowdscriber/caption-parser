1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:03,908
We got some bad news yesterday.

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,308
Phil's mom died.
It wasn't unexpected.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,908
He was with her and she went
very peacefully in her sleep.

4
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:12,608
She and I had
a special connection.

5
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,808
- We all did.
- But mostly me.

6
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:16,408
She said I was just like her.

7
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,108
Was she weirdly competitive too?

8
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:21,282
The whole family is
going down to Florida

9
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:22,482
tomorrow to be with Phil 
for the service.

10
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:24,661
Such a relief.

11
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,521
I can feel how much
he needs me right now.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,820
There they are.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,520
Hey, guys.

14
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,079
Oh, you brought my neck pillow.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,972
I missed you so much.

16
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,727
Phil, I'm so sorry.

17
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:40,914
Thanks.

18
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,687
Grace was such a kind
and whimsical soul.

19
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:46,865
The different animals she put
antlers on for Christmas cards--

20
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:47,752
inspired.

21
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:49,382
Not a single one
was photoshopped.

22
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,764
- Not even the alligator?
- Cost her the tip of her pinkie,

23
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:53,226
- but she had no regrets.
- Oh!

24
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:55,188
I'm so glad you guys are here.

25
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,016
I hope it wasn't too hard
to get away from work.

26
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,048
No. Please, anything for family.

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,983
Anything to get me
out of that office.

28
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:04,354
Ugh! It's all boring paperwork
and endless meetings.

29
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,317
Honestly, this funeral could not
have come at a better time.

30
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,721
Aw, that's sweet.
You should put that on the flowers.

31
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:12,850
Gloria, you must be so hot in that.

32
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:16,365
I am in mourning. In Colombia,
we take death very seriously.

33
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,026
Where don't they?

34
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,473
Can we lose the veil?
Nobody's looking for you, Gloria.

35
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:20,754
Who is Gloria?

36
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,350
I am a wanted woman in Florida.

37
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,741
I used to live there,
and when I left,

38
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:30,429
my roommate made our apartment
into a house of prostitution,

39
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:32,092
and my name
was still on the lease.

40
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,076
It's like a traffic ticket.

41
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:34,941
You walk into court,
pay a fine, it's done.

42
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:35,892
Quick and easy.

43
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,269
Yes, that was the name
of the whorehouse.

44
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:40,481
Mitchell, can you
go with her to court?

45
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,075
She's gonna need
some sort of lawyer.

46
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:44,272
Uh, you know, Jay,
Mitchell is so burnt out right now.

47
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:45,957
He is in desperate need of a break.

48
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,001
Bench warrants are a no-brainer.
And, I mean, come on.

49
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:49,740
Does Gloria really look
like the kind of woman

50
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,064
who would run a brothel?

51
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:54,681
- Yeah, I better go with her.
- You should go.

52
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:55,672
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

53

55
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,851
There they are!

56
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,088
- Hey.
- Hi.

57
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,373
Oh, you look beautiful.
Hi, Claire.

58
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:14,534
How are you holding on, hmm?

59
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:15,286
Oh, well, you know...

60
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:16,750
We're getting through it.
Huh, dad?

61
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,252
Ah. I'm doing okay.
A little trouble sleeping.

62
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,496
I'm so used to her snoring,

63
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:22,506
I may have to borrow
the neighbor's bulldog.

64
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:25,022
Morning, Charlotte!

65
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:27,367
This is my family from California!

66
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:30,879
I can tell. They all
look like movie stars.

67
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,803
Ah. Oh, thank you.

68
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,849
That's nuts. I know that woman,
but I have no idea from where.

69
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,029
Yeah. This place is full
of stories like that.

70
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,733
Good morning,
Mr. Dunphy, visitors.

71
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,972
- Please, Shelley, call me Frank.
- No, sir.

72
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,007
That might be the way
they do things at Whistling Pines,

73
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:47,184
but we run a tight ship
here at Leisure Park.

74
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,749
As per your request,
I have reserved

75
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,109
the lakeside promenade
this evening for one hour,

76
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,266
beginning at 5:00 P.M.,
for your memorial service.

77
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,297
May I remind you that there's
no smoking on the grounds,

78
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:57,513
no glass near the lake,
no feeding the ducks?

79
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,205
And I'm sorry for your loss.

80
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,516
- Thank you.
- No feeding the ducks.

81
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:02,269
What are you looking at me for?

82
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:11,633
I love it here--

83
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,783
manicured lawns,

84
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,665
planned activities, early dinners.

85
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,957
What more does a kid need?

86
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,732
Oh, yeah. And everyone's
so polite and considerate--

87
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,825
nothing like the constant
catfights in my circle,

88
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,046
where every week,

89
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,409
somebody's mad at somebody
for God knows who what,

90
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,258
and I'm always thrown
into the middle.

91
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,430
You seem tense. You know,
they have a steam room.

92
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,300
- Wanna join me for a schvitz?
- Please, it's Florida.

93
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,836
If I wanna sweat more, I'll just
move my arms. You go have fun.

94
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,661
Hey, you.

95
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,435
Are you liking that book?

96
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,508
Well, it's not the worst thing
I've picked up at an airport,

97
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,477
but close.

98
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:39,717
What is this,

99
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:41,687
a book club or
a Miss America Pageant?

100
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,049
We're looking for our next book.

101
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,018
Oh, what are you reading now?

102
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,915
"Tempted by her innocent kiss."

103
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,496
I-I'm sure you don't know it.

104
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,008
Oh, please. Devon Carter
was Ashley's first,

105
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,684
she wants their passion to last,

106
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:56,023
but her hopes of true love
are crushed when she finds out

107
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:58,743
their marriage is just another one
of daddy's business deals.

108
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,093
I'm gay.

109
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,102
Oh! My grandson is gay.

110
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,842
His name is Daniel Schulman.
Uh, do you know him?

111
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:08,011
Oh! Is he about this tall,
dark hair, circumcised?

112
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:10,715
Terrible.

113
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:12,264
Don't be nervous, all right?

114
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,437
I'll explain your situation.

115
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:14,580
We'll have you
out of here in no time.

116
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:16,580
30 days in county jail.

117
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:20,068
What?
Ooh, she's tough.

118
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,264
Next.

119
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,344
Anita Menchaca.
Petty theft.

120
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,257
Si.

121
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,864
Mister, you're a lawyer?
Help me, please.

122
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:29,249
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm her lawyer.

123
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:32,073
No, no, help her,
so this will go faster.

124
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:33,994
And she reminds me of my abuela,

125
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:37,247
with her head scarf and
her petty theft charges.

126
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,024
Here, your honor.

127
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,514
I'm Mitchell Pritchett,
attorney to Miss Manchego.

128
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,614
- Menchaca.
- Ah, yeah...

129
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,113
Are you ready to enter a plea?

130
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:45,215
Absolutely.

131
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,842
I see no reason why
this matter should

132
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,875
take up any more
of the court's valuable time.

133
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:50,263
Not guilty, your honor.

134
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:51,168
Why?

135
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,870
Gonna need a minute.

136
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,957
Look what my dad just gave me.

137
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,264
Please tell me that's not your mom.

138
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:05,032
No, no. She picked out her own urn.

139
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:06,183
My dad keeps saying

140
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:08,465
it's a size too small but
she squeezed into it.

141
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,689
No, this is stuff
she left for the kids.

142
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,002
- Can I... open it?
- Yeah.

143
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:16,457
Wow. There's a note for you.

144
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:18,211
I can't read it.

145
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:19,589
- Okay.
- Would you?

146
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,445
All right.

147
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:24,561
"Dear Phil,

148
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,352
"you've always been
the most wonderful son,

149
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:29,713
and now I need you to do
one last thing for me."

150
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:30,495
Oh, no!

151
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,160
She's gonna ask me to throw
her ashes in the Pope's face.

152
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:36,197
"Don't say anything to your father

153
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,664
"because he'll just resist,

154
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,662
"but there's a woman
named Annie Fitzsimmons

155
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,232
"who lives a few streets over.

156
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,648
"We don't know her very well,
but I've always admired her,

157
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,177
"and I think she'd
be perfect for your dad.

158
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:49,040
So before you go home,
I want you to fix him up with her."

159
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,124
That is crazy!

160
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,547
"I know this sounds crazy,

161
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,798
"but single men are
in short supply here.

162
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,562
"And a lot of scheming
harpies will swoop in

163
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,387
"before your father
knows what hit him.

164
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:59,801
I love Frank, but he'll follow
anything with a casserole."

165
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:01,268
I don't believe this.

166
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,871
It's too soon, and
my dad's not a cartoon bear.

167
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:06,579
He's perfectly capable
of making intelligent decisions.

168
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,371
Hey, guys? I made cookies.

169
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,124
Oh, good. I thought
that was a neighbor.

170
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,418
Hey, kids, your grandma
left each of you something.

171
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,932
Cool! Rockports!

172
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,153
It's just the box.

173
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,450
Oh, my God.
There's a letter.

174
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:28,837
I don't know if
I'm ready for this.

175
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,021
Although if grandma wrote it,

176
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:30,813
she must have sensed
I was ready.

177
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:32,462
Because you had such a bond?

178
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:33,639
You felt it, too?

179
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,173
Haley, why don't you
tell us what yours says?

180
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:36,384
Well, it's so sweet.

181
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:38,653
It's about how beautiful
I am inside and--

182
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:40,781
score! Jewelry

183
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,117
Whoa! Check it out!

184
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,045
Oh, look at that.

185
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,851
Your grandma loved pocket watches.

186
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,518
- Aw!
- She said they made a man look dignified.

187
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,144
Is this chain in case
you swallow it?

188
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,890
No, but suddenly
I'm glad it's there.

189
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,500
- A lighter?
- Huh. What does the note say?

190
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:55,703
"This is a lighter."

191
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,938
I don't understand.

192
00:06:58,305 --> 00:06:59,936
How much clearer
could she have been?

193
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,514
I wouldn't read too much into it.

194
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,901
Your grandma loved you very much.

195
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,695
She just did a couple of
bizarre things towards the end.

196
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,284
Here, Alex, I can
help you out with that.

197
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,818
You are getting very sleepy.

198
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,896
A crappy old lighter
is not a sucky gift.

199
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:17,150
Honey, hey, hey. So you're not
gonna do what your mom asked?

200
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,117
Marry off my dad
to a complete stranger

201
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:20,816
on the day of her funeral?
I think not.

202
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,121
It was her last wish.

203
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,754
When my dad is ready,
he gets to pick his own girlfriend.

204
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,531
That's the big upside
to your wife dying.

205
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,828
Also, not having to think
before you speak.

206
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:30,765
Yeah.

207
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,018
Your honor, it all
boils down to this.

208
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,269
The motel owes
Miss Menchengo--

209
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,746
- Menchaca.
- Damn it. Every time.

210
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,963
More in wages than
she ever could've taken

211
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:42,273
in soaps and tiny shampoos.

212
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:43,916
Fine. Case dismissed.

213
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:44,934
Yes!

214
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,776
Oh! Gracias! Muchas gracias!

215
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,254
- De nada. De nada.
- Muchas gracias.

216
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:52,443
Did you see that? I won!
I-I can't believe it!

217
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,980
Yeah. It scares me that winning
is such a surprise for you.

218
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,120
Next! Matthew Plonkser.
Parking violations.

219
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,064
I thought I'd be a little rusty,
but apparently not.

220
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,738
Oh! Really? Sweet.

221
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,724
Yes! Go make your
mistakes with him.

222
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,676
I don't want to go
to jail for prostitution.

223
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,924
Like you could afford me.

224
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:16,271
It seems to me
it wasn't only the meter

225
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,789
that was broken
that fateful afternoon.

226
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,781
Nay!

227
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,735
It was the entire
criminal justice system.

228
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,751
Therefore I submit to you,

229
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,810
the only "influence" my client
was under that night

230
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,738
was his love of boating.

231
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,804
Shame!

232
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,695
I just don't get it.
Why would she give me a lighter?

233
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,810
Maybe she wants you
to burn all your clothes.

234
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,772
Is it possible we didn't have
the connection I thought we did?

235
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:45,202
I don't know.
You heard dad.

236
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:47,304
She was on all that medication
towards the end.

237
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,529
People do weird things
when they're on drugs.

238
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,919
When Dylan was on Vicodin
after his root canal,

239
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,136
he bought the complete DVD set
of "Dr. Quinn medicine woman."

240
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:01,071
Get going, ladies.
The pool's for residents only.

241
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,704
Oh, okay. Sorry. We'll leave.

242
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,708
Uh, no, we won't.
There's nobody here.

243
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,579
- Haley!
- Why can't we use the pool?

244
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,207
Because those are the rules.

245
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:09,865
Are we gonna have a problem here?

246
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,954
You don't scare me
I've been in real jail.

247
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:15,390
Oh, you two are
pretty smart, aren't you?

248
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,128
No. Only she is.

249
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,084
North.

250
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:24,104
Flowers.

251
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:25,131
Red.

252
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:27,309
One dot.

253
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,048
Two bam.

254
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:32,142
I have mahj!

255
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,743
- Hee hee!
- Again?!

256
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:35,925
Wow, you're really
on some streak, Edith.

257
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,435
Luck of the tiles.

258
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,672
Anyone else want some punch?

259
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:41,719
Yeah. I'll join you.

260
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,161
- You are very good.
- Well...

261
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,650
Where'd a farm boy like you
learn to play mahjong?

262
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:51,985
Oh, well, one summer,

263
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,686
I worked at the central
Missouri b'Nai b'rith.

264
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,855
It's the nation's smallest chapter.

265
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,575
Listen, Marilyn,

266
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,541
I don't mean to stir things up,

267
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:03,806
but I just saw Edith take the winning
tile out of her jacket pocket.

268
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,417
I knew it!

269
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,638
Nobody's that good!

270
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,753
Listen, I'm as shocked as you are.

271
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,832
It just doesn't seem like Edith.

272
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,145
Yeah, well, it goes to show,
you think you know someone...

273
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:22,070
Hey. What happened
to all the cookies?

274
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,450
Oh, well, you know
I hate to stir things up...

275
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,358
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

276
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,437
Jay Pritchett. Frank Dunphy's son
is married to my daughter.

277
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:33,636
Oh, I'm so sorry.

278
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,101
Ah, he grows on you.

279
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,434
Oh, you're talking about
the death. Thank you.

280
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:41,672
You look very familiar to me.
Did you ever live in Ohio?

281
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:44,841
No. I'm from Pensacola.

282
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,718
And then it hit me.

283
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:49,666
I had done my basic
training in Pensacola.

284
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,219
She was my first.

285
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,397
I'll never forget her--
Charlotte somebody.

286
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,627
I was 18, and she was 31.

287
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,253
And we fell pretty hard
for each other.

288
00:10:58,582 --> 00:10:59,952
I always felt bad
I never called her

289
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,225
when I got back from Vietnam.

290
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:04,165
Especially because by then I had,
you know...

291
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:05,986
learned a few things.

292
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:08,105
I'm sorry.
You'll have to forgive me.

293
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,654
My memory isn't what it used to be.

294
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:12,760
I was in the Navy.
Jay Pritchett.

295
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:14,516
Little more up here,

296
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:15,757
little less down here.

297
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,296
I'm sure you're a very nice man,

298
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:20,583
but I-I think you may have
mistaken me for someone else.

299
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,826
I was shipping off to Vietnam.

300
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,721
You had the ass of
a young Ann-Margret.

301
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,966
Yeah, that was me.

302
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,684
Grandma looks so happy here.

303
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,144
Yeah. We were pretty hammered.

304
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:34,249
That was last 4th of July--
grandma's favorite holiday.

305
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:36,685
The Plimptons had a barbecue,

306
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:39,346
and gram and I got a little tipsy
on ginger margaritas.

307
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,465
We came home for a catnap

308
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,670
and slept right through
the big fireworks show.

309
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,413
First one she ever missed.

310
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,133
Boy, was she mad.

311
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,440
I made it up to her

312
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,566
with a little fireworks show
of our own later.

313
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,561
Grandpa!

314
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,878
A couple of glow sticks and
a slingshot in the backyard.

315
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:59,238
Which led to some pretty
memorable lovemaking.

316
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,818
Not to change the subject,

317
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,242
but I don't really get
the gift grandma left me.

318
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,035
Well, didn't she explain
it in the note?

319
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,000
No. The note's four words.

320
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,109
You know it opens, right?

321
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,483
It does?

322
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:17,599
Sure. Look, it's Florida.
Everything sticks together.

323
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,588
It's all so weird.

324
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,844
- Mm. - This thing you dread
in the back of your mind

325
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,270
suddenly becomes real.

326
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,269
I know.

327
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:29,869
I feel better having
you here, though.

328
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,366
Oh, I'm always here for you.

329
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:33,587
Look at that house.

330
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,989
That is a cute house.

331
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,478
I wonder who lives there.

332
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:37,923
I don't know.

333
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,863
Claire, what are you doing?

334
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:42,132
I love this house.

335
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,196
I bet you anything I would love
whoever lives here.

336
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:44,817
Wait a minute.

337
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,690
That lady from my mom's letter
lives here, doesn't she?

338
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:47,852
Annie Fitzsimmons.

339
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:49,169
Phil, listen to me.

340
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,496
You may have your reasons
for not wanting to do this,

341
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:54,064
but your mother was
a very wise woman.

342
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,433
She believed that whoever
is behind that door

343
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,111
would make your father happy
for the rest of his life.

344
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,357
Yeah. What can I do for you?

345
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,106
She's perfect.

346
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:05,935
I thought Annie Fitzsimmons
lived here.

347
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,056
She does.
Annie, honey!

348
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,644
There's people here to see ya!

349
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

350
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,783
Can I help you?

351
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,835
We're selling vacuum cleaners.

352
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,571
Wow. That is strange.

353
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:17,093
I know.

354
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,743
Because just this morning,
my vacuum cleaner broke.

355
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:22,334
- Huh.
- That's on me. I shed like a collie.

356
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,458
Let's see what you got.

357
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,027
Yes, Claire,
let's see what you got.

358
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:26,600
I didn't bring it.

359
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:27,580
- You didn't bring it?
- No.

360
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,848
You had it when we left
the vacuum cleaner office.

361
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,646
I guess it's fair to say
you've made a huge mistake.

362
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,646
- Mm.
- No. Say it.

363
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,676
I'm sorry to do that.
It's part of the training.

364
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:40,161
I've made a huge mistake.

365
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,587
I don't think she's gonna work out.

366
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:55,038
- That's mahj again!
- Oh! Well, shocker.

367
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,215
- That's it. You're cheating.
- I am not.

368
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:01,296
Oh, please! You've stashed more tiles
than Marilyn has cookies!

369
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,508
Oh! O-okay.
Uh, let's just take a breath.

370
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,425
Who cares about tiles or cookies

371
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,561
or whatever Hattie's
slipping into her coffee?

372
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,125
I knew you were drinking again!

373
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:11,720
- That's how she lost her license.
- You shut your traps!

374
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:12,745
- Drop dead!
- Screw you!

375
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,679
- Yeah, you, too!
- Ladies.

376
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,070
- And you!
- Ladies.

377
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,883
- Stop it! Stop it.
- You--

378
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,661
You have been friends
for 20 years.

379
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,391
What on earth has
gotten into you all?

380
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,832
Why does drama keep
following me everywhere I go?

381
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,055
It just keeps popping up
out of nowhere.

382
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,837
Like Crispin's hair plugs.

383
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:32,916
And so we went
to your apartment.

384
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,759
It's still embarrassing.

385
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,750
I told you I had never
been with a woman.

386
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,105
And you took me by the hand
and you led me into the bedroom.

387
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,866
You were so sweet and beautiful.

388
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,808
I thought I'd gone to heaven.

389
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,292
- Jay Pritchett.
- Yes! Yes!

390
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:48,980
Oh! I remember that.

391
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,839
You were so handsome.

392
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:52,369
Ohh! I don't know about that.

393
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,535
I mean, cute, maybe. I--
People talk about my eyes.

394
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,380
But I always regretted
not getting in touch with you

395
00:14:58,381 --> 00:14:59,471
when I got back,

396
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:02,192
because you had given me
something that I cherished

397
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,167
for almost 50 years.

398
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,439
You gave me something, too.

399
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:07,662
I did?

400
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:09,060
You wait right there.

401
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,427
I'm down there for a funeral--

402
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:12,910
it's such a sad event--

403
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:16,220
and I end up finding something
that I thought was lost forever.

404
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:19,689
This beautiful moment that meant
so much to both of us,

405
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:22,124
set against the backdrop
of fighting commies.

406
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,020
There's your movie.

407
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,926
I remember exactly where I was
when you gave it to me.

408
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,203
You said, "wear this bec--"

409
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:31,716
No, no. This isn't mine.

410
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,657
And I never went
to Jefferson High.

411
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:36,087
Oh. My mistake.

412
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,034
Ah! Here it is.

413
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,158
- You said, "pin this--"
- No, no. N-no. Never got a medal.

414
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,809
And, uh...

415
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,358
this is the wrong
branch of service.

416
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:46,760
Of course.

417
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,823
These are th--

418
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:49,924
Never wrote.

419
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:53,647
Why don't you look through here?

420
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,770
Turns out she sent more men
off to war than Lyndon Johnson.

421
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:00,142
Well, we're here.

422
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:01,924
You wanna try to sell
my dad a vacuum?

423
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:03,044
Tease me all you want.

424
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,621
I am glad that we at least tried.

425
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,125
I know you mean well,
but he's gonna be fine on his own.

426
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,682
So funny.

427
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,392
Ooh! Here.
Try mine, Frank.

428
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:12,848
- Oh! I bet it's delicious.
- Mmm.

429
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,325
If your taste buds are dead.

430
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:15,803
Dead? Real sensitive, Myra.

431
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:18,246
The woman's not even cold...
unlike your eggplant parm.

432
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:19,774
What is going on?

433
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,118
Oh, it's a feeding frenzy.
They're all over him.

434
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,913
They're practically measuring
the windows for new drapes.

435
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:24,936
It's disgusting.

436
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,955
I must get this recipe, Myra.

437
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:27,762
Oh, sure.

438
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:30,077
You want the recipe?
It's thaw, heat, and serve.

439
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,103
My mom was right.
They're gonna eat him alive.

440
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,022
Do you think we can break up

441
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,824
- Annie Fitzsimmons and her boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?

442
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:39,067
Oh, you mean Marv?
Oh, that's hilarious. Oh!

443
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,571
Marv's her brother,
visiting from Pompano.

444
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,415
He's here for the week,

445
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,400
slept with half
the women in this place.

446
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,157
She's single? This is fantastic.

447
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,361
Cam, how do you know that?

448
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,202
This place is lousy with gossips.

449
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,678
Next.
Gloria Delgado?

450
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm here!

451
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:57,049
Conspiring to promote prostitution.
How do you plead?

452
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,863
- Not guilty, your honor.
- Oh, good. It's you.

453
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,859
Your majesty.
I didn't do anything wrong.

454
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,753
But I will say that I am guilty

455
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,089
if I can just pay
the fine and go home.

456
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,222
No, you won't.

457
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,881
You're innocent,
and I can prove it.

458
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:12,199
Your honor,
this document here shows

459
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,035
that my client was a resident
of California at the time.

460
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:16,779
And these canceled checks prove

461
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,436
that she was legally subletting
the apartment in question.

462
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,564
I might be a simple man,
but I do know one thing...

463
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,450
If a dog don't bark--

464
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:26,302
Okay, I can't listen
to him anymore.

465
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:29,098
Case dismissed. Court adjourned.

466
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:32,012
- Oh!
- Ah! Gracias, Mitchell! You're wonderful!

467
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:36,292
You know what? We got lucky because
I had no ending to that dog thing.

468
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,291
 If you don't have
anything to do next week,

469
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,970
maybe you can go with me to Texas.

470
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:43,645
Hello again.

471
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,582
Oh, no. You're alone.

472
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,619
Did you fire that nice girl?

473
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,168
No. She's not a nice girl.
She's my wife.

474
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,686
And we don't sell vacuums.

475
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,480
Thank God. You'd starve.

476
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,772
U-um, I-I-I'm actually Phil Dunphy.

477
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,743
I-I'm Frank and Grace Dunphy's son.

478
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,610
Oh, I heard about your mom.
I'm--I'm so sorry.

479
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,484
Thank you.

480
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,318
I only met her a few times,

481
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,623
but she seemed like
a lovely woman.

482
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,869
Mm, but I'm still confused.

483
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,214
Well, this probably
won't help, but, um...

484
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:19,382
Her last request was for me
to fix you up with my dad.

485
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,179
Oh, my.

486
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,949
Yeah. I really wish
I sold vacuums.

487
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,273
So earlier...

488
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,545
We were thrown when your brother
answered the door.

489
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,250
We thought he was your boyfriend.

490
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:31,538
I don't know what to say.

491
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:34,734
Really? This is such
a-a normal request I'm making.

492
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:37,355
Please, by the way,
don't feel pressured at all.

493
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,343
My dad doesn't even
know about this.

494
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:42,560
I-I just--I had to tell you.
It's what she wanted.

495
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,823
She was always doing
crazy stuff like this...

496
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,987
Going out of her way
to take care of us.

497
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:52,145
I coughed on the phone once,
and she overnighted me soup.

498
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,424
When I wanted to learn how to ski,
she knit me a sweater.

499
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,526
When I wanted to be
a marine biologist,

500
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,543
she knit me a sweater
with a whale on it.

501
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,393
Who does that?

502
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,206
That's just the kind
of person she is.

503
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,640
Was.

504
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,254
Oh, sweetie.

505
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,940
You're a good son.

506
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:19,022
She was right.
You are very nice.

507
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:31,925
It's a beautiful service.

508
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:34,430
It really makes you think about
how you wanna live your life.

509
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,583
I wanna quit my job and
get back into the courtroom.

510
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:38,519
What?

511
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,371
Yeah. Just--just don't say
anything to anyone.

512
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:41,780
Well, who am I gonna tell?

513
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:44,973
Thank you, Mel.

514
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:46,563
That was beautiful.

515
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:51,673
Um, before we say good night,

516
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:54,489
my daughter Alex
would like to pay tribute.

517
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:58,848
Thanks, sweetie.

518
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:08,542
My grandmother and I
had a very special bond.

519
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,119
Seriously? Again?

520
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:12,146
This may not make
sense to everyone,

521
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,554
but I'm pretty sure
she would've loved it.

522
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:27,712
"This is a lighter.

523
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,417
"It belonged to my favorite actor,
Paul Newman.

524
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:34,181
"One day, he came into the restaurant
where I was waitressing

525
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:35,843
"and accidentally left it behind.

526
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,985
"For the first time in my life,

527
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:39,972
"I did something
I wasn't supposed to

528
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,597
and slipped it into my pocket."

529
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:43,975
"One of the customers saw

530
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,455
"and said, 'don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

531
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:49,516
"That customer turned out
to be the love of my life,

532
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,107
"your grandfather.

533
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:54,038
"So, my Alex,
who I love so dearly,

534
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,398
"who is probably too much
like me for her own good,

535
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:58,525
"every once in a while,

536
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,375
"don't be afraid to break the rules.

537
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:02,621
You never know what can happen."

538
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,022
How 'bout this weather?

539
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,080
Yep. They say
it's supposed to rain.

540
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,271
We need it.

541
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,395
Muriel.

542
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:20,418
Hey! Are you two packed up
and ready to go?

543
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:21,451
Yep.

544
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,759
Where does the time go?

545
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:25,315
Darned if I know.

546
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:27,547
Everyone's always in such a hurry.

547
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,129
And why? We're all gonna
end up in the same place.

548
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:33,574
Well, I guess we better mosey.
