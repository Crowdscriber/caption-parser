00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:02,911
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,608
<i>You cannot bully your way back
to the table, Raymond,</i>

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:07,727
just as you cannot
buy the keys to Congress.

4
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:11,058
Best of luck keeping your
majority in the House.

5
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:13,743
She's in New York.

6
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,545
- Adam Galloway.
- Yes sir.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,432
- I understand you work for Adam Galloway.
- Yeah. It's a way to pay the bills.

8
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:22,095
So how is it that I've found more
in two days than you have in two months?

9
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,231
- You're a parasite.
- So are you Danton.

10
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,826
- How many elections have you won?!
- Look where your desk is now!

11
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,004
- And I'd say we're even.
- Not my vice president.

12
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:36,309
- But he's a dangerous man.
- We can be dangerous too.

13
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:37,865
How much danger
are we in, Frank?

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,855
None if we end this
conversation right now.

15
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:42,068
Have you ever loved anyone?
I'm glad I have this.

16
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:47,353
It's been a big bump in
business since it came out
I'm talking lines around the block.

17
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:49,492
Let's fill up that map
with Freddy's BBQ Joints.

18
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,446
- You kill your co-venture with Tusk.
- That was never part of the deal.

19
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:56,253
- We're running out of options.
- A tip of your iceberg is melting, Frank.

21
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,883
Hey, Freddy! How ya doing?

22
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,011
- Hey.
- All right, that's what I like to hear.

23
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:16,771
- My man.
- Catch you later, brother.

25
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,610
I spoke to everyone
I know at the<i> Daily.</i>

26
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,650
Nobody's naming sources,
but it has to be Remy.

27
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,971
- Is Galloway going on the record?
- He wouldn't.

28
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,450
- Not without speaking to us first.
- Let's be sure about that.

29
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,251
- I'll talk to Adam.
- Maybe it's smarter to avoid contact.

30
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,891
Somebody has to respond,
whether it's him, or us, or both.

31
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,691
We have to coordinate,
and do it carefully.

32
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,771
Let me take care of this.

33
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,411
Well, let's just
think this through.

34
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:58,451
- I've got it covered, Francis.
- OK.

35
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,171
What should I do?
Head back to the office?

36
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,291
You should work here.
We can't avoid the press if you leave.

37
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,131
- All right. You hold down the fort.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,491
- And you follow Claire's lead.
- We'll shut this down, sir.

39
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,972
- There can't be any doubt.
- Let's walk through a timeline.

40
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,171
- So you first met him when?
- Whitney Biennial...

41
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:12,651
This hurts us both.

42
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:14,771
But it's not my wound to suture.

43
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,291
Claire must be the surgeon.

44
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,611
Only she can stop the bleeding.

45
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:23,051
You know we got
them plates in there.

46
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:24,771
All the changes
you asked for.

47
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,051
Gave you five more points
on the post-recoupment share.

48
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,451
Approval over all the
marketing materials.

49
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,530
Approval over the staff hires of the
flagship in Silver Spring.

50
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:36,771
- So, what next?
- You sign.

51
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,692
- And I get my $95,000?
- By the end of the week.

52
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,691
Just have to wire it from our
main account into the LLC,

53
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:44,571
cut a cashier's check for you.

54
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:47,011
Oh. I want to show you this.

55
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,971
It's a mockup of
the bottle design.

56
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:52,690
And we already started
on the concept layouts

57
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,491
for the
Silver Spring location.

58
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,931
- Why's that linoleum peeling up?
- To make it seem real.

59
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,291
Well, I wanted it
to look nicer than this.

60
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,931
We can scratch the peeling linoleum,
but we don't want it to look too nice.

61
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,570
You want them white folks
to feel like they slummin' it.

62
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,291
- No, to have an authentic atmosphere.
- And I get to play the nigger.

63
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,450
Look, Freddy,
you know how this works.

64
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,690
They don't just want the ribs,
they want the experience,

65
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,811
but without having
to leave the suburbs for it.

66
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:25,291
We're not selling
candlelit dinners here.

67
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,211
But I promise, nothing gets
built without your signing off.

68
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,091
<i>So,</i>
<i>what do you want me to do?</i>

69
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:43,531
- I need you to deny it.
-<i> The affair?</i>

70
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:47,090
The affair, taking the
photograph, everything.

71
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,571
We have a public history.
I donated work for your...

72
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,451
<i>You can say we had</i>
<i>a business relationship,</i>

73
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,891
<i>but that you didn't</i>
<i>take the picture of me</i>

74
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,131
in the bed.

75
00:06:57,131 --> 00:07:01,251
It was Photoshopped.
Whatever it is you need to say.

76
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:05,011
I'm so sorry, Claire.
I only have one print and it's still here.

77
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:08,131
<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>it. The digital file also.</i>

78
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:11,171
<i>- But e-mail us a copy first.</i>
- Why?

79
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,811
We need to make sure that there's nothing
in the image that links to your studio.

80
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,251
<i>Whatever</i>
<i>you think is best.</i>

81
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,250
Thank you, Adam.

82
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,811
I watched you...

83
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,091
<i>...when you did</i>
<i>the CNN interview.</i>

84
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:32,651
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't,</i>
<i>but I couldn't help it.</i>

85
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:37,291
<i>It's a shame it takes this</i>
<i>for us to talk to one another.</i>

86
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,291
You're well, besides this?

87
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,411
<i>Yeah. I spent three months in Colombia
after you came up here to work,</i>

88
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,491
<i>but also to get away.</i>

89
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:50,131
<i>- I met someone.</i>
<i>-</i> Oh.

90
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:53,931
<i>She's from Bogotá.</i>
<i>She's working for an NGO there.</i>

91
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,931
<i>Her name's Inez.</i>
<i>She's living with me now.</i>

92
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,490
Wow. That...
Things happened quickly.

93
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,890
<i>Yeah. They did.</i>

94
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,651
I should go.

95
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:09,891
So I won't talk to the press

96
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,730
until I get instructions.

97
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,371
<i>That's right.</i>

98
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:18,531
- It's good to hear your voice.
- You too.

99
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,371
- You finished?
- Yeah.

100
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,210
- Smack, crack, blow.
- No, thanks.

101
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,211
Come on, old man.
We got what you need.

102
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,931
I don't need anything.

103
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,131
Gotta buy somethin'
if you want to get inside.

104
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,371
- Get out the way.
- What?

105
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:06,610
For real. You need to get
the fuck on outta my way.

106
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,611
I'm just fuckin'
with you, nigga.

107
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,931
Chill the fuck out.

108
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:34,450
- Who are you?
- Your grandfather.

109
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,331
Open up.

110
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:38,851
<i>- What's your plan?</i>
- Work from home.

111
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,291
You don't need me dragging
this circus to the White House.

112
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,051
<i>I mean in terms</i>
<i>of a statement.</i>

113
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,211
We're drafting one.
Short and sweet.

114
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,650
<i>Forgive me, Frank,</i>
<i>but you know I have to ask.</i>

115
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,731
If it were true,
I would tell you, sir.

116
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,211
<i>Would you like me to go on</i>
<i>record? Say I stand beside--</i>

117
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:54,731
No, no, no. I appreciate that,
Mr. President, but you shouldn't

118
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:57,250
dirty your hands
with this sort of garbage.

119
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,970
If the press corners you, just tell them
you don't engage in gossip mongering.

120
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,491
Sir, it seems Mr. Galloway
is about to appear on television.

121
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,531
<i>Go. Let me know if there's</i>
<i>anything I can do.</i>

122
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:10,211
Thank you, sir.

123
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,770
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>I have very little to say.</i>

124
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,570
<i>Only that I never had any</i>
<i>romantic involvement</i>

125
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,370
<i>with Claire Underwood,</i>
<i>and that I did not take</i>

126
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,570
<i>the photograph printed</i>
<i>in the</i> DC Daily.

127
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,691
<i>I'm sorry that the vice</i>
<i>president and his wife</i>

128
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,811
<i>have to go through</i>
<i>this ridiculous ordeal.</i>

129
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:29,651
<i>And I would ask that the media leave
both my fiancée and me out of it.</i>

130
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,010
<i>Thank you.</i>

131
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,850
You'll be ready
in an hour?

132
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,730
- Yes. We'll be ready.
- Uh...

133
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,170
You might want to change
into something more...

134
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,011
- Conservative?
- Uh, yes.

135
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:41,251
I'm gonna go throw
the hounds a bone.

136
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:48,090
- I know it's demeaning...
- Not another word.

137
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,050
I should've been
more careful.

138
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,770
We'll put this behind us,
just like we've always done.

139
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,810
- Part of me wishes...
- What?

140
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,571
That you'd be more upset.

141
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,051
Tusk came after you
because of me.

142
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,650
It's you who
should be upset.

143
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:15,491
Wasted energy, isn't it?

144
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,490
For both of us.

145
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,131
Shall we rehearse?

146
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,450
- I don't need your help.
- This ain't a handout.

147
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,011
You have to pay me back
over time. Work for it.

148
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:33,291
Work for you?

149
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,491
I'm gonna get the
house either way.

150
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,530
Whether you choose
to live in it is up to you.

151
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,450
Yeah, just what I need.
You in the easy chair,

152
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,451
laying into me every time
I come in and out the door.

153
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:46,690
The place is for you and DeShawn.
I'm gonna be at my own apartment.

154
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,651
You sure this nigga ain't
just sellin' you smoke?

155
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:53,330
Says it right in the contract,
95 Gs no matter what.

156
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:58,051
I don't know, man.

157
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,411
I mean, five years I don't see you,
then you come knockin' on the door,

158
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:03,290
- talking about you got 95 Gs?
- Your choice.

159
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,571
You didn't want me
to visit you no more in jail

160
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,770
- and you didn't want to see me after.
- Still don't wanna see you.

161
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,210
Well, here I am.

162
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,770
Get the fuck outta here,
old man.

163
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,010
You listen to me, boy.

164
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,930
I never had nothing
to give you.

165
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,930
I didn't have no money,
and you didn't want whatever I had.

166
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,291
But we talking
about a house.

167
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:29,050
DeShawn deserves to live better
than in a place like this.

168
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,491
This ain't about him.
It's about you.

169
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,610
You know where to find me.

170
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,370
See you, kid.

171
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,051
- Less than 30 minutes.
- Are they going to deny?

172
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:48,450
I'm gonna let the vice president
and his wife speak for themselves.

173
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,970
- Have they been in contact
with Mr. Galloway? - No, they haven't.

174
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Why has it taken them
almost a full day to respond?

175
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,850
I'm sure you can understand they
wanted to consult with legal counsel first

176
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,371
regarding defamation
and slander.

177
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:00,370
You're saying they
will deny the affair.

178
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,810
I'm saying they'll
be out here in 30 minutes

179
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,410
and you can quote them
instead of me.

180
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,890
Thank you all very much
for your patience.

181
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,410
- I hate this.
- What, waiting?

182
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,730
No, the affair. It's bullshit.
I feel like a tabloid hack.

183
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,890
You'd rather be stuck
at the White House all day?

184
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,651
- Fuck this.
- Where are you going?

185
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:22,970
To do something
meaningful with my time.

186
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,329
Hey, I need you to book me
a flight to St. Louis.

187
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,051
Tonight, if you
can find something.

188
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:44,410
No Q&A, so don't even try.
Behave yourselves, people.

189
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:52,811
I find it very painful
that anyone would suggest

190
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:57,570
I'm capable of being unfaithful to
my husband, whom I love dearly.

191
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,531
<i>I've known Adam Galloway</i>
<i>for years. We both have.</i>

192
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,530
<i>When I ran the</i>
<i>Clean Water Initiative,</i>

193
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,770
<i>I commissioned him to do</i>
<i>a series of photographs</i>

194
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,571
for the marketing campaign.
And he was extremely generous

195
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:12,610
by donating work for our
fund-raising auctions.

196
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,050
So I'm not sure why he would
deny taking the photograph.

197
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:22,650
<i>I love Adam's work, so I asked
him to take this portrait.</i>

198
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,651
We did it here, at the house. Francis
was there during the shoot.

199
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:31,689
It was a birthday present. Claire asked me
what sort of portrait I wanted,

200
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,571
and I said I want
one of her sleeping,

201
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:37,330
<i>because she's so very beautiful</i>
<i>when she's sleeping.</i>

202
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,650
<i>It hangs in my office</i>
<i>on the second floor.</i>

203
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,810
They're fucking lying.

204
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,530
<i>So I can only assume that Adam</i>
<i>was intimidated by the media attention,</i>

205
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,771
<i>- and he needed to distance himself.</i>
- What?

206
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:52,970
<i>But really, all we have here</i>
<i>is a very talented photographer</i>

207
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,170
<i>- and a prized possession. Thank you
all very much.</i> <i>- Thank you.</i>

208
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,810
Because it would've seemed too clean
otherwise, like we were--

209
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,290
<i>You made me</i>
<i>look like an idiot.</i>

210
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,931
If we had the same story, the media
would assume we were coordinating.

211
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:13,009
- It needed to look messier.
<i>- This was supposed to go away, Claire.</i>

212
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:15,651
I've got twice as much press
outside the building now.

213
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,890
<i>- Adam...</i>
- I've gotta keep the lights off

214
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,730
'cause they're on the roof
across the street trying to film us inside.

215
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,690
You just need to confirm
that you took the photo for us.

216
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,490
Confirm our version.
Say you lied because you were scared.

217
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,370
I don't know why you didn't just tell me
this is what you were intending to do.

218
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,690
<i>Because I know you, and you
would've refused. You have too much pride.</i>

219
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,771
- I don't want to speak to the press again.
<i>- Listen.</i>

220
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,290
<i>If you say nothing, they're not going</i>
<i>to leave you alone.</i>

221
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,411
<i>They will just camp out</i>
<i>for weeks on end--</i>

222
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,730
This is... it feels wrong,
Claire. It feels...

223
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,250
I'm sorry I lied.

224
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,771
<i>I wasn't trying to be</i>
<i>manipulative--</i>

225
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:59,250
- I have to go.
- Adam? Adam?

226
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:04,210
I think he'll
do the right thing.

227
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,130
I don't know. I hope so.

228
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,170
- Cigarette?
- No. I'm gonna turn in.

229
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,490
Wake me if he goes on TV.

230
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,210
- <i> Sir.</i>

231
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,970
- Doug, why don't you and Seth come over?
-<i> Yes, sir.</i>

232
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,491
Should we consider a lawsuit
against the paper?

233
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,770
- Show we won't tolerate this
sort of gossip? - They won't settle.

234
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,290
They'll fight it in the courts because
it'll generate more news.

235
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,530
And what about the president?
He offered to say something.

236
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,490
- Draws attention.
- President isn't a bad idea,

237
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,011
if we phrase
a statement for him.

238
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,170
He becomes the headline.

239
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,370
We can't control
his press operation.

240
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,810
If we coordinate
with them--

241
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,050
Coordination looks bad.

242
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,010
So it's your job
to conceal it.

243
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,410
If Seth doesn't think the president
should make a comment,

244
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,130
we should defer to his judgment.
I'm gonna get another beer.

245
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,330
- I can go grab you one.
- No. I feel like stretching my legs.

246
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,130
- Doug, Diet Coke?
- I'm fine, thank you, sir.

247
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,410
- Seth, a beer?
- I have to drive, but thanks.

248
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,490
I'll be right back.

249
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,170
- Watch yourself.
- What do you mean?

250
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,090
Connor was an easy target,
but I'm not going anywhere.

251
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,970
Look, Doug,
I'm grateful just to be here.

252
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,050
You think I've survived
with the vice president

253
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,490
so long by being blind?

254
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,050
Upward mobility has
a ceiling with the Underwoods.

255
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,650
- I'm the ceiling.
- Understood.

256
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,730
- What else have you got on them?
- Nothing.

257
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,250
You fork over the journal without a backup
plan for a rainy day? I don't think so.

258
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,130
I had one hand and I played it.
I don't press my luck.

259
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,170
- You can't expect me to believe you.
- I don't.

260
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,450
I wouldn't if I were you.
But I'm telling the truth.

261
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,250
A little sibling rivalry isn't such a bad
thing, especially between adopted boys.

262
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,250
They either push each other
to be the best versions of themselves,

263
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,490
or one of them gets booted
back to the orphanage.

264
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,530
You're in my house.
You drink if I drink.

265
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,090
One Diet Coke for you,
and one beer for you.

266
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,850
Thank you, sir.

267
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,450
Oh, darling,
what a mess.

268
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,930
Sweetheart.
How are you holding up?

269
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,250
The press have been
harassing us the past two days.

270
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,930
Yeah, we barely made it out
of the building without being trampled.

271
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,770
- Oh, how awful.
- You said someone was here to see me?

272
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,890
- He's in my office.
- Did he tell you who he was?

273
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,290
I didn't want to say over the phone.
You never know, these days.

274
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,490
He says he used
to work for the Underwoods.

275
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:44,131
- Who?
- Your assistant.

276
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,249
- No, she would never--
- She would and she did.

277
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:49,650
- Why are you doing this?
- Not me. The man I work for.

278
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,370
- And who is that?
- That doesn't concern you.

279
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,250
This is my life
you're fucking with.

280
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,810
You and I are just
pawns, Mr. Galloway.

281
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,610
- You should leave.
- We need more...

282
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,810
...to prove the affair happened.
Another photograph.

283
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,490
Thirty seconds,
you better be out the door.

284
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,890
I'm not going anywhere.

285
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,410
You recognize
the country code?

286
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,571
And the city code is Bogotá.

287
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,810
Is it still ringing?

288
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,730
- Marshall!
- Hey, Pops.

289
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,930
Man, never seen it like this before.
The line's down the block.

290
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,530
Something else, ain't it?

291
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,490
Looks like you could
use some help.

292
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,770
Got a extra apron
in the back.

293
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,210
Let's go!

294
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,329
<i>She</i>
<i>refuses to leave the lobby.</i>

295
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,930
What's her name?

296
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,650
<i>Ayla Sayyad,</i>
Wall Street Telegraph.

297
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,610
<i>She's part of the</i>
<i>vice president's press corps.</i>

298
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,370
Oh, yeah.

299
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,610
Send her up.

300
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,410
I appreciate it,
Tricia, but I'm fine.

301
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,930
This whole thing will blow over
in a day or so, and I'll...

302
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,130
Can you hold on one second?

303
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,249
- The<i> Daily.</i> They called for a comment.
- Did Adam speak with them?

304
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:22,850
Yes, but not what we told him
to say. He sent them this.

305
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,250
Tricia, can I call you back?

306
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,889
- Is that you?
- No.

307
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,089
Because he's saying it is.

308
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,769
- It might be.
- Mrs. Underwood.

309
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,690
I mean, it could be, yes.

310
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,729
It probably is.

311
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:42,690
I asked you about
any vulnerabilities.

312
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,770
I didn't know he took this.

313
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,209
You have short hair in the picture.
You said it ended over two years ago.

314
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,929
Well, I visited
him last fall.

315
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,610
Does anyone else know?
Did anyone see you there?

316
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,090
He had friends over,
to his apartment.

317
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,890
Christ.

318
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,650
But we've said
that he's a friend.

319
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,091
There's nothing wrong
with me visiting him, being at a party.

320
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:09,090
There is if this photo
is on the front page of the<i> Daily.</i>

321
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,970
Politics and business are intertwined
in China, as I'm sure you know.

322
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,490
It's not uncommon to partner with someone
who can ensure Beijing's approval.

323
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,730
So you needed his
political influence.

324
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,090
All this is moot.
Our venture fell through.

325
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,490
Right after the Port Jefferson
Bridge was approved.

326
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,370
Well, I had nothing to do
with that project.

327
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,289
- Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.
- No, but Wu Bin Yang did.

328
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,130
He's Feng's biggest
rival in Beijing.

329
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,810
Well, it looks like I shouldn't be schooling
you on Chinese politics.

330
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,889
You know far more than I.

331
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,649
You used the word "intertwined."

332
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:52,369
That's the sense I'm getting
from all of this.

333
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:55,810
The samarium subsidy,
the Chinese refinery, the bridge,

334
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,090
- your friendship with the president...
- Who sent you?

335
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,370
Who sent me?

336
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,290
When you're as rich as I am,
you're always a target.

337
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,730
- Nobody sent me.
- You're here... in St. Louis.

338
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,291
Instead of covering
the vice president and his wife.

339
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,369
My gut says there's more to
Xander Feng than has been reported.

340
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,570
It's a far better use of my time
than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.

341
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,209
It's not real news.

342
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:32,330
You miss Tehran. I read some of your
work while you were in the waiting area.

343
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,290
- It started to get too dangerous.
- Ooh! Yeah.

344
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,050
Not the best place to be when you
want to get married and start a family.

345
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,890
- Or if you're Jewish.
- That too.

346
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,850
My wife got this for me

347
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,850
when she visited there
before the revolution.

348
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,330
- It's beautiful.
- Sixteenth century.

349
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,889
It, um, broke when it was
being shipped, into a thousand pieces.

350
00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:00,529
It took specialists
over a year

351
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,170
to restore it.

352
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,850
- Here, I want you to have it.
- I can't accept gifts.

353
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,890
No, no. Not as a gift. No.

354
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,370
As a reminder of how hard it can
be to put something back together again

355
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,690
once it's been crushed.

356
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,450
If you're going to threaten me, you don't
have to go to the trouble of veiling it.

357
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,610
I don't usually do interviews
with reporters. They're parasites.

358
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,010
Usually interested in just finding
a way to knock me down a peg.

359
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,690
Invariably, what
they write is inaccurate.

360
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,690
And when that happens,
I have no choice but to retaliate.

361
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,089
America can be just
as dangerous as Iran, Ms. Sayyad.

362
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,249
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Tusk.

363
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,650
Travel safe back
to Washington.

364
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,049
Get Remy on the line.

365
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,250
<i>- Remy's on line two.</i>
- Remy.

366
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,370
Let's not hold back on the other thing.
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.

367
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,290
Best day yet.

368
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,409
You gotta get
a safe or something.

369
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,969
Or maybe one of those,
uh, pickup services.

370
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,010
That's too much money to be
carrying around at night.

371
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,490
I can handle myself.

372
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,090
There ain't nobody can handle
a Glock to the face.

373
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,210
Unless you got
one yourself.

374
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,329
My days of packin'
are long gone.

375
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:50,690
There. Take mine.
I got one at home.

376
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,450
What the fuck you doin'
bringin' that thing in here?

377
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,330
Oh, it's just
for protection, man.

378
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,169
I don't know what you doing
with it anyway.

379
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,530
What about your parole?

380
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,929
I'm a lot more worried
about niggas

381
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,090
in my building
than some parole officer.

382
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,489
- All right, sit down.
- See, man?

383
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:05,409
This is what I'm
talkin' about, man.

384
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:07,130
You being all righteous
and judgin' me and shit.

385
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,089
Do me a favor and just
sit down. Sit down now.

386
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,490
Look.

387
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,570
We got us a good thing,
potentially.

388
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,170
Maybe nothin' comes of it,
but maybe something does.

389
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,529
If the Joint works out,
maybe one day you can be the manager.

390
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,810
Shit, if it blows up, you can
run the whole fuckin' franchise.

391
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,929
But that means
you gotta be careful.

392
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:44,049
That means you cannot
be sent back inside.

393
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:49,210
We gotta follow the rules.
Hear me?

394
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,570
- All right.
- You gonna get rid of that thing?

395
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,249
- Yeah.
- All right.

396
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:03,210
Now that's what's being a man.

397
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,330
I'll need you to cut it.

398
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,970
How short?

399
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,729
This short.

400
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:19,010
I have a modeling career.
If I cut it that short--

401
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,810
If you actually
had a modeling career,

402
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,210
I would be speaking
to your agency,

403
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,329
and not sitting
in your apartment.

404
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:29,410
- Do you want this job or not?
- OK, yeah.

405
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,889
- I can cut it.
- All right.

406
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:37,448
And before we go to the studio,
I need to see how well-spoken you are.

407
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:39,449
Why does that matter?

408
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:43,770
Because you're gonna be on
every news channel in America.

409
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,050
Wait, what's this for?

410
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:48,968
Read this.

411
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,570
Those exact words.

412
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:58,289
Read 'em. If you're good,
you'll memorize them.

413
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,809
My name is Stephanie Daldry.

414
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,449
I am a professional model.

415
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:09,050
"Freddy Hayes
was convicted in 1982

416
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,209
for sticking up a convenience
store in Columbia Heights.

417
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:16,570
During a high-speed pursuit, Hayes lost
control and crashed into another vehicle,

418
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,449
killing an elderly couple.

419
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:22,289
He avoided manslaughter charges
by pleading guilty to armed robbery.

420
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,330
He served nine years.

421
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,690
In 1992, he opened
Freddy's BBQ Joint,

422
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,249
a small restaurant
specializing in ribs,

423
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:35,329
frequented by
Vice President Frank Underwood."

424
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,650
- Did you know?
- No, I didn't.

425
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,450
- You think it's Tusk?
- Who else?

426
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,809
- Who are you texting?
- Seth.

427
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,810
All I want to do
is make a short statement.

428
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,529
Freddy did his time, he's been
an upstanding citizen for 20 years.

429
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:03,889
He's a convicted felon
who killed two senior citizens.

430
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:06,129
- By accident.
- That's beside the point.

431
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:07,769
I'm not gonna
hang him out to dry.

432
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,769
If the Galloway story wasn't
happening, I'd say it's fine.

433
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,410
But it's too
risky right now.

434
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,170
Think of how this is shaping up.

435
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,090
A vice president whose wife
cheats on him

436
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,850
and who is friendly
with a former gangbanger?

437
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,009
There is no way you win,
standing up for this guy.

438
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:23,329
He's about to
start a franchise.

439
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,410
I will not have it jeopardized
because Tusk decided--

440
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,049
It's more than just Freddy, sir.
I did some digging.

441
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:31,769
His son did time for
narcotics, trafficking, distribution--

442
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,289
- I've never met his son.
- Let's hold off and tackle--

443
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:36,729
No. I want you to organize
a press avail tomorrow morning.

444
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,369
Have Freddy brought over here.
Bring him through the back.

445
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,130
Yes, sir.

446
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,329
I won't leave one of my own
bleeding on the field.

447
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:53,290
If you're gonna have
the Washington Redskins,

448
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,049
then you're gonna have
to have the New York Knickers.

449
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,769
Pops, you ain't
even deep like that.

450
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:01,489
Yo, back off, man. Yo, yo, yo,
yo! Back the fuck off.

451
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,769
- Darnell, just ignore them.
- You think I'm fucking around?

452
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,329
Darnell, ignore them!
Ignore 'em.

453
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,089
They can't take our pictures
if we don't want them to.

454
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:09,409
- Sure as hell can.
- What you say?

455
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:10,410
The First fuckin' Amendment.

456
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,970
You gonna read me the

457
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,649
Constitution now, motherfucker?

458
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:15,089
- Let's go on inside.
- I ain't done with this asshole.

459
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,369
Hey, don't touch me.

460
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:17,969
Oh, but you can
get all up in my face

461
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,129
but I can't get up in yours?

462
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:20,249
Listen to your daddy
and chill out.

463
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:21,209
- Let's go.
- Don't push me.

464
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:22,809
I will fuck you up.

465
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:25,049
- You think I'm scared of you?
- You scared of this?

466
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,130
Darnell! Parole!

467
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,489
<i>Can you tell me your</i>
<i>name, please?</i>

468
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:36,969
<i>Stephanie Daldry.</i>

469
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:38,609
<i>I'm a professional model.</i>

470
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,290
<i>And this is you in this</i>
<i>photo on the right?</i>

471
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,130
<i>- Yes, that's correct. - We shot this photo
yesterday with Ms. Daldry.</i>

472
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,170
<i>So you're suggesting that</i>
<i>Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?</i>

473
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,529
<i>I don't know anything about professional
photography, I'm just a flack.</i>

474
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,210
<i>But if we can create a fake</i>
<i>in less than 24 hours,</i>

475
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,889
<i>I think an expert photographer</i>
<i>like Adam Galloway--</i>

476
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:01,730
<i>Those are serious allegations, especially given
that Mr. Galloway vehemently denies it.</i>

477
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,810
<i>I'm not surprised</i>
<i>he's denying.</i>

478
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,969
<i>Ultimately, though, it's gonna be</i>
<i>your word against his.</i>

479
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,490
<i>Not my word.</i>

480
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,250
<i>The vice president</i>
<i>of the United States'.</i>

481
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,450
<i>It's his word versus that</i>
<i>of a potentially troubled man.</i>

482
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,410
<i>- Troubled?</i>
<i>- Potentially.</i>

483
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,010
<i>Or maybe he has a motive.</i>

484
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,970
<i>What motive</i>
<i>could Mr. Galloway</i>

485
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,289
<i>possibly have</i>
<i>for a fake photo?</i>

486
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:21,689
<i>- What would he get out of it?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

487
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,969
<i>My job is to separate fact from
fiction, just like yours is, Candy.</i>

488
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:29,209
<i>But maybe fact and fiction don't matter
as much to the artistic sensibility.</i>

489
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:31,169
<i>Maybe the lines</i>
<i>are blurred for him.</i>

490
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:34,009
<i>This is not a man who</i>
<i>stages fictitious scenarios.</i>

491
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,009
<i>Like I said, the art stuff, it's over
my head. And you may be right.</i>

492
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,970
<i>But I would hate</i>
<i>to think that Mr. Galloway</i>

493
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,849
<i>was doing this</i>
<i>just for publicity.</i>

494
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,449
<i>You think it's</i>
<i>a publicity stunt.</i>

495
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:45,050
Come on in.

496
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,890
- Sir?
- Is Freddy on his way?

497
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,169
There was an incident
with his son.

498
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:51,609
- What happened?
- He's in custody for threatening

499
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:55,809
- a photographer with a firearm.
- Jesus.

500
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,809
- Where is Freddy now?
- He's at home.

501
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:01,370
- I have to go see him.
- That's the projects, sir.

502
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,569
I don't care, you figure it out,
and the press can't know.

503
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,449
Yes, sir.

504
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,289
- Francis, you know I love Freddy...
- I'm going.

505
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:12,770
Freddy is dangerous
because you care too much.

506
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,089
- When we care too much, it blinds us.
- What Tusk did is cheap.

507
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,530
And you're letting it get to you,
which is exactly what he wants.

508
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,729
- If I ignore this, if I do nothing--
- It's not nothing.

509
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:24,849
Staying focused
requires strength.

510
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,449
- You want me to make something?
- You go ahead. I'm not hungry.

511
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:41,690
You should eat.

512
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,290
I'm sorry. You didn't ask for
this. It's not fair to you.

513
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,050
All I want is to be done with it.
For my father to be all right.

514
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,889
If I thought there
was any other way, that...

515
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:54,849
I didn't want to take
the chance that he would--

516
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:57,610
- I know.
- These people.

517
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,890
I always knew they
were ruthless, but...

518
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,489
We're caged up in here like animals.
They're painting me as some sort of...

519
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:09,570
And your family...
It's inhuman.

520
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,409
They're fucking inhuman.

521
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:13,930
Getting worked up isn't
going to change anything.

522
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,609
Let me.

523
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,089
Hello?

524
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:56,330
- Hey, Frank.
- I'm fine.

525
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,689
- Thanks for dropping by.
- How you holdin' up?

526
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,769
I been better.

527
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,929
Ain't never seen you
without a suit before.

528
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,449
We didn't want
to draw too much attention.

529
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:11,489
Well, this is it, my castle.

530
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,730
Ain't as big as yours,
but it'll do the job.

531
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,129
- Blind Willie.
- Are you a blues fan?

532
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,609
"Dark Was the Night."
Gets me every time.

533
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:24,489
Man, you shoulda
told me that years ago.

534
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:28,130
I can jam, talking about
some blues all day long.

535
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,449
Check this out. Original 78.

536
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:33,489
You want something?
Water? Iced tea?

537
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:36,089
I'd like some iced tea,
thank you.

538
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,370
- How's your son?
- They set the bail at 60 grand.

539
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,330
- Jesus.
- How's your wife doing?

540
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,210
Oh, Claire's got a suit
of armor three inches thick.

541
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,009
We'll get through
all this garbage.

542
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:57,770
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.

543
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,249
Whoever it is, they done stepped on
the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.

544
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:07,490
That's why I'm here, Freddy.

545
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,889
I have to distance
myself from you.

546
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,890
I need to make sure you're not going to
play up what good friends we've been.

547
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:26,128
That you've been to my office,
that you've cooked dinner at my home,

548
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:28,490
or that the president was there.

549
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,650
We can't drag him
into anything.

550
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:36,688
And I won't be coming in
for ribs anymore.

551
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:41,089
With all that's going on,
we can't add fuel to the fire.

552
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,849
You couldn't if you wanted to.

553
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:48,489
I'm selling it.

554
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,329
- Selling the Joint?
- That's right.

555
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:55,209
- What are you talking about?
- The franchise thing, with the sauce.

556
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,808
My business partner's
pullin' out.

557
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:02,689
Say them white folks down in Silver Spring
don't wanna go to no place run by thugs.

558
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:05,529
- Why do you have to sell yours?
- Darnell's bail.

559
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,089
Well, doesn't that guy have to give
you a hundred grand, regardless?

560
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:13,770
I ain't getting shit.
There's a morality clause in the contract.

561
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,610
But he's gonna pay me
45 thou for the storefront.

562
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,729
That, with what little I got
saved, I can pay that bond.

563
00:35:21,729 --> 00:35:25,130
- You can't sell Freddy's.
- He's already drawin' up the papers.

564
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,210
- Let me help you with the money.
- Nah, Frank.

565
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,729
We'll make it a loan.
You can pay me back.

566
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,409
- Not gonna happen.
- Don't be prideful.

567
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:31,769
- Frank.
- Please, let me help.

568
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,529
I ain't takin' your guilt money.

569
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:44,369
When I was bangin',
we used to clear 60 Gs a month.

570
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,450
I seen guys shot down
execution-style.

571
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,529
I didn't give a shit.

572
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:52,849
Then I got caught.

573
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,729
Darnell was
born my first year in.

574
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:58,529
Never saw him once,
not even a picture.

575
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:03,849
I can't take
back the bad I done.

576
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,848
All I can do is to make my own way,
like I been doin'. You understand.

577
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,410
Ain't pride, Frank.

578
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,009
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

579
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:39,129
You was a good
customer, that's it.

580
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:43,568
You ain't gotta pretend
to be my friend.

581
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:49,089
- You take care of yourself, Freddy.
- You too, Frank.

582
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:01,329
Do you think I'm a hypocrite?

583
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,130
Well, you should.

584
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,409
I wouldn't disagree with you.

585
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:12,810
The road to power is paved
with hypocrisy...

586
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,009
...and casualties.

587
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,088
Never regret.

588
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:44,848
This way.

589
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:55,489
Have a seat, Adam.

590
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,088
You left your phone at home,
as you were asked?

591
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:07,689
- Yeah. - And what did you tell
your fiancée exactly?

592
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:10,529
That I'd be gone for a while.
She doesn't know where.

593
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:13,369
And what will she say
if someone checks in on her?

594
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:15,049
- What is this?
- What will she say?

595
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:17,249
Francis.

596
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:20,289
- We need to work together now.
- I tried. You lied to me.

597
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:22,609
And I explained to you
why that was necessary.

598
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:25,249
You didn't follow
my instructions.

599
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,409
Do you know
who Remy Danton is?

600
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,729
He approached you?

601
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:37,290
Inez's father is a human
rights activist in Bogotá.

602
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,409
The government has charged him
with treason for working with the rebels.

603
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,009
They're going
for the death penalty,

604
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:45,769
and Danton said they
have the judge in their pocket.

605
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:48,129
- You should have come to us.
- Well, I said I would.

606
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:51,569
- Danton said you couldn't do anything.
- He's wrong.

607
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:54,169
- I wasn't gonna take any chances.
- Has he done what

608
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:56,529
- the government's claiming?
- No. They're made-up charges.

609
00:38:56,529 --> 00:39:00,089
He's a journalist documenting
atrocities in the Darien Gap.

610
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,169
- I can get the charges dropped.
- Why should I trust you?

611
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:05,328
Because the secretary of state
is a good friend of mine.

612
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:08,929
- And you don't have any other choice.
- We're not your chess pieces.

613
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,369
And this isn't a game,
Mr. Galloway.

614
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:12,088
Then why are you
toying with us?

615
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:13,409
We are trying to help.

616
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:14,928
That's a fucking joke,
Claire.

617
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:18,128
Do not talk
to my wife that way.

618
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:21,089
Oh, your wife?
What does that even mean to you?

619
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:24,289
Do not mistake any history
you have shared

620
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:27,689
for the slightest understanding
of what our marriage is,

621
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:32,089
or how insignificant
you are in comparison.

622
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:40,088
- Can you give us a few minutes?
- I'm gonna go call Cathy.

623
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:48,449
Forget my career and my reputation.
I want to marry this woman, Claire.

624
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:50,409
We're going to make
this disappear.

625
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:53,129
Because of you, I will always be the man
who placed her father in danger.

626
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,728
- I can never erase that.
- I'm sorry it's come to this.

627
00:39:55,728 --> 00:40:00,129
I'm sorry I ever met you.
All you've ever done is cause me pain.

628
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,008
Now you're fucking with my life
and the life of the woman

629
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,969
that I love more
than I ever loved you.

630
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,409
You'll be driven
back to New York tonight.

631
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,129
In the morning, you'll make a statement
saying this was a publicity stunt,

632
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:17,648
and that the value of your work had been
stagnating and you wanted to revive--

633
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,689
- No, Claire. I won't do that.
- Yes, you will.

634
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:23,248
- How about I tell the press--
- Adam, shut up!

635
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:26,049
That you wanted the attention,
then you got cold feet,

636
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,569
denied it, then you
changed your mind again.

637
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:31,369
And that you faked the shower
photo and you're coming clean.

638
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:36,009
- Is that clear?
- I'm not part of this world.

639
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:39,888
I didn't sign up for it.
I have no interest in it.

640
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:43,009
We're giving you an out, Adam.

641
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:46,208
And if you choose
not to take it,

642
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,849
I will bury you.

643
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:54,409
I've never hated anyone before.

644
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:59,088
Now I know what that feels like.

645
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:05,408
It's a terrible feeling,
isn't it?

646
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:31,529
- End call.
<i>-  Call ended.</i>

647
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:36,208
Call Raymond Tusk.

648
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,729
<i>No answer at his place.</i>

649
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,489
Is it a matter of more money?

650
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:42,928
<i>Secretary Durant has already</i>
<i>called President Moreno.</i>

651
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:44,529
So we need to move quickly.

652
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:46,729
<i>The minister of foreign affairs</i>
<i>is involved now.</i>

653
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,769
<i>The judge isn't gonna rush a conviction</i>
<i>in less than 12 hours.</i>

654
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:51,728
Well, who do we know
who has the minister's ear?

655
00:41:51,728 --> 00:41:54,328
Nobody who can trump
President Moreno,

656
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,929
and he's very sensitive
to Durant's views on human rights.

657
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:00,408
- Are you giving up on this?
-<i> No, just being realistic.</i>

658
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:03,329
- Work on Moreno, then.
- We'll start leaving footprints.

659
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:05,289
<i>- Quiet.</i>
- Excuse me?

660
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,329
- Oh. Not you, my birds.
<i>- I think we need to be prepared</i>

661
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:11,369
<i>for the possibility that we can't follow</i>
<i>through with our threat.</i>

662
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,968
I am hearing excuses,
not solutions.

663
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:18,049
My hands are tied. I can't circumvent
the entire US State Department.

664
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:20,368
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I hired you to destroy Frank.</i>

665
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:22,369
- You're failing.
<i>- Look, Raymond,</i>

666
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:24,449
<i>I'm your lobbyist,</i>
<i>not your henchman.</i>

667
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:25,769
I don't employ lobbyists.

668
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:27,088
<i>I employ people</i>

669
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:28,489
<i>who can be useful to me.</i>

670
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:31,088
And you are proving otherwise.
Quiet now.

671
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:33,529
- I'll figure something out.
-<i> Soon.</i>

672
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,368
OK, that's good.

673
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:51,928
You don't have to do this.

674
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:54,089
Yeah, I do.

675
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:56,329
The charges are dropped.

676
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,209
They lied to you.
You can lie to them.

677
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:02,049
New charges can always be filed.
It's not worth the risk.

678
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,848
OK.

679
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:12,528
Are you disappointed in me?

680
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:15,609
Let's just get it over with.

681
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:25,528
OK, go ahead.

682
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:28,408
I'd like to make a statement.

683
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:30,288
There will be a little cleanup,
some folks who will want

684
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:33,289
to linger on the story, but we're
over the hump, I'd say.

685
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:35,009
So we can leave the house now?

686
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:37,248
The sooner you get back to
normal work, the better.

687
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,369
All the meetings I had to cancel, let's
find a way to get them back on the books.

688
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,168
- Yes, sir. - I need to push
ahead with the assault bill.

689
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:44,208
We've got your Matt Bai
interview lined up for tomorrow,

690
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,409
- but I think that--
- Maybe we should hold off on Bai

691
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:50,089
- till after things quiet down.
- That's exactly what I was gonna suggest.

692
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:53,568
- Doug is right.
- OK, let's get going.

693
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:55,488
I'll meet you in the car.

694
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,408
He's done a good job
handling all this.

695
00:43:59,408 --> 00:44:02,569
- Yes, he has.
- Should we have any more concerns?

696
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:06,048
- He claims he doesn't have anything else.
- Do you believe him?

697
00:44:06,048 --> 00:44:08,129
I wouldn't go that far.

698
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:10,688
- Keep an eye on him.
- I plan to.

699
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:14,089
As for Raymond, we have to strike
back hard and fast.

700
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:16,129
I want him obliterated.

701
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:18,328
More than that.

702
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:21,889
Let's make him suffer.

703
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:26,249
I don't know whether
to be proud or terrified.

704
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:29,088
Perhaps both.

705
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:58,128
Wish I could do more.

706
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:02,968
- What you gonna do with her?
- I don't know yet.

707
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:07,448
Probably have to knock it down.
It's worth more as an empty lot.

708
00:45:07,448 --> 00:45:10,849
Is there anything else you wanna take?
A memento or something?

709
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,968
Nah.

710
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:17,488
I ain't one
for lookin' back.

711
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:19,768
Eyes ahead.

712
00:45:20,928 --> 00:45:22,089
Good luck, Freddy.

713
