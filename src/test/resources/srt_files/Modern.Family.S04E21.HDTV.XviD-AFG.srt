1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,436
- Shh.
- I didn't say anything.

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:05,836
- Stop talking.
- That's talking.

3
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:08,894
- Do you think she's asleep yet? - I'm on
the same side of the door as you are.

4
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:10,094
- Stop talking.
- Cam.

5
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:11,844
Lily lost her first tooth today.

6
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,944
And she's very excited
about a visit from the tooth fairy.

7
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:19,244
When I had my first loose tooth,
my mama tied one end of the string to it,

8
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,644
and the other to the tail of a ***

9
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:23,296
fired off a 12-gauge shotgun,

10
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:25,084
and the cow went
running out of the room.

11
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:25,901
That never happened.

12
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,930
Tell that to the cow-shaped
hole in my bedroom wall.

13
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:30,643
Shh. Shh.

15
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:37,935
Gotcha!

16
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,089
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,896
You're not the tooth fairy.

18
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,809
N-no. But we just wanted
to see if she'd come yet.

19
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:47,667
No. She sure is
taking her sweet time.

20
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,316
- Maybe you should just go
back to sleep, sweetie... - Yeah.

21
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,203
- 'Cause it could take a while.
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:54,623
I've got nowhere to be.

23

24
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:08,980
Mom, I can't be late today.

25
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,602
Sanjay Patel and I
are dissecting a pig.

26
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,628
So sad what passes
for a date in your life.

27
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,397
- Haley. - He keeps asking me
to hand him all of the instruments.

28
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,101
He wants me to act like a nurse.

29
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:19,037
Now it sounds like
a date in Haley's life.

30
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,668
- Whoa.
-  Okay, before you say no...

31
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:22,271
- No.
- You haven't even seen it yet.

32
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:23,278
Mm, I'm sticking with "no."

33
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:24,518
It's for Luke's career day.

34
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,716
I thought I'd offer
the kids a chance

35
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:26,964
to put their face on my body.

36
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:27,540
- Ew.
- Mnh-mnh.

37
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,608
Ew. I just heard it, too.

38
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,881
How come you guys
never had a career day?

39
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,371
- Cutbacks.
- Nor'Easter.

40
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,706
Today I get to talk
about the love of my life...

41
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,639
Residential real estate.

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,812
He really doesn't hear it.

43
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:40,924
I wanna make Luke proud.

44
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,557
I wanna be his hero
like my dad was

45
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:44,832
when he talked to my class
about running a grocery store.

46
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,734
He came in with
two price guns in holsters

47
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,555
and marked our teacher at $1.29

48
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:50,871
before she knew what hit her.

49
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:52,931
I bet that produced
a lot of laughs.

50
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:53,827
Claire, please.

51
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,490
And Olivia Berman's mom

52
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,627
works in the rare books
department at the library.

53
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,394
Hope I get a chance
to pick that brain.

54
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,516
Looks like you got quite
the career day lineup.

55
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,359
So I guess they already got
a closet guy coming in, huh?

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,034
No. I didn't think
you'd wanna do it.

57
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:09,141
I don't, but you know,
I just feel bad for the kids.

58
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,366
A lot of interesting stories
in the closet biz.

59
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,382
Oh. Why have you never told us any?

60
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,348
Okay. Well, for example,
there was this guy...

61
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,457
- Must have had over a hundred hats...
- Yes?

62
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,094
And we had to fit them
in the closet.

63
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:22,891
Okay?

64
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:25,251
And we did.

65
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,694
All right. Maybe it's not
the most exciting career

66
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:30,109
in the world, but it pays the bills.

67
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,106
No one is complaining.

68
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,645
Were there other things
I'd rather do? Yes.

69
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,683
- But I had to make ends meet.
- What other things?

70
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:37,034
Well, I always wanted
to write thrillers.

71
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:39,787
- Like that hat story?
- Spy thrillers.

72
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:41,325
I've been kicking around
this character,

73
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,422
CIA Agent Chuck Stone,
who doesn't care

74
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,917
how much his antics annoy
the brass in Arlington.

75
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:47,195
Why didn't you ever try it?

76
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:48,826
I was busy with work and family.

77
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:50,862
I was gonna start writing
after my divorce,

78
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:53,304
but you know...
life got in the way.

79
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:56,380
Why do you point at me
when you say "life"? Am I "life"?

80
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:59,547
- I meant you keep my busy.
- You had a 3-hour nap on Sunday.

81
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:00,931
- I was tired.
- From what?

82
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,888
Your 2-hour nap on Saturday?

83
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:05,709
Jay, I've been with you
for five years,

84
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,013
and I've never heard you mention
anything about writing.

85
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:10,007
Hey. I bought a typewriter.

86
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:11,677
A typewriter?

87
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,245
When is your book signing?

88
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,212
1975?

89
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,737
It's a hell of a character.
They taught him how to kill,

90
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,437
but he never learned to love!

91
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,930
- No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait.
- Okay.

92
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,218
Daddies! Daddies!
The tooth fairy came.

93
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:29,143
- What? No way!
- Oh, that's so exciting!

94
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,286
What'd she bring you?

95
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,103
Well...

96
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,450
- Oh! Fairy dust. Nice touch.
- Ah.

97
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:37,011
- Oh, my gosh, it's a lot.
- Uh-huh.

98
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:38,414
Some stickers...

99
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:39,980
- Oh!
- Ah!

100
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:41,138
A toothbrush...

101
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,516
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

102
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,756
And a hundred dollar bill!

103
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,457
- What? Okay.
- Wow. Look at that.

104
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,713
I love the tooth fairy.

105
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:51,258
The tooth fairy gave
our daughter $100.

106
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:53,230
Does she not know that
the going rate for a tooth

107
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,862
is $5 at the most?

108
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,940
Well, obviously,
the tooth fairy made a mistake.

109
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:58,076
Maybe it's 'cause the tooth fairy

110
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,723
had a little too much
chardonnay last night.

111
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,495
I think the tooth fairy
can handle the chardonnay.

112
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:02,669
What I don't think she can handle

113
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,802
is criticizing someone who
made an honest mistake

114
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:05,873
in the dark of the night.

115
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:07,532
I'm gonna put this in my clutch.

116
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,463
I can't wait to tell
everyone at school!

117
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,225
Okay, we cannot be
the parents of a 6-year-old

118
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,376
who gets $100 from the tooth fairy.

119
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:17,423
It's bad enough we're the parents

120
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,883
of a 6-year-old with a clutch.

121
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,221
You know, that bag transitions
from day to night seamlessly,

122
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:24,549
and I no longer have to carry
crayons in my front pocket.

123
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,807
Can't have this argument again!

124
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:27,975
Thank you, Dr. Ann,

125
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,587
for showing us
how exciting and surprising

126
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:32,680
a real live therapy session can be.

127
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,197
I will hold on to this card.

128
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,023
Next up, we have Luke's dad,
Mr. Dunphy.

129
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:39,950
Hey. Thank you.

130
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:40,732
Mm-hmm.

131
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:42,693
Guess what?

132
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,517
I've been in your house
when you weren't home.

133
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,558
And yours.
And yours.

134
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,027
No, I'm not a burglar.
I'm a realtor.

135
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:53,614
Ho! Hey, sorry I'm late!

136
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,138
I just sold another mansion.

137
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:56,886
How you doin', honey?

138
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,850
History is full of great rivalries--

139
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,905
Athens and Sparta,
Kerrigan and Harding,

140
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,379
Phil Dunphy and Gil Thorpe.

141
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:06,214
In this scenario, he's the Tonya,
I'm the Nancy.

142
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,034
Pay attention, kids.

143
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:11,210
You're about to hear from
the number four realtor in town.

144
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,148
Anyway, uh, I'm not gonna
bore you guys with a lecture.

145
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,709
Instead, I'd like you to watch
as I converse with a young man

146
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,991
who's wondering
what to do with his life.

147
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,623
Hey, kid.

148
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,216
Hey, kid, up here! Up here!

149
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,881
Yo, dude! Whassup?

150
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,176
I'll tell you what's up.

151
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,909
I'm interested in helping you

152
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,098
by telling you all about
a career in real estate.

153
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:38,049
Real estate? Isn't that just
buying and selling houses?

154
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,548
I don't have time for that.
Epic fail.

155
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,589
Sounds like we need
to start at the beginning.

156
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,428
You see, real estate
is about people.

157
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:47,755
Pfft.

158
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,400
People?

159
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:51,860
Couldn't agree more, Phil.
Best part of our job

160
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,304
is putting the right person
in the right home.

161
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,798
- Gil...
- Matter of fact, last week,

162
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,767
- I put a "Spanish" couple
into a Spanish home. - Gil.

163
00:05:57,768 --> 00:05:59,901
A world without houses?
That's cray cray.

164
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,607
Okay. Okay.

165
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,354
Phil, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to screw up your little show.

166
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,031
I know timing is critical
on these things.

167
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,595
- Gil, please. - Believe me,
the last thing I want to do is...

168
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:09,401
Aw! You sold a house
to the channel 7 weatherman?

169
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,654
No. No.

170
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,454
But I did sell one to Kobe Bryant.

171
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,252
What?! Guess what? He's not
talking to you. He's talking to me.

172
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:17,352
And I have a very funny story, actually.

173
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:20,041
- A guy walks into... no.
- That's hilarious.

174
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,412
No! I haven't told it!

175
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,742
Okay, um... oh!

176
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:24,582
Uh...

177
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:27,760
Great throw. You were right.

178
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,584
- It is in my court.
- Ball's in your court!

179
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:32,104
But guess what-- 
it was me the whole time.

180
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:34,862
What?!

181
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:36,676
Come on, kids, come on.

182
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:40,292
Give it up! Give it up!
He tried.

183
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:42,339
I think we all know what
you were going for, Phil.

184
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,859
But I'm lookin' out here,
and I'm seeing some hungry kids.

185
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,948
Am I right?
That's why I brought plenty of...

186
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:48,681
Gil pickles!

187
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,450
Who wants a Gil pickle?
Come on. Let me see 'em.

188
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,911
All right. Come on. Grab one.

189
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,324
Gil pickles.

190
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,348
Genius.

191
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,983
So much better than
my Phil-low cases.

192
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,483
Claire wasn't a fan.

193
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:01,981
One of him in bed
is more than enough.

194
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,378
Do you hear that, ladies?

195
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,419
All right. Just hit "send."

196
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,427
Hey! You just sold a house!

197
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,602
And you're gonna be chasing
that high for the rest of your life.

198
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:19,935
Give her a round
of applause, everybody.

199
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:21,033
She just sold a house.

200
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,269
I wanna thank you kids
for having me here today.

201
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,456
And remember the three
rules of real estate--

202
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,914
Thorpe, Thorpe, Thorpe!

203
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:28,872
Okay.

204
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,768
Thank you, Mr. Thorpe.

205
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,123
It turns out we have
a little extra time.

206
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:34,660
- Uh, Mrs. Dunphy?
- Yes?

207
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,786
I'm sure the class
would love to hear from you.

208
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:38,703
Oh, no. I just came in
to help my husband.

209
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:39,922
I'm a...
I'm a stay-at-home mom.

210
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,546
I know. And that's
a very important job.

211
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,493
It is. Uh, yeah.

212
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:46,511
I can--I can do this for a minute.

213
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,441
Um, stay-at-home mom.

214
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,794
Uh, what that means
is I actually have

215
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:51,946
a whole bunch of different jobs.

216
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:54,405
I am a chauffeur, a chef,

217
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,241
uh, a house manager,

218
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,848
- a nurse.
- Is it what you always wanted to do?

219
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,811
No. Not exactly.

220
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:03,759
Uh, I went to college,
uh, to study marketing

221
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,288
and worked at one
of those big hotel companies.

222
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,508
But when my kids came along,
I just wanted to be there.

223
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,829
You know, wipe their noses
and change their diapers

224
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,100
and tuck 'em in at night.

225
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:14,919
Mom!

226
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,222
For the record,
I do all my own wiping.

227
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:18,971
So why haven't you
gone back to work?

228
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,799
I've done a few things lately.
I just redid a house,

229
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,487
and I ran for city council last year.

230
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:25,615
You're on the city council?

231
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,283
No. I-I didn't win.

232
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:28,859
- You lost?
- That's what "didn't win" means.

233
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:31,392
I... I thought I would be
going back to work

234
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:32,546
when the kids got older,

235
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:35,186
but it--it's not as easy
as you might think.

236
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:36,899
You know, people
aren't exactly lining up

237
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,262
to hire a woman who's almost 40

238
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:40,195
and has been out
of the job market for 15 years.

239
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,710
I thought you were 42.

240
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,243
That's almost 40, Luke.

241
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,018
My mom went back
to work when I was 4.

242
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,113
Oh, so there was no one at home
to teach you not to interrupt?

243
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:48,609
Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

244
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,615
Let me tell you something.

245
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,893
Stay-at-home moms are heroes.

246
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:53,717
- Yeah.
- They're the backbone of this country.

247
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:54,566
Thanks, Gil.

248
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,637
I mean, if I had to do that job,

249
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:58,049
- I'd probably drink myself
to death, honestly. - Ooh.

250
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,718
All right, let's give her
a round of applause, everybody.

251
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,417
Come on.

252
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,274
Oh, come on, you can do better
than that. Let me hear ya!

253
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,903
All right! All right!

254
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,614
All right, class dismissed.
Get out of here!

255
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:07,204
No!

256
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:09,114
No, no, no.

257
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,377
We have... guys,
we have three more hours.

258
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,413
- Here.
- My old typewriter.

259
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,486
You said you want to write.
Write.

260
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:20,669
Now? I've got a busy day.

261
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,748
I already called your office

262
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,088
and told them that you can't come in

263
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,678
to walk around for 20 minutes

264
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,248
saying to everyone,
"what's up, sport?"

265
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:28,870
I know this is your subtle little way

266
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,521
of saying you
don't think I can do it.

267
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:33,072
No. It's life getting out of the way.

268
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,245
Fine. I'm gonna take you
up on your little challenge,

269
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,182
but you should know this--

270
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,095
this behavior of yours
is not gonna fly

271
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:38,991
when you lose your looks.

272
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,236
Mm!

273
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,426
You're gonna be long gone by then.

274
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:49,598
- Hey.
- Mnh?

275
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,151
- Dunphy.
- Yeah? Oh.

276
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,608
- You okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

277
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,549
Don't let that little smart-ass
bother you, all right.

278
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,729
Have you seen her mother?
Does not age well.

279
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:00,910
Well, um, thanks
for rescuing me in there.

280
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:03,123
And tell Phil I'm sorry
if I threw him off in there.

281
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,353
I probably should learn just
to keep my big blowhole shut.

282
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:08,198
Actually, it went a little better
than it did in rehearsal,

283
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:08,887
to be honest.

284
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,825
- But I will tell him what you said.
- All right.

285
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,682
You know, your little meltdown
in there got me thinking.

286
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,529
I'm building a retail office development,

287
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,547
and I could use a liaison

288
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:17,713
to work with
the planning commission.

289
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:20,343
Are you offering me a job?

290
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,959
Well, yeah.
You know people in city hall,

291
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,540
and you did a hell
of a job on that flip.

292
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:25,445
And for the safety
of you and your family,

293
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:26,760
I gotta get you
out of that house.

294
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,758
But you and Phil are competitors. It--

295
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,516
Not on this.

296
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,717
Look, if this works out,
everybody's gonna win...

297
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,354
except for that tropical fish store

298
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:34,724
we're booting out of there. Mm.

299
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:35,826
I don't feel bad about that at all.

300
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,120
Can I take a couple of days
to think about it?

301
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,996
- Yeah. Yeah. Take your time. No pressure.
- Okay.

302
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:41,786
And when you're ready,
just give me a call.

303
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,122
- Okay.
- Number's on the stick.

304
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,728
Great. Oh, yeah.
Okay. Gil pickle.

305
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,248
See ya! Thorpe! Thorpe! Thorpe!

306
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:48,257
Thorpe. Thorpe. Thorpe.

307
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,495
Look what just came in the mail--

308
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,922
a letter addressed to you, Lily.

309
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,014
Really? I don't get much mail.

310
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,067
Oh, let's see here.

311
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,195
Uh, yeah. Oh, the tooth fairy.

312
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,028
"1 Tooth Fairy Lane.

313
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,936
Tooth City, Tooth Dakota."

314
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,860
I hope it's another $100.

315
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:10,004
Ooh! Well, lookie there.

316
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,203
Glitter!

317
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,779
I guess the tooth fairy doesn't have
to worry about vacuuming.

318
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,005
See, "dear Lily, I'm writing
because I made a mistake

319
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:20,022
- and gave you too much money."
- Oh.

320
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:23,344
"Please leave the $100
under your pillow tonight,

321
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,491
and I'll give you a dollar.
Sorry if that bites."

322
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:28,099
Oh.

323
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:29,790
Let me see that.

324
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:32,164
I can't read.

325
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,608
Uh, well, it sounds
like she's really in a jam.

326
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:36,767
And I think we're gonna

327
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:38,773
have to give the tooth fairy
her $100 back.

328
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:39,543
Mm-hmm.

329
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,981
No! I wanna keep it.

330
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:45,446
I'm scared that
she's gonna be the one

331
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,311
- taking care of us when we're older.
- Yeah.

332
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,330
"Chuck Stone,

333
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:53,029
"6-foot, 3-inches of
steely eyed determination

334
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,086
sat at the interrogation table."

335
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,435
"His mind was a blank..."

336
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,998
"A complete blank.

337
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:06,231
"He literally could not think
of one single, solitary thing.

338
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:07,846
Then he noticed a spot."

339
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,439
"It looked like syrup
left over from breakfast..."

340
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,673
"Which made him realize
it was lunchtime.

341
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,594
"A bacon, lettuce,
and tomato, sandwich--

342
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,728
"or B.L.T, as Chuck Stone called it--

343
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,656
would really hit the spot."

344
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,765
"The secret, Chuck realized,
was real mayonnaise..."

345
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:26,556
- Mmm. - "Not that healthy crap
his wife kept buying for their son."

346
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:27,315
Damn it!

347
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,896
"I mean, what's the point
of t-t-t-t-t-t-t?

348
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,211
Tea for two.
Two for tea."

349
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,455
It only gets worse from here.

350
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:39,759
You can't be serious!
Gil Thorpe is my nemesis!

351
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,737
I hate to break it to you, Phil,
but you're not Batman.

352
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:42,444
Trust me.

353
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,262
Gil is a snake and he's found
the perfect way to mess with me.

354
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:47,768
Did it ever occur to you that
he was hiring me because of...

355
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,269
I don't know? Me.

356
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,348
Are you kidding?
What's your last name?!

357
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,256
Right now?

358
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:54,350
I'm sorry, Claire.

359
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:57,010
I-I hate to do this,
but I have to use my veto.

360
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,466
Veto?
Oh, you don't get any vetoes.

361
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,781
- You veto me all the time.
- 'Cause you have dumb ideas.

362
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,018
Name one.

363
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,711
That went on for a while.

364
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:08,061
...And let's not forget shower snacks.

365
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,958
I can't be the only one
who gets hungry in there!

366
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,354
Hey, Jay. My mom said
you were writing a book.

367
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:23,036
- That's fantastic.
- Uh-huh.

368
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:25,610
By the way, career day
was a little weird.

369
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:27,810
I think Claire's going through
some pretty dark stuff,

370
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,181
- and you might want to check--
- Enough chitchat.

371
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:30,958
I've gotta get a character
out of a bind.

372
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,402
Ooh. What did he do?

373
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:34,136
He told his wife
he could write a book.

374
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,229
Don't give up, Jay.
Self-doubt is part of the process.

375
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,221
You can't be a good writer

376
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,899
without being critical
of your own work.

377
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,466
Hmm.

378
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,364
- Huh.
- What?

379
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,668
I'm racking my brain
for a compliment here.

380
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,193
I know. It stinks.

381
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,619
And your mom's gonna rub it
in my face pretty good.

382
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,586
Okay. Why is Chuck Stone
interrogating this guy?

383
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:55,491
He needs the codes.
If he doesn't get 'em,

384
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,042
the International Space Station's gonna

385
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:59,631
- crash into Times Square on New Year's Eve.
- So he's short of time.

386
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:01,193
He's got about two minutes.
He's desperate.

387
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:01,949
How about this?

388
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:05,606
"Chuck Stone smiled
and lit a cigarette,

389
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,681
"as if he had all the time
in the world,

390
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,606
when in fact, the world
was about to end."

391
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,020
Holy crap. What happens next?

392
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,353
Move over. I'll type.

393
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,659
Some coffee would be great.
Thanks.

394
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:28,914
I'm sorry. I don't understand
why we don't just go in there,

395
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,741
we tell her we're taking the money,
and that's that.

396
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,183
Because this is
a teaching moment,

397
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:34,414
and we want her to want
to give the money back.

398
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm just really worried

399
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,662
we're becoming those
overindulgent parents right now.

400
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:38,983
Don't be silly.

401
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:40,527
Okay, you ready, tooth fairy?

402
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,789
- Let's do this.
- All right.

403
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,753
Lily, look who came to say hi!

404
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:55,881
It's me, the tooth fairy.

405
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:59,220
And I've come to ask you for a favor!

406
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:01,589
Are you really the tooth fairy?

407
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,397
Oh, yes, I am.
Look at my wings!

408
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:07,521
Can you fly?
I wanna see you fly.

409
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:10,851
Well, I can't right now because...

410
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,786
Um... well, because--

411
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,112
because the tooth fairy's
too sad to fly...

412
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,546
Because she made a mistake
that only you can make better.

413
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:21,527
Is this about the money again?

414
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,583
Well, yes, it is.

415
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:26,716
I need enough for all
the other children's tooths.

416
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,097
- Teeth.
- Wait a minute.

417
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:31,859
You're not the tooth fairy.
You're Haley.

418
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,016
No! I am the tooth fairy!

419
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,133
Look! Fairy dust!

420
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,214
And there's that glitter.

421
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,130
Why did you lie?
You said lying was wrong.

422
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,967
We also said that when someone
is in trouble, you help them.

423
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,366
How do I know you weren't lying?

424
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:48,853
- She is good.
- All right, Lily, this is ridiculous.

425
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:51,297
All right, the tooth fairy
has made a mistake.

426
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,320
You need to put
the $100 under the pillow,

427
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,123
and that is the end of the story.

428
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:56,640
Because you believe
it's the right thing to do...

429
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,507
- Yes.
- Don't you?

430
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,487
But I wanna buy a scooter.

431
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:00,917
Oh. That's what I'd do.

432
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:02,952
I mean...

433
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,609
who cares what Santa thinks, right?

434
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:07,595
Santa?

435
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,357
Well, he sees everything,

436
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:12,328
and this'll probably put
you on the "naughty" list.

437
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,109
But who needs presents every year?

438
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,613
You've got a hundred dollars.

439
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,822
You can ride around
that empty Christmas tree

440
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:21,259
until you're an old lady.

441
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,870
Can I have some time
to think about it?

442
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,941
- You don't need any--
- Of course, sweetie.

443
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,007
Yeah. Okay.

444
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,008
Haley? Okay, that was brilliant.

445
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,183
Thanks.
Oh, also, can I borrow this?

446
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:35,930
- Why?
- I'd rather not say.

447
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:39,000
You know, after I put on the wig,

448
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,725
I just... I felt like the character.

449
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,002
Hang on.

450
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:43,873
Yell-o?

451
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,807
Quick question.
Am I talking to live Phil or video Phil?

452
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:48,439
What do you want, Gil?

453
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,592
I just wanna make it's okay
that your wife calls me "boss."

454
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:53,044
- Good-bye.
- Oh, hold on! Hold on!

455
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,424
I'm just messing with ya.

456
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,698
Although I do think your wife's
gonna enjoy being under me.

457
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,040
My son is in the car.

458
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,105
Hey, superstar! What's up?

459
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,018
Listen, any time you wanna
swing by the beach house,

460
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,199
I'll be glad to show you
how to throw a tight spiral

461
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,966
like I did at Texas Tech. Booyah!

462
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:08,242
- Tommy!
- He already knows how to throw.

463
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,022
- Yeah, my gay Uncle Cam taught me.
- I-I got this.

464
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,240
This was between us.
You don't bring family into it.

465
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,138
Low blow getting Claire's hopes up.

466
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:16,318
Hey, I'm not getting her hopes up.

467
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,577
This is a real job
with real bennies--

468
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,221
one of which is I get
to tell you what I'm thinking

469
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:23,084
whenever she leans over my desk!

470
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,198
Ha ha ha!

471
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,137
Oh, I'm gonna have
so much fun with this! Uhh!

472
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,528
Later, dunph-bags!

473
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:30,547
What a jerk.

474
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:31,502
You know what?
We're gonna tell your mom

475
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:33,221
before she goes
into business with this guy.

476
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:36,194
He's gil-ty of being a thorpe in my side.

477
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,107
Trying too hard.

478
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:38,853
Yeah.

479
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,143
Hello!

480
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,018
Move!

481
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,716
- Ow!
- You're fine.

482
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:47,462
So?

483
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,352
How was your first day of writing?

484
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:52,346
Gloria, shh!
Let me finish one thought.

485
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:54,595
Got it.

486
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,058
So you actually wrote something?

487
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,251
Well, it was slow going at first,

488
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,969
but then the juices started flowing.

489
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:01,657
- May I?
- Sure.

490
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:03,604
Uh, if it helps,
picture Tom Berenger.

491
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:04,731
I always do.

492
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,141
Mnh.

493
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:10,685
What?

494
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:11,914
Well, it's just this...

495
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,518
this first sentence is a bit long.

496
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,973
Long or dynamic?

497
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,582
No, long and confusing.
I can't tell who's talking.

498
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,778
Maybe that's just to mimic
the fog of battle.

499
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:22,875
Okay.

500
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,315
- Hmm.
- What now?

501
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:30,498
Just... there were
no cell phones in 1965.

502
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:31,868
That's a mistake.
I'm changing that.

503
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:34,267
You can't change that.
It comes back in the end...

504
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,219
I-I presume.

505
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,829
The point is, I can write.

506
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,080
I probably won't pursue it,
but it's a viable career option.

507
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:43,031
The CIA had all sorts
of top-secret technology.

508
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,759
Who's to say they
didn't have cell phones?

509
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,796
Manny, let it go.

510
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,061
And this Chuck Stone--

511
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,669
he doesn't seem
very good at his job.

512
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,134
He's flawed. That's what makes
the character interesting.

513
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:55,703
If you want someone perfect,
put in a robot.

514
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,158
A robot!

515
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,354
I like a robot.

516
00:18:58,355 --> 00:19:00,931
No! You're not putting
a robot in my story!

517
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,021
That's right, my story.

518
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:07,256
You must be very happy.

519
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:10,084
I would be,
but life got in the way.

520
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,125
What are you doing?

521
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,714
Oh, I just got out my old briefcase.

522
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,429
It's still capable
of doing the job,

523
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:20,739
just like me.

524
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,264
Claire, you have
to understand something.

525
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,594
You have to understand something.

526
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,585
I walked around
all day on cloud nine

527
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,128
because somebody valued me.

528
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,348
I value you.
We all value you.

529
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:31,213
No, of course you do,

530
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:33,967
because I cook and I clean
and I pick up dirty underwear.

531
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:35,611
No, honey,
it's different than that.

532
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:37,687
I have been
on the sidelines for so long,

533
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,490
I didn't know if anybody
would ever think

534
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:40,617
I have what it takes again.

535
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,246
I know Gil's not the greatest guy,

536
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,332
but this is important. And I think--

537
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,534
I think you should take the job.

538
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:47,805
But, dad...

539
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,482
No, Luke. She's right.

540
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,296
Your mom's gonna
be amazing at this.

541
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,042
Mmm!

542
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:59,232
- I retract my veto.
- You never had a veto.

543
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,303
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't, and I'll tell you why.

544
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:03,279
And that went on for a while.

545
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,344
...And lastly, this whole conversation
would be happening

546
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:08,363
- in a yurt.
- It's the perfect structure.

547
00:20:08,364 --> 00:20:09,504
I have to go take
the shoulder pads out

548
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,764
of all my old suits!

549
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:13,915
You know he's gonna keep teasing you.

550
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,374
If it makes your mom happy,
I can handle a few phone calls.

551
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,998
And texts. Wow.

552
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,116
- What does it say?
- Nothing I can't handle.

553
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,450
"We all weave a web of lies."

554
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:32,407
"Some we tell to try
to help the ones we love."

555
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:40,152
"Some we tell to try
to fool ourselves."

556
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,060
"And some we tell because,

557
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,151
"when you're out of bullets

558
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:47,724
"and staring down
the barrel of a kalashnikov,

559
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,266
the only weapon
you've got left is guile."

560
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:53,357
She's nuts. That's fantastic.

561
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,002
Okay, guys, bring it in!

562
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:04,592
Let's get this place shipshape
before she gets home.

563
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,060
I'm sure she had a big first day.

564
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,918
Haley, I'm putting you on laundry.

565
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,171
Alex, kitchen and vacuum.

566
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:10,539
Luke, you're cleaning the bathroom.

567
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:11,546
Why me?

568
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:12,793
Because you always mess it up.

569
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:14,660
Yeah, why can't you pee straight?

570
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:16,749
Hey, I'm doing a great job
from that far back.

571
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,993
Okay, guys,
team Dunphy on three.

572
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,810
One, two--that's right,
we got a lot to do!

573
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,066
Honey, what are you
doing home so early?

574
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,457
I quit. That man is a complete pig.

575
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,931
He treated me like a servant

576
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,653
and showed me
absolutely no respect.

577
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,622
I'm so sorry.
You deserve better than that.

578
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,577
- I do.
- Ohh!

579
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,851
So what's for dinner?

580
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,524
I feel like you heard me wrong.
I said, what's for dinner?

581
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:40,356
I heard you!

582
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:41,756
