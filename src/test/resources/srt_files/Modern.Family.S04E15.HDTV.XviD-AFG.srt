1
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:07,787
Clive Bixby.
What a sexy surprise.

2
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:09,488
Quick question--
Hmm?

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:11,690
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,793
Because you--Uh...

5
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:15,327
I'm gonna come in again.

6
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:16,995
We are watching baby Joe
on Valentine's day

7
00:00:16,996 --> 00:00:18,331
so my dad and Gloria can...

8
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:20,332
make love.
Ew. Don't.

9
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,300
Oh.
The point is, we are
celebrating a day early.

10
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:23,601
So they can finally be intimate.

11
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:25,436
You've...
more than made that point.

12
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:27,438
I'm just saying it's a long wait
after giving birth.

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,606
Six weeks.
Ugh.

14
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,410
I couldn't keep my hands
off this one for that long.

15
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:31,610
(both chuckle)

16
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:34,047
I can only imagine
what Jay's going through.

17
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:37,850
Voila.
(gasps)

18
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,852
Square knot. Impressive.

19
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:41,420
I can make any kind of knot.

20
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,256
It's like I have a sailor in my mouth.

21
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:45,758
I should check on the kids.

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,759
Haley took 'em to a movie.
She's not even gonna answer.

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,761
I know, but, sweetie,
I have a good reason to worry.

24
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,464
Luke had that nasty nosebleed
this morning,

25
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:53,599
and Alex, as usual, fainted.

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,402
She's fine,
and dunphy men get nosebleeds.

27
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,937
I told you this when we
got married. It was in my vows.

28
00:00:57,938 --> 00:00:59,906
I'm still a little unclear as to
why you put them in your vows--

29
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:03,442
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

30
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,045
Just finish that drink, pretty lady.

31
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:06,712
We got a big night ahead of us.

32
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,280
Okay.

33
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,250
First, we have a date with romance.

34
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,585
A threesome, if you will.
Oh.

35
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,988
From here, we move on
to an old-Fashioned blimpnic.

36
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,355
Now is that the one

37
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:17,991
where the man has to
face out at the woman...

38
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,959
it's a picnic on a blimp.

39
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Hmm.

40
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,028
Champagne, cheese,

41
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,029
and this beautiful city beneath us.

42
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,332
That actually sounds really romantic.

43
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,869
After that, we swap
our earplugs for some earmuffs,

44
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,972
and take a few moonlit turns
around the local ice rink.

45
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,540
Oh.

46
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,743
From there, it's a quick trip
back to the hotel,

47
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:39,345
where...
I'm spinning.

48
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:40,846
Well, I wouldn't start with that,

49
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:43,649
But, uh, we--we can
work our way up to it.

50
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,484
No. I'm feeling really weird.

51
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:48,287
Catch that, clive?
Just tell me what you want.

52
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,923
(thud) Juliana?

53
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,291
Claire?

54
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,693
One of you needs to answer me.

55
00:01:54,694 --> 00:02:02,694
♪♪♪

56
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,342
Blood pressure's still good.

57
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:11,609
I think I can send you home.

58
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,778
Great. So it was probably just
low BLOOD sugar or something?

59
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,882
See, honey? I told you
it was nothing to worry about.

60
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,349
Well, it's not nothing.

61
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,917
You did have a small heart episode.

62
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,687
Dr. Coben,
this may have been my fault.

63
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,389
I think I was being...
too sexy.

64
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,392
Yeah, I don't think that's an issue.

65
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:27,427
You sure about that?

66
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,695
Um, doctor, you're not saying

67
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,663
that I had a heart attack
or something, right?

68
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,934
Not at all. What you have
is a very minor arrhythmia,

69
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,268
known as Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome.

70
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,771
It's hereditary, so you're off the hook.

71
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,372
Oh, yeah. My mom has that.

72
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:41,472
We'll treat it with medication

73
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:43,308
and have you back in a couple of days.

74
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,711
In the meantime, just take it easy.

75
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:46,445
Okay. Thank you!

76
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,912
I guess we should tell your dad

77
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:49,282
we can't watch the baby tomorrow.

78
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:50,316
No. No.

79
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:51,883
I don't want everyone
to know about this.

80
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,320
They're just gonna get worried

81
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,421
and--And make a bigger deal
of it than it is.

82
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,556
Sweetheart, promise me?

83
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,991
I promise. I know
it's not that big a deal.

84
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:02,428
This is a huge deal...

85
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:03,797
for which I'm partly responsible,

86
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,899
in spite of what Claire's
lesbian doctor says.

87
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,768
Hey, honey, I was just reading
about this Wolff-White thing.

88
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,870
It's not that serious.
You're gonna be fine.

89
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:13,840
(Claire) I know.

90
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,509
Who's ready to hit the ice?

91
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,578
What?
Come on.

92
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,380
Somebody promised me a moonlit skate.

93
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,481
But didn't the doctor say
you needed to take it easy?

94
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:25,249
Oh, that's just one of those
things they have to say,

95
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,417
like, "you can't drink
when you're pregnant."

96
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:27,618
(chuckles) (laughs)

97
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,655
Come on.
We're not gonna seriously

98
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,322
blow off valentine's day, are we?

99
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:33,625
No. I just thought
why... Ice things down

100
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,461
when we could heat things up?

101
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:39,698
Oh, I like
where this is going.
Right?

102
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,367
Yes.
Yeah?

103
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,401
Ye--No!

104
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,003
Honey, I know what you're doing.

105
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,271
You're treating me like a patient,

106
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,272
and you promised
that you wouldn't.
No.

107
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:49,042
No, no, no, no, no.
I just had a better idea.

108
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:50,042
What?

109
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,378
Side-By-Side
couples massage.

110
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,278
Oh.

111
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,046
Just you, me,
and a couple cambodian guys

112
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:56,282
to work us over good.

113
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:58,317
Specific.
(door closes)

114
00:03:58,318 --> 00:03:59,952
What is that?

115
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,554
You think the kids are home?
(indistinct conversations)

116
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:03,957
That sounds like more than our three.

117
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,392
(pop music playing) Oh.

118
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:09,495
Oh, they think we're not home,
and they're having a party.

119
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,797
I'm killing them.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

120
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,266
"a" --it's my turn
to kill them.

121
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,835
"B" --you need to order up
those massages.

122
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,404
Mm-hmm.
It's under

123
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,306
"Best number one U.S.A.
Coca-Cola good time massage."

124
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,944
What the hell is going on?!

125
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,646
Dad? What are you doing home?

126
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,248
So This is how it is?

127
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,649
We're gone for a minute,
and you guys throw a party?
No!

128
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,819
Just texted mom we're having
a good time at the movies.

129
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,353
It works every t--aah!

130
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,889
So This is a regular thing?
No!

131
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,725
You know the drill.
Coolers our b--Aah--Ack!

132
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,759
Enough! Turn off the music!

133
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,261
(music stops)

134
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,863
Everybody who I did not create,
get out of my house right now!

135
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,032
I don't want to get upset.

136
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,734
I've been through enough tonight.

137
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,570
What happened?
I'm not supposed
to tell you.

138
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,506
When you say it like that,
we make it worse in our head.

139
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:55,574
Fine. It's no big deal.

140
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,410
Your mother had to go to the hospital.

141
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:58,744
Oh, my god!
What?!

142
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,011
That is so much worse
than it would be in our heads!

143
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,579
She's fine.
She just passed out a little.

144
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,914
Something to do with her heart.

145
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,417
Like a heart attack?!
Mom had a heart attack?!

146
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:07,319
Mom almost died
of a heart attack?!
no!

147
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,556
She had a little episode,
probably triggered by me.

148
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:11,290
She just needs to rest.

149
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,959
For once, let's not think
about ourselves.

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,260
(crunches)
(Claire) Phil, everything okay?

151
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:16,729
(mouth full)
fine! I'm coming!

152
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,730
(scoffs)
Just act like
everything's normal.

153
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,565
Oh, and if, uh,
two Cambodian guys show up,

154
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:21,768
send them to our bedroom.

155
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,970
(rattles)

156
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,306
(door opens)

157
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:31,276
Kids had a few friends over.
I handled it.

158
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,445
So you're good at handling things.

159
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,781
(chips crunch and clatter)

160
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:36,915
You like?

161
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,585
Me love, but is this
appropriate massage wear?

162
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,521
They were busy, which is what
we should be getting.

163
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,690
Honey.
(switch clicks)

164
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,425
Honey, are you sure this is
okay for your--aah!

165
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:47,559
Mm-Hmm!

166
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,461
Mmm. Ooh! (whispers) salty.

167
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:50,928
I still have a few moves.

168
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,265
Mm, that's the chips, sweetie.

169
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,665
Oh, sorry.
Right.

170
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,934
(door opens) Mmm.

171
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:57,302
Mom, we need to talk to you.
(Claire groans)

172
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,271
Dad told us not to say anything,

173
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,272
but we're really worried about you.

174
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,274
You told them?!
No!

175
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,309
You had a heart attack?

176
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,843
Phil!
That is not what I said.

177
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:06,511
(sighs deeply and groans)
Kids, everything is fine.

178
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:07,678
(Haley screams)

179
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,848
(high-Pitched voice)
Call 9-1-1!
Oh, god!

180
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,349
Her heart exploded!

181
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,352
Oh, my god! I did it again!
Phil, it's your nose!

182
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:14,520
Oh.
Ugh. This is the one thing--

183
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,823
The one thing I ask from you is
not to make a big deal of this,

184
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,324
and you couldn't even do that.

185
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,426
Honey, you need to stay calm.

186
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,361
No, I don't, because I am fine.

187
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:24,496
We are all fine.

188
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:27,467
Oh, god.
Haley, revive your sister.

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,440
Not in the mood for an apology, Phil.

190
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:36,841
Good, 'cause you're not gettin' one.

191
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:38,309
I'm allowed to worry about you.

192
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,311
Mm-Hmm. Yeah, when there's
something to worry about.

193
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,280
But this was nothing.
I told you, my mom has this.

194
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,581
Which I just found out about today.

195
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,485
How has that not come up in 20 years?

196
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,819
I was... getting to it.

197
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,986
Look, I know you feel like

198
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,323
you have to be the rock for this family

199
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,258
and worry about Everybody's
boy problems and nosebleeds

200
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,627
and...
who has enough greens.

201
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:56,628
They're supposed to cover
half the plate.

202
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:57,996
Claire, stop it.

203
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,799
I'm saying you could
let us take care of you

204
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,366
every once in a while.

205
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:05,037
Like for example, when you
clutch your chest and collapse.

206
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,372
This house isn't gonna crumble
in the dust

207
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,675
if you let yourself be vulnerable.

208
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,043
We don't know that.

209
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,377
We could find out.

210
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:14,047
(sighs)

211
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,417
It was kind of scary.

212
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,652
Of course.

213
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,656
Until I knew what it was,
and then--
don't ruin it.

214
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,027
I just have one more question.

215
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,561
Hmm?

216
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:30,729
Did it hurt?

217
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,397
Well, I blacked out
before I--

218
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,866
When you fell from heaven?

219
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,036
Nailed it.

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

221
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,498
You just take care of Claire.
We got Joe.

222
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:50,933
(phone beeps) Gloria?

223
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,702
¿Si, mi amor?

224
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,937
Wow.
Happy Valentine's--

225
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,671
(lowered voice)
Wait. Wait. Wait. Time-out.

226
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,508
That was Phil.
They can't watch Joe today.

227
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,743
Claire was in the emergency room
last night.

228
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:01,976
Is she okay?
She's gonna be fine,

229
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:03,814
but, you know,
she had a little bit--
Okay, good.

230
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,815
I love how you look in this suit.

231
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,617
Let's see how it looks
on the floor, okay?

232
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:09,685
Okay, but I gotta be
in a meeting in one hour.

233
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,687
Ay, that's so cute that after six weeks,

234
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:13,889
you think you're going to need an hour!

235
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,025
(both laugh) happy Valentine's day!

236
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,494
It's the one time of the year

237
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:20,363
when the world tries to be as
romantic as I am all the time.

238
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:22,398
Good luck, world.
Get out.

239
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,099
Anyway, since you're
almost done dressing Jay...

240
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Mm-hmm.
How about
we head to school early?

241
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,337
I'll check my hair
and meet you in the car.

242
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,475
Gloria, I'll be back in two hours, tops.

243
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:37,346
We decide who does what
when you come back.

244
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,383
I got a ticket
running a red light...
(door closes)

245
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:42,051
So let's make this worth it.
Put the kid down.

246
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,053
I can't. He's being
a real Pritchett.

247
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:45,889
We need to come up with
a different term for that.

248
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,089
Watch.

249
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,791
(Joe crying)

250
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,459
(crying stops) (whispers) Watch.

251
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,027
(crying)

252
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,363
(crying stops)
Okay, I used to have a tv
got reception like that.

253
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:56,899
Let me try.
Hey, Joe Joe. Hey Buddy.

254
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,002
Guy to guy, you're blocking me
a little bit. You know that.
Ohh!

255
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:02,037
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do, Joe.

256
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:04,940
Hey, how about a half-Hour?
What do you say, pal? Huh?

257
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,041
Can you do it?

258
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,444
Attaboy!

259
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,647
I've never been more
attracted... (whispers) to you.

260
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:11,947
Prove it.

261
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,116
Are you kissing?
That's a bit of a mood killer.

262
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,785
My daddies kiss a lot.

263
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,086
And flatlined.

264
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:20,356
(sighs) Mitch and cam are having
a party for Valentine's.

265
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:23,926
Claire was supposed to take care
of her, but now she can't.

266
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:27,463
Lily, we're so happy to have you here.

267
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,432
I have a big surprise for you!

268
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:32,067
Look! A brand-New,
shiny tv remote!

269
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,369
Looks complicated.

270
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,669
Just keep hitting all those buttons

271
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,072
until something good happens.

272
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:38,340
(under breath) That's my plan, anyway.

273
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:39,408
Woof!

274
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,743
(doorbell rings)

275
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:41,978
Where were all these distractions

276
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:44,113
the night that Joe was conceived?

277
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:46,049
I'm kissing.
He's a blessing.

278
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,585
Can I help you?

279
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:52,455
Yeah, I'm Harlan. I'm here
to do your baby proofing.

280
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:55,057
Jay, I've been waiting
for this appointment for weeks.

281
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,759
I've waited longer for mine.

282
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,994
The human race has survived
for a thousand years

283
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:01,897
without these foam bumpers
and--And gates everywhere.

284
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:03,364
Hell, I used to drive to the supermarket

285
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,068
with Mitchell and Claire
on the Hood of the car.

286
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,803
When did everybody get
so overprotective?

287
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,406
Maybe when kids started flying off cars.

288
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:11,574
How long?

289
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,976
Normally I have help, but Dale, uh...

290
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,344
you met Dale at the shop.
He's a tall guy.

291
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,547
He's my sister's kid--
Hey, listen. You and I are gonna
bang this out in about an hour.

292
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,982
(grunting)

293
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:21,485
Where do you want it?

294
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,119
(box thuds)

295
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,590
I know a lot of people think
that I'm attracted to Jay

296
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,091
because of his money, but they're wrong.

297
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,827
I'm attracted to him because he's sexy,

298
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,730
and he's never been sexier than today.

299
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:36,432
The suit...

300
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,501
the carrying of the boxes...

301
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:39,836
no, no. You listen to me.

302
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,904
You've had my wife's car four days.

303
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:43,740
Figure out what
that screeching noise is,

304
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,708
or you'll be making one yourself.

305
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,543
(phone beeps)

306
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,446
(Gloria) the yelling on the phone...

307
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,013
give me that.

308
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:55,050
(drill whirring)

309
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,852
And the drilling.

310
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,954
So much drilling.

311
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,489
Time to go, Harlan.

312
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,090
Okay. You want me to walk you
through any of the--

313
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,992
No, we'll take it
from here.
Okay. Uh, listen.

314
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,593
Give me a call if you have
any trouble with the gates,

315
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:06,995
because they're
a little tricky, you know?
(whispers) Yeah

316
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:08,899
you gotta be gentle with it.
(slams door)

317
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,000
Ten seconds, or I start without you.

318
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,369
(singsongy) Ready or not, here I...

319
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,435
okay.
Hold on!

320
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:15,603
Okay, you have to lift it.

321
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:16,971
It's not a lift.
It's a squeeze.

322
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,041
Okay, then squeeze it!

323
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,509
I'm squeezing it!
It's impossible!

324
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,578
Jay, please.

325
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,946
(door opens)

326
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,080
Best day ever!

327
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,783
I just got invited
to a Valentine's party

328
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,450
by a secret admirer!

329
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,352
You should go.
Sounds great! Go!

330
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,886
I obviously need to get dressed first.

331
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,557
Can you keep it
under a half-hour?

332
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,658
You're funny.

333
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,060
(pounds on door) Manny, come on.

334
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,029
Let's go!
(door opens)

335
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,763
Relax.
Come on!

336
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:42,098
You don't have to drive me.
It's just down the street.

337
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,466
Oh, I thought I...
had to drive you. (grunts)

338
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:45,634
(latch clicks)

339
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:46,936
(sighs)

340
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,069
What's with the hat?

341
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,404
My secret admirer requested

342
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:50,905
I wear a hat with a feather in it.

343
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,008
I'm like, "which one?"

344
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,442
really?

345
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:56,011
This secret admirer Have
any other requests?

346
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,346
Uh, yes.

347
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:59,949
She asked me to bring some
poetry to recite at the party.

348
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,116
Mm-Hmm.

349
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:04,453
These, uh, kids at the party...

350
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:07,022
(latch clicks)
they wouldn't be
the popular ones by any chance?

351
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:08,958
The most popular. Why?

352
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,894
No reason.
Just... have fun.

353
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,563
(chuckles) I will.

354
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,968
(door opens and closes)

355
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:22,571
(rattling)

356
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:24,873
No, Jay.

357
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,342
It's squeeze.

358
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:27,710
(clank) UHH!

359
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,044
(clatters)

360
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,546
(giggles)

361
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,982
(giggling)

362
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:33,984
(laughs)

363
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,086
What? I have cigar breath?

364
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,087
It's not you.

365
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,723
Ay. Did you already...

366
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:42,057
what?

367
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:44,026
No!

368
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,961
No. I'm worried about manny.

369
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:48,031
I think he's being set up
for some kind of humiliation

370
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,565
at that party.

371
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:52,067
Oh. That's so sweet
of you to worry.

372
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,070
Just when you thought that
you couldn't get any sexier.

373
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,740
Yeah, he's fine, right?
Yeah, he's fine.

374
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,041
(giggling)

375
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,509
Come here... (laughs)

376
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,077
Oh, I think I gotta check on him.

377
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,414
There was something about
some kind of secret admirer

378
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,350
getting him to...
bring his poems?

379
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:11,587
Yeah, he told me when I was
lint-Rolling his jacket.

380
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:13,354
And you're not worried it's a prank?

381
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:14,624
Of course I worry.

382
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,492
I worry about him all the time.

383
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:20,863
But like you said, we can't
protect them from everything.

384
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:23,599
So I'm just trying to, like,
let go a little bit.

385
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,768
Let him ride on top of the car?

386
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,336
No, that's just crazy.

387
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:31,473
That's the hardest part, isn't it?

388
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:34,777
When you realize you can't stop
the world from hurting them.

389
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:38,113
Now you're making me want to cry.

390
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:39,683
This is not what this day is all about.

391
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:40,949
You're right.

392
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,984
Okay.

393
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:43,920
I'll go and get us some Champagne.

394
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,021
Good idea.

395
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,461
Manny?

396
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:53,629
No, nothing.

397
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,098
Just wanted to know
if everything is okay.

398
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:59,034
Hi, honey. Sorry to bother you.
I know you're resting.

399
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,037
I heard you had
a little scare last night.

400
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:05,040
Hey, uh, when are you going back
to the doctor?

401
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,944
'cause if you want, I can go with you.

402
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,913
(snoring) (phone ringing)

403
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:20,848
This year for Valentine's day,

404
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,518
we decided to throw
a lonely hearts party

405
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,018
for all of our single friends.

406
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,586
Sometimes when we're around them,

407
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,890
we feel a little guilty
for having found each other,

408
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:31,426
like we're waving our love
in their faces.

409
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,661
There's gotta be a better way
of saying that.

410
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,863
Anyway, it was supposed to be
an elegant affair.

411
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:37,965
Ogle me.

412
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:39,867
(doorbell rings) Showtime.

413
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,435
Put the cat away.
Okay. Yeah. Great.

414
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,338
Oh, and, Mitchell,
please... Hey.
Yeah?

415
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,872
Please try to have fun tonight.

416
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:45,908
I always have fun.

417
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,308
No, I know you're great

418
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:48,775
at stay-at-Home fun
and sit-on-the-Couch fun,

419
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,644
but this is party fun,
and sometimes you--

420
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:51,747
Okay, this is not fun.
(rings)

421
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:52,747
Get the door.

422
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,716
♪♪♪

423
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:56,618
I will show you some fun.

424
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:02,491
Things got a little hazy after that.

425
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:06,461
(phone rings)

426
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,629
(grunting)

427
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,630
(beeps)

428
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:10,630
(gruff voice) Hello?

429
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:11,600
(clears throat)

430
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,334
(normal voice)
Yeah, hi--Hi, dad.

431
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:15,870
No, no. I'm up.
I am up.

432
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,772
Yeah, bring her by at any time.

433
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:19,307
Okay. Good night.

434
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,308
(beeps)

435
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,442
Oh, cam.

436
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:23,911
Oh, god, that was some party last night.

437
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:26,948
Yeah. Well, I'm just glad
you made it home safely.

438
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,449
Wha--Made--Made it ho--
I don't--

439
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,950
I don't even remember leaving the party.

440
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,887
Oh, I-I think
I got a little tipsy.

441
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:32,887
Tipsy?

442
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,656
You were like all
of the "mad men."

443
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:35,990
Oh, no, no, no.

444
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:38,961
Don't make it out like I did
a lot of crazy, out of control--

445
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,864
I was hoping
I dreamt that.
Mm.

446
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,631
Come on. Like--like you've
never had a few cocktails

447
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:46,435
and died a cat pink
with Cherry kool-Aid.

448
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,970
Okay. Well, is there anything
else you need to tell me about?

449
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,873
Not that I remember.

450
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:53,908
I'm remembering this.

451
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,008
Oh, my gosh, Mitchell,

452
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,411
are these Burt and Dottie Winchell's

453
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,846
Christmas decorations?
How could you?

454
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:00,515
They never take them down, okay?

455
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,817
I was doing the whole
neighborhood a favor.

456
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,085
Oh, god.

457
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,587
Cam, I... you know, I think--
I-I think there are pictures.

458
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:10,358
I remember Pepper
and Longinus were--Okay.

459
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,727
Mm.
(gasps) Oh, my gosh.
Those poor reindeer.

460
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:14,728
Oh, it seems like prancer
is the Belle of the ball--

461
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:15,831
No surprise there.

462
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:17,765
Oh. You must be vixen.

463
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,667
Okay. Okay.
Not funny, Mitchell.

464
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,969
Look at this place.
What were you thinking?

465
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,906
Okay. Cam, I... yes,
I went a little nuts, all right?

466
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:26,440
I-I'm sorry.

467
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:28,643
But I didn't do anything
that can't be undone.

468
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,611
Hey, roomies.

469
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:33,515
Hey, thank you so much
for letting me move in here.

470
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,317
Um...

471
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:38,553
yes. Could you excuse us
for just a...

472
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:39,921
a moment, Dylan?

473
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:41,423
Yeah. Take as much time
as you need.

474
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:44,625
It's your house.
I just live here now.

475
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:46,829
Cam, did--Did I tell him
that he could live with us?

476
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,362
Obviously.
Oh, my god.

477
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:49,796
Was he even at our party?

478
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:51,765
Yes. He's been driving
a limousine for some company,

479
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,400
and J'Marcus hired him for the night,

480
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:54,937
and now he lives here.
Are you all caught up there?

481
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,804
I-I don't remember
any of this.

482
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:58,006
Well, let's create
a new memory--

483
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,775
One where you tell him
he can't live here.
Oh.

484
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,044
Can I say one short thing?

485
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,812
I came to this house a broken man

486
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:07,682
After my mom threw me out
for her new boyfriend.

487
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:08,851
And then I found out

488
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,852
I was getting let go
from the limo company

489
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:13,821
the same night Haley
goes to a party without me.

490
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:17,358
So I had nothing and no one.

491
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,493
And then you...
(cries)

492
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,361
(lowered voice)
okay. Come on. Tell him.

493
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:22,364
(lowered voice) Let him finish.

494
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:23,631
I'm sorry.

495
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:26,868
I mean, gay dudes
Have always been nice to me--

496
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,669
I mean, super nice.

497
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,738
But nothing like this.

498
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,840
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

499
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:34,675
Oh, my God.
He's gonna sing.

Dylan, Dylan.
I'm--I'm sorry.

506
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,569
Oh, gosh, I--This is...

507
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,738
This is really hard for me to say,

508
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:06,574
but we--We just cannot...

509
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:09,543
not wash our cat.

510
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:10,544
I'm sorry.

511
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:12,647
(cat screeches)

512
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,949
And yet when I did that drunk,
not a scratch.

513
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,486
Oh, my gosh, this place is
cleaner than when we moved in.

514
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:20,021
Best houseguest ever.

515
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:22,623
No, we are not keeping him.

516
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:23,823
Do you think he took
the christmas decorations

517
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:24,891
back to the Winchell's?

518
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:26,660
Oh, well, I think he thinks he did.

519
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:27,896
What?
Okay, yeah.

520
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:28,896
Dylan!
Dylan!

521
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:29,998
Dylan!
No, no, no!

522
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,033
Oh, hey, guys.
I'm up here.

523
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,434
Yeah, hi. Listen, Dylan,

524
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,603
those decorations were on the yard...

525
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,505
of that house.

526
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,507
Oh. No good deed, huh?

527
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,409
Yeah, well...

528
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,478
hey! I can see our house
from here.

529
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,013
Uh... oh!
(thuds)

530
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:48,348
Oh, jeez.
Are you kidding me?
(high-pitched voice)
Dylan! Dylan!

531
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:49,418
This day...
aah!

532
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,919
One night.
Just till his bone sets.

533
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,922
Yeah, but there's always gonna
be a reason not to tell him,

534
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:54,922
isn't there?

535
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:55,924
Okay. What if we, um--

536
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:57,692
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

537
00:18:57,693 --> 00:18:59,794
No "We." You made your bed.
You lie in it.

538
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,929
Don't lie there. I just made it.

539
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,930
Sorry.

540
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,899
Not looking. Not looking.

541
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,999
It's okay, Dylan.

542
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,467
I made you guys some soups.

543
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:08,969
Oh, Dylan, you didn't have to do that.

544
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,839
Well, cam didn't have to offer
to let me stay here,

545
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,839
but he did.

546
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,975
So here are soups.

547
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:15,343
Cam offered?

548
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,812
Well, I know he was
speaking for both of you.

549
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,915
You weren't home yet.
Is that a problem?

550
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,017
Not for me.

551
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh. Dylan, can you
give us just a moment?

552
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,788
Not looking.
Not looking.

553
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,824
(doorbell rings) I'll get it!

554
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,826
(chuckles) So I guess in a way,

555
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:33,527
we're both responsible.

556
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:36,798
Yeah, but in the real way,
you're responsible.

557
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:38,834
Take care of that.

558
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:40,501
Come on.

559
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:41,502
Let's do it.

560
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:43,038
Oh, my god.
I hate myself right now.

561
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,338
What kind of monster

562
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,774
throws an injured innocent
onto the street?

563
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,075
(Lily) You can't live here.
Get out!

564
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,777
Lily.
Lily.

565
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,545
It's weird.
You're a big boy.

566
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:52,881
I'm sorry, Dylan.
She doesn't mean that.

567
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:55,082
No. She's right.
Everyone says it.

568
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,785
I need to stop running from conflict.

569
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:00,054
It's time to be a big boy
and Patch things up

570
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:02,823
and move back in with my mom.

571
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:04,092
I'll get my things.

572
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,627
Okay. Sorry.
Sorry, yeah.

573
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:09,430
(mouths words)

574
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:10,632
I guess I got off easy.

575
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,633
She is Blunt but effective.

576
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,835
Maybe we should have her
talk to the Gardener.

577
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,737
Hey, c-Cam, um...

578
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,640
do you really think
that I'm not any fun?

579
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,708
What?
Last night,
you said that I--

580
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,376
(Lily) This isn't a hotel!

581
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,944
Yeah, you made your point, honey!

582
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:25,946
He's got it.

583
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:28,315
No, it--I only drank
like that last night

584
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,885
because I...
I was trying to be more fun.

585
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:33,954
Oh. No, I didn't
mean it like that.

586
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:34,955
I'm sorry.

587
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:37,091
You know I have party anxiety.
I was nervous.

588
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:38,727
No, but you're not entirely wrong.

589
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:42,830
I mean, I-I could be
a little... less uptight

590
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:44,365
and loosen up a little bit.

591
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,767
Yeah. Maybe we could,
you know,

592
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:48,602
aim for middle-Ground fun.

593
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:50,372
You know, if--if you're up
for a do-Over,

594
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,039
I recently heard of an idea

595
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,475
that could put us in the low end

596
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:56,310
of upper middle-Ground fun.

597
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:57,344
Okay.

598
00:20:57,345 --> 00:21:00,414
(piano jazz playing)

599
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:01,950
Do you believe in love at first sight,

600
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:03,919
or should I walk in again?

601
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:11,456
(Gloria, singsongy) Jay?

602
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:13,023
Coming, honey!
Oh, god.

603
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:15,259
There you are, Jay.
I thought you'd never wake up.

604
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,294
Turns out my night
with my secret admirer

605
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:18,496
couldn't have gone better.

606
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:21,131
We danced all night.
And the best part was,

607
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:22,365
her eyes were just...
(lowered voice)
manny. Manny, manny--

608
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,434
Dying to hear it.

609
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:26,203
Wait ten seconds and come in
and tell both of us.

610
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,038
Jay, you took so long.

611
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,406
I'm not done with you.

612
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:30,441
I'm not done with you, either.

613
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,509
(squeals)

614
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,545
(door opens)
(manny) best Valentine's
party ever.

615
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:35,946
So there's this girl--

616
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:37,515
I should start from the beginning.

617
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:40,284
All right.
So first a little history...

618
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,103
