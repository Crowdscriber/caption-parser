1
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:03,608
<i>We have built a new boat.</i>

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:06,458
For the first time,
we can go west.

3
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:07,959
Countless riches await us.

4
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:10,611
Our enemies are everywhere.

5
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:12,454
They cannot prevail.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,375
<i>The Earl knows nothing
about our new boat.</i>

7
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,233
He could kill us
for disobeying his orders.

8
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:18,008
Have you got the balls
to join us?

9
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,137
<i>They have set sail.</i>

10
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:20,824
<i>They'll never be
heard from again...</i>

11
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,527
What if Ragnar is right?

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,291
There are no lands to the West!

13
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,877
- They've come.
- They're here.

14
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,403
Who is here?

15
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,670
<i>Hell - and all its devils!</i>

16
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:36,435
How do you speak our language?

17
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,062
Why have you not killed
this one?

18
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,628
He is worth more alive.

19
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,684
<i>Take what you will.
This is what we came for.</i>

20

31
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,631
Hello!

32
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,651
You are Ragnar Lothbrok's son,

33
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,954
Bjorn.

34
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,799
I remember you from the thing.

35
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,712
Yes.

36
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:48,998
Where is your father?

37
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,731
<i>Bjorn? Who are you
talking to?</i>

38
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,551
I was just asking your son

39
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:59,115
where Ragnar Lothbrok might be?

40
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,426
He's gone fishing.

41
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:03,427
Oh! Fishing.

42
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,552
He's gone fishing.

43
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,476
Yes, fishing.

44
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,552
When will he return?

45
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,551
I don't know.

46
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:23,886
In which case I must take
someone back as surety,

47
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:25,308
<i>just in case.</i>

48
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,253
In case...?

49
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,899
In case your husband
has not gone fishing!

50
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:47,738
You! Come!

51
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,206
<i>Come!</i>

52
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,928
You have to come with me.

53
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,610
<i>If you don't obey this order,</i>

54
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,786
the Earl will never give you
an arm-ring!

55
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:11,551
I'll come.

56
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,551
Good.

57
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,595
Then let's be on our way.

58
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:20,403
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my son?

59
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,714
<i>He'll be quite safe, woman.</i>

60
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,014
I bid you all a good day.

61
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:44,375
We did it, brother.

62
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,810
Yes, brother, we did.

63
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,934
Let's just hope the Earl
sees it that way.

64
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,419
Yeah.

65
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,626
What is your name?

66
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,273
Athelstan.

67
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:21,398
I am Ragnar Lothbrok.

68
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,695
What was that place called?

69
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,410
Lindisfarne.

70
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:32,848
England?

71
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,733
Yes.

72
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:41,151
It was foretold
that divine punishment

73
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:44,987
would fall upon God's chosen
people for all our grievous sins,

74
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,482
and so it has happened.

75
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,422
And that is why I am here.

76
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,448
No.

77
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,150
You are here
because I spared your life.

78
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,965
Why did you spare my life?

79
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,337
I don't know yet.

80
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:05,314
Ragnar Lothbrok!

81
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:06,901
What is it?

82
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,429
Brother cenwulf here,
beside me,

83
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,270
I think he's dead.

84
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:25,758
You're right.

85
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,676
<i>Leif.</i>

86
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:00,183
May God rest your soul,
brother cenwulf.

87
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,347
<i>E nomine patri, e filii,</i>

88
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,476
et spiritus sancti.
Amen.

89
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:10,899
Yeah!

90
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:12,951
We'll drink well tonight,
my friend.

91
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:13,955
Ahhh.

92
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:21,791
<i>Erik!</i>

93
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,508
Oh, thank the gods!

94
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,895
And not alone!
Look!

95
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:27,649
We've brought slaves to sell.

96
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,746
<i>But there's more, woman.</i>

97
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,767
More things of gold and silver

98
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,759
than you and I have ever
seen before,

99
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,170
nor anyone else here
in Kattegat.

100
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,784
Ragnar Lothbrok, welcome back.

101
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,873
We know you sailed West
across the open ocean

102
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,288
and found land and plunder,

103
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:54,982
<i>as you promised.</i>

104
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:58,703
<i>So let no man say any more
that it is not possible,</i>

105
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:01,172
and we salute and praise you.

106
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,698
Knut.
You're too late.

107
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,106
You missed the boat.

108
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,877
I came to tell you that
Earl Haraldson summons you

109
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:37,327
to attend him
in the great hall.

110
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,297
It will be a pleasure.

111
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:46,068
Well done, Ragnar!

112
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,079
Are you coming, Knut?

113
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,166
My Lord,

114
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:27,034
it was easy to take
all of these things.

115
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,212
The priests in their temple,

116
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,572
they had no weapons.

117
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,510
They were like babies.

118
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:39,050
Here is one of their priests.

119
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:43,616
We captured several of them
to sell for slaves.

120
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,613
It must be true

121
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:51,476
that there are many more
such holy places in England

122
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,776
<i>and other lands to the West</i>

123
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:59,318
likewise filled
with such treasure,

124
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,374
and to sail there
will benefit us all.

125
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:17,093
How did you find this place
of great riches

126
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:20,336
when all before you had failed?

127
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,167
My Lord,

128
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,601
<i>we were more fortunate
than others.</i>

129
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:32,002
We had Thor on our side.

130
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,249
Thor. Thor. Thor.

131
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,923
Yes.

132
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,479
Then you were indeed fortunate.

133
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,175
But you understand that
all this belongs to me,

134
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,541
<i>by right.</i>

135
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:55,897
My Lord, me and Floki paid
for the boat.

136
00:12:56,223 --> 00:13:00,907
Surely we are entitled to...
some reward, and my crew...

137
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:03,739
You want me to pay you

138
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,479
when you took these things
as easily as from babies?

139
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,711
Here's what I've decided
to do...

140
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:31,109
<i>Each one of you
can take one thing</i>

141
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:32,619
<i>from this haul.</i>

142
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,557
One?

143
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:37,464
Yes. And you'll still be richer
than you were before.

144
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:44,538
Now, all the world can see

145
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:47,500
how magnanimous and generous
is your Lord,

146
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:52,466
especially since you
disobeyed me.

147
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:58,736
<i>So, Ragnar Lothbrok,</i>

148
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:02,498
what will you choose?

149
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:42,996
I will take the priest
for my slave.

150
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:47,609
The priest?

151
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:01,760
Granted.

152
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:12,487
Why did you do that?

153
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:15,062
Why did you give everything away
so easily?

154
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,380
We wasted our time.

155
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,045
I never should have
believed in you.

156
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:24,013
He was looking for an excuse
to kill us.

157
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,896
Why would we go to Valhalla

158
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:28,412
after such miserable
and pointless deaths?

159
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,273
Brother, believe me,

160
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:37,663
this is not the end,
it's just the beginning.

161
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,079
Well...

162
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,552
At least we didn't give
everything away so easily.

163
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:56,699
That's your one thing?

164
00:15:58,163 --> 00:15:59,927
How should he ever find out?

165
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,961
You idiot!

166
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,355
Would Odin expect us
to do anything so stupid?

167
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:12,422
<i>You have your Odin
and I have mine.</i>

168
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,259
Why don't you go get drunk,

169
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:18,388
spend all this on whores.

170
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:21,781
Make sure the Earl really finds
out that you stole from him.

171
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:01,122
What a hoard is this!

172
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,719
What a hoard it is.

173
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,879
See what you've done, my Lord?

174
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,698
Never doubt your power.

175
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:13,486
<i>With just a few words,</i>

176
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:17,093
you stripped Ragnar Lothbrok
of all his treasure.

177
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,059
<i>He's nothing to you,</i>

178
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,145
and you are all power,

179
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,685
all authority.

180
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:31,795
You can have whatever you want.

181
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:48,686
<i>They told me you'd come home!</i>

182
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,948
Father! You're home!

183
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:53,734
Little man...

184
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,755
Did you reach the West?

185
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:08,946
So...

186
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,516
Where's all the treasure
you promised?

187
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,410
The Earl took it all
for himself.

188
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:20,821
But I found it,
and it filled the boat.

189
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,925
I believe you.

190
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,633
You ought to believe me.

191
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,796
This is a priest
from the temple to prove it.

192
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,402
Priest!
This is my family.

193
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,424
His name is Athelstan.

194
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:41,227
<i>Although he's a foreigner,
he speaks our language,</i>

195
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,439
don't you?

196
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:45,023
A little, yes.

197
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,908
What is wrong with your head?

198
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,468
When we become monks,
they cut our hair.

199
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,829
It marks us out.

200
00:19:56,854 --> 00:20:00,686
If you're a priest,
which God do you like best?

201
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,002
There is only one God.

202
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:09,497
Here, you can touch him.

203
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:12,537
Are we keeping him?

204
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:13,958
Hello.

205
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:18,201
I've missed your smell
and your body.

206
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,344
<i>Why do you wear this?</i>

207
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:26,276
<i>All monks do.</i>

208
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,780
Look at his feet.

209
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,528
<i>Athelstan.</i>

210
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:16,056
Athelstan, we want to ask you
something.

211
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:22,600
Come and join us, priest.

212
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:24,732
Come on.

213
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:29,830
Don't you want to?

214
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,231
You'll enjoy it.

215
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:34,312
I am a monk.

216
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,542
I have taken vows of celibacy.

217
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,867
I cannot touch a woman.

218
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,719
I never have.

219
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,519
Wouldn't you like to?

220
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:08,491
It would be a sin.

221
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:09,835
Who would know?

222
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,188
God would know.

223
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:16,811
What if he looked
the other way?

224
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:32,087
Go to sleep then...
with your God.

225
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:45,219
<i>Is this what you wanted?
There are so many...</i>

226
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,796
<i>Bjorn, where are you going?</i>

227
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,329
Time for breakfast.

228
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,766
Agh!

229
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,300
What age are you, boy?

230
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,048
Thirteen.

231
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,090
<i>Thirteen.</i>

232
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:11,887
The age my boy would have been.

233
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,383
<i>The men will soon be going
on the summer raids,</i>

234
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,022
are you looking forward
to joining them?

235
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:21,508
I dream of it.

236
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:24,352
I'm already a good fighter,
like my father was.

237
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:27,667
That's why I chose you,

238
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,106
because you're broad
and strong.

239
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:40,262
That's deep enough.

240
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:45,416
Come.

241
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:09,461
Why are you burying
all this treasure?

242
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:12,129
Don't you know anything, boy?

243
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:14,490
Odin promises that a man
will have the use

244
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,127
of everything he has hoarded
up after he is dead

245
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,742
and wakes up again in Valhalla.

246
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:22,835
But the hoard needs protection,

247
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:25,432
somebody to look after it...

248
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:30,589
In this life...
and the next.

249
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:39,167
You've already seen enough
of this life, boy.

250
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:41,870
Aghhh! Oh!

251
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,519
No more.

252
00:27:32,925 --> 00:27:34,415
We don't like those
in our house

253
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,613
to go hungry or thirsty.

254
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:48,687
I am very curious
about England.

255
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:50,685
Does it have one king

256
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,936
who rules over
the whole country?

257
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:01,573
There are four kingdoms

258
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,175
with four kings.

259
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:09,378
You landed in the Kingdom
of Northumbria.

260
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:14,616
The king of Northumbria
is called Aelle.

261
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:17,844
He is a great king.

262
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:21,375
A powerful king.

263
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:23,744
Then why did his men
not protect your temple?

264
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:28,530
Before you came,

265
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:31,584
we had no need
to protect our monastery.

266
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:34,016
We lived in peace.

267
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:38,705
Everyone respected it
as a place of God.

268
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:46,493
Why does your God need
silver and gold, hmm?

269
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,318
He must be greedy...

270
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:53,546
Like Loki!

271
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:56,545
We have greedy gods too.

272
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,376
My God is not greedy.

273
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:05,231
His kingdom is not
of this world.

274
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:08,251
Then why is his kingdom
so full of treasure?

275
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:13,290
Christian people
give away their riches

276
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:15,666
to the churches and monasteries

277
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,863
in order to save their souls.

278
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,996
What are their souls?

279
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,262
I want to learn
some of your language.

280
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:38,063
Will you teach me, priest?

281
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,137
<i>You. Come.</i>

282
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,928
<i>Ragnar Lothbrok.</i>

283
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,602
My Lord.

284
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,790
And how do you find
your new slave?

285
00:30:34,987 --> 00:30:36,355
Hmm...

286
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:40,274
I find him very useful,
as you will discover.

287
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,738
So what do you want?

288
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:46,875
<i>I want to sail West again.</i>

289
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:49,163
I have spoken at great lengths

290
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:50,534
with my Christian slave.

291
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:53,348
He is not a stupid person,

292
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:55,832
however stupid his God is.

293
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:58,493
<i>He has traveled a great deal,</i>

294
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,484
and he has told me that there
are many countries to the West.

295
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,830
He has also told me
about his England,

296
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:09,718
about his kings
and his customs.

297
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:12,401
And what are we to do
with his customs?

298
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,626
He has informed me
of a large town,

299
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,741
near to the temple
that we raided before.

300
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:20,309
And in this town there
are other temples,

301
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:23,225
and surely other riches.

302
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,691
No! I was lying!
There's nothing there!

303
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,140
<i>Shhh!</i>

304
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,025
You see?

305
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,415
This town is clearly
worth a visit.

306
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,810
<i>Give us back our boat.</i>

307
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,198
Let us go there and find out.

308
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,216
<i>What do you have to lose?</i>

309
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,327
<i>Any plunder we take
will be yours to do with</i>

310
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,719
as you please.

311
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:46,883
I could go there myself.

312
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,050
<i>Ragnar yes, you could, my Lord,</i>

313
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:51,765
but why put yourself in danger?

314
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,507
Why not leave it to someone

315
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:57,306
who has more... experience
of this journey,

316
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,192
and someone who is
more expendable?

317
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:18,565
Very well.

318
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,601
I sanction this raid...
On one condition:

319
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:26,315
a warrior I trust
goes with you.

320
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:27,596
Knut.

321
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:32,073
You will go with him
for my sake.

322
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:33,771
Trust me, Lord.

323
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:37,267
I will take very close care
of your interests.

324
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:42,248
O Lord, forgive me
for what I have done.

325
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,142
You will not regret this.

326
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,778
He's found a new way
to navigate the sea.

327
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,660
Find out what it is.

328
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,603
<i>Run away if you want.</i>

329
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,356
<i>I have the Earl's permission
to sail back to England.</i>

330
00:34:09,587 --> 00:34:11,339
I want to leave
as soon as possible.

331
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:18,447
How soon is that?

332
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,684
Tomorrow.

333
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,438
We all wish you success.

334
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:32,627
We will sacrifice to Odin.

335
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,320
Are you not coming?

336
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,266
What?

337
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,214
I want you to come with me.

338
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:51,372
But the farm, the children.

339
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,142
Bjorn is still too young,

340
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:56,312
although he can help
on the farm.

341
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,436
But who is to be in charge?

342
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,570
<i>The priest.</i>

343
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:04,893
<i>I will leave him with a key.</i>

344
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,947
Father! You cannot place
a slave above me,

345
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:10,105
your natural son.

346
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,953
<i>I don't regard him as a slave.</i>

347
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:17,516
He's a responsible person.

348
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,448
Please, Ragnar Lothbrok,

349
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:22,533
don't do this.

350
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:26,253
What do you think, Gyda?

351
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:29,718
I don't mind.
I like the priest.

352
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,040
Hmm...

353
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:32,903
Then it is decided.

354
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,742
If any harm befalls
my children,

355
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:56,271
I will tear the lungs
out of your body, priest.

356
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,197
Oof!

357
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:45,311
Answer me this, Knut:

358
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,281
are you really with us?

359
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:49,979
Understand this!

360
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,344
A war band lives...

361
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:57,886
and dies together.

362
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:03,543
If you cannot trust the men
to either side of you,

363
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:06,968
or in front of you,

364
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:11,052
you are already a dead man.

365
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,153
I am with you.

366
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:22,737
I made a mistake before -
I did not come with you.

367
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:27,268
Now I fear Odin will make
a bad judgment of me.

368
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:32,524
For me, that's as important
as it is for you.

369
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,108
Just wanted to ask.

370
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,993
Ungh!

371
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,249
Ragnar!

372
00:43:02,602 --> 00:43:04,267
Ha! Hi-yah!

373
00:43:34,493 --> 00:44:11,485
