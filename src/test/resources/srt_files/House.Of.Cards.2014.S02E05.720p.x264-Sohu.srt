1
00:00:01,178 --> 00:00:02,768
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:05,824
The president is like a lone
tree in an empty field.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,682
He leans whichever way
the wind is blowing.

4
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,386
And right now, Raymond Tusk
blows far too strong from the West.

5
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:15,910
<i>The People's Republic of China
will not be threatened.</i>

6
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:19,655
<i>Any future bilateral trade</i>
<i>talks will be impossible.</i>

7
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:20,982
We need to fix this.

8
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,932
<i>- And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.</i>
- Let me freshen your memory.

9
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,546
<i>I don't owe you any favors.</i>

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,026
You will have this.
You slide it into the server.

11
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:29,921
I didn't sign up
for Bonnie and Clyde.

12
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:31,825
You're a productive asset,
Gavin.

13
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:35,874
But the moment you stop being
productive, no lawyer can help you.

14
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:38,683
Head into the nearest office
and shut the door.

15
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,999
She's going to ask why
you had the abortion.

16
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,765
I haven't had one.
I've had three.

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,621
Three? No, you need
to stick to one.

18
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,239
- Are you saying that you were...
- Raped.

19
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:48,656
- Was he charged?
- Francis pinned stars on him.

20
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,264
General Dalton McGinnis.

21
00:00:53,289 --> 00:02:26,855

23
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,129
Oh!

24
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,129
Come in.

25
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,809
Mr. Feng, it's time.

26
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:52,529
Ten thousand.

27
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,407
Let's go.

28
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,567
Here began the last bloody march

29
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,087
toward Appomattox,

30
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:13,807
where General Grant met
General Lee for the first time,

31
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,767
and brave men bled to set
the course of history.

32
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,087
I'm so honored to be here
celebrating the 150th anniversary

33
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:21,647
of the Overland Campaign.

34
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,647
Thank you to County
Administrator Roberts,

35
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:25,767
to all the dedicated
re-enactors,

36
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,847
and of course
to Governor O'Keefe

37
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:31,488
for organizing such
a wonderful three-day event.

38
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:35,527
- That's all, sir?
- That's it. Short and sweet.

39
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,008
Or at least just short.

40
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:46,127
In Gaffney, people called it
the War of Northern Aggression.

41
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:48,567
I personally take no
pride in the Confederacy.

42
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:51,126
Avoid wars you can't win,
and never raise your flag

43
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:54,447
- for an asinine cause like slavery.
- He's on his way.

44
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:55,848
Fine.

45
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:02,727
- People will move on.
- They won't.

46
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:05,927
- The less you say, the more they'll dig.
- Let them.

47
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:11,368
- Willa, could you give us two seconds?
- I'll be right outside.

48
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:20,528
McGinnis happened in college.

49
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,527
The abortion
happened five years later.

50
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:27,248
- There aren't any medical records.
- None at all?

51
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,607
We specifically made sure.

52
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,247
A nurse, somebody
in the waiting room?

53
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,008
The doctor was
the only one there.

54
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,166
- Then where is he now?
- It's a long time ago, Connor.

55
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,728
He passed away.
And if I'm not worried, you shouldn't be.

56
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,649
Even still, sexual assault is part
of the conversation now.

57
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,527
Every article and column
mentions you.

58
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:48,647
If we offer nothing,
we can't shape your image.

59
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,007
I made it very clear,
I don't want exposure.

60
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,248
When we have something
new to say, we'll say it.

61
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:58,407
Willa? Any luck
with the Joint Chiefs?

62
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,527
The chairman's office still
says he's unavailable.

63
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:04,886
But they did offer to send the
director of the Joint Staff.

64
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,087
- Eleven a.m. tomorrow.
- Confirm it.

65
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,807
We'll meet in Francis's
office at the West Wing. Anything else?

66
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:12,086
No. I should get going.
Hit the road.

67
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,248
Thank you, Connor.

68
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,927
Get Congresswoman Brooks
on the phone.

69
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:21,487
And see if the First Lady
will be available this afternoon.

70
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:23,929
You want a brief on everyone on the
Chinese side of the summit?

71
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,487
No. What Durant's doing in Washington
is a facade. This is the real negotiation.

72
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,087
Give me what you have on Feng.

73
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:34,447
Xander Feng. Deep family
connections to the party.

74
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:36,967
Grandfather fought
side by side with Mao.

75
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:40,767
Big in the telecom industry.
Estimated net worth is over 50 billion.

76
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,167
- More than Raymond's.
- By a few billion, but who's counting?

77
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,567
Do they have any
other business partnerships

78
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:49,167
- other than the rare earth refinery?
- Not that I could find.

79
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:51,367
All right. Get a progress
update from Durant.

80
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,047
Tell her I'll be in touch as soon
as we know what Feng wants.

81
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,646
When a man like Raymond Tusk
gets involved in state diplomacy,

82
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,807
you can be sure he's not
after the Nobel Peace Prize.

83
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:03,567
He's an opportunist.
But so am I.

84
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:08,446
Maybe this is my opportunity
to loosen his grip on the president.

85
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,487
You must be the manager.
Thank you for having us. Good morning.

86
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,727
Mr. Vice President,
do you have any idea how long...

87
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,607
Any comments
on the talks with the Chinese?

88
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,206
Can we get a
comment on the summit talks?

89
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,006
The vice president will
be working from his room

90
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,887
for the remainder of the day.
All day.

91
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:38,046
Mr. Feng, it's a pleasure.

92
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,927
Likewise,
Mr. Vice President.

93
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,607
- Coffee? Tea?
- I have already been offered.

94
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,048
- But thank you.
- Thank you, Meechum.

95
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:53,726
It's a long flight from Beijing.
You must be exhausted.

96
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:58,287
I keep Western hours.
My midnight is your midnight.

97
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:01,327
So have you had a chance
to look over the proposal?

98
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:03,487
- I have.
- Shall we?

99
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,207
Page four.

100
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,607
- The refinery.
- With Mr. Tusk.

101
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,168
With the highest bidder.

102
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,247
We are prepared to offer
Clayton West a 40-year lease

103
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:21,327
on the Mei Mei rare earth elements
refinery, to which I will lend my name.

104
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,567
I understand that you and
Raymond are business associates.

105
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:26,206
But you're gonna have
to open it up to bidding.

106
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,286
Mr. Tusk will outbid
any competitors.

107
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:31,327
Well, even so, you know,
for appearances.

108
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:34,927
Yes. Appearances.
If you must.

109
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:38,966
- So there are no issues here, then?
- We may proceed.

110
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:43,047
- Page six.
- The bridge.

111
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:47,647
The committee on foreign investment
will approve a pilot infrastructure project

112
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:51,446
to build a bridge over the
Long Island Sound from
Port Jefferson to Milford

113
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,286
in exchange for a 25-year
toll-taking contract.

114
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:59,167
Before we consider the bridge,
there's one more item I'd like to discuss.

115
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:01,127
Consider? I thought
the bridge was definite.

116
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:05,167
- Nothing is definite.
- This bridge is a priority-one item.

117
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:09,327
It's very important to your
president. I understand.

118
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,767
What would you like to discuss?

119
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,887
The currency manipulation suit

120
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,247
which you have filed against us

121
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,286
in the World Trade Organization.

122
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,607
Which we are prepared
to drop if all other conditions are met.

123
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,927
The point of this meeting
is to allow us to say things

124
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,967
that cannot be said
in formal settings, yes?

125
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:28,406
- Yes, of course.
- We don't want you to drop the lawsuit.

126
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:33,286
Forgive me, I...
I don't understand.

127
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:37,006
Do not back off in the WTO.

128
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:40,086
But you've been fighting us on
currency manipulation for years.

129
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:42,047
Free-floating
currency is inevitable.

130
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,968
Now I have something
I can work with.

131
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,046
- Why the suddenn change of heart?
- Not sudden.

132
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,446
It has taken those of us
who are more forward-thinking

133
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:53,366
many years to convince
our counterparts.

134
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,847
But China could just do it.
I mean, you know as well as I,

135
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:59,407
- you don't require WTO ruling.
- Appearances, as you say.

136
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:05,687
It's important that it looks like America
forced us out, not that we gave in.

137
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,806
Well, I'll need a little
more time so that I can
brief the president.

138
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,407
I'm here for
as long as necessary.

139
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:14,168
However you would like to communicate,
I leave that to you.

140
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,248
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
- Thank you, Mr. Feng.

141
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:26,127
In Gaffney, we had our
own brand of diplomacy:

142
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:30,288
shake with your right hand,
but hold a rock in your left.

143
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,527
Well, look who got
stuck with the pool.

144
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,807
We volunteered
because we hate ourselves.

145
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:41,249
- All's well on the Southern Front?
- No news is no news.

146
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,407
Come on. I hear there's
muskets out there.

147
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,127
When you giving us
something real?

148
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,007
We're here in beautiful
Spotsylvania, aren't we?

149
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,246
This is dress-up for
grown men with toy guns.

150
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,286
Sounds like 500 words to me.

151
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,527
Tell Durant that China won't discuss
the bridge unless we drop the WTO suit.

152
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:58,529
I thought you said
they want to keep it?

153
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,967
Feng does, which means Tusk does.
But we don't know if Beijing does.

154
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,406
You think Feng's lying?

155
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,087
An open currency could
free up interest rates,

156
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:07,567
reduce inflation in China.
They both profit.

157
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,487
If they're forcing
Beijing's hand, or we are,

158
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:12,286
- that could throw the summit into chaos.
- Exactly.

159
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,567
Look, Feng may
well have support,

160
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,647
but my guess is that the
Standing Committee's divided.

161
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:18,527
Either way, we'll
throw them off balance.

162
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:19,846
Let's leak we're
dropping the suit

163
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,686
as soon as Cathy presents it.

164
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:24,126
Just the lawsuit?
Nothing else in the leak?

165
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:27,328
A hint of Feng, but no names.
Let's let this grow on its own.

166
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,166
- How was that?
- Much better.

167
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,767
I feel good.
What do you think?

168
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:41,206
- I think you're ready.
- How long on the code?

169
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,765
Just a couple of bugs
to work out.

170
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,566
I told them tomorrow
or Wednesday.

171
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,686
- Work's not done.
- If I postpone again,

172
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,287
- don't you think it'll draw attention?
- It'll be done when it's done.

173
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,327
I'll email you when
the bugs are fixed.

174
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:54,327
Somewhere public.
Place and time.

175
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,807
Hey. Are you sure you
want to do this?

176
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,606
- I understand the risks.
- Well, you think you do.

177
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,327
This isn't the first time
I've been in danger.

178
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:06,886
Oh, yeah?
Paper cuts at the<i> Herald?</i>

179
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,366
Death threats. When I
exposed a drug ring in DC.

180
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,646
No, I read the articles.
That's small-time.

181
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,367
I almost had to go
into protection.

182
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:17,406
This is the FBI.
It's not a few street cops.

183
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:23,085
You think you're badass because
you're on some vigilante anarchy kick?

184
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,807
At least I have the balls
to put my name on the work I do.

185
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:31,087
You've never faced a hundred
years in prison, you self-righteous prick.

186
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:34,367
Most of my friends are locked up
and rotting away 'cause they poked the bear

187
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,126
one too many times. Why?

188
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,327
They wanted to expose government
surveillance, the PRISM program,

189
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:42,887
embezzlement, abuse,
fucking torture, lies.

190
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,367
You're a journalist? Who gives
a shit? We're fucking soldiers.

191
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:52,367
It's personal for me now.

192
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:55,127
I don't have a choice,
but you still do.

193
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:00,767
I don't have a choice.

194
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:09,007
- Where did you get this? - You can say
a source close to the Chinese delegation.

195
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,846
- Give me a name.
- All I know is that it's

196
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,886
a Chinese businessman with
ties to the Standing Committee.

197
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:14,806
- Back-channeling the summit.
- In Washington?

198
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,487
- I don't know.
- With who?

199
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:19,046
- I don't know that either.
- If I called the USTR's office,

200
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:22,726
- they'll confirm?
- I'm telling you as much as I know.

201
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,726
Why are you telling me
this at all?

202
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,087
They're going public with it tomorrow.
You might as well get the scoop.

203
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:28,886
Why me specifically?

204
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,006
You deserve better
than a Civil War reenactment.

205
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,407
Please don't pretend you've suddenly
become Santa Claus.

206
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,726
I give you something now,
maybe you remember.

207
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:41,167
- It's an investment in the future.
- I'm not big on favors.

208
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,528
I said "maybe."

209
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:51,846
Connect me to the USTR's office.
Skip the press secretary.

210
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,606
Tell them I want
to talk about the WTO suit.

211
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,847
- Who did you speak to?
- Connor.

212
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:59,127
- He's talking to Ayla Sayyad.
- How much did you fill him in?

213
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,566
- The bare minimum.
- I'd be a lot more comfortable

214
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,806
if it was you going directly,
as we discussed.

215
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,726
This puts distance on me,
which puts distance on you.

216
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,006
I want you to meet with Feng
tonight. No proxies.

217
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,886
- Understood.
- Now where are we with Mr. Goodwin?

218
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,288
Any day now.
Thirty-five to life.

219
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,927
Cyberterrorism.
The penalties are stiff.

220
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,006
- This needs to be clean, Doug.
- It will be.

221
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:28,885
One fall of the axe.

222
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:31,807
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,127
Well, I just think what
you did took so much bravery.

224
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:40,806
To go on air like that in front of
the whole country and say what you did?

225
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,927
That means a lot to me.

226
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:46,767
And I admire what you both have been
doing to advocate for the, well,

227
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:50,166
- for the victims.
- Women. Like you and me.

228
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:53,566
- Not victims.
- Men too. It's not gender-specific.

229
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,086
Well, yes.

230
00:14:56,087 --> 00:15:01,525
- Would you consider pitching in?
- How?

231
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:06,486
It would send a strong message if
we had the First Lady in our corner.

232
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:11,326
- If you think I could help. - Well, we
have thehead of the women's caucus.

233
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,206
Both wives from the White House.

234
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,925
That's a meeting they couldn't
sweep under the rug.

235
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,646
And the fact that the chairman
sent anyone is promising,

236
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,366
but we need to make sure
our message gets back to him.

237
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:25,846
I just... I haven't been through
the same sort of experience.

238
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,126
Well, why should
that prevent you?

239
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,606
I don't know if I have a right

240
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,285
- to speak about it.
- You're the First Lady.

241
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:34,928
You have the right to speak
about anything you want.

242
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,166
- Mr. White?
- Mrs. Marbury.

243
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,606
- I'm Susan.
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

244
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,527
I know I'm a little off the beaten path.
Did you have any trouble finding me?

245
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,926
No, the directions were great.
Easy as pie.

246
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:50,328
Well, good. Come in.

247
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,245
I have to admit, I've been
looking forward to this all day.

248
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,006
I didn't realize you were
announcing so soon.

249
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,126
We've had some great luck
with the endowment.

250
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,286
Well, my husband didn't get much
recognition while he was alive.

251
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:10,006
I was so thrilled when Planned Parenthood
asked to name a fund after him.

252
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,606
We're thrilled that
you're open to it.

253
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:15,445
When you called, you said
you had some questions?

254
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:18,006
They're delicate. That's why
I wanted to come in person.

255
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:21,606
- Delicate how? - There are
a lot of people who will protest

256
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,887
this sort of financial
assistance to minors.

257
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:26,727
And we want to make sure
they have no cause to smear us.

258
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:30,246
People tried to smear my
husband his entire career.

259
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:33,487
He never let it affect
the work he was doing.

260
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:36,208
Did your husband ever perform
any illegal abortions?

261
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:42,325
I need you to answer me,
Mrs. Marbury.

262
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,646
Did your husband
perform any illegal abortions?

263
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,767
I won't discuss that.

264
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:49,807
- Nothing unreported?
- Young man.

265
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:54,126
You're not old enough to remember,
but there was a time when every...

266
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:59,126
What about any prominent figures
who the antichoice crowd could vilify?

267
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:02,846
- No. - Did Dr. Marbury perform an
abortion for Claire Underwood?

268
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:06,806
- No, he did not.
- I know for a fact that he did.

269
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:11,486
That is not true. And I
would like you to leave now.

270
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:16,966
Forgive me, Mrs. Marbury.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

271
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:21,608
My name's Seth Grayson.
I don't work for Planned Parenthood.

272
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,408
Mr. Feng?

273
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,566
There's speculation back home
that the back channel is you.

274
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,447
Two separate
articles in Hong Kong...

275
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,006
there's your name.

276
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:36,688
Do you want me
to contact the vice president?

277
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:41,726
No. Let him come to me.

278
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,287
Get Mr. Tusk on the phone.

279
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:50,086
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

280
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,846
I'm doing this for your
own good, Mrs. Marbury.

281
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:57,205
Imagine the media frenzy,
your husband's legacy destroyed,

282
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:00,566
the press hounding you
day and night,

283
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,646
and the Planned
Parenthood fund... gone.

284
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,806
How do I know you work for her?

285
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:09,166
That you're not just some
right-wing fanatic who wants to destroy...

286
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:12,966
Because I wouldn't have done
you the courtesy of paying a visit.

287
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:19,166
There would've been an army of satellite
trucks at your door instead of me.

288
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,325
Well, I won't tell anyone,
if that's what you're worried about.

289
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:26,126
I believe you.

290
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:29,166
Did your husband keep records
of any kind of who he assisted?

291
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:32,566
Anything at all? Notes?
Unofficial records?

292
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:36,127
- He kept a journal.
- Do you still have it?

293
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:54,367
- May I?
- Go ahead.

294
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:01,606
- I need to take this with me.
- Can't you just take out that page?

295
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:06,166
Someone finds this with pages
missing, that could raise eyebrows.

296
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,007
There's 60 years
of his life in there.

297
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:12,526
From when we met until he died.

298
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,486
And do you want six decades
reduced to one night in August,

299
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:20,006
25 years ago?

300
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,086
Just imagine what it
looked like back then.

301
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,006
At the edge of the ridge was
a dense thicket which allowed

302
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:27,766
the Northern troops to come in
and form on the Mule Shoe.

303
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,526
The Southern regiments were entrenched
in this area at the apex of the line.

304
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:36,046
As you can see, the topography forced
the two sides down towards each other.

305
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,767
- This is the Bloody Angle?
- That's right.

306
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,286
I was reading
about it last night.

307
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,126
Close quarters,
hand-to-hand combat.

308
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:46,005
All told, about 15,000
Union and Confederate soldiers

309
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:47,925
lost their lives here
at the Bloody Angle

310
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:50,686
on a battlefield that's
only about half a mile wide.

311
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,726
Now, Mr. Vice President,
we have a surprise for you today.

312
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,007
I'd like to introduce you to
Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood

313
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,326
of the 12th Regiment
of McGowan's Brigade,

314
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,726
your
great-great-great-grandfather.

315
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:05,166
- I died here, in this battle.
- I think there's been a mistake.

316
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,925
My grandfather never mentioned
any Underwoods in the war.

317
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,086
We did our research. He
definitely fought and died here.

318
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:13,806
I was 24. And my son,
your great-great-grandfather,

319
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:15,886
was two years old.
I never met him.

320
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,247
It happened here?
At the Bloody Angle?

321
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:21,886
At the edge of those woods.
My skull was bashed in with a rock.

322
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,686
Thank you.
Now, over here,

323
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:27,406
we've got something that's
very interesting as well.

324
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,287
Just a moment.

325
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,846
- Tell me more.
- It was the middle of the night.

326
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,805
We were out of musket balls.

327
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:41,766
Just bayonets, and only
half of us had those.

328
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:45,566
I had nothing.
Just these hands.

329
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:49,246
So dark you
couldn't see nothin'.

330
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,686
But you could hear 'em,
the Yanks, running toward us.

331
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:53,726
Then you could smell 'em.

332
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,326
First Yank that brushed up against me,
I grabbed him by the throat.

333
00:20:56,327 --> 00:21:01,767
Fall down on the ground.
I bit him so hard I could taste the bone.

334
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:07,287
Then he grabs a rock, brings it down
right here. That was that.

335
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:10,686
I was buried in a mass grave.
No headstone.

336
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,487
Can we get a picture
with you and Augustus?

337
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:15,006
Yes.

338
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,047
Thank you.

339
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:32,366
- He takes it rather seriously.
- Oh, yeah, they all do.

340
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:36,928
Now up ahead we have examples
of Confederate ramparts
that we've reconstructed.

341
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,526
You can see how they've cut the timber
and made the trenches.

342
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:42,527
Those trenches traded hands many times
over the course of the battle.

343
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:49,806
- You have keys?
- We own you. Yes, we have keys.

344
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:52,286
- Let me put some clothes on.
- Forget your clothes.

345
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:55,087
And I quote:
"You sure you wanna do this?"

346
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:58,006
And I quote: "I don't
have a choice, but you do."

347
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,846
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

348
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,967
He should know what
he's getting into.

349
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:06,046
Are those silk pajamas?

350
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:10,887
Looks even fancier in person.

351
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:15,567
Cashew.

352
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:19,206
No. Don't touch her.

353
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:23,126
Hey, there, little guy.

354
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,205
I've seen you before on camera.

355
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:31,887
Please put her down.

356
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:40,565
Don't take the chance.

357
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:43,886
I bought these shoes at J.C.
Penney. Seventy-two dollars with tax.

358
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:46,686
Rubber soles.
Can clean 'em off with a hose.

359
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:48,486
Please, you're hurting her.

360
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:52,486
I have a pet too.
His name is Gavin Orsay.

361
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,087
Sit!

362
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,247
I said sit.

363
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:08,367
Look what a good boy
you are, Gavin.

364
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:20,085
- Is that what you need me to do?
- Quiet.

365
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:22,326
When I say fetch, you fetch.

366
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:25,846
And now we are going to fetch
Lucas, just like we discussed.

367
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:31,006
If you try to bite my hand,

368
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,166
I will put you to sleep.

369
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,367
Mind if I take a couple?

370
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,886
Doug Stamper. I'm the vice
president's chief of staff.

371
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:01,686
I know. Sit down.

372
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,606
My grandfather fought
in the revolution.

373
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:08,486
China was poor then.
Sugar was hard to come by.

374
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:11,207
Now, sugar
is everywhere in China.

375
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:16,767
- Do you like Old Fashioneds?
- No, thanks.

376
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,806
I've seen the news.

377
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:22,406
Your government was enthusiastic about
us dropping the suit.

378
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,646
They've touted it as
a victory back home.

379
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:27,925
It is a victory.
But not the victory we wanted.

380
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,726
We're finding that
difficult to believe.

381
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,725
By "we" you mean
the vice president.

382
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,326
I mean the American government.

383
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:35,046
Which he proclaims to represent.

384
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:37,766
He does.
And I'm representing him.

385
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,405
Don't inflate your status,
Mr. Stamper.

386
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:43,086
You're nothing
but an errand boy.

387
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:45,606
Do you have a message
for the vice president?

388
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:47,686
If he represents
the American government,

389
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:49,848
then why did he fail
to communicate my request?

390
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:52,125
We question your legitimacy,
Mr. Feng.

391
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:57,327
Nothing your delegation has done or said
has in any way supported your requests.

392
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:02,445
Mm... Smell that.

393
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:08,245
I use Macallan Rare and Fine,
1926. Forty thousand dollars a bottle.

394
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:12,206
- You used to be an alcoholic, correct?
- Not used to be. Still am.

395
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:15,807
- A sober one.
- Do you miss it?

396
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:20,805
- Five thousand dollars you just spilled.
- I'll send you a check.

397
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:25,966
I like you, Mr. Stamper, even if you're
just an errand boy.

398
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:30,365
I'll ask you again. What is your
message for the vice president?

399
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:33,806
There will be no Port Jefferson
Bridge unless the lawsuit is reintroduced.

400
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:37,446
When you do, there will be those
on the Standing Committee who protest,

401
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:41,727
but I'll manage them.
The majority want reform.

402
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,685
I'll tell the vice president.

403
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:48,446
Mr. Stamper, one more message.

404
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,125
Please remind the vice president
that we are both here at the behest

405
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:52,927
of our mutual friend, Mr. Tusk.

406
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:55,966
If the vice president
fails to cooperate,

407
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,366
I will simply bypass him.

408
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:07,725
- Yes?
- It's Doug.

409
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:09,247
Fine.

410
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:15,445
Spoke with Feng.
Here's your onion rings.

411
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:20,245
Did you know that General
Longstreet was shot here?

412
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,485
Accidentally by his
own men in the dark?

413
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:25,607
No, I didn't.

414
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:31,646
All right. Bring me up to date.
Where are we with Feng?

415
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,366
He wants us to
resume the lawsuit.

416
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,326
So he's sticking to his guns.

417
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,886
If we don't reintroduce it,
there's no bridge project.

418
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:41,286
Well, that will greatly
upset the president.

419
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:43,846
Do you want me to
deliver Feng's message?

420
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,525
Absolutely not.

421
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:48,445
We want the president angry.

422
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:52,686
The tricky part is making sure
he doesn't direct it toward me.

423
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:56,005
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Get ahold of Cathy's people.

424
00:26:56,006 --> 00:27:01,406
Do not mention the lawsuit at all.
Have them bring up the bridge instead.

425
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:04,726
- Let's see if Feng is bluffing.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,846
We must learn from Longstreet.
He rode too high in the saddle.

427
00:27:10,847 --> 00:27:13,646
If a bullet comes my way
tomorrow, it will not be an accident,

428
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:16,367
and I must be quick to duck.

429
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:22,165
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

430
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,286
Is the vice president attending?

431
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:26,246
No, he's not. He's out of town.

432
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,966
I've just decided to use his office
because it's a bit bigger than mine.

433
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,806
Please, sit.

434
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:38,205
I know this isn't the first conversation
you've had about sexual assault.

435
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,646
We've had a very open dialogue with
the congresswoman for quite some time.

436
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:45,847
"Open" is one way to put it. I think the
Joint Chiefs have tolerated my concerns...

437
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:48,605
To be fair, we've been quite responsive.
Over the past two years...

438
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:51,125
The congresswoman has
expressed her frustration to me

439
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:54,446
- that there's still room for improvement.
- Mrs. Underwood, if I may.

440
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:58,846
- Please. - This is an issue
we've grappled with seriously.

441
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,806
Increased education
and prevention measures,

442
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,005
restructuring
the reporting process,

443
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:05,566
insulating courts-martial
from abuse of power.

444
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:09,765
- It's still not enough. - Civilian
jurisdiction is not gonna happen.

445
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:16,526
We're all aware that's what
the congresswoman would prefer,
but we won't allow our...

446
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,525
- Am I late?
- It's my fault.

447
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:21,445
The meeting got pushed up.
I meant to e-mail you. I'm very sorry.

448
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,486
That's fine. Please, sit.

449
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,406
We didn't know you'd be
attending, Mrs. Walker.

450
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:29,525
I'm sorry for interrupting.
Continue.

451
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:32,245
As I was saying...

452
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:36,366
...putting sexual assault cases
entirely in the hands of civilian courts

453
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:41,166
fundamentally erodes
the military's ability to self-discipline.

454
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:45,205
What about civilian oversight
instead of civilian courts?

455
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:46,926
That's a slippery slope.

456
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:49,486
There were those who
said the same of racial integration.

457
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:52,125
Integration didn't
change the core operational nature...

458
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:55,125
But it did prove that the military
could shape its own evolution.

459
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,245
Absolutely. But in this case,

460
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:59,406
civilian oversight
is not the answer.

461
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:02,647
My husband is a
civilian who oversees the military.

462
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:05,845
Are you suggesting that
civilians can offer no guidance

463
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,885
- in matters like this?
- Forgive me, Mrs. Walker.

464
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:10,485
I didn't mean
to suggest that at all.

465
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,366
Then maybe you should
listen to the civilian

466
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:18,925
- sitting across from you.
- Yes, ma'am.

467
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,966
This is from your own sexual
assault prevention literature.

468
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,405
And in it, it says

469
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:30,685
in some cases it may
be advisable to submit than to resist.

470
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:35,166
I think it's quite clear that
there's still room for improvement.

471
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:43,165
Did you know about Xander Feng?

472
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,245
Not until I saw his name
on the wire.

473
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:48,605
He's been charged with corruption twice.
Both times, the charges were dropped.

474
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:50,645
Do you know what happens in
China if you're convicted?

475
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:52,645
- I'm guessing it's not good.
- You die.

476
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,365
- There you go.
- We're talking about a man

477
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:56,485
who's only one kangaroo court
away from lethal injection,

478
00:29:56,486 --> 00:30:00,485
who's filthy rich and clearly corrupt,
and this is who the Chinese send?

479
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:02,726
- You are asking the wrong guy.
- Stop dodging.

480
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:05,686
I passed a note in class.
That's all.

481
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:09,085
<i>We placed</i>
<i>our faith in you, Frank.</i>

482
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:11,005
We still have the rest
of the day

483
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,845
- and all of tomorrow, Mr. President.
- <i> I need this bridge.</i>

484
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,645
<i>Otherwise we have to stall</i>
<i>my infrastructure program.</i>

485
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,725
No foreign investment,
no deficit reduction.

486
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,365
<i>And the Chinese know this.
They're using it for leverage.</i>

487
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,205
- Yeah, but for what?
- <i> That I'm not sure of.</i>

488
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:25,285
Then why did we send you
to Spotsylvania, Frank?

489
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:27,085
<i>You're supposed to have answers</i>
<i>to these questions.</i>

490
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,885
<i>Mr. President, I spoke</i>
<i>to Mr. Feng an hour ago.</i>

491
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:31,445
<i>- What'd he say?</i>
- Here comes the bullet.

492
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,525
<i>He claims that Frank hasn't been</i>

493
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:35,206
<i>delivering</i>
<i>his messages properly.</i>

494
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:38,525
I have conveyed
his requests word for word.

495
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:40,645
<i>He says you've been</i>
<i>doing the opposite.</i>

496
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:42,606
Who is responsible for
the back-channeling here?

497
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,887
<i>- Me or Raymond?</i>
- You are, Frank.

498
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:47,205
I'm simply here to facilitate,
not negotiate.

499
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:49,445
<i>And yet you continue</i>
<i>to have private conversations</i>

500
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:51,846
<i>- with Beijing's supposed emissary.</i>
- Listen, Frank...

501
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:54,885
<i>Are you prepared to trust Mr.
Feng's word over mine, Raymond?</i>

502
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,606
No one is doubting
your word, Frank.

503
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,765
<i>If Feng is truly representing</i>
<i>his government's interests,</i>

504
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:01,326
why is he telling Raymond
one thing and telling me another?

505
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,326
<i>How do you explain the</i>
<i>bridge falling through?</i>

506
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,126
He personally profits
from a free-floating currency.

507
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:09,806
Just as anyone would who's in business
with him, such as yourself, Raymond.

508
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:13,445
The refinery and the bridge
are two completely different issues.

509
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:15,806
Let's keep our focus here.
I want the bridge

510
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,726
back on the table.
End of story. Catherine?

511
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:20,045
<i>It'll be the first item I bring up</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

512
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:23,086
<i>Frank, stay put for</i>
<i>now. But don't contact Feng.</i>

513
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:24,564
<i>And that goes for you too,</i>
<i>Raymond.</i>

514
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:27,086
I don't want any more back-channeling
until the bridge is revived.

515
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:28,605
And Catherine, you communicate

516
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,324
- directly with me.
- Yes, sir.

517
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:32,006
We're done here.

518
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:35,085
The first drops of blood
have been spilt.

519
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:37,085
Bullet grazed my cheek,
but I haven't fallen.

520
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:39,245
Doug, find me a way
to meet Feng.

521
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:41,766
- We need to discuss something first.
- What's wrong?

522
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,886
I just got off the phone
with a guy named Seth Grayson.

523
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,006
- I've spoken to my husband.
- Doug told me.

524
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,485
- Thank you for fitting me in today.
- Is that it?

525
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:59,245
- August '86.
- And why should we trust you?

526
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:01,687
There was evidence that
Connor didn't make disappear.

527
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:05,405
I could've taken this to<i> Us Weekly</i>
and bought a new house.

528
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:08,565
Instead, I brought it to you.

529
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:12,206
And why didn't you apply when I was
interviewing candidates?

530
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:16,965
There was no point. Willa doesn't
like me. I intimidate her.

531
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:19,686
That journal is my
version of a résumé.

532
00:32:21,326 --> 00:32:23,645
Or extortion.

533
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:26,085
I'm not extorting you,
Mrs. Underwood. I'm just...

534
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:29,805
...highlighting the difference between
a good choice and the right choice.

535
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:33,925
And tell me, how would we handle the
repercussions of firing our comm director

536
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:37,565
- three months after we hire him?
- You don't fire him.

537
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:41,645
You tell him that you're bringing me
on board to help with the workload.

538
00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:43,685
He stays on with you,
I cover your husband.

539
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,646
Connor will hate
working with me.

540
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:47,525
I'll arrange a job offer
elsewhere in a few months.

541
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:50,965
By the time it comes in,
he'll want to move on.

542
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:56,724
Connor knows. What's to prevent him
from going public?

543
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:01,606
I can handle Connor Ellis. You just have
to take me on my word on that.

544
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:06,885
Here's what I know.

545
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:11,645
It is far easier
for you to destroy me

546
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:13,726
than the other way around.

547
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:22,127
- I have to speak to my husband.
- Of course.

548
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:30,767
I didn't make any copies.
You have the only one.

549
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:52,246
Johnnie Walker Black. Neat.

550
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:57,726
- Where is it?
- It's in my pocket.

551
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:00,646
Come on.

552
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:03,846
- Is something up?
- No. We're good to go.

553
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,405
You seem nervous.

554
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:07,045
Just because I've been breaking
the law for 20 years

555
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,327
doesn't mean I don't
still get nervous.

556
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:12,724
- Gavin...
- Do not say my name.

557
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,407
Look at me.

558
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:21,165
This is gonna be fine.
We've practiced. I'm confident.

559
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,566
This is gonna work.

560
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,766
I got your drink.

561
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,285
He's more than qualified.

562
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:57,684
<i>What do your instincts tell you?</i>

563
00:34:57,685 --> 00:35:00,445
That I just don't want
to end up more exposed.

564
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:04,206
<i>Well, Grayson already knows.</i>
<i>I mean, we don't exhibit some degree...</i>

565
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:07,565
Have Doug look into him.
Let's see if there's some leverage.

566
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:11,007
Yeah, but we don't know what
he'll find or when or what
he'll do in the meantime.

567
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,165
And that puts us
into uncharted territory.

568
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,885
<i>Connor will expose us</i>
<i>too if we let him go.</i>

569
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:17,285
Not if it goes smoothly.

570
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,726
<i>If we turn away Grayson now,</i>

571
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,526
<i>we can't predict anything.</i>

572
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:23,326
<i>And look, he has a lot less</i>
<i>to lose than we do.</i>

573
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,125
OK.

574
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,325
I just, I don't think
we can trust him, Francis.

575
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,845
<i>We wouldn't be having this conversation
if Connor had done his job.</i>

576
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:34,645
<i>I'd rather manage someone</i>
<i>I don't trust than someone who's reckless.</i>

577
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,565
Fine. What's the next step?

578
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:38,205
<i>I'd like to talk</i>
<i>to Grayson myself first.</i>

579
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:40,645
And then I'll have
Doug talk to Connor.

580
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:43,965
<i>- How are you doing?</i>
- You been following the news?

581
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:46,965
<i>- Is it bad for us or good?</i>
- Could go either way.

582
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:50,766
<i>- I'm here if you need me.</i>
- I'm back tomorrow.

583
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:55,087
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Love you too.

584
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,165
- We all set?
- All set, sir.

585
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,927
Let's go.

586
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:23,245
No, no. Turn those off.
Turn those off.

587
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:26,406
- Where is he?
- Right this way, sir.

588
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:11,445
- Did Augustus play?
- I like to think I did.

589
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:13,605
What's your name?

590
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,284
When I'm here,
I'm Augustus Underwood.

591
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:18,645
- What's your real name?
- Doesn't this feel real to you?

592
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:23,446
Will you show me where he died?
The exact spot.

593
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,326
I will, sir.

594
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:37,645
I'm gonna pay respects to my ancestor.
I would appreciate a little privacy.

595
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:40,687
- We'll wait here.
- Little John on the move.

596
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:48,486
- Just beyond those trees.
- Thank you. I'll be good from here.

597
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:09,525
We're fine.

598
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:12,805
- I hope you haven't waited long.
- It's peaceful here.

599
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:18,525
- I didn't mind. - Peaceful now. Fifteen
thousand men died in these woods.

600
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:21,445
My grandfather's grandfather
died where we're standing.

601
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:25,406
- My grandfather was killed
in the revolution. - So I've heard.

602
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,885
Do you fear death,
Mr. Vice President?

603
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:33,205
No more or less than any man.

604
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:36,724
It motivates me,
to experience everything.

605
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,605
Accomplish all I can
before it all vanishes.

606
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:41,325
I think you and I are
similar in that regard.

607
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:44,005
Then why are we working
at cross-purposes?

608
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:49,405
What you mean is, why am I not
submitting to you and Mr. Tusk?

609
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:50,964
You are sabotaging
the negotiations.

610
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,925
And you're using them
for your own personal ends.

611
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:56,565
Wrong. It's taken me
seven years to convince

612
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,644
the Standing Committee
that this was the right course of action.

613
00:38:58,645 --> 00:39:02,165
A course of action that will
earn you and Tusk billions.

614
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,605
Why did you want this meeting,
just to attack me?

615
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:07,405
To send a message to Raymond.

616
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:10,285
The president of the United States and
I are not his puppets.

617
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:11,925
Now, you tell him that.

618
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:15,245
Fine. The bridge deal is dead.
There will be no saving it.

619
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:19,685
Stick a knife through its heart and put
an apple in its mouth. I won't shed a tear.

620
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:23,085
- Your president will ascribe
the failure to you. - I'll take the risk.

621
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:24,884
Think strategically,
Mr. Vice President.

622
00:39:24,885 --> 00:39:26,965
You're setting us
on a very dangerous course.

623
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:35,525
Do you know how Grant
defeated Lee?

624
00:39:35,526 --> 00:39:37,925
He had more men.
That's all.

625
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:40,485
And he was willing
to let them die.

626
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:43,924
It was butchery, not strategy,
which won the war.

627
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,844
Mr. Tusk and I have great
resources at our disposal.

628
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:52,045
Add up all your billions together
and you get the GDP of Slovakia.

629
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:55,284
I have the federal government
of the United States of America.

630
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:57,645
Your money
doesn't intimidate me.

631
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,525
The most that you can buy
is influence.

632
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:04,165
But I wield
constitutional authority.

633
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,844
The strongest army
doesn't always win.

634
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:08,685
Mao started out
with only a few thousand men.

635
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:11,005
They took over half a continent.

636
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:12,564
Mao is dead.

637
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:15,406
- And so is his China.
- But I'm not.

638
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,605
Not yet.

639
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:22,525
Don't forget, your ancestor
fought for the losing side.

640
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:24,926
There is no sacred ground
for the conquered.

641
00:40:42,886 --> 00:40:46,565
We have over 9,000 servers here,
utilized by several hundred clients.

642
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:49,885
Everything from small businesses
to major corporations.

643
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:53,406
- What are some of the largest clients?
- The largest here is AT&T.

644
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:58,804
Their servers occupy more
than half of the floor space.

645
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,686
- Can you show me?
- Yeah.

646
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,246
Right this way.

647
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:21,525
Did you or did you not
meet with Feng last night?

648
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:24,125
<i>- Where is this coming from, Raymond?
- - Answer the question.</i>

649
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:27,245
I have not contacted him since
you and I spoke, Mr. President.

650
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:30,045
- Just as you instructed me to do.
- -<i> Not according to Feng.</i>

651
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:32,525
I believe you were also instructed
to avoid him too, Raymond.

652
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,605
<i>He reached out to me.</i>
<i>I just answered the call.</i>

653
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,485
We had clear,
pre-arranged terms, Frank.

654
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:37,965
Months of back-channeling.

655
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:39,924
<i>I am on the frontlines,</i>
<i>Mr. President.</i>

656
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:41,884
<i>And I can tell you firsthand</i>
<i>that we are dealing</i>

657
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:44,205
with a regime that
is not being forthright

658
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:47,405
and will seize upon the
faintest whiff of trepidation.

659
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:50,885
This is a test to see how far
they can push us before we break.

660
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,444
Do not play their game.
End the talks.

661
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:55,364
<i>We can't overreact here.</i>

662
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:57,284
Well, they walked away
from the Joint Commission.

663
00:41:57,285 --> 00:41:58,845
<i>We can walk away</i>
<i>from the summit.</i>

664
00:41:58,846 --> 00:42:01,124
The economic fallout
would be catastrophic.

665
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,606
- The market will...
<i>- Or we can just kowtow and submit</i>

666
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:06,324
- to the new reigning superpower.
- -<i> Don't be hyperbolic.</i>

667
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:08,924
Well, we are dealing with
one quarter of the world's population.

668
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:12,045
Mr. President, you would
be making a disastrous mistake.

669
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:15,565
Where are your allegiances, Raymond?
To Xander Feng or to the United...

670
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,605
<i>- Don't you dare question me...</i>
- All right. Silence.

671
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:21,045
<i>There were two</i>
<i>mistakes. Both of them mine.</i>

672
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:23,565
The first was allowing you,
Raymond,

673
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:25,565
to enlist one of your business
partners for these talks.

674
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:27,604
- I was trying to...
<i>- The second</i>

675
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,645
<i>was enlisting you, Frank.</i>
<i>Instead of clarity,</i>

676
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,405
<i>we got miscommunication.</i>
<i>That's poor diplomacy.</i>

677
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:32,884
Mr. President, listen...

678
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,445
I have listened to both of you.

679
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:37,204
And all I've heard
is accusations.

680
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:41,245
Now, if neither one of you will take
responsibility, I will. We're pulling out.

681
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:44,845
<i>And it's not because you suggested it,
Frank, it's because you've made</i>

682
00:42:44,846 --> 00:42:49,445
<i>such a mess of these</i>
<i>negotiations I have no other</i>
<i>choice than a show of strength.</i>

683
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:52,924
You both disappointed me...
greatly.

684
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:57,446
- Mr. President?
<i>- The president has left the call.</i>

685
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:05,925
<i>Raymond, are you still there?</i>

686
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:08,965
That's the first time he's
ever hung up on me...

687
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:13,684
<i>- ...in 20 years.</i>
- Oh, I feel for you.

688
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:17,125
Goodbye, Frank.

689
00:43:19,206 --> 00:43:21,405
And the butchery begins.

690
00:43:21,406 --> 00:43:25,165
It's all the way down this row
and the next seven rows over.

691
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:29,325
- You wanted to see inside one, right?
- Yeah. That would be great.

692
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:34,765
Go ahead.

693
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:37,165
There's not much to it,
actually.

694
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,044
Just a lot of
hard drives and wires.

695
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:42,245
So, in terms of backup,
if the power goes down,

696
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:46,004
some natural disaster hits like a storm,
or an earthquake, what exactly...

697
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:47,445
- On the ground.
- No, no...

698
00:43:47,446 --> 00:43:49,565
Right now.
I said on the fucking ground.

699
00:43:55,206 --> 00:43:59,085
Why don't you ride back to DC with me?
We need to discuss something.

700
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:02,644
- What's up?
- We'll talk about it in the car.

701
00:44:02,645 --> 00:44:07,565
Today, we break earth on
the Overland Campaign Visitors Center,

702
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:12,205
so that generations to come
will fully absorb the importance

703
00:44:12,206 --> 00:44:14,125
of this hallowed ground,

704
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:18,005
the wilderness
where the campaign commenced.

705
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:26,325
Augustus,
would you do the honor?

706
00:44:38,525 --> 00:44:43,645
And now, a moment of silence
and prayer for the dead.

707
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:10,446
Thank you.

708
00:45:11,726 --> 00:45:14,886
And God bless
the United States of America.

709
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:21,966
I just heard.
We got Lucas Goodwin.
