1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:15,698
My man.

2
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:50,893
Ain't but $290 here.

3
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,592
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy...

4
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,492
a kickback's supposed to be $500.

5
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:58,992
Stash got hit, yo.

6
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,891
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!

7
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:06,990
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.

8
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,291
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!

9
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,490
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.

10
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,089
You gonna see who you're fucking with!

11
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:22,488
Do I look like a fucking punk?

12
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:27,388
Yo, shorty.

13
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,688
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.

14
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,286
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?

15
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:43,386
Fuck, this is bad shit!

16
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,586
Fuck, this is really bad.

17
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:49,684
Shit.

18
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,084
Get your ass out that car.

19
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:54,184
All right!

20
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,384
Shut up.

21
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:02,183
Where the money at? Check his socks.

22
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:04,983
You got something for me here, Zig?

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,383
You got some dough for me, man?

24
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:10,083
Jesus, jackpot.

25
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,482
Man, hold up, man.

26
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:16,580
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,280
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know....

28
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,680
What the fuck you think this is, man?

29
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,380
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,679
Is that what you think, man?

31
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,378
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.

32
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:38,679
Yeah, I know it did.

33
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,177
All right, look, how about the coat?

34
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,877
Take the coat, all right?

35
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:47,777
I paid two large for it...

36
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,876
so that, plus the cash I gave you...

37
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:54,276
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.

38
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,075
You know I will!

39
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,575
You know right there, you can fix that.

40
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,975
$2,000?

41
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:03,674
For this?

42
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,073
Not even a black man could style that shit.

43
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,073
You know what I'm saying, man?

44
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,372
What you laughing at, man?

45
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:18,173
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.

46
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:22,072
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!

47
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:26,571
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.

48
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,172
Yo, take my man's ride.

49
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,369
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!

50
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,268
Fuck you!

51
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,153
Why me?

52
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:44,252
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.

53
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:47,352
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.

54
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,051
I'm not saying I don't want it.

55
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,050
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.

56
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,551
Yeah, I thought about that, too.

57
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,249
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster...

58
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,949
I'm saying to myself:

59
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:06,849
"Why take a man
who already burned you once...

60
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,249
"who already proved himself disloyal?"

61
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,849
Now, why would I do that?

62
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,647
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.

63
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:25,446
Because if I caught him once...

64
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:28,746
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.

65
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:33,346
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time...

66
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,346
so that it won't happen again.

67
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:37,045
No, sir, it won't.

68
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,444
One other thing...

69
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:45,043
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.

70
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:48,443
Your paycheck may say "sergeant,"
but on this detail...

71
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,543
Det. Greggs runs your team.

72
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,842
Same as it ever was.

73
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:24,738
Well?

74
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:29,938
I'm in.

75
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:32,438
Come here, you sweet bitch.

76
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:33,537
Motherfu--

77
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:37,836
Don't be grabbing my dick, faggot.

78
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:43,935
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.

79
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:46,536
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.

80
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,135
Summit Silver 450.

81
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:53,835
Top of the line, right here.

82
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,534
Over there?

83
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,031
Yo, Bubs.

84
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,831
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.

85
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:21,031
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?

86
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:24,231
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?

87
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,029
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me...

88
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:32,828
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.

89
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,728
What the hell is that?

90
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:38,928
A Baltimore knot.

91
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,728
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?

92
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:45,628
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.

93
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,826
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.

94
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:52,126
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?

95
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,125
That's old business. You remember Bird?

96
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:58,425
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.

97
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:02,025
He said you can reach him
here at this number.

98
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,725
You can leave a message.

99
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:08,523
Good work, Bubs.

100
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,123
As always. Here.

101
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:15,623
Cab fare.

102
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:25,621
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.

103
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:29,121
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about...

104
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,620
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.

105
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,220
I mean, what the fuck, man?

106
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,020
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.

107
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,919
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf...

108
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,319
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.

109
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,718
Why? He play you hard?

110
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,017
I go at him respectable...

111
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,618
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.

112
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,817
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel...

113
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:58,417
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.

114
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:00,917
I damn near pissed in my pants...

115
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,116
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.

116
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:04,517
It ain't funny.

117
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:07,615
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things...

118
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,416
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:

119
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:13,015
"Good work, bubs," and a little bit of this.

120
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,214
For your pains.

121
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,813
Where are we at with the Jane Does?

122
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:23,713
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons...

123
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:26,713
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.

124
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:29,513
How's the port police broad
working out for us?

125
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,112
She knows the docks okay.

126
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,712
No detective, though.

127
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:36,912
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.

128
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:39,511
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.

129
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:41,410
You're detailed temporarily.

130
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,910
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over...

131
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,109
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?

132
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:55,409
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.

133
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,108
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.

134
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,408
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.

135
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,306
How's it feel?

136
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:16,106
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.

137
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:17,806
The deck has a harbor view?

138
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:19,505
Yes, in two directions.

139
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:22,305
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.

140
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:27,005
-This ain't Federal Hill.
-Excuse me?

141
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:28,905
This is the Point, Locust Point.

142
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:33,704
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street...

143
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:36,503
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.

144
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,203
Are you two house hunting?

145
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,503
We just started.

146
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:43,202
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.

147
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,802
-This particular house--
-Is my aunt Treesey's.

148
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,901
Really, your aunt?
ls she a relation to the McDonalds?

149
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,601
Nope. She's a relation to me.

150
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:57,801
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.

151
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,700
Is that the price?

152
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,799
That's the listing, yes.

153
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,699
They ain't gonna get that much, right?

154
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,698
I can't say for certain, but one just like it...

155
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:17,298
in the 1 200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.

156
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,397
$340,000?

157
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:25,596
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

158
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,095
Maybe we should rent.

159
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,994
We're here because Valchek wants us here...

160
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:49,294
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local...

161
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,593
has too much money.

162
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,393
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs...

163
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:54,992
on the union hall phones.

164
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:58,392
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.

165
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:01,692
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it...

166
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,591
and buy ourselves a little time.

167
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:05,991
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.

168
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,691
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night...

169
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,990
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.

170
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,190
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?

171
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,689
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.

172
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,790
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy...

173
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,788
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?

174
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:24,787
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.

175
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,388
I'll show you how it's done, homes.

176
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,488
Cool Lester smooth.

177
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,087
What's happening?

178
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:36,786
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail...

179
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:39,686
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.

180
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,286
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?

181
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,586
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.

182
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,485
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.

183
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,384
-Then we did you a favor.
-I wouldn't go that far.

184
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,383
But fuck it. Who we chasing?

185
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,183
Frank Sobotka?

186
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,383
-How fucking good is he?
-You know the man?

187
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,882
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week...

188
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,083
working that case about
dead girls in the container.

189
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:07,182
He a suspect?

190
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:10,382
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.

191
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,882
-Why are you on him?
-My father-in-law hates his guts.

192
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,281
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.

193
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,580
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.

194
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,980
So you're thinking drugs?

195
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,380
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?

196
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,079
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just...

197
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,379
with Terrell being sick and all....

198
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,079
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.

199
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,878
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up...

200
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,877
with something out of the mix.

201
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:44,577
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.

202
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,876
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it...

203
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:50,176
and give back some time for family.

204
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,876
For you and me and Terrell.

205
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,776
Family?

206
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,876
They thinking about
how they can do for you.

207
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,275
They making all these plans...

208
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,174
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.

209
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,773
Stringer says so, anyhow.

210
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,973
Why you be like that?

211
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:14,073
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?

212
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:17,573
They playing you with that
"We're family, and it's all about love."

213
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:18,772
That's how they do.

214
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:21,772
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.

215
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:23,972
It's just about business, Donette.

216
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:28,071
Dee, they gonna be there for us.

217
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,369
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.

218
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,769
-You know Stony got that check.
-Slow down, fool.

219
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,869
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.

220
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,969
-Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
-I ain't got no ends.

221
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,368
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.

222
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:46,168
No, I ain't say that.

223
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:50,568
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.

224
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,267
-Fuck you all.
-Yeah, motherfucker?

225
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,064
Yo, B.

226
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,465
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.

227
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:21,364
Damn.

228
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,362
What the fuck was that?

229
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:36,362
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.

230
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,661
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?

231
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,561
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.

232
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,361
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.

233
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,560
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.

234
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,058
Zig, what's up?

235
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:14,257
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?

236
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,156
Fucking niggers got me.

237
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,256
What?

238
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,855
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.

239
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:24,154
You hear me? They got my fucking car.

240
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,154
If I had a gun, I swear to God...

241
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,754
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.

242
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,854
-You call the cops?
-Can't.

243
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,754
It was over some dope.

244
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,953
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?

245
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,853
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.

246
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,951
From who? White Mike?

247
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,651
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.

248
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,451
-A few ounces, you know?
-Why not White Mike?

249
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,250
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.

250
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,050
Why the fuck would I know how he be?

251
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:05,950
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.

252
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:10,649
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.

253
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:14,147
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.

254
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:18,247
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.

255
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,747
And now they're telling me...

256
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:23,046
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.

257
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:28,446
I need $2,700.

258
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,545
So?

259
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:33,945
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.

260
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,745
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?

261
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,442
I ain't giving you the money.

262
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,042
They're gonna kill me.

263
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,142
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.

264
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,142
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.

265
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,640
I ain't got it for you, Zig.

266
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,738
You cocksuckers.

267
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,334
-Major in?
-Yeah, just knock.

268
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,534
Yeah?

269
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,332
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.

270
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:07,632
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.

271
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,732
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.

272
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,631
Okay.

273
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,731
Fuck with my ass, will you?

274
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,628
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.

275
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,128
All right, your research papers are here.

276
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:36,328
Remember Friday, take-home test.

277
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,627
Well done, Mr. Bell.

278
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:46,627
-Mr. Lucas, you got five minutes?
-Absolutely.

279
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,327
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.

280
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:50,426
I'll try.

281
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,725
What are the options
when you got an inferior product...

282
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,824
in an aggressive marketplace?

283
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:03,225
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.

284
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,624
And if you don't?

285
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:07,624
Reduce price to increase market share.

286
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,324
That assumes low overhead.

287
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:11,923
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss...

288
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:14,723
and worse, as your prices drop...

289
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:18,223
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.

290
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:23,121
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.

291
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:27,521
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.

292
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,321
-So he proposed--
-To change the name?

293
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,821
Exactly.

294
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:47,417
Which one?

295
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,417
He's got a weenie in his hand.

296
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,718
On this case, ain't that you?

297
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:00,116
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.

298
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:02,616
What the fuck is that?

299
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:04,216
Grand jury summons.

300
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:05,716
Grand jury?

301
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:07,516
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.

302
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,816
You lie to them, it's perjury.

303
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,514
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.

304
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:21,613
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?

305
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,513
That's John Spamanato right there.

306
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,312
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?

307
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,212
Johnny Fifty?

308
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:33,712
What the fuck is that?

309
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:37,112
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.

310
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:41,511
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.

311
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,210
"Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City."

312
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,509
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?

313
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,710
Everybody on that ship testifies.

314
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,909
About what?

315
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,909
About them girls in the can.

316
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,009
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.

317
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,108
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock...

318
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:02,909
in a box, dying there in the dark because....

319
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:07,706
Because why, Detective?

320
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:12,606
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?

321
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:16,805
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?

322
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:21,106
I got a wife and three sisters.

323
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:23,105
And they got daughters.

324
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:26,805
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off...

325
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,405
at what's in your heads right now.

326
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:31,804
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.

327
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:33,703
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!

328
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,502
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!

329
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:39,502
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?

330
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:40,902
I take the fifth commandment.

331
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,302
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?

332
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:46,302
-I don't remember.
-Don't remember what?

333
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:47,501
Nothing.

334
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:52,001
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S. Iocal on the East Coast...

335
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,501
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.

336
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,800
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.

337
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,999
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.

338
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,899
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.

339
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,499
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon...

340
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,298
Ronnie "The Union Buster" Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.

341
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:13,298
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!

342
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:24,497
These four ain't working today.

343
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,496
You wanna leave the papers here...

344
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:30,495
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.

345
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:34,094
Come on.

346
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,295
-Today?
-Now!

347
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,992
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr. Gant...

348
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,992
as a .380 semi-automatic.

349
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,691
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:

350
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:02,091
"Australian, or one of those 'A' countries."

351
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,991
Is that correct?

352
00:25:04,091 --> 00:25:05,191
Indeed.

353
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,790
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?

354
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,390
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.

355
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,189
Mr. Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine...

356
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,589
who manufactured the weapon?

357
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,189
I wasn't.

358
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:21,188
Then how were you able
to relate that information...

359
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:22,688
to the detectives?

360
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,387
Bird showed it to me.

361
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,988
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?

362
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:33,887
Which murder we talking?

363
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:36,987
Bird committed more than one murder?

364
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,786
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?

365
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:44,086
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody...

366
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:46,485
talking about this deed and the next.

367
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:50,284
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.

368
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:55,084
Mr. Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside...

369
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:57,683
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.

370
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,082
I thought he did good.

371
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:12,282
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me...

372
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,581
putting that sociopath on the stand.

373
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,881
You got to admit, it'll be different.

374
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,381
Dress him up at least.

375
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,180
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.

376
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Here's a voucher for court clothes.

377
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,379
Anything with a tie.

378
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:45,976
I'm saying, Dirt...

379
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:48,677
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.

380
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,676
You see what I'm saying, yo?

381
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,276
Well, I'll be.

382
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:55,175
All the time I be telling you, be on post.

383
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:58,575
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib...

384
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,975
trying to play house with them bitches.

385
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:04,174
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here...

386
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,674
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?

387
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:09,973
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?

388
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,572
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.

389
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,973
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.

390
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,972
How'd we do, Charlie?

391
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:27,071
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.

392
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:30,271
They don't scare, them guys.

393
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,069
What now?

394
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,369
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?

395
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:40,069
A Cl?

396
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:42,969
An informant.

397
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,468
You ain't got no informants on the dock?

398
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:50,768
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?

399
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:58,467
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.

400
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:02,266
Meaning, we ain't about much.

401
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,765
The voucher says $150.

402
00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:13,964
Look on the clearance rack.

403
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,064
-It's a look.
-No, it ain't.

404
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:26,462
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.

405
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:28,362
I'll see you in about a half-hour.

406
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:32,962
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.

407
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:40,361
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.

408
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:46,360
Where's he at?

409
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,459
Said he had to go get his props.

410
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:00,457
1 2-08.

411
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:01,958
12-08.

412
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,257
Request lateral with 1 2-10.

413
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:06,757
KGA, he can meet me on 6.

414
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,157
Do you copy, 12-08?

415
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:09,957
10-4, on 6.

416
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:14,456
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?

417
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:18,156
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.

418
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:32,054
What's up? You need a little help?

419
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,753
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?

420
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:37,153
-You got it to spend?
-For sure.

421
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:40,553
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.

422
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:49,050
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.

423
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,750
All in the props.

424
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,747
Feel any different? Me neither.

425
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,047
-Special Agent Cleary.
-Jim McNulty, from the city.

426
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:19,647
How can I help you?

427
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,647
Found floating off the Key Bridge.

428
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:25,346
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.

429
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:28,246
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.

430
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:31,845
-Homicide fellows.
-Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?

431
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:34,745
-Yeah, you working with them?
-Sort of, I fished her out.

432
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:37,545
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.

433
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:39,544
You're kidding, right?

434
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:42,543
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know...

435
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:45,543
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.

436
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,743
Step into my world, Virginia.

437
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,542
A grand jury?

438
00:30:56,242 --> 00:30:59,442
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.

439
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:01,242
But you know nothing.

440
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,241
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.

441
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:06,840
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse...

442
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,339
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

443
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,139
You sure?

444
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,039
Horse is a rock.

445
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:19,239
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.

446
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,938
But you say he wants to stop.

447
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:27,437
Yeah, for a little while.

448
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,038
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks...

449
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,137
at least until this shit chills.

450
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,536
These were local police, right?

451
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:35,636
Yeah.

452
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:37,636
Their interest is in the girls.

453
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:40,135
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.

454
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:41,435
A dead end.

455
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,735
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.

456
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:46,535
Another dead end.

457
00:31:46,635 --> 00:31:48,535
The police are going nowhere.

458
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:54,934
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.

459
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,833
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.

460
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,232
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.

461
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:05,632
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.

462
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:08,832
Says he wants the Greek.

463
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:11,331
Says you tell him when and where.

464
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:12,831
Niko.

465
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:19,430
About that other business, the chemicals....

466
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,730
What do you need them for?

467
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,829
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.

468
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:30,829
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.

469
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:32,628
Yeah?

470
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,828
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?

471
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,727
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?

472
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:45,227
Maryland and Delaware only.

473
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,427
Any of them still in your custody?

474
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:50,027
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.

475
00:32:50,127 --> 00:32:51,726
Everyone in that book was deported.

476
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:54,025
You can guess,
some of them are already back.

477
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,425
Any field office have anything active?

478
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,524
That's what I'm looking at right here.

479
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,024
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.

480
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,524
Anything I can drive to?

481
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:06,324
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.

482
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:09,824
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 1 2 in their bullpen four days ago.

483
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:11,123
That'll work.

484
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,123
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?

485
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:17,623
I'll take a day, yeah.

486
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:19,821
What's between you and this girl?

487
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:24,521
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?

488
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:26,721
I have.

489
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,819
Mau. How you been?

490
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,419
-Same old.
-Yeah?

491
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,919
You getting some days?

492
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,417
Pretty much.

493
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:48,517
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.

494
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,117
You want to come in?

495
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:57,017
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.

496
00:33:57,416 --> 00:34:00,816
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?

497
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:06,016
Let me get my jacket.

498
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,314
So I tell him,
"Dee, why you acting like that?"

499
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:19,714
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.

500
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:23,313
He off the damn hook.

501
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:28,312
You tell him about the plans, right?

502
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:32,512
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.

503
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,612
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.

504
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:39,110
He knows some.

505
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,610
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?

506
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,109
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend...

507
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:55,609
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.

508
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,809
He say just leave him alone.

509
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:04,608
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.

510
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:07,006
Little Donette know how to burn.

511
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,406
Your father bucking us, little man.

512
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,306
What you think about that?

513
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:24,405
Yeah. I think you're right.

514
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:30,604
What you looking at?

515
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:35,802
Fucking Ziggy, man.

516
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:38,303
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?

517
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:40,303
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.

518
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,702
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.

519
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,701
What's up?

520
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,701
Came to see a man about a car.

521
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,599
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.

522
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,999
Yo, Cheese. White boy.

523
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,099
Yo, you got my money, man?

524
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:10,098
That's what we came to talk about.

525
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:12,197
Yo, you got to a lot of heart...

526
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:14,398
coming up in here
without my fucking money.

527
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,897
We thought maybe
we can work something out...

528
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:18,597
so you can get what's yours.

529
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:20,197
How you plan to do that?

530
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:22,997
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.

531
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:26,395
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.

532
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:29,895
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.

533
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:34,095
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much...

534
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,494
I'll give the boy another week to pay.

535
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:43,394
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.

536
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:47,193
You don't believe me?

537
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:49,493
Have a look.

538
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:18,189
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.

539
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,988
And you counted on that?

540
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,588
Who else am I gonna ask?

541
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:26,387
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.

542
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,887
Not even for you am I a snitch.

543
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,487
I'm not thinking about it like that.

544
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:36,587
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together...

545
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,286
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it...

546
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:41,685
he's still a good guy...

547
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:43,786
someone I can talk to about this.

548
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:49,084
How come it didn't go nowhere?

549
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,183
You did good. Who knows?

550
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:58,683
I don't know, you never know.

551
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:06,783
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.

552
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,782
All of a sudden, you're a cop.

553
00:38:10,382 --> 00:38:12,281
Help me with this, Mau.

554
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:17,980
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?

555
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,080
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

556
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,279
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off...

557
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:28,479
Iooking for someone to clue you in...

558
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:32,179
when a lot of what you're asking about...

559
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,778
is right there for the taking.

560
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:35,979
How so?

561
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:41,577
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?

562
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,276
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.

563
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:49,276
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems...

564
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:51,475
then that paper gets tossed.

565
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,576
That don't happen today, right?

566
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,975
Nothing gets tossed anymore.

567
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,674
The computer.

568
00:39:08,273 --> 00:39:09,673
Thanks, Mau.

569
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,169
Well?

570
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:38,969
Good news and bad, Zig.

571
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:41,168
Those fucking niggers.

572
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,068
Give me the bad.

573
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:47,268
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.

574
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:51,668
What the fuck can be good?

575
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,168
You can cancel your car insurance.

576
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:10,365
Let me get two red tops.

577
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:16,264
There we go.

578
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:23,763
I hope you guys are taking notes.

579
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,458
Shit.

580
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:06,757
One-and-one.

581
00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:20,055
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.

582
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:38,453
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.

583
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:45,351
A talk would ease his mind.

584
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:47,551
Ease my mind first.

585
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:50,951
This business with the grand jury.

586
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,351
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.

587
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,650
Just the regular panels.

588
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,349
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.

589
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,750
-And?
-Nobody talks.

590
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,549
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.

591
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:09,249
It is more attention than he expected.

592
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:11,847
He will need money for his lawyers.

593
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:16,347
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.

594
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:18,746
Let the money talk.

595
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:24,547
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.

596
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:26,146
Each one weaker than the other.

597
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:29,046
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.

598
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,445
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers...

599
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:34,645
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.

600
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:36,844
Who got the good shit?

601
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:38,044
Eastside.

602
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:39,943
Eastside, who?

603
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,543
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe...

604
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:46,643
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.

605
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:49,342
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.

606
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,343
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime...

607
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,742
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.

608
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:54,842
Damn!

609
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:59,442
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.

610
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,541
I hear you, man, I'm on it.

611
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,340
You working it out with Dee?

612
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,639
Boy got to find his own way.

613
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:15,539
I'm saying, you know...

614
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:17,738
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.

615
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,638
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.

616
00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:24,238
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.

617
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:26,738
He has something to come home to.

618
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:28,138
Do it.

619
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:33,336
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?

620
00:43:33,836 --> 00:43:37,036
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't l?

621
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:41,235
You've been fair.

622
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:43,436
Too fair.

623
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:57,533
-Where's the Greek?
-He sent me.

624
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:59,433
Fuck you, and fuck him.

625
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:03,732
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee...

626
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:05,332
to help with any legal troubles.

627
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:07,332
He also told me to tell you he regrets...

628
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:10,532
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.

629
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:15,231
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars...

630
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,430
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?

631
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:21,031
I'm done. I'm out.

632
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:22,930
I need nothing more to do with you people.

633
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,729
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.

634
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:34,428
They used to make steel there, no?

635
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:41,727
Smoke from the stacks.

636
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:44,027
But inside....

637
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:08,623
Potassium permanganate.

638
00:45:10,223 --> 00:45:12,023
Spell "permanganate."

639
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:14,623
F-U-C-K.

640
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,121
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?

641
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,621
I'm in the checker's local, right?

642
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:27,921
You know, while you Local 47 boys...

643
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,320
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads...

644
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,320
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.

645
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,519
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?

646
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:46,317
Let me ask you:

647
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:48,818
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?

648
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:50,518
If they want it, they want it.

649
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:53,017
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon...

650
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,817
I'm fucking toasted.

651
00:46:05,915 --> 00:46:08,316
I don't know who you've been talking to...

652
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:11,614
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.

653
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:14,014
-It's not like the old days.
-No?

654
00:46:15,113 --> 00:46:18,413
A little here and there,
but for the most part...

655
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:21,313
the new technology
has changed everything.

656
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:27,112
Look, see this little box right here?

657
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:28,213
You fucking mind?

658
00:46:28,313 --> 00:46:30,312
Ring's a little stressed right now...

659
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,512
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks...

660
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:36,711
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.

661
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:37,910
Bite me.

662
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,810
-Frank, these officers are--
-I know who they are.

663
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,610
Frank here helped set this system up.

664
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:45,709
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.

665
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,409
No problem, chief.

666
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:52,609
In a nutshell, what this shows...

667
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,909
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.

668
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:58,108
The plan calls for 85 moves.

669
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:01,608
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.

670
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:02,808
Now, look at the screen.

671
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:06,107
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record...

672
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:08,706
and puts it in the permanent database.

673
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:12,006
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.

674
00:47:12,106 --> 00:47:14,205
Did our port manager tell you
that right now...

675
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:17,805
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?

676
00:47:18,306 --> 00:47:20,605
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis...

677
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:22,505
we came up 300 light?

678
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,205
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.

679
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:26,404
160?

680
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:27,904
Not that all of them are stolen.

681
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:30,004
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.

682
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:34,803
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.

683
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:37,402
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there...

684
00:47:37,502 --> 00:47:38,902
sometimes waves get knocked down.

685
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:40,702
That happens, a can don't get entered.

686
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:43,402
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.

687
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:48,301
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.

688
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:52,501
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.

689
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:55,000
So imagine February on the docks.

690
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,199
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.

691
00:47:58,399 --> 00:48:00,399
You're saying
that's what happened to the can...

692
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,099
with the girls in it?

693
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:05,199
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.

694
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,298
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer...

695
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:09,598
it might look like
there's some dirt going down...

696
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:11,798
when it's really just a glitch in the system.

697
00:48:11,898 --> 00:48:15,998
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?

698
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:19,597
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.

699
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,797
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.

700
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:26,895
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.

701
00:48:26,995 --> 00:48:30,095
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.

702
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:32,794
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.

703
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:40,594
-Frank give you everything you need?
-He did, thanks.

704
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:43,194
They're playing us.

705
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,491
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?

706
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:54,291
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.

707
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:57,091
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?

708
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:59,991
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.

709
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:02,791
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.

710
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:04,790
-Where do you hold them?
-County detention.

711
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:07,590
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.

712
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:10,890
You all heard of WorldCom?

713
00:49:12,189 --> 00:49:14,189
All right, let's try this.

714
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,789
You all get jacked by some knockos.

715
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:18,588
But you all clean.

716
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:21,487
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.

717
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:23,087
What do you do?

718
00:49:26,988 --> 00:49:28,587
Give another name.

719
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:29,687
Why?

720
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:33,686
Because your real name ain't no good.

721
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:36,686
All right, it ain't good and....
Follow through.

722
00:49:39,986 --> 00:49:42,286
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?

723
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:45,684
Then change up the name.

724
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:46,984
What else?

725
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:50,484
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?

726
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:53,884
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.

727
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:58,283
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?

728
00:49:58,383 --> 00:50:00,882
And then we do, like, some fake competing.

729
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:04,883
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.

730
00:50:04,983 --> 00:50:06,882
There's a thinking man, right there.

731
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:10,082
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?

732
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:13,981
You and my uncle talk?

733
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,580
How'd it go?

734
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,480
No problem.

735
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,080
Three boxes.

736
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,079
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle...

737
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:33,879
that it's three times the usual fee for each.

738
00:50:38,277 --> 00:50:41,576
We checked on those chemicals.

739
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:44,177
We looked into that.

740
00:50:44,277 --> 00:50:46,276
I was worried, you know?

741
00:50:49,976 --> 00:50:53,276
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.

742
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:55,575
A bomb or some shit?

743
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,775
I ain't down for that.

744
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:03,374
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?

745
00:51:04,373 --> 00:51:05,574
Cocaine.

746
00:51:10,873 --> 00:51:13,572
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.

747
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,072
No problem.

748
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,173
When?

749
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:18,472
End of the week.

750
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:25,372
Maryska.

751
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:29,071
She's good with English.

752
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,569
They're dead.

753
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:38,769
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.

754
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:08,865
What did she say?

755
00:52:09,165 --> 00:52:13,264
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?

756
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,560
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?

757
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:56,458
A computer?

758
00:52:56,558 --> 00:53:00,758
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.

759
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:01,958
You're looking for what?

760
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:06,057
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.

761
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:09,157
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway...

762
00:53:09,257 --> 00:53:11,856
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.

763
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,756
Not to me, it doesn't.

764
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:15,656
I'm not bringing your open murders...

765
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:18,255
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.

766
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:19,354
Lieutenant!

767
00:53:19,454 --> 00:53:23,155
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka...

768
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:26,454
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.

769
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:28,854
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement...

770
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:30,754
and running an investigative unit again.

771
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:33,954
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.

772
00:53:34,054 --> 00:53:37,452
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.

773
00:53:37,653 --> 00:53:39,553
Rawls, Landsman...

774
00:53:40,452 --> 00:53:43,752
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.

775
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:46,851
We got enough room for it here, anyway.

776
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:00,950
You can set up here at the off-site...

777
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,550
and we can share information.

778
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:05,149
But the murders stay with Homicide.

779
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:10,647
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.

780
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:43,643
Three ROIROs, four containers.

781
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:46,243
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers...

782
00:54:46,343 --> 00:54:47,643
and we're still short.

783
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,743
-A good day.
-That it is.

784
00:54:52,843 --> 00:54:56,742
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.

785
00:54:56,842 --> 00:54:58,042
Even you.

786
00:55:03,442 --> 00:55:06,040
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?

787
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,639
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!

788
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,139
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.

789
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:15,838
Triple?

790
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:28,738
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.

791
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:32,137
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.

792
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:35,136
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.

793
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:39,035
But the writing's on the fucking wall.

794
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,135
Fuck the wall.
