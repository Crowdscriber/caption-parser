00:00:01,175 --> 00:00:02,787
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:05,573
The issue at stake is whether the
White House was in any way involved.

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:08,234
Just the act of laundering
Chinese contributions is illegal.

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,964
Douglas Stamper,
your chief of staff.

5
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,511
This is him at Lanagin's casino,
July 14th.

6
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:14,946
They have evidence of Doug being
where he shouldn't have been.

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,767
- We're talking about impeachable offenses.
- Not at all, sir.

8
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:19,898
You're scared. I can tell.

9
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:21,233
I'll say whatever
you want me to say.

10
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:23,458
- She could indict you.
- That's what having a staff is for.

11
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:27,279
Even Achilles was only as strong
as his heel.

12
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:28,314
We need to be louder.

13
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,870
If the bill goes to the floor
as is, I won't just bow out.

14
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,122
I'll actively fight it.

15
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:34,092
If you ask me, she's
betraying our country too.

16
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:37,405
Multiple fronts, Remy.
It has to be Jackie Sharp.

17
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:38,453
Then I was right.

18
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:40,532
- About what?
- How little I meant.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,074

20
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,706
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.

21
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,338
He's worried about his marriage
counseling, as he should be.

22
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:55,018
- If you're worried about your marriage
counseling, you shouldn't be.
- Imagine the fallout...

23
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,824
- This one address keeps popping up.
- Underwood?

24
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,018
The President.

25
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:04,592
You're parsing the law, and
I'm talking about a spiritual code.

26
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,110
Confidentiality is a covenant,

27
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,249
not only between myself
and those I counsel,

28
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,400
but also between myself
and the Lord.

29
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,480
Dr. Larkin, my chief focus here
is the money laundering.

30
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:19,040
If the President brought up Xander Feng,
Raymond Tusk, the Adohi casino...

31
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,719
Doesn't matter what the focus is. I can't
share anything we discuss privately.

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,760
Religious guidance is protected.

33
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,960
But you were also conducting
professional therapy.

34
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,680
- I never claimed that.
- Mr. and Mrs. Keith confirmed as much.

35
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,440
We were at their house.

36
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:36,240
But they didn't participate in our
conversations, so how would they know?

37
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,720
So you're saying that you
only gave religious counsel.

38
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,680
That's how I choose
to interpret it.

39
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:48,000
The President and his wife have
never once attended your church.

40
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,960
- They're not even the same denomination.
- Irrelevant.

41
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:52,880
Not legally speaking.

42
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,040
I'm certain I can convince a judge to
issue a subpoena on the grounds

43
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,681
that you weren't their
legitimate spiritual advisor.

44
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:01,919
Which is your prerogative,
but I can appeal.

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,401
- And I would.
- You'd lose.

46
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,560
The only circumstance
by which I would talk

47
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:12,121
is if someone personally
waived their privilege.

48
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:15,281
Otherwise, I'd rather face
contempt of court.

49
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:16,601
It's a matter of ethics.

50
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,120
Mr. President.

51
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,960
Aww... You brought it back in.

52
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,880
Floyd Mayweather visited
the White House this morning.

53
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,519
- I thought he'd get a kick out of it.
- Did he have a go at it?

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,320
He threw a combination I thought
would bust the stitching loose.

55
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,200
That must have been
a treat to watch.

56
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,600
He was telling me,
it's not just about the power.

57
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,760
There are plenty of boxers
more powerful than he is.

58
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,800
No, it's his tactics,
his precision, his speed,

59
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,360
most important,
his counterpunch.

60
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:55,160
He dances and dodges, then picks
the perfect moment to strike.

61
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,920
Does that sound familiar?

62
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,679
How do you mean, sir?

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,240
You gave this to me
as a gesture of friendship.

64
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:07,199
When I look at this now,
I don't see friendship,

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,002
I see calculation.

66
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,240
You set me up, Frank.

67
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,919
- What?
- Your back-channeling,

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,880
the special prosecutor...

69
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:24,761
When I think about Raymond,
about Linda, about Jim Matthews...

70
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:28,960
You are wrong, sir.

71
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,880
Questions from Dunbar,
about the marriage counseling.

72
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,120
"It's a needle in the haystack,
she's not trying to find."

73
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:39,280
That's what you said.
Well, she found the needle.

74
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,600
- I am shocked, sir, I never...
- Like hell you are.

75
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:45,120
- You want to diminish me.
- Diminish you?

76
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:49,040
Laying the groundwork
for a challenge in 2016.

77
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,080
I am sorry to have to say this, sir,
but you are being ludicrous.

78
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:55,040
Do you really think
I'm so blind?

79
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,520
A vice president has never
challenged a sitting president!

80
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:01,240
You've climbed the ladder doing
things other men would never do.

81
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,120
Always in service
to you and the party.

82
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,960
It was your idea
to hand over those logs.

83
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,520
You connected the White House
to China, the casino.

84
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:11,321
Raymond Tusk entangled us
with China and the casino.

85
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:14,600
- And if I hadn't intervened...
- You can't dodge and duck like Floyd.

86
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,201
I've learned your moves now.

87
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:22,079
This office breeds paranoia.
Don't give into it, sir.

88
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,440
I'd ask for your resignation if
it wouldn't make things worse.

89
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:29,200
But from this moment forward,
I don't want to hear your voice.

90
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,920
I don't want to see your face.

91
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:35,560
And if I do, I will put you
on your goddamn back.

92
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,400
Exile.

93
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:47,480
I've managed to isolate
the president from everyone...

94
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:50,121
...including myself.

95

96
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:30,079
"Congresswoman Sharp is a perfect example
of how the military brainwashes us

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
into never questioning
the party line.

98
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,920
Her opposition to the bill
is disgraceful.

99
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:38,399
It will cost thousands of men and women
the justice they deserve,

100
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,560
- and some of them their lives."
- Those are Megan Hennessey's words.

101
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,760
- They're biased...
- They're Claire's words.

102
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,079
Hennessey's just the mouthpiece.
Why does it say I declined to comment?

103
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,999
You said you didn't want to kick
up dust if we could avoid it.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,240
It's<i> The New York</i> fucking<i> Times.</i>
You should've let me know.

105
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,879
That was my call.
I'll take the blame.

106
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,480
Find out when Hennessey's
next appearance is.

107
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:01,240
- I want to beat this bitch down.
- I know she went after you.

108
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:04,440
- but going after her...
- Not her, Claire Underwood.

109
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:08,319
I understand how Garrett might misconstrue
things, given the pressure he's under,

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,920
but you can't honestly
believe it yourself.

111
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:13,119
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to believe anymore.</i>

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
Francis is devastated.

113
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,360
All he wants to do is help, but he
feels like he's being unfairly accused.

114
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:22,120
<i>I don't want to believe it, Claire,</i>
<i>but Garrett is convinced.</i>

115
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,719
Will you talk to him?

116
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,879
I have to concentrate on keeping
my family together right now,

117
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,479
not getting
into arguments over...

118
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,360
<i>If Francis were</i>
<i>really up to something,</i>

119
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:32,960
don't you think he would've
told Dunbar about the therapy?

120
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,600
He basically did, by forcing us
to hand over the logs.

121
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,999
Your husband chose
to hand them over.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,320
If he had said no, Francis
wouldn't have pressed the issue.

123
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:43,160
I don't want to debate this
with you, Claire.

124
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:47,400
<i>All I'm asking is that you</i>
<i>really think this through, Tricia.</i>

125
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,040
- Is he with you right now?
- Who?

126
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:54,081
<i>- Frank.</i>
- No, it's just you and me.

127
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,880
I want to get off the phone.

128
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:00,441
<i>- Will you please talk to Garrett?</i>
- Goodbye, Claire.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,759
What do you think?

130
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,320
I don't think she's going to side
with me instead of her husband.

131
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,400
Did Tricia tell anyone else
about the Xanax, besides you?

132
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,519
I doubt she would.
She's very sensitive about it.

133
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,880
If she'd only told someone else,
then we could just leak it.

134
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,080
- But it'll too obvious.
- The doctor.

135
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,560
He's protecting them.
He won't say anything.

136
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,520
Unless they waive the privilege.

137
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,561
They have absolutely
nothing to gain by that.

138
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,680
But we do.

139
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,399
- You have to meet with Tusk.
- Why would he talk to me

140
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,800
- after I backstabbed him?
- That's precisely why he'll talk to you.

141
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,760
- I can't go to St. Louis.
- Tusk will come east.

142
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,400
Your job is to get
in the same room with him.

143
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,039
- What's the play?
- Remy Danton, go.

144
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,480
- Get me Durant, in person.
- I'll set it up.

145
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:54,119
And Doug, let's make sure we're
airtight on everything else.

146
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,079
- No Achilles' heel.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,360
"Cry 'Havoc,'" said he who
fought chaos with chaos,

148
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,961
"and let slip the dogs of war."

149
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,400
Missed appointments,
no contact in weeks...

150
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,079
- You know the rules.
- I'd like to speak to Agent Green, please.

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,959
- What are you up to?
- Put Green on the fucking line, please.

152
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,080
Anything you have to say,
you can discuss it with me.

153
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,359
What I have to say
is way above your pay grade.

154
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Where do I turn off this shit?

155
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:33,320
Look at the other screen,
to the left.

156
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,039
- What is this?
- That is the access grid

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,639
to all eight
of AT&T's data centers.

158
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,080
So, what do you say you uncuff
me and tell Agent Green

159
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,321
I'll be waiting for his call.

160
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,159
I'm trying to repair
relations with China.

161
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,640
Giving Feng asylum
would be a slap in the face.

162
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:00,919
Garrett's in trouble.
He needs to appear resolute.

163
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,600
We're only as strong as the president
we serve. We have to rescue him.

164
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:07,359
How can you be sure his testimony
won't implicate the White House?

165
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,320
He knows where
his bread is buttered.

166
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:12,040
This isn't about
you saving the president.

167
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,840
- Of course it is.
- We've been down this road before, Frank.

168
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:19,159
Michael Kern, Adam Galloway.
I wanted to become secretary of state

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,039
in order to engage in productive diplomacy,
not full-time damage control.

170
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,480
Which is why we have
to put Garrett back on his feet.

171
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:29,640
You want him on his ass, Frank.

172
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:32,319
Is this what
the president told you?

173
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,839
He's paranoid, Cathy.
He's trying to turn people against me.

174
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,161
You're turning them against
yourself. You're asking me
to undermine the president.

175
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,000
All right.

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,959
Let's say that what the
president has accused me of...

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,959
...is true.

178
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,559
Would that be so bad,
if taken to its conclusion?

179
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,000
Wouldn't you stand to benefit?

180
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,439
Wouldn't the country?

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,719
- I don't want anything to do with this.
- Just one more time, Cathy.

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,160
Let's unshackle ourselves.

183
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:21,159
This is a one-time
offer, Mr. Feng.

184
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,679
<i>I would need it in writing.
Open-ended, no restrictions.</i>

185
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,879
<i>The same goes</i>
<i>for legal immunity.</i>

186
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,120
First I need to know whether or not you
funneled money through Lanagin's casino.

187
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,759
No. I will speak freely once I have
arrived safely in the United States.

188
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,880
<i>Unless you provide</i>
<i>valuable evidence now,</i>

189
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:39,560
the attorney general will not
grant immunity on any level.

190
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,160
<i>I have denied</i>
<i>these allegations in China.</i>

191
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:45,439
<i>My enemies want me dead. You're asking
me to give them confirmation.</i>

192
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,839
And we're giving you
safe haven in return.

193
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,919
<i>I already have</i>
<i>safe haven in Dubai.</i>

194
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,680
Your asylum there is only temporary.
We're offering you permanent status.

195
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,279
<i>I'm confident that they will</i>
<i>grant me permanent status.</i>

196
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,479
Did you hear that directly from
the minister of foreign affairs?

197
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,640
<i>Because I just spoke to him.</i>

198
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:05,319
Right now you are a man
without a passport.

199
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,960
Whatever assets
Beijing hasn't seized

200
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,960
are frozen in every country with close ties
to the United States or China,

201
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,080
which is just about every
country in the world.

202
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,880
You want your freedom
and fortune.

203
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,601
<i>We want information.</i>

204
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
<i>Mr. Feng?</i>

205
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,680
What do you need to know?

206
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,679
<i>Confirm for me the existence</i>
<i>of a money laundering scheme.</i>

207
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:32,719
Yes.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,840
<i>We used the casino</i>
<i>to mask foreign contributions.</i>

209
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,040
All right.

210
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,880
One of you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

211
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:48,159
- You have to comply.
- You mean I have to show up.

212
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,760
- Unless we appeal.
- We'd lose.

213
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,079
She wouldn't have issued the subpoena
unless she had something substantial.

214
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,200
I agree, which is why I think you
should go and plead the Fifth.

215
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:00,120
- What do you think she has?
- I don't want to speculate.

216
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,719
Goddamn it, I pay
the six of you more in one day

217
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,639
than it costs to put
a kid through college.

218
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,559
I pay you to know
more than I do.

219
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,519
Her line of questioning
will tell us a lot.

220
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,840
We could use that to prepare
a defense in case there's an indictment.

221
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:16,799
- When do I have to go?
- Your interview is the day after next.

222
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,960
Forty-eight hours?

223
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,480
- Having trouble starting it?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,199
I think the battery
might be dead.

225
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,160
I have some cables
if you want to try and jump it.

226
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,798
- You sure you don't mind?
- Not at all.

227
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,718
All right.
That's really nice of you.

228
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,239
Pop your hood.
I'll bring my car around.

229
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Sure.

230
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,199
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Peter.

231
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,079
- He's the guy who drove me back.
- Oh.

232
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,600
- Where do you want these?
- I'll take them. Thanks.

233
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,759
- Rachel, right?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,079
- Lisa said you two are roommates.
- Can I get you something?

235
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,919
- A glass of water?
- No, thanks. I should get going.

236
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,479
All right.
I can't thank you enough.

237
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,919
My pleasure.
Good luck with the car.

238
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,679
- Thanks.
- I hope it's only a dead battery.

239
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,001
Have a good night.

240
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
We should give him some money.

241
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,881
- What?
- Peter!

242
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
She needs to be gone.

243
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,599
- You told me she could stay.
- I changed my mind.

244
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,519
But you said you didn't care
if she was here.

245
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,079
I don't need to explain myself.

246
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,080
You can't stand it, can you? The idea
that I might actually love somebody,

247
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,439
that I might have somebody
in my life who isn't you.

248
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,559
If you care about her,
make it happen, Rachel.

249
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,559
- Hey. Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
You need to tell your friend
that I won't take any money.

251
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,760
I was happy to do it. We all need
a good Samaritan every now and again.

252
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,480
Did you feel justice was served
when General McGinnis

253
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,558
got sentenced to 40 years?

254
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes, as far as his crimes go,

255
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,519
but not for thousands
of servicemen...

256
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,519
I'm sorry to interrupt, but my producer
is telling me that Jacqueline Sharp

257
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,920
has called in,
the House majority whip.

258
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:35,439
- Congresswoman, are you there?
- <i> Yes, I'm here, Chris.</i>

259
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,279
<i>- Thank you for taking my call.</i>
<i>- </i> Thank you.

260
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,039
<i>- Hello, Megan.</i>
<i>- Congresswoman.</i>

261
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,839
First of all, as a veteran like
yourself,

262
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,199
I want to thank you for your
service to our country.

263
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,599
<i>- Duty doesn't require thanks.</i>
- I'm glad you brought up duty,

264
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,800
because you recently
equated it with brainwashing.

265
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:56,080
- That's not what I meant.
- <i> You said "toeing the party line."</i>

266
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,719
What I meant was the culture
and the system is one...

267
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,760
I didn't call to argue with you,
Megan. The opposite.

268
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,440
We can't fix this problem until we find
some common ground, wouldn't you agree?

269
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,480
There is no middle ground,
as far as I'm concerned.

270
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:09,199
- The military needs to change...
- Can't we agree that you and I served

271
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,599
so that we could protect open debate,
which is the very bedrock of democracy?

272
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,800
Yes, in theory, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

273
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:18,119
<i>Not in theory, in reality.</i>

274
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,679
Brave men and women
die fighting for that freedom.

275
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,639
The meaning of bravery is fighting for the
freedom of those with whom you disagree.

276
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,439
Sure, but let's get back
to the issue here.

277
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
<i>What I don't think is brave</i>

278
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,799
is Claire Underwood
dodging this debate

279
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,919
and having you fight this battle
for her instead.

280
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,639
<i>That's not true.</i>

281
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,519
<i>Then why am I talking to you</i>
<i>instead of her? It's her bill.</i>

282
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,359
<i>It's not just hers.</i>
<i>It's all of ours.</i>

283
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,120
<i>Except one of you</i>
<i>is brave enough to say it,</i>

284
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:45,239
<i>and the other is a coward.</i>

285
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,919
<i>Mrs. Underwood was brave enough to go
on national television and admit that...</i>

286
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,520
<i>And where has she been since?</i>

287
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:53,039
<i>Deflecting scandal</i>
<i>and hiding from the press.</i>

288
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,799
<i>You called me disgraceful in</i>
The New York Times,<i> Megan,</i>
<i>and you have every right.</i>

289
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,639
But I also have the right to say
that Mrs. Underwood is disgraceful,

290
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,680
because nothing is more
disgraceful than running from a battle.

291
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
- Megan?
- That isn't...

292
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,440
<i>We're not even...</i>

293
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,720
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

294
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,558
- Where are you going?
- To the Capitol.

295
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,159
Did Feng mention either
me or the president?

296
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,559
Dunbar wouldn't say, but the fact that
Feng confirmed the money laundering

297
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,359
increases focus
on the White House.

298
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,399
As long as we're innocent,
which we are...

299
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Raymond Tusk
has been subpoenaed.

300
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:39,879
Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?
Just keeping us in the loop?

301
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,159
Did you encourage Secretary
Durant to offer Feng asylum?

302
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,559
Bill, for godsakes.

303
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,879
The president could have
asked me that question himself.

304
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,479
As White House counsel,
it is my responsibility...

305
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,199
No, I did not.

306
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,279
So you're saying Durant
acted of her own accord.

307
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,359
I have no idea what her
motivations were.

308
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,759
I'm just as shocked as the president
that she would have gone through with this

309
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,958
without his direct approval.

310
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,999
There's another matter
I'd like to discuss, privately if we could.

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,160
Just give us a few moments.

312
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,278
- The therapy.
- Yes.

313
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,719
To be specific,
the confidentiality waiver.

314
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,680
Feng's testimony puts us
in a very awkward position.

315
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:24,760
We're under a great deal of
pressure to waive the privilege.

316
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:28,798
If we don't, it implies that the president
may have confessed to things he didn't.

317
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,079
Dunbar is just grasping,
don't give in.

318
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,518
I don't want to, but Larkin's argument
for spiritual confidentiality

319
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,438
is shaky at best.

320
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,399
We want to control
how this thing plays out.

321
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
How can I help?

322
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,439
We need to know if anyone else
might pop out of the woodwork.

323
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,759
Well, I haven't mentioned it to
anyone and neither has Claire.

324
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,520
I would never betray
the president's trust like that.

325
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,079
Thank you for your time.

326
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,239
Tell the president it saddens me that we
now have to communicate through lawyers.

327
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,558
I will make myself available if
he wants to discuss any of this in person.

328
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,639
Yes, sir.

329
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,319
What Megan said was offensive.

330
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,159
She shouldn't have
questioned your character.

331
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,038
Those were talking points,
carefully crafted and not by her.

332
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,520
I'm not here to pick a fight,
Jackie. I'm here to end one.

333
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,559
It'll end soon enough,
when the bill goes to the floor.

334
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,319
It won't go to the floor.

335
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,919
I've spoken to Elaine Brooks
and I'm withdrawing the bill.

336
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,719
What you said had some truth.

337
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,719
Early on, you offered to sit down
with me and find a middle ground.

338
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,158
I decided to draw a line
in the sand.

339
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,319
The braver thing would've been for me
to swallow my pride and sit down with you.

340
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,359
If you're still open to that,
I'd love to start over.

341
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,838
- Are you and Frank up to something?
- A passable bill.

342
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,759
He had Nancy spy on me. He
brought my personal life into...

343
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,919
Francis is used
to getting his way,

344
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,479
and he'll do anything
to make sure he does,

345
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,799
especially if it's something
important to me.

346
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,998
I don't know, Claire.
I'm skeptical.

347
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,119
We're deeply sorry
for the way we've treated you.

348
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,959
And we want to rebuild
the trust we've lost.

349
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,999
Do you think that's possible?

350
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,799
I'm sorry to ambush you,
I tried calling.

351
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,238
You can't do this to me, Claire.

352
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,559
I was very clear that I have
to respect Garrett's...

353
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,720
Not that, the sexual assault
bill, it's not going to a vote.

354
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,878
Did the Speaker
remove it from the docket?

355
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:33,079
No, I did.

356
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,359
I just spoke to Jackie.

357
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,199
This is because of what
she said about you?

358
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,919
My main concern is that
she doesn't come after you next.

359
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,159
Not while you and Garrett are
going through the investigation.

360
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,279
I thought you should be aware, because
I know how much this bill meant to you.

361
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,439
- All the work you've put in.
- That we've put in.

362
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,479
But we'll pass Jackie's version,
take this baby step and build on it.

363
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,039
I'm disappointed about the bill,
but I have to say, I'm relieved.

364
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,879
How are you holding up?

365
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,879
Did you hear what Catherine did,
giving Feng asylum?

366
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,599
- Inexcusable.
- Garrett's beside himself.

367
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,959
He feels cornered, like we have no choice
but to waive the privilege now.

368
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,280
- But what about the medication?
- I know.

369
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,998
I shouldn't be sharing this.

370
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,719
We don't have to talk about it.
You should go.

371
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,360
I know you have
a packed schedule.

372
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,438
<i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

373
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,639
<i>All I had to do was</i>
<i>get her alone in a hallway.</i>

374
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,079
<i>- I meant with Jackie.</i>
- We have our priorities.

375
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,238
I know it isn't easy to let go
of something like that.

376
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:39,038
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

377
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,399
- I can't live in this house alone.
- I'm not going anywhere.

378
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,598
You say that,
but this could all backfire.

379
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,239
Raymond will plead the Fifth.

380
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,759
If he names me, it's an
admission of his own wrongdoing.

381
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,559
I'm more worried about Garrett.
You've made a powerful enemy.

382
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,239
- We're stronger than they are.
- And he's still the president.

383
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,399
I promise you, of all the
sacrifices that you've had to make,

384
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,759
divorcing a convict
will not be one of them.

385
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,519
We can't waive
the privilege, Garrett.

386
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
- We don't have a choice anymore.
- Feng confirmed the money.

387
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:13,119
Over the phone,
not in a formal interview.

388
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,759
Rescind the asylum,
send him back...

389
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,039
- Obstruction of justice.
- Is that what Galich said?

390
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,479
Definitely how it will be perceived.
And anything we do that looks

391
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,959
like a failure to cooperate
amplifies that perception.

392
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,519
I just don't want
our marriage put on display.

393
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,279
Look, Dunbar will ask
if I brought up China. I didn't.

394
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,798
So Larkin can only help
to exonerate me.

395
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:32,039
And if the marriage counseling
ends up in her report, so be it.

396
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,439
- We can survive that.
- But he prescribed us medication.

397
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,159
- Technically, not us.
- You took mine, Garrett.

398
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,479
Larkin wrote the prescription
to me knowing you would.

399
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,159
Wait, have you mentioned it?
The medication?

400
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,879
- Claire?
- I'm sorry, but she's the only person

401
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,719
I can talk to who really
understands what it's like...

402
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,599
All the more reason
we have to waive the privilege.

403
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,078
If they leak this, we can't
control the information.

404
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,919
- Claire wouldn't do that.
- Don't underestimate her.

405
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,478
If they were going to, don't you think
they would have done it by now?

406
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,358
She dropped the sexual assault
bill to reduce pressure on us.

407
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,999
That may have been
what she told you.

408
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,880
They're not going
to say anything.

409
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm begging you, Garrett,
don't waive the privilege.

410
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,758
The things we talked about
were so intimate.

411
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,638
- Imagine if the kids...
- I know, but Tricia...

412
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:24,159
When we ran, I knew every aspect
of our lives would be under scrutiny,

413
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,598
but I thought we could
protect at least this.

414
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,438
What happens in here...

415
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,719
I'll protect us.

416
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,079
Whatever I have to do.

417
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,919
You have to believe that.

418
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,559
We checked the USB dongle.

419
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,439
The code you're claiming
infected the data center isn't there.

420
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,279
I programmed the code to
self-erase as soon as it hit the server.

421
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,000
It was gone before
Lucas was in cuffs.

422
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,678
You don't believe me?

423
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,598
This is one of the most
sophisticated firewalls in the world.

424
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,999
Even if your code did get you in there,
you couldn't break it down.

425
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,439
Your wife uses AT&T.

426
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,278
- So does her lover.
- What?

427
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,038
She's over there right now.

428
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,799
Jonathan Kemp.
It's her chiropractor, right?

429
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,360
Want to see
their texts to each other?

430
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,959
- No.
- Oh, I see, you already know.

431
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,078
I don't blame you for not making a fuss,
with the kids still at home.

432
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,279
But you walked my code
right through that door,

433
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,679
into 32 million people's phones.

434
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,158
And that's on you,

435
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,198
and it's on the FBI,

436
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:58,439
and it's a shit storm that will bring
the bureau right in front of Congress.

437
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,999
So you tell me, how much is
making that disappear worth?

438
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,959
You have a hundred years hanging over your
head, extorting the FBI won't help you.

439
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,078
Did Douglas Stamper tell you
to set up Lucas Goodwin?

440
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,078
Counterterrorism Director, that's
a big step up from White House Liaison.

441
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,918
- I think you had a helping hand.
- Not true.

442
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,359
Keep lying.
Meanwhile, here's what I want.

443
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,238
One... I'm no longer your bitch.

444
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,719
Two, all of my charges
are dropped.

445
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,438
Three, all of Barrett Brown's
charges are dropped.

446
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:29,400
- That's up to the US attorney.
- Figure it out.

447
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,199
If I'm hearing you correctly,

448
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,998
you'd like to keep Larkin's testimony
focused on the money laundering.

449
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,358
Which I never brought up,
because I knew nothing about it.

450
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,559
But your concern is other
matters, private matters.

451
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,278
Which are irrelevant
to the investigation.

452
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,558
I can't prevent Dunbar from
asking what she's going to ask.

453
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,918
Of course not, Bill.

454
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,759
The most I can do is ask
Dr. Larkin how he would

455
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,039
respond to certain questions.

456
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,359
But he's a smart man. He'll
understand what I'm getting at.

457
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,118
And this approach keeps us within the law?
We're not tampering with testimony?

458
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,959
It's a fine line,

459
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,319
- but I'll stay on the right side of it.
- Thanks.

460
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,798
He shut me out, Frank,
just like he did with you.

461
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,959
My undersecretary has been
assigned full diplomatic authority.

462
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,999
A temporary setback, Cathy.
Where I go, you go.

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,398
At this very moment, the president
is in the Situation Room.

464
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,758
China responded to Feng's asylum
exactly the way I predicted.

465
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,679
They're doubling their naval
presence off the coast of Yonaguni.

466
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,319
And you know who isn't in
the Situation Room? You and I, Frank.

467
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,359
You're thinking about where we
are instead of where we're headed.

468
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,318
Now, that isn't the Catherine Durant
I waltzed with at the Jefferson Ball.

469
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,878
She understood potential.

470
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:46,398
She had her eyes
toward the future.

471
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,878
I told that Catherine Durant that
we needed her in the State Department.

472
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,838
We still need her.

473
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,838
I wish I knew where she was,
because she's not the Catherine Durant

474
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,279
sitting in front
of me right now.

475
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,279
But I'll tell you something.

476
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,157
If she doesn't show up soon,
I'm just gonna have to keep waltzing alone

477
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:12,958
because I'm done trying to
convince this woman in front of me...

478
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,760
...to take my arm.

479
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,400
Oh, don't let me keep you.

480
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,919
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere, Frank.

481
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,158
You still have access
to the presidential briefing?

482
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,799
Yes, I have it right here.

483
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,118
Walk me through everything
that's going on with China.

484
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,438
Feng is in play now.
We might be able to use him.

485
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,637
- How?
- I don't know yet.

486
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:48,759
But he's clearly valuable to Beijing,
which makes him valuable to us.

487
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,678
- Nothing about Xander Feng?
- Never.

488
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,519
Daniel Lanagin? Raymond Tusk?

489
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,198
We only discussed
their marriage,

490
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,679
nothing about the business
of the White House.

491
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,997
Any oblique reference

492
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,798
to work-related pressures
he was feeling?

493
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,838
He said he wasn't getting
as much sleep as he'd like.

494
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,519
Did you ever prescribe
him any medication?

495
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,078
As I've always stated,
I provided religious counsel.

496
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,718
I understand,
but I'm asking about medication.

497
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,758
How is this relevant?

498
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,598
I'm trying to assess whether his
judgment may have been impaired.

499
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,839
In my opinion, he and his wife
were dealing with standard marital issues.

500
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,518
That's not what
I asked, Dr. Larkin.

501
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,838
So I will ask for a third time,
and let me be more specific,

502
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,678
was any medication prescribed or taken
as a result of your counseling session,

503
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,399
by the president
of the United States?

504
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:40,639
His faculties were operating at
100 percent, if that's what you're asking.

505
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,398
Has anyone from the
Administration spoken to you?

506
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,358
- How do you mean?
- About this deposition.

507
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,719
Has anyone approached you,
coached you?

508
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,239
If you tell me now, I will qualify that
as a timely declaration.

509
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,239
- I'd like to leave.
- The president waived his privilege.

510
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,839
- But I'm here voluntarily.
- Dr. Larkin, at first you wouldn't

511
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,799
talk to me because it violated
your ethical code, I respect that,

512
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,959
but let me ask you,
as a man of faith,

513
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,118
is deliberately lying to me
an exception to that code?

514
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:19,038
Because that is what you're doing
by refusing to share the truth.

515
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,718
- I don't understand.
- It wasn't going to pass.

516
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,518
But you said
we almost had the votes.

517
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:27,718
We needed to be 100 percent
solid, and we weren't.

518
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,078
If the bill failed,
that would set us back.

519
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,038
We need to accept
incremental reform.

520
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,638
You sound
just like Jackie Sharp.

521
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,838
I'm actually
working with her now.

522
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,118
- She's a powerful ally for us to have.
- After what she did to me?

523
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,678
After what she said about you?

524
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,718
If I let the things people say
about me get under my skin,

525
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,999
I wouldn't be able
to leave my own home.

526
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,878
You know how this will go.

527
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:55,959
Everyone will say, great, we did
something, which is really nothing.

528
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,359
They'll pat themselves
on the back and they'll forget about it.

529
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,198
We helped put this on the radar.

530
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:04,518
I thought we were doing
something real, changing people's lives.

531
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,038
How naive, right? But at least
I didn't want to give up.

532
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,238
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right,
you are a fucking coward.

533
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:14,238
I'm the one that pulled
you out from under the covers.

534
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:18,960
You were hiding, you and your pills.
You tell yourself whatever you need to.

535
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,878
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,759
There were political realities
we couldn't ignore.

537
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,239
Do you ever wonder why
so many people hate Washington?

538
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,719
It's because of people like you
using phrases like that.

539
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,638
Raymond?

540
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,118
I'd turn the lights on, but when you're
paying for the room with the best view,

541
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,238
you might as well
make the most of it.

542
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:59,198
I've never been in
the penthouse here, have you?

543
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,958
What's going on?

544
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,919
Do you know why I'm in DC?

545
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,958
Oh, it's OK, Remy, there's nothing you
can say that I don't already know.

546
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,558
Feng is on his way to testify.

547
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,159
Whatever Seth has told you,
don't believe a word of it.

548
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,998
What might he have told me
that I shouldn't believe?

549
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,079
You met with
the vice president in a church,

550
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,238
- don't pretend you didn't.
- Playing both sides?

551
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:26,598
- Raymond, look.
- I want to hear you say it.

552
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,199
That you met with Frank.

553
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,479
I'll talk to you, Raymond,
but not with him here.

554
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,199
Leave us.

555
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,319
- Should I hold the elevator for you?
- Go fuck yourself.

556
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,879
OK, you can take the stairs.

557
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,438
- They're toying with you, Raymond.
- No doubt,

558
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:53,518
but so are you, Remy.

559
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,157
I wanted to lead Frank on, give
him a false sense of security.

560
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:58,077
If you're going to lie,
lie better than that.

561
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:00,798
They want to tear us apart.

562
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,837
I don't blame you for wanting
to keep your options open,

563
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,319
but clearly you have bought
the wrong insurance policy.

564
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,438
Don't shoot yourself
in the foot like this.

565
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:12,558
Your foot,
and you're holding the gun.

566
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,358
- Now go some place else to bleed.
- You want to talk about blood?

567
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,039
How much have you spilled
in this war with Frank?

568
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,799
All I've tried to do
is keep the peace.

569
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,438
You could've let him
have the upper hand.

570
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,199
What would that have really
cost you, other than your pride?

571
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,958
Such a shame.

572
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:38,999
You have just made 42 billion
enemies, Remy, and some change.

573
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,438
Thirty-nine billion, Raymond.

574
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,920
Your market cap is shrinking.

575
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,319
<i>White House counsel Bill Galich</i>
<i>was called into questioning this morning</i>

576
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,798
<i>by Special Prosecutor</i>
<i>Heather Dunbar.</i>

577
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,359
<i>According to Dunbar's office,</i>
<i>there are suspicions that Galich</i>

578
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,718
<i>may have tampered</i>
<i>with witness testimony.</i>

579
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,998
<i>The witness in question</i>
<i>is Dr. Thomas Larkin,</i>

580
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:06,039
<i>a reverend and therapist who allegedly
conducted secret marriage counseling</i>

581
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,958
<i>sessions for the president</i>
<i>and First Lady.</i>

582
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,118
The White House counsel wouldn't
be manipulating testimony

583
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,198
without explicit direction
from the Oval Office.

584
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,599
And just as disconcerting is the fact
that our president is seeking

585
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,878
psychological treatment, and chose to
hide this from the American people.

586
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:21,118
If we can't trust him about that,
how do we know he wasn't involved

587
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,878
in a money laundering scheme?
How do we know he's mentally fit to lead?

588
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:28,398
And most important, how can he
enforce the law when he's breaking it?

589
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,238
I believe our colleagues in the
House certainly have enough

590
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,798
to consider
articles of impeachment.

591
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,919
Both trust and laws
have been broken.

592
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,198
Whatever the House decides to do,
we must hold this president accountable.

593
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:44,238
Fully support the president, will stand
by him no matter what comes his way.

594
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,918
Put that in, put it out.
And get me Ayla Sayyad.

595
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,278
And as for Remy, let's let him
wither on the vine a little longer.

596
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,838
In the meantime, have his better
half come by the house tomorrow.

597
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,559
- Raymond?
- No, Jackie.

598
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,319
Mr. Tusk.

599
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:17,958
Well, Ms. Dunbar,
in 67 years on this planet,

600
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:20,919
I have never once
been issued a subpoena.

601
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,518
I can now cross that
off my bucket list.

602
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,078
This interview is being
recorded and sealed.

603
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,918
As the subpoena mentioned,
Mr. Tusk, I spoke with Xander Feng.

604
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,038
He verified that you were
his partner in laundering Chinese money

605
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,638
to political
super PACs since 2005.

606
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,398
How would you respond
to his allegations?

607
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,878
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

608
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,238
Did you ever use these contributions
to bargain for political favors?

609
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,438
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

610
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,518
What was your relationship
with Daniel Lanagin?

611
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,279
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

612
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,238
I don't even remember
why I came over here.

613
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,079
- You mean when you first showed up?
- No, to the kitchen.

614
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:22,758
I'm sorry.

615
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:26,479
- Please don't think that I don't love you.
- Then why? I don't get it.

616
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:29,518
Everything's been so fast.

617
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,039
And...

618
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,959
I don't know, it's hard to explain.
But I'm not ready for this...

619
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,839
- That's bullshit.
- No, it's not.

620
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,838
I'm still trying to figure out
this new life, and this is too confusing.

621
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,678
This is the only thing
that's clear and you know it.

622
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,838
You're afraid,
but it's good to be afraid...

623
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,678
I need you to leave, OK?
For your own good.

624
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,278
I'm just going to hurt you.

625
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,198
I have thicker skin
than you can even imagine.

626
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,478
Please don't make this harder
than it has to be.

627
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:59,438
Everything was fine yesterday.
It's so sudden.

628
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,559
- It's like it's coming out of nowhere.
- Well, it's not.

629
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,958
I've been thinking
about it for a while.

630
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,478
No, you haven't.
I would've sensed it.

631
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,398
Would you please,
please, please just go?

632
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:11,319
- Just tell me what's going on.
- I don't expect you to understand!

633
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,437
- Maybe if you try...
- I don't want you here! OK?

634
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,477
I don't love you
the way that you love me!

635
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:20,759
I was using you because it felt good
to have you around, but it was selfish!

636
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,918
I said the words because
I knew you wanted to hear them,

637
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:25,798
but I didn't mean them and I
don't want to keep saying them.

638
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:28,038
I'm gonna go for a walk
while you pack your stuff.

639
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,319
No, I don't want anything
that's been here.

640
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,798
Lisa.

641
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:56,677
<i>There was a steaming</i>
<i>mist in all the hollows,</i>

642
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:59,758
<i>and it had roamed in its</i>
<i>forlornness up the hill,</i>

643
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:04,558
<i>like an evil spirit,</i>
<i>seeking rest and finding none.</i>

644
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,079
<i>A clammy</i>
<i>and intensely cold mist...</i>

645
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,918
<i>...it made its slow way through</i>
<i>the air in ripples that visibly followed...</i>

646
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:18,678
<i>and overspread one another, as the waves
of an unwholesome sea might do.</i>

647
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,278
<i>It was dense enough to shut out everything
from the light of the coach-lamps...</i>

648
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:25,038
I'm surprised you wanted
to speak to me.

649
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,958
I haven't been the biggest
friend of the administration.

650
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,638
Isn't that the very best
reason to speak with you?

651
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,839
- I'd like to begin recording.
- By all means.

652
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,198
A number of political analysts predict
that the House Judiciary Committee

653
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,078
will commence with hearings
on articles of impeachment.

654
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,358
Let's just stop right there.
So these analysts you speak of,

655
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,398
they're making predictions prior to
Dunbar's report even being released.

656
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,078
That could take months.

657
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,758
There's no way the Judiciary
will sit on this for that long.

658
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:54,557
And isn't that the fundamental
flaw with these hearings?

659
00:37:54,558 --> 00:37:57,958
The Committee feels compelled
to act because of hypotheses

660
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,558
advanced by those in the media,
such as yourself.

661
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,678
I can't speak for all of my colleagues,
but I'm just reporting facts.

662
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:10,078
Well, you may call them facts,
but if we're being honest...

663
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,158
In every article and interview,
I report alleged activities.

664
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:18,158
And if you repeat allegations enough,
again and over and over and over,

665
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,998
people start to believe they're
true. That's human nature.

666
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,198
I've done my research. Xander Feng
admitted to the money laundering.

667
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:27,318
But you're no longer writing
about Xander Feng, are you?

668
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,198
You're writing about
the administration.

669
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,198
The truth is these hearings have
been initiated by the press.

670
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,278
And my fear is that the President
will be tried by the press.

671
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,158
- Do you believe he's innocent?
- Absolutely.

672
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,119
I said so in my written
statement, and I say so again now.

673
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,357
The White House counsel has denied
coaching Dr. Larkin, but according...

674
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,078
Whatever comes to light, it will only
prove the president's innocence,

675
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,719
and I'll tell you why.

676
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,997
I have never known anyone
more honest, ethical,

677
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,717
and patriotic
than Garrett Walker.

678
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:59,198
His reverence for the Constitution
and the laws of this country

679
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,637
are surpassed by none.

680
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:05,038
Tricia and I have been blessed
with a strong and loving marriage,

681
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,118
but even strong marriages
face challenges.

682
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,598
Like millions of Americans, we sought
counseling from a spiritual advisor,

683
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,518
one who happened also
to be a professional therapist.

684
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,118
Over the years, we have often turned
to our faith in times of adversity.

685
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,038
Many have criticized us,

686
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:25,597
<i>but would you rather have</i>
<i>a president that doesn't ask for help?</i>

687
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:28,598
<i>I ask for help</i>
<i>from my wife every day.</i>

688
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,157
<i>We've relied on one another</i>
<i>for 23 years,</i>

689
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:34,638
<i>we've raised two beautiful</i>
<i>children together,</i>

690
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,077
<i>endured the</i>
<i>campaign trails together.</i>

691
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:42,118
From the state capital in
Denver, to the nation's capital,

692
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,358
we've always been
at each other's side.

693
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,078
I married this man for the same reason
that so many of you voted for him:

694
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,278
because he's a man of God,

695
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:54,437
because he believes in family...

696
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,478
<i>...because he is</i>
<i>compassionate and loving.</i>

697
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,598
<i>Now, none of us are</i>
<i>perfect: I'm not, Tricia's not,</i>

698
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,478
<i>although she certainly</i>
<i>comes close.</i>

699
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,758
Good morning, Mr. Feng.

700
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:07,118
I won't ignore
what makes me human,

701
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,358
that's a form of blindness.

702
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,917
Good leadership means tackling
my imperfections head on.

703
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:16,438
Not bad for a man on the run.

704
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:18,478
You mean a man with immunity.

705
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:22,638
Wherever you're most comfortable.
We have a lot to discuss.

706
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,718
<i>I do so with open eyes,</i>

707
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,958
just as I love with open eyes...

708
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:35,439
...my wife,
my Maker and my country.

709
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,839
Come in.

710
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:46,438
Thank you, Meechum.

711
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:49,917
Jackie, in these circumstances,
normally I would come to you,

712
00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:53,398
but we need to keep a public
distance for the time being.

713
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:56,918
I thought I was here to discuss
the sexual assault bill.

714
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:59,958
- You are.
- Among other things.

715
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,918
I see.

716
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,237
- There's a price.
- We don't think of it that way.

717
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:08,878
I'm going to support your bill,
no matter what you say today.

718
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:12,878
- Regarding?
- Impeachment.

719
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:16,877
- Well, if it goes to the Judiciary...
- It most definitely will.

720
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:19,757
I'm not sure about that. Did you
see the president's address?

721
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:21,597
- We did.
- I think it will help,

722
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:24,837
stop the bleeding.
Impeachment can be defeated.

723
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:27,038
But that's what
we need to avoid.

724
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:29,878
You want impeachment.

725
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:32,637
Why fight a losing battle?

726
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:35,197
- We have a majority in the House.
- We do now,

727
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:40,317
but not if this party fails to distance
itself from a toxic president...

728
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:41,917
We're thinking ahead here.

729
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:44,157
It's why I came to you
about the bill,

730
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:46,438
because it wasn't worth
burning a bridge over.

731
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:50,518
In the long run, we have
a lot more to gain by working together.

732
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:53,518
I don't understand. You said
in the<i> Telegraph</i> article...

733
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,117
I had to. My office is three
doors down from the president's,

734
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,319
I can't publicly deride him.

735
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,359
You want me to do it.

736
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:09,638
We want you to do what
you do so well: whip the votes.

737
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:20,357
I can't abandon the president.

738
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:24,918
If the party rescues him, we'll lose
50 seats in the House in the midterms.

739
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,237
You will lose your position
in the leadership

740
00:42:27,238 --> 00:42:31,558
and it will take us a decade to
regain the trust of the electorate.

741
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:34,237
All we're asking
is that you have an open mind.

742
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:38,918
Claire kept an open mind and you'll
pass sexual assault reform as a result.

743
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:42,838
- You can't possibly compare impeachment...
- It's an illustration, Jackie,

744
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,678
of what the future looks like.

745
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,238
What we offer is progress,

746
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:52,599
with a promise of more to come.

747
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,318
It's only the beginning, Jackie.

748
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:59,958
Ruthless pragmatism, remember?

749
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,878
That's why I wanted you
to be the whip.

750
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:05,159
The three of us,
we're cut from the same cloth.

751
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:12,077
Mr. Vice President,
what you're asking

752
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:14,558
is just shy of treason.

753
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:20,199
Just shy, which is politics.

754
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,999
Oh, be careful, it's delicate.

755
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,878
What is it?

756
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:33,277
Something I've been working on
for a very long time,

757
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:36,518
and it's nearly finished.

758
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:41,758
Jackie... help us finish it.

759
00:43:45,632 --> 00:46:02,060
