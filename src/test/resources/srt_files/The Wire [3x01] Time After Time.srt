1
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,740
I don't know, man. I mean, I'm kind of sad.

2
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,015
Them Towers be home to me.

3
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,550
You gonna cry over a housing project now?

4
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,245
Man, they should have blew
the motherfuckers up a long time ago...

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,914
- you ask me.
- Man, it ain't all been bad.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,686
I mean, I done seen some shit happen
up in them Towers...

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,420
that still make me smile, yo.

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,624
<i>A few moments from now,</i>
<i>the Franklin Terrace Towers behind me...</i>

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,498
<i>which, sadly, came to represent some</i>
<i>of this city's most entrenched problems...</i>

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,898
<i>will be gone.</i>

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,133
Y'all talking about steel and concrete, man.
Steel and fucking concrete.

12
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,075
Man, I'm talking about people,
memories and shit.

13
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:46,771
That ain't the same.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,849
Look, they gonna tear this building down.
They gonna build some new shit.

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,577
But people?
They don't give a fuck about people.

16
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,313
<i>You are very soon going to see...</i>

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,652
<i>low and moderately priced houses...</i>

18
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,658
<i>- built in their place.</i>
- Yeah!

19
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,128
My cousin used to live in 221.
I used to be up in there all the time.

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,256
Man, who you be telling?
I caught my first pussy up in there.

21
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,834
The girl, Chantay.

22
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,368
Man, why didn't you say something before?

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,529
They probably wouldn't be
tearing this tower down now.

24
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,163
They could put a big-ass sign in the front...

25
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,538
that says, "Here's where Malik Carr
first got his dick wet."

26
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,974
You know what I'm saying, too?

27
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,740
We could be taking pictures.
Tourists be taking pictures and shit.

28
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,146
- Souvenirs of your dick about this size.
- He ain't funny, yo. He just jealous.

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,980
What? Jealous of that?
You crazy? Chantay?

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,180
Man, the mention of that bitch
make my dick burn.

31
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,722
Yo, ain't no bad pussy, fool.

32
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,486
Yeah, that's what they keep telling your ass
down at the clinic, man.

33
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,424
Keep that shit up.
You ever see this motherfucker...

34
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,995
when he walking down to the clinic burnt?

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,588
Poot be like this. He looks like
a backwards-ass cowboy and shit.

36
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,894
Instead of like this,
homie, here, walking like this.

37
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,764
Dick looking like a fried chicken wing.

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,531
<i>Now, mistakes have been made.</i>

39
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,772
<i>And we will learn from those mistakes.</i>

40
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,337
<i>Reform is not just a watchword</i>
<i>with my administration.</i>

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,173
<i>- No, it's a philosophy.</i>
- Yeah!

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,874
Shit, man, no matter how many times
you get burnt, man...

43
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,712
you just keep on doing the same.

44
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,877
Nigga do not learn.

45
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,519
<i>Now, what do you say, huh?</i>

46
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,448
<i>Are you ready for a new Baltimore?</i>

47
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,652
Shit gonna be off the hook, yo.

48
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,161
Man, my whole life
been around them Towers, you know?

49
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,697
I mean, I <i>feel...</i>

50
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,131
Shit, I feel like
I don't got no home no more.

51
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,602
Housing just moved your mama
up to Poplar Grove, didn't it?

52
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,864
You ain't homeless, nigga, you got a home.

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,238
Shit, you just damn near out of work is all.

54
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,005
- What you mean?
- I mean, look. All over the city...

55
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,548
even out in the county, you had people,
coke or dope, 24l7.

56
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,139
Where was it they go?

57
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,847
Man, look, you live in the projects.

58
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,479
You ain't shit. But you sling product here?

59
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,921
You got the game by the ass, man.

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,823
Shit, now these
downtown suit-wearing-ass bitches...

61
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,694
done snatched up the best territory
in the city from y'all.

62
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,824
You wanna cry over some shit,
cry over that.

63
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,961
<i>All right, everyone. Count with me.</i>

64
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,701
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

65
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,475
<i>eight, seven...</i>

66
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,745
<i>six, five...</i>

67
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:06,485
<i>four, three, two, one!</i>

68
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,442
Oh, shit.

69
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,355
Fuck! I just stepped in dog shit.

70
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,765
You hope.

71
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,329
Fuck.

72
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,442
It's Cheese? Can you see him?

73
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,990
<i>- Yo, where he at?</i>
<i>- Who you mean?</i>

74
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,359
<i>Cheese, man. I'm looking for Cheese, man.</i>

75
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,160
<i>Nigga, you ain't supposed to be</i>
<i>dropping names and shit.</i>

76
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,631
<i>Ain't you got no sense?</i>

77
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,225
<i>I ain't said shit about shit, man.</i>

78
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,236
<i>I'm just looking to get together</i>
<i>with the man, man.</i>

79
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,967
<i>- To see him about nothing at all.</i>
<i>- So he be where he be, fool.</i>

80
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,032
<i>Is he at the place that we was at?</i>

81
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,112
<i>'Cause I'm looking to,</i>
<i>you know, saddle up...</i>

82
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,737
<i>and then put another bat</i>
<i>on this motherfucker.</i>

83
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,079
<i>He need to deal with me today or I'm gonna</i>
<i>take it to someone who can handle it, man.</i>

84
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,845
<i>- It's nothing. We let him know.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

85
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,354
"Saddle up and put another bat
on the motherfucker"?

86
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,320
Settle up and put another bet.

87
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,755
But what was that last part?

88
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,491
Man said, "He need to deal with me today...

89
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,863
"or I'm gonna take it to someone
who can handle it."

90
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,993
Girl, you do have an ear.

91
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,774
<i>He's looking to get with him.</i>

92
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,079
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>- Same thing as before?</i>

93
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,211
<i>- Same thing I told him.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

94
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,072
What are you seeing?

95
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,405
Call comes in to Cheese's number two.

96
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,603
He whispers in the man's ear
and off they go.

97
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,113
- Yeah. Nothing to the call here.
<i>- I figured that.</i>

98
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,379
These guys come correct.

99
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,216
The phones only go so far.

100
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,156
Above that,
it's all done as a face-to-face meet.

101
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,925
Three months
and we've yet to hear his voice.

102
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,302
And Herc takes the alley
to cut that off from Calhoun.

103
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,376
So, me and Truck go up the wrong way
on Stricker Street?

104
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,069
You got a badge, remember?

105
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,543
And we're doing the same one block over...

106
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,614
so they can't come to ground
that block neither.

107
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,081
Now, the thing is, when we jump out
on these little cocksuckers...

108
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,412
there'll be a designated runner.

109
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,646
Who's gonna sky up,
just so we get to chase his ass.

110
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:12,656
But fuck him. We let him go and jack
every other motherfucker who stays.

111
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,554
Let's mount up.

112
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,131
Carv.

113
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,601
What's up?

114
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,735
He's a complicated man. And the only one
that understands him is his woman.

115
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,578
Seek therapy.

116
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,817
Narcos. Narcos!

117
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,996
Let's see your hands! See your hands!
See your hands, up against the wall!

118
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,231
- Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
- Put your hands up against the wall.

119
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,806
- You ain't gotta push me.
- Hands upstairs.

120
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,239
Keep your hands up.

121
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,976
- Anything on you?
- Here he goes.

122
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,803
Later, son. Step light.

123
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,244
Yo, was that the stash? Fuck!

124
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,087
Let's go, let's go! Cut him off on Stricker.

125
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,600
<i>I've got Calhoun. Where you at?</i>

126
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,752
Lost him. Rear of Stricker, 800 block.

127
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,450
Clear on Riggs.

128
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,798
He just went across Stricker in an alley
headed for Gilmor.

129
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,201
Fuck.

130
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,543
We got rabbit in the alleys
near Gilmor and Riggs.

131
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,810
- How about some backup?
<i>- Roger that.</i>

132
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,089
<i>Dozerman, what's your 20?</i>
<i>Hey, Doze, where you at, man?</i>

133
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,727
<i>- Did he cross Stricker?</i>
<i>- Definitely.</i>

134
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,596
<i>Everybody...</i>

135
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,108
Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

136
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,512
He went to ground in this block, man.

137
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,285
Hey, listen to me,
you little fucking piece of shit!

138
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,797
I'm gonna tell you one thing,
and one thing only...

139
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,390
about the Western boys
you are playing with!

140
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,261
We do not lose!

141
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,331
And we do not forget!

142
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,567
And we do not give up! Ever!

143
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,203
So I'm only gonna say this one time.

144
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:24,476
If you march your ass out here right now
and put the bracelets on...

145
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,882
we will not kick the living shit out of you!

146
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,820
But if you make us go
into them weeds for you...

147
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,153
or if you make us come back down here
tomorrow night...

148
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,023
catch you on a corner,
I swear to fucking Christ...

149
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:40,428
we will beat you longer and harder
than you beat your own dick!

150
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,960
'Cause you do not get to win, shitbird.
We do!

151
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,685
With these Towers down,
we need to take the rest of them low-rises...

152
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,687
and all them Fayette Street corners.

153
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,656
Take them? Take them how, Mr. Bodie?

154
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,622
- You say "fuck it" and take them.
- Nigga, you ain't got the floor.

155
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,425
Chair don't recognize your ass.

156
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,725
Take them how?

157
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,361
I don't know.

158
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,104
Just let them Fayette niggas know,
you know, we serious, right?

159
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,263
You know, get or get got.

160
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, like you did on McCulloh Street
last year?

161
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,009
Snatch the real estate, load up...

162
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,636
and just wait
for some shit to happen, right?

163
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,540
No, man,
we done worrying about territory, man...

164
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,844
what corner we got, what project.

165
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,021
Game ain't about that no more.
It's about product.

166
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,847
Yeah.

167
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,315
We got the best goddamn product...

168
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,088
so we gonna sell
no matter where we are, right?

169
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,024
Product, motherfuckers. Product.

170
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,459
Chair recognize Slim Charles.

171
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,301
Chair, our people got to stand somewhere,
don't they?

172
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,909
I mean, all the product in the world
don't mean nothing...

173
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,605
if you constantly getting your ass whupped
for standing on another fool's corner, man.

174
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,976
All right.

175
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,408
We had six of the Towers
on the Terrace, right? All running 24l7.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,886
But three of those
we had to give to Prop Joe's people...

177
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,617
to upgrade the package
that we was putting out there, right?

178
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,193
Now, how much you think we lost
in the deal?

179
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,927
All right, the answer is, we made more.

180
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,532
Half the real estate, twice the product.

181
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,862
And our profit went up, like,
eight or nine percent. Yo, get it straight.

182
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,099
Your territory ain't gonna mean shit
if your product is weak.

183
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,439
Go ahead and ask them motherfuckers
trying to sell them Ford Tempos...

184
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,036
and you got niggas riding around
in Japanese and German cars...

185
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,512
in America all day.

186
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,912
Territory ain't shit.

187
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,309
Especially when you consider
it's the fight for the territory...

188
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,317
that be bringing the bodies
and the bodies that bring the...

189
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,792
police.

190
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,027
- Yeah, but how we gonna stand...
- Yo.

191
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,562
Chair ain't recognize your ass, man.

192
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,531
- How we gonna stand on some...
- Come on, man.

193
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,472
How we gonna stand on some corner
that's not ours?

194
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,805
Well, we got the best product, right?

195
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,775
So the chances are, we gonna be able
to bring in the competition...

196
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,247
by offering to re-up with us
from our package.

197
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,810
Feel me?

198
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,510
Everybody making money,
sharing the real estate.

199
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,289
Slim Charles.

200
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,822
But what if
they don't cop our re-up, though?

201
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,557
Well, I'm gonna worry about that
when it happen.

202
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,860
Until then, Mr. Charles, we gonna
handle this shit like businessmen.

203
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:33,165
Sell the shit, make the profit,
and later for that gangster bullshit.

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,532
Yeah.

205
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,072
Do the chair know we gonna look
like some punk-ass bitches out there?

206
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,942
Motherfucker, I will punk your ass
for saying such shit!

207
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,036
- Yo, yo, String.
- What?

208
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,173
- Poot did have the floor, man.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

209
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,218
This nigga too ignorant
to have the fucking floor.

210
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,950
Y'all niggers need to start looking
at the world in a new fucking light.

211
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,258
Start thinking about this shit
like some grown fucking men.

212
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,925
Not some niggas off the fucking corner.
You heard me?

213
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,172
Adjourn your asses.

214
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,744
Y'all look like shit.

215
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,619
Well, we been stuck in that vacant
since before dawn.

216
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,759
- How should we look?
- Proud to know you, Detective.

217
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,836
- Nice look on you.
- Dress for success.

218
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,903
I watched that motherfucker Cheese
take re-ups...

219
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,606
move weight all day, and not once
did he go near a fucking telephone.

220
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,242
Closest it comes is a call
to a hanger-on's cell phone ten feet away.

221
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,810
Which brings me back to what
I was just discussing with the Lieutenant.

222
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,948
So far, we've been up on some
of these cell phones for nearly six months.

223
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,256
The only drug talk we have
is from street-level small fry.

224
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,563
So, the feeling
is that maybe two weeks from now...

225
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,758
we don't go back to the court
for another extension.

226
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:09,993
We charge what we have...

227
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,162
we try to roll someone up at Cheese
or one of Joe's other lieutenants.

228
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,604
What, are you kidding?
We don't have a case worth making yet.

229
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,573
And at this rate, we never will.

230
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,873
- For Christ's sake.
- As a plan on paper, it was a good one.

231
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,414
We came out of the port investigation
with good phone numbers...

232
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,416
for some of Prop Joe's people,
and the PC to get up on those phones.

233
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,180
I guarantee if we can push this thing
a level or two above the street...

234
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,256
we're gonna start seeing Prop Joe himself.

235
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,382
We start seeing Joe,
we're gonna see Stringer.

236
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,620
I can't ask for more time
on a wire that's going nowhere.

237
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,558
Either we figure a way
to punch through the wall or we let it go.

238
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,336
- Baker?
- Yes, sir.

239
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,269
- So you must be Castor.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,275
- Officer Aaron Castor.
- You any kin to Lloyd Castor?

241
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,312
- Yes, sir, that's my uncle.
- Good police.

242
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,678
Do you know where you are?

243
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,077
- You, too. Where are you?
- The Western, Major.

244
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,952
Right this very goddamn second,
you getting your hind parts kicked...

245
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,525
and you on the horn screaming for help.

246
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,617
And you got your backup
looking all over the place...

247
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,821
'cause he don't know
where the fuck you are.

248
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,899
And that means
I gotta explain to your next of kin...

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,935
how you went and got yourselves killed
on my watch?

250
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,598
Sir, we're at 1034 North Mount,
first floor rear.

251
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,969
Good.

252
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,336
Now, which way is north?

253
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,137
Point.

254
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,739
That's east.

255
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,887
Now, don't you think
if you're in a foot pursuit...

256
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,287
it might help your backup to know
what direction you're running?

257
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,160
Even numbers tell you north and west.

258
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,395
Odds, south and east.

259
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,376
Compasses. Until you learn that much,
you carry one.

260
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,740
Welcome to the Western.

261
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,011
Gentlemen, scuff yourself up a little.

262
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,787
And learn the stare.

263
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,759
Hey, Carv, where you at?

264
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,423
I'm at a desk outside the roll call room
on the first floor of 1034 North Mount.

265
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,729
My feet are facing west
and my dick is pointing south-southwest.

266
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,898
Bunny Colvin's been giving that speech
as long as you guys been sucking air.

267
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,802
Where you at, shitbird?

268
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,512
You're in handcuffs, in my house,
looking stupid, ain't you?

269
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,355
Fleeing and eluding?

270
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,891
Do we have a drug charge here?

271
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,427
Loitering in a designated drug-free zone.

272
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,997
Let me rephrase. Do we have drugs?

273
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,589
He raised up when we hit his corner
and he grabbed this bag.

274
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,566
We pursued and recovered the bag.

275
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,761
But no drugs.

276
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,499
- And they whupped my ass.
- Western District way.

277
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,097
So, what did we learn?

278
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,338
Using half my district K-9 and the copter
to bring a 14-year-old to bay.

279
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,504
What did we learn?

280
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,106
That you can't raise up and run
from a drug corner in Sector One...

281
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,276
without my boot finding your ass.

282
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,954
Right?

283
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,330
I got it, I got it, I got it. Got it.

284
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,460
Cast iron. $20 at least.

285
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,934
It'd be better if it was copper.
Be better if it was copper.

286
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,026
Yeah, be better if it was gold.

287
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,471
But you know, you gotta take life
as it goes along, you know.

288
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,236
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

289
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,739
- What's wrong with you?
- Sorry.

290
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,408
- We're past sorry.
- Oh, fuck, man, chill.

291
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,507
Chill, chill!

292
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,782
- We definitely don't need this, man.
- You think you fucked up now?

293
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,124
- What's up?
- Look what they did to my ride.

294
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,064
Well, do it or don't.
But I got someplace to be.

295
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,670
Thank you for your kindness.

296
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,467
You all got to pay something, anything.

297
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,974
- There be a principle here.
- Lf we had a dime, you'd have a dime.

298
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,512
We're a little insufficient right now, okay?
We're on our way to the metal man.

299
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,605
We'll come back and pay for everything.
I promise you.

300
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,881
Hey, hey, after the junk man,
we gotta roll past K-Mart.

301
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,394
Definitely.

302
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,930
<i>One last question, Commissioner.</i>

303
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,195
<i>Looking back over the past couple months,</i>
<i>if I read the felony breakdowns correctly...</i>

304
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,135
<i>you've been seeing an up-tick in shootings</i>
<i>and serious assaults...</i>

305
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,638
<i>in the Eastern District especially.</i>

306
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,538
<i>Can we assume</i>
<i>that you're already addressing this?</i>

307
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,968
<i>Let me throw that over to Bill.</i>

308
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:51,515
<i>As Deputy for Operations,</i>
<i>I'm sure he's got a handle on our response.</i>

309
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,982
<i>I do indeed.</i>

310
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,047
<i>In answer to your question, Councilman...</i>

311
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,919
<i>I can assure you</i>
<i>that we've put additional tactical teams...</i>

312
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,051
<i>on a 7:00-to-3:00 shift</i>
<i>in every Eastern sector.</i>

313
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,663
<i>Additionally, we've put</i>
<i>the district flex squad...</i>

314
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,459
<i>on a 7:00-to-3:00 shift...</i>

315
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,061
<i>being as those are the hours...</i>

316
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,465
<i>when we're seeing a spike</i>
<i>in aggravated assaults.</i>

317
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,932
<i>Thank you, Deputy.</i>

318
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,076
<i>Anything else</i>
<i>for these esteemed constables?</i>

319
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,143
<i>No?</i>

320
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,144
<i>Okay, then,</i>
<i>I guess I'll see you all tomorrow night...</i>

321
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,111
<i>for the quarterly budget review.</i>

322
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,523
Erv, hey...

323
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,355
if you don't mind, I'd like to get with you
about a couple things.

324
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,553
Can we get lunch?

325
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,226
Glad to, Mr. Chairman.

326
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,232
- How about Werner's in a half-hour?
- Half-hour, good.

327
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,036
- You see Watkins in the back?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,840
Who was that skirt with him?

329
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,646
That's him there in the orange?

330
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,743
- That's Drac.
- Our last best hope.

331
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,747
Talkingest motherfucker
I ever heard on a wiretap.

332
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,586
- Here, listen.
<i>- No, no, no, the other thing.</i>

333
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,458
<i>The good... The other thing, my nigga.</i>

334
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,691
<i>- You talking him?</i>
<i>- No, her. I mean her!</i>

335
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,027
<i>Cocaine, nigga, you feel me now?</i>

336
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,104
<i>Goddamn, you ignorant...</i>

337
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,797
When was the last time
you heard that on a wire?

338
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,704
Shame he doesn't report to anyone
that matters.

339
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,973
Right now, Drac's re-ups
are with Lavell Manns.

340
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,478
He's got those corners
over on Preston and Bond.

341
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,447
He was pretty close to selling us weight.

342
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,543
No shit. Sydnor's been working toward him
for a couple of months now.

343
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,589
Lavell's a soldier.
He's not gonna roll up on Prop Joe.

344
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,657
That's true.

345
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,158
But if we take him off
with a hand-to-hand...

346
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,455
they gotta promote someone
to replace him.

347
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,860
Yeah, why Drac?

348
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,529
- One thing about our boy?
- That's Prop Joe's nephew.

349
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,968
On his mama's side.

350
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,248
$20 and $2.

351
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,980
Y'all know you ain't got pants?

352
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,622
And there's Dominic standing in line.

353
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,255
And when he finally gets up
to meet the President...

354
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,025
who's looking the other way,
Dominic reaches around behind Carter...

355
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,432
- grabs his belt, yanks it up...
- Secret Service must've shit.

356
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,060
He says,
"Hey, Mr. President, remember me?"

357
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,106
And Carter actually remembers.

358
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,643
Says, "Sure, Dominic DiPietro
from Baltimore, on the campaign trail."

359
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,802
And Dominic doesn't miss a beat.

360
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,402
He puts his finger in Jimmy Carter's face...

361
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,039
and says, "So where's that money
you promised me three years ago...

362
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,412
"to fix up my streets and alleys?"

363
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,281
- Unbelievable.
- That's nothing.

364
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,547
After losing to Reagan,
Carter comes back here to speak...

365
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,179
at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner
or something...

366
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,723
and Dominic is ushered up to him.

367
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,952
Carter asks about his health,
and Dominic says...

368
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,393
"You son of a bitch, I'm still waiting
on that money for my streets and alleys."

369
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,486
Come on!

370
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,295
No shit. Carter's just grinning
through those big teeth.

371
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,768
Some guy grabs Dominic's arm,
and off he goes.

372
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,498
Guy says, "Christ, Dominic...

373
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,309
"you just called
the President of the United States an SOB."

374
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,636
He shrugs, he says,
"Fuck him. I don't need him. He lost."

375
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,478
No, that's good. That is good.

376
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,879
And that is from whence I come.

377
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,856
Proud son of the fighting First District.

378
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,850
But the truth is...

379
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,592
I don't wanna be just another muldoon
like Dominic DiPietro...

380
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,190
warming the backbench.

381
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,668
Not with the way things are right now
in the city.

382
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,635
We're losing 10,000,
12,000 residents a year.

383
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,935
And when you ask them
why they're moving to the county...

384
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,067
you know what they say?

385
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,611
- Schools.
- And crime.

386
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,644
Schools and crime.

387
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,979
And there goes our tax base
right across the line...

388
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:51,385
and the Mayor's acting like a 10% bump
in the murder rate is business as usual.

389
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,551
- Check, please.
- And you know what?

390
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,590
If you were smart, you'd come to me
when the Mayor shorts you...

391
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,825
on hiring, on equipment,
on overtime, on cars.

392
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,959
You get the shit end of the stick,
you come to me.

393
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,963
Not publicly.
I know you can't cross the Mayor publicly.

394
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,734
But backdoor, you come to me...

395
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,038
and I can use that subcommittee
to give you what you need.

396
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,605
Thanks.

397
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,613
- Kind offer.
- Erv, I can help you.

398
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,515
And we can turn this damn city around...

399
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,181
But long ago, when I was just starting out
in the Department...

400
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,157
I had the good fortune to be taught
a little something about chain of command.

401
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:35,589
And right now,
in my capacity as Acting Commissioner...

402
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,204
I report to Mayor Royce.

403
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,509
I got your coffee. Leave a tip if you want.

404
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,144
So what do you need to see me for?

405
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,382
- You're getting out tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

406
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,515
Probably trying to reach out.

407
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,061
- What you gonna do first?
- Huh?

408
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,153
Tomorrow. What you gonna do?

409
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,961
I don't know.

410
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,760
I know what be first. You don't know?
I know what be first.

411
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,203
I'm going home.

412
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,767
Time out!

413
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,520
Back in!

414
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,918
Watch the hole. Watch the hole.

415
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,095
Short-timer.

416
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,733
You know you got the one day left, huh?

417
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,030
- You done the one, just gotta do that other.
- All right.

418
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,798
Like they say.

419
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,802
You only do two day.

420
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,376
- There's the day you go <i>in...</i>
- The day you come out.

421
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,139
I don't know. I did 14 years.

422
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,679
Well, yeah, you know.
You did you a little stretch, true.

423
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,752
But you still a soldier, right?

424
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,684
You know them Towers
done came down now, huh?

425
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,320
The Terrace? The Murphy Homes?
All that shit gone, man.

426
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,489
A lot of things is different now
since you been up in here. You'll see.

427
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,033
- Lot of changes.
- Yeah, no doubt.

428
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,332
But, I mean, you know, shit.
Some things, they stay the same, man.

429
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,497
I mean, the game's the game.

430
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,442
And the thing is,
since the Towers is gone...

431
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,637
I'm gonna need to take my thing up
to some new places. You feel me?

432
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,075
You know I'm gonna be home
soon enough, right?

433
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,347
Yeah, first parole hearing, I'm out. For real.

434
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,517
Shit is fixed right.

435
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,884
I come <i>home...</i>

436
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,315
Shit!

437
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,657
There's gonna be a little hell to be paid.
You know what I mean?

438
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,231
A good soldier ain't gonna lack for work.

439
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,037
Take that number, man.
When you out, you call.

440
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,033
We'll hook you up, man, no problem.

441
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,543
You know, it's like a coming-home gift.
All right?

442
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,009
Call it.

443
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,717
The joint might have broke him.

444
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,717
Boss, you talking about a homie
walked up and shot Elijah Davis.

445
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,864
Broad daylight, at Pennsie and Gold.

446
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,058
Then picked up the phone, dialed 911...

447
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,162
told the police,
"I just shot a nigga, come get him."

448
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,271
That dude ain't breaking.

449
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,575
Look, we had the $20, you know.
But we had to go buy some pants.

450
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,415
So if you just take this short money...

451
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,854
we get back at you tomorrow, man.
We get you on the comeback.

452
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,287
Yo, he want two for $16.

453
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,226
Trying to get two, man.
I'm trying to get two.

454
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,991
From this young motherfucker.

455
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,223
No.

456
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,098
Come on, man, see,
you see, we a little short now...

457
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,899
but tomorrow,
I'll be right back here with the $4...

458
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,666
Joey said no.

459
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,772
Fucking guy, man.

460
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,780
At these prices,
I can't afford more phone surveillance.

461
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,919
I'm aware of that.

462
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,057
And right now, the plan is to go
for a hand-to-hand on one lieutenant...

463
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,060
a couple rungs down from Proposition Joe.

464
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,153
And then roll the lieutenant up?

465
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,799
We don't think he'll have much roll to him.

466
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,961
Joe's people are pretty schooled.

467
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,935
The hope is that they promote
this mid-level dealer, who's a fool...

468
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,701
to replace him. Name of Drac.

469
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,074
And we're on his cell phone.

470
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,477
If he gets promoted,
maybe he talks to Joe or Joe's top people.

471
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,516
We get that far,
maybe we start to see Stringer Bell.

472
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,219
What makes you think
they'll promote the wrong man?

473
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,458
We do it all the time.

474
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,900
Look, speaking of promotions,
I sent yours over to the Hall, as promised.

475
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,065
- And?
- And the Mayor's holding it up.

476
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,934
My understanding is
he wants to know what your wife is doing.

477
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,866
- My wife?
- Yeah.

478
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,810
There's a rumor that she's gonna
take a run at a Council seat.

479
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,382
Maybe try to knock off Eunetta Perkins.

480
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,747
- That's my wife's business.
- Yes, it is.

481
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,811
But the Mayor counts Eunetta as an ally.

482
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,620
Our deal was for a permanent unit
and the next vacancy for major.

483
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,091
You got your unit.

484
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,331
And I sent your name over to the Hall.
I kept my word.

485
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,465
But the Mayor...

486
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,933
he may wanna know who his friends are
before he makes a new commander.

487
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,605
Where'd she say she was gonna be at?

488
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,844
Near the dugout, first-base side.
She'll turn up.

489
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,110
When is she supposed
to bring them over to you?

490
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,914
Middle of the fourth.

491
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,686
Dad, can I have a hot dog?

492
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,055
Yeah, as soon as the guy comes around.

493
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,327
Speaking of which, where's the beer man?

494
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,523
There they are.

495
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,274
Damn. They got great seats.

496
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,801
Hell.

497
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,139
- What?
- Who's that on her left? The suit.

498
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,808
- Just a friend?
- No, he's in the cake.

499
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,653
Who comes to an Orioles game in a suit,
spends half the time on a cell phone?

500
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,092
Downtown lawyer.

501
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,061
Something wealthy like that.

502
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,130
- Wish we had more of it.
- Long way to go for half a shot.

503
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,036
It'll be better tomorrow, Bubs.

504
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,783
What kind of dope fiend
be talking about tomorrow?

505
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,351
Tomorrow ain't shit.

506
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,288
Today, Johnny. Today.

507
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:10,220
I hunted down all that metal.
Lugged it around like a dog.

508
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,128
I nearly get killed over a scratch of metal,
so that I gotta beg for my life.

509
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,632
Lost my trousers, man,
my fucking trousers.

510
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,230
And then I'm begging again for half a shot?

511
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,142
I swear to God, man, I'm not even high.

512
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,381
- We just missed a foul, Pa.
- Yeah?

513
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,983
Our seats are great.
We're practically on the field.

514
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:48,031
Yeah, my friend, Dennis,
he gets company seats every now and then.

515
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,099
- Where are you sitting?
- Mezzanine. Come on.

516
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,003
No, no, you guys go.
Your dad hasn't seen you all week.

517
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,132
Now, don't take their jackets off,
'cause Sean's just getting over a cold.

518
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,209
Okay?

519
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,443
Jimmy, right? Dennis Kerpelman.

520
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,043
Great kids.

521
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,485
Anyway, nice meeting you.

522
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,815
- Do you want anything from the stand?
- No, thank you.

523
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,762
Don't stay till the last inning,
'cause it's a school night.

524
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,063
Bye.

525
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,482
You got spatter going in two different
directions, just off the curb.

526
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,056
- Yeah.
<i>- Shooting on the west side.</i>

527
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,218
Another one? Christ, where?

528
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,388
<i>North and Pulaski, Cole's up.</i>

529
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,395
Cole's working a cutting off Belvedere.

530
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,764
Call Crutchfield.
See if he's back from the Westport scene.

531
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,201
<i>- Crutchfield?</i>
- Lf not, call Bunk at home.

532
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,704
<i>- Bunk's off day.</i>
- Well, fuck his off day.

533
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,705
I love this town.

534
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,250
Perlozzo's pretty quick to yank a pitcher,
ain't he?

535
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,790
I'm thinking of becoming a woman.

536
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,502
Red-hot peanuts!

537
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,705
Office. Yeah.

538
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,635
I'm at the ballgame.

539
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,608
The ballgame.

540
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,415
Yeah, what about Cole? Call him.

541
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,816
Oh, shit.

542
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,724
All right.

543
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,398
Can you believe this?
They caught five tonight.

544
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,301
They're telling me I gotta come in
on my day off.

545
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,497
Five?

546
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,438
City's jumping bad, man.

547
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,378
Okay, listen.

548
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,775
- I gotta go to work, all right?
- All right.

549
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,311
Mr. Jimmy's <i>gonna...</i>

550
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,584
He's gonna take you home.

551
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,891
You're on your own, partner.

552
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,055
Hey, Ma.

553
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,362
<i>- And Erdman Avenue?</i>
<i>- No ballistic information.</i>

554
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,433
<i>Are you sure?</i>

555
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,632
<i>Take your time, Major.</i>

556
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,946
Can you believe that cocksucker Carcetti?
Thinking I'm gonna talk out of school.

557
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,413
<i>Any day now, Marvin.</i>

558
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:02,077
What can a white councilman give me
that a black mayor can't?

559
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,885
No, you played it right.

560
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,889
<i>It was a .38</i>
<i>recorded on Erdman Avenue, sir.</i>

561
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,983
<i>So what you are, in effect, saying, Major,</i>
<i>is rather than looking...</i>

562
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,393
<i>at this cluster of robberies</i>
<i>you had along Monument Street...</i>

563
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,225
<i>you chose to investigate each</i>
<i>using separate personnel.</i>

564
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,197
<i>No, sir, three of those cases</i>
<i>were commercial robberies...</i>

565
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,169
<i>so we sent those downtown to CID.</i>

566
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,800
<i>- My people had responsibility...</i>
<i>- God damn it, Marvin!</i>

567
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,743
<i>Did you just</i>
<i>invoke the word "responsibility"...</i>

568
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,473
<i>to explain</i>
<i>why you didn't get on top of this shit?</i>

569
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,847
<i>Did you just do that? I don't think</i>
<i>you know what the word means.</i>

570
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,750
<i>When I look at the 24's and plainly see...</i>

571
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:41,585
<i>that some .38-caliber asshole</i>
<i>is raping your entire district...</i>

572
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:45,628
<i>all the way from Greenmount</i>
<i>to fucking Edison Highway.</i>

573
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,699
<i>It's policing like that</i>
<i>that makes it possible for us to get hit...</i>

574
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,360
<i>with five fucking homicides</i>
<i>in a single fucking night, people!</i>

575
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:57,003
- Poor fucking Marvin.
- Better him than us, right?

576
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,310
Based on your testimony,
the buy itself will be enough to charge...

577
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,936
but you get him saying something on tape,
it's even better.

578
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,379
Are you sure this guy
wants to be selling you weight?

579
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,144
'Cause we don't wanna be forcing this.

580
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,446
I been stroking this guy
for two months, man.

581
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,077
That's not what he asked you.

582
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,715
This guy is ripe and ready, Kima.
It ain't no thing.

583
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,624
They're about ready.

584
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,229
You living out of the office, Cedric?

585
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,243
All right, Drac is depending on you people.

586
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,207
Mount up.

587
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,285
And find your way home.

588
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,555
Look a little light to be an ounce,
don't you think?

589
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,725
No, man.
Ain't nothing light, it's just settled, is all.

590
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,496
All right, man, if it does what it should...

591
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,538
I'm gonna come back to you for three,
maybe four a week.

592
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,801
- Yeah, that could work.
- We good, then?

593
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,333
We good.

594
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,378
- That's it.
- Take him down.

595
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,931
- Somebody snitching!
- Shut the fuck up!

596
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,528
Let's go, Lavell.

597
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,148
It's Cutty.

598
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,689
Was told I could call for help.

599
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,558
What about the Oxbow?

600
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,824
The Oxbow on Laurens, at Fulton. All right.

601
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,034
Damn.

602
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,241
<i>I'm saying, they caught Lavell</i>
<i>with, like, a whole ounce.</i>

603
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,470
<i>Might not be no bail for that much weight.</i>

604
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,206
<i>They might just take it federal,</i>
<i>run wild on they ass.</i>

605
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,874
<i>And you know Joey gotta give</i>
<i>Lavell's corner to someone, right?</i>

606
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,646
<i>- Might be my turn.</i>
- Our boy won't shut up.

607
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,814
Caroline, you say that like it's a bad thing.

608
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,888
Let's just hope we're listening
to a candidate for elevation.

609
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,441
Oh, I heard about you, man.
I hear your name used to ring out.

610
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,709
You got something for me?

611
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,379
You see where shorty's sitting at
right there?

612
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,744
You'll find a little help.

613
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,220
But when you ready, we got
some real work for you, all right?

614
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,667
Jesus.

615
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,417
Hey. How you doing?

616
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,527
Okay.

617
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,798
- We were just talking about you.
- Really?

618
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,564
- You know Denise, from the sorority.
- Hi.

619
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,869
Charles, of course.

620
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,172
- Always a pleasure, Lieutenant.
- Good to see you.

621
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,248
And I don't think you've met
Delegate Watkins.

622
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,643
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

623
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,045
We were saying
you fill out a lieutenant's uniform nicely.

624
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,453
- Makes an impression on the campaign lit.
- That matters?

625
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,294
Well, Marla's a new face
taking on a longtime incumbent.

626
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,989
- Everything matters, I'm afraid.
- Well, anything I can do to help.

627
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,157
I'll get out of the way
and leave you all to it.

628
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,531
Marla, I have to tell you that your photo
with Cedric works really well...

629
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,736
on the mailer.

630
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:31,246
Yeah. I sure hope
he knows what he's in for...

631
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:34,476
because it's gonna be a long race
for the both of you.

632
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,280
And that is not going to go easy.

633
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,116
Speaking of which,
you've got to make <i>some...</i>

634
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,888
Jesus. Who called the media?

635
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,545
<i>No, you think the man might respect</i>
<i>my shit enough to let me step up.</i>

636
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,982
<i>- But it ain't even go like that.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

637
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,055
<i>He gonna give Lavell's corner</i>
<i>to that off-brand nigger, Cheese.</i>

638
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,386
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>Joe's my uncle and shit.</i>

639
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,823
<i>I mean, I'm kin to the fat motherfucker.</i>

640
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,294
That idiot works for us,
he'd be a deputy commissioner by now.

641
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,095
Ain't no luck at all to this case.

642
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,106
<i>And how, in all good conscience, can I,</i>
<i>as chairman of this subcommittee...</i>

643
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,038
<i>authorize any more</i>
<i>above-the-line overtime...</i>

644
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,167
<i>when it's clear enough from the data</i>
<i>in front of me...</i>

645
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,406
<i>that that money is not gonna go</i>
<i>to line officers, or working detectives...</i>

646
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,915
<i>but is being used to pay for drivers</i>
<i>and clerical and...</i>

647
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,145
<i>And Jesus, look at this,</i>
<i>so that two colonels...</i>

648
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:46,916
<i>and three majors can attend a community</i>
<i>policing seminar in Miami, Florida.</i>

649
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,218
<i>Mr. Chairman...</i>

650
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,384
<i>What does South Beach</i>
<i>have to teach this department...</i>

651
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,621
<i>about making Baltimore</i>
<i>a safer place, Commissioner?</i>

652
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,723
<i>I have no idea and you have no idea,</i>
<i>and it is an embarrassment.</i>

653
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,403
Cedric, they're gone.

654
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,983
I wanna thank you for this.

655
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,820
No problem.

656
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,989
It's not easy, I know.

657
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,321
But they seem to think it matters
that I present myself <i>as...</i>

658
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,758
I'm fine with it.

659
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,821
All those years
you were all about my career.

660
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,397
Well, it's the least I can do, right?

661
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,534
Good night.

662
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,114
We're not holding anything up
in his district.

663
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,652
Repaving, foot patrols, <i>streetlights...</i>

664
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,946
He's getting his share.

665
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,257
Unless it's not about his district...

666
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,023
it's about him.

667
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,661
Maybe he's got big eyes for something.

668
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,401
For what?

669
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,499
Not me, not my chair, not in this town.

670
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,399
Oh, no. If that guy came off any whiter,
he'd be see-through.

671
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,272
But if that's it, come on with it.

672
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:18,178
- In fact, please, Jesus.
- Or maybe John the Baptist.

673
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,213
Soften you up for someone else.

674
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:23,514
- Lf he's gonna bang us on crime...
- Bang me on crime.

675
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,922
Look, is there any way
for you to talk to this guy?

676
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,727
- Keep him from crawling up my ass?
- He's old First District.

677
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,593
Not a lot of favors we can call in
over that side of town.

678
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,460
Well, we've got to show him
something, right?

679
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,468
- Four to five percent drop in felonies.
- And murders.

680
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,573
Get the murders down to under 250
for the year.

681
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,532
All due respect, Mr. Mayor,
we're at 232 now.

682
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,178
What can you realistically do?

683
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,477
Our best case scenario,
if we bump overtime, is...

684
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,646
275, maybe.

685
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,550
- 275, Christ.
- That's a promise, right?

686
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,323
275...

687
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,925
and this asshole Carcetti has no issue.

688
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:27,108
<i>Gentlemen, the word from on high</i>
<i>is that felony rates district by district...</i>

689
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,812
<i>will decline by five percent</i>
<i>before the end of the year.</i>

690
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,118
<i>We are dealing in certainties.</i>
<i>You will reduce the UCR felonies...</i>

691
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,488
<i>by five percent or more, or...</i>

692
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,385
<i>I've always wanted to say this...</i>

693
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,960
<i>let no man come back alive.</i>

694
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:45,364
<i>In addition, we will hold</i>
<i>this year's murders to 275 or less.</i>

695
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,629
Christ.

696
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,938
<i>Feeling a little fazed, Colonel Foerster?</i>

697
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,930
<i>A little dyspeptic?</i>

698
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,972
<i>Dis-who? No, sir. I'm good to go.</i>

699
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,282
<i>Here's a fun fact for you people.</i>

700
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,011
<i>If Baltimore had New York's population...</i>

701
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,679
<i>we'd be clocking 4,000 murders a year</i>
<i>at this rate.</i>

702
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,315
<i>There is no excuse I will accept.</i>
<i>I don't care how you do it.</i>

703
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,260
<i>- Just fucking do it.</i>
- Deputy...

704
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,859
as familiar as we all are
with the urban crime environment...

705
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:18,932
I think we all understand
there are certain processes...

706
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,937
by which you can reduce the number
of overall felonies.

707
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,667
You can reclassify an agg assault...

708
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,209
or you can unfound a robbery...

709
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,541
but how do you make a body disappear?

710
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:35,043
There isn't one of you in this room
who isn't here by appointment.

711
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,080
If you want to continue
wearing those oak clusters...

712
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,851
you will shut up and step up.

713
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,018
Any of you who can't bring in
the numbers we need...

714
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,823
will be replaced by someone who can.

715
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,894
That is all.

716
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,731
Jesus, Bunny...

717
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,101
what got into you?

718
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,167
Another six months to my 30.
I'm out the door on a major's pension.

719
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,173
The hell they could do to me.

720
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,375
Spider bags, red tops.

721
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,843
- Any other bright ideas?
- How about a bug?

722
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:40,984
A bug?

723
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,415
Yeah, bug one or two of the big corners
where these mopes hang.

724
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,685
Watching those corners over on Ashland
yesterday, I'm seeing dumpsters, weeds...

725
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,225
maybe a utility pole.

726
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,524
You hide a bug in the right corner
at the right moment, you make this case.

727
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,565
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention the money.

728
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,065
And for what?
We're still a long way from a quality target.

729
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,435
I say we come down off the wire,
charge what we can, and move on.

730
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,873
We come down early two years ago
and we left a real bastard on the street.

731
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,344
You're telling me we're gonna let
that same son of a bitch beat me again?

732
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,575
How many times do you let a cocksucker
like Stringer Bell go around the board?

733
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,050
Collect another fucking $200 million.

734
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,745
- There's other fish in the barrel, McNulty.
- Stringer's the target.

735
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:24,293
There isn't a better fucker out there.
You know it, Lieutenant.

736
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,460
Don't you let him go soft on this.

737
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,429
It's you against the world, is it?

738
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,002
What the fuck did I do?

739
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,245
Red tops, spider bags!

740
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:46,482
You up?

741
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,021
Step the fuck off, motherfucker.

742
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,389
You got a need,
you talk to one of the young 'uns.

743
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,798
I ain't in the market. I'm selling.

744
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,237
You look like the right person
to be talking to, chief.

745
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,035
You seem like you steady
running this shit here.

746
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,908
What, are you some kind of police
or something?

747
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,503
I'm a long motherfucking way
from the police.

748
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,447
I just finished a 14-year bit in Jessup.

749
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,850
Got a package
as a coming-home present. G-pack.

750
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,385
Well, why not sell that shit your own self?

751
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,856
I just came home.
I ain't trying to get my ass violated.

752
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,921
- Even split.
- Shit.

753
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,190
- It's all profit to you.
- Risk mine, too.

754
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,198
What make you think
I ain't on paper or some shit?

755
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,771
Sixty-forty.

756
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,845
Cool. Give your shit to my boy.

757
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:54,675
- He good with it. Then come past tonight.
- All right.

758
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,311
<i>And one last item for you gents.</i>

759
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,586
<i>It seems that Foxtrot was hovering</i>
<i>over the stationhouse a few days ago...</i>

760
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:07,288
<i>and caught a lovely view of about 700 or</i>
<i>800 discarded beer cans on the garage roof.</i>

761
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,029
<i>Seriously, no off-duty drinking</i>
<i>on the station lot.</i>

762
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,329
<i>And if you do find yourself</i>
<i>holding a beer can...</i>

763
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,235
<i>don't throw it on the roof,</i>
<i>take it home with you.</i>

764
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,101
<i>Come on, guys, the memo came down</i>
<i>from our beloved Deputy of Operations.</i>

765
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,943
<i>All right, get out of here.</i>

766
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,278
<i>Don't get captured.</i>

767
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:32,985
At ease.

768
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,588
- Anything from day shift?
- Nothing that'll make the papers.

769
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,858
All right, then, I'm gonna ride the district
until the Deputy Major gets in.

770
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,865
If you need me, hit the radio.

771
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,901
Distribution?

772
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,498
Possession.

773
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,675
- And some loitering.
- Loitering?

774
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:58,040
And behaving like assholes
in the presence of sworn officers, boss.

775
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:11,846
Five-o creeping.

776
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,171
It's midnight relief coming in.

777
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,592
What the hell is all this?

778
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,566
You don't look at what you did before,
you do the same shit all over.

779
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,671
I'm out of here.

780
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,487
Spiders with a red top! One and one!

781
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,328
Where he at?

782
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,742
Spider bags! Got those spider bags!

783
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,847
The fuck you looking at?

784
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,525
- What, do you want a go?
- Just my split.

785
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,420
Some bad luck there.

786
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,600
The police came through,
snatched up a ground stash or two.

787
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,864
Shit happened to be yours. Fuck, right?

788
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,329
- You got a number?
- A number?

789
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:48,676
Back in the day, when a player tried to say
he lost a package to the police...

790
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,246
he had to give up a number for the report.

791
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:53,473
Well, we ain't back in the day.

792
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,409
I'm getting fucking tired of your ass.

793
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,596
Yeah, walk it off, motherfucker.

794
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,535
Fucking old-school-ass bitch.

795
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,925
Got them spider bags. Two'll get you three.

796
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,892
- What?
- You up?

797
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,865
Spider bags, two gets three.

798
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,627
You up or you not?

799
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,033
What you doing, boy?

800
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,668
Oh, man! Dumb rookie.

801
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,338
Don't you know five-o?
