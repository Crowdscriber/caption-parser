1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,390
If I get just, everybody's attention...

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,790
Real quick.

3
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:09,450
Um, on this wonderful occasion--

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,318
our daughter leaving
tomorrow for college...

5
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,136
If I could get everyone
to raise their glass

6
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,990
as I quote from one
of our nation's great fathers--

7
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,197
Jefferson.

8
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:20,723
George Jefferson.

9
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,591
"I never dreamed
that one of my own

10
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,147
"would be going off
to a university,

11
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:26,047
"but here I stand,
a proud black man,

12
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,312
knowing that all those hours
I put in at the dry cleaner--"

13
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:29,990
- Phil.
- Not now, weezie.

14
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:30,923
Where was I?

15
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:32,038
Quoting that president.

16
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:33,583
Okay, if she's
the future of America,

17
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,407
we should start using
Chinese money now.

18
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,947
We already are.

19
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,265
My arm is tired. To Haley.

20
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,914
To Haley!

21
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,766
And before everyone
puts their glasses down,

22
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,423
uh, uh, we're also
very proud of Lily.

23
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:47,968
Tomorrow is her first day
of kindergarten.

24
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,371
- To Lily.
- Oh, Lily.

25
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:52,455
To Lily. To Lily.
And you'll be impressed to know

26
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,018
that she's gonna be one
of the smartest girls there.

27
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,345
Lily, sweetie, what's
the square root of 64?

28
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:57,125
8.

29
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:58,053
Wow. Hey!

30
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:58,969
Nice trick.

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,608
Hey, Lily, what's the square
root of this potato?

32
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:02,307
8.

33
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:04,394
Congratulations.
You have a parrot.

34
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,190
We couldn't even get
through the toast to Haley

35
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,900
before you pulled focus to Lily.

36
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,537
Oh, come on. It's-- it's a big day
for both of them. Huh?

37
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,687
Haley going to college
is a miracle.

38
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:16,435
Lily going to kindergarten
is the law.

39
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,410
Well, Haley and Lily aren't
the only ones starting school.

40
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,053
My mom and Jay
are going to parenting class.

41
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,255
We're doing it for the baby.

42
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,590
Not this baby.
That baby.

43
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,196
Manny doesn't believe that
we know what we're doing.

44
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,416
A couple of new hairs
under his arm,

45
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,775
and now he thinks he knows
more than his own mother.

46
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:35,132
I know not to embarrass my son

47
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,737
as he stands
on the threshold of manhood.

48
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,337
I don't know why I have
to go to this thing.

49
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,721
In case you've forgotten,
I raised two kids.

50
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:42,891
- Ow!
- Ow! Stop pulling my hair.

51
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,181
- Stop twisting my nipple. Ow!
- Shut up. Shut up.

52
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:48,998
Why look at me?
It was their mother's fault.

53
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:50,384
I was barely around.

54
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:51,216
No!
Ow, ow!

55

57
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,957
Haley, this is, like,
the third bag

58
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,299
of makeup and hair care products.

59
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,846
Dad, if you want me to get
good grades, I have to look cute.

60
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:11,898
Don't say a word.

61
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,444
No. No.
I agree with that premise.

62
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,365
Thank you. Wait.

63
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,332
Yeah, thank you.

64
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:21,644
- Claire.
- Mm-hmm?

65
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:23,978
In Haley's stuff,
a box of condoms.

66
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,545
Yeah.
Um, I-I bought those for her.

67
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:29,258
What? Why don't you just
buy her some fishnet stockings

68
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,829
and a nurse's outfit?

69
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:33,072
Not that that's my thing.
That just popped into my head.

70
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:35,410
Honey, she's an adult,
and she's going to college.

71
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,667
I want to be realistic.

72
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,377
I don't want her
to get caught unprepared.

73
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:41,290
24 times? What, are you
buying her a 4-year supply?

74
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,336
Please.
Phil, that would've lasted me

75
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,535
and my college boyfriend,
like, a long--

76
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,780
La, la, la, la, la, la, la!

77
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,015
Okay, we gotta hit the road.

78
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,536
Give your sister a hug good-bye.

79
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:53,920
Don't dork up our room.

80
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,658
Don't slut up your college.

81
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:02,174
Seriously, though,
don't study too hard, okay?

82
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,793
I'm totally going to have fun.

83
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,073
I'm Iceland in the mock U.N.

84
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,273
Mom, we're gonna lose her.

85
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:09,874
I am doing my best.

86
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,670
Luke, come say good-bye
to your sister.

87
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm right here.

88
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,549
Bye, Haley. Have fun.

89
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,036
Don't drink too much beer
and shots of Tequila.

90
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:21,589
Why are you wearing that mask?

91
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,483
Uh, I like it.

92
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,140
He doesn't want you
to see him cry.

93
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,996
He's literally
masking his emotions.

94
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:27,698
No!

95
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,564
- That's so sweet.
- Come here.

96
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:32,371
It's not sweet.
I'm an evil cyborg.

97
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:35,133
Half my face was burned off
in an industrial accident,

98
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:38,148
and the mask is hiding
the servos that control my mouth.

99
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:42,372
Yes, I am sad Haley is leaving,

100
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:45,204
but I'm gonna be okay knowing
I've done everything I can

101
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:49,382
to get her set up and prepared
and off on the right foot.

102
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:52,193
Not me. When we're standing
in her dorm room saying good-bye,

103
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:54,778
it's gonna be one of the most
emotional moments of my life.

104
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:58,083
I'm gonna cry harder than
the first time I saw "Air bud"...

105
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:00,764
Especially when I give her this.

106
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,763
- "Phil's-osophy."
- Hmm.

107
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,676
A hardbound collection of
all the life lessons I've learned,

108
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:07,733
such as...

109
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,274
"Always look people in the eye,

110
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:14,194
"even if they're blind.

111
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:16,720
Just say, 'I'm looking you in the eye.'"

112
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:18,698
or...

113
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,954
"If you get pulled over
for speeding,

114
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,047
tell the policeman
your spouse has diarrhea."

115
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:29,936
Phil's-osophy.

116
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,950
Look how much fun
you're gonna have here, Lily.

117
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:36,941
So many great toys to play with,

118
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,870
and you're gonna make
so many new friends.

119
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,825
Oh, I wish I was
in kindergarten again.

120
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,548
Oh, not me. Did I ever
tell you about David Anthony?

121
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,317
He used to call me "Cam the ham."

122
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,700
- Okay, Lily's day.
- Yeah, you're right.

123
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,685
You know what?
It's gonna be a great day.

124
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,839
I'm just saying,
it's difficult to grow up

125
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,111
with a name
that rhymes with "ham."

126
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,855
Hello? Mitch? Witch. Twitch.

127
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:53,998
Bitch.

128
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:55,247
Elaine Stritch.

129
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:56,013
What?

130
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,481
Not all bullies are straight.

131
00:04:57,808 --> 00:04:59,359
Okay, parents...

132
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,396
- Oh! 
- We'll see you at 12:00.

133
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,654
- All right.
- Mm!

134
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:04,160
- This is when the crying starts.
- Mm!

135
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,319
Does it ever stop?

136
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:07,427
Come on, Cam.

137
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,358
Okay.
You know what, Lily, sweetie?

138
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,770
I know this is gonna be difficult--

139
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:11,843
Bye!

140
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,246
Okay.
That was a knife to the heart.

141
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,103
No, it's-- it's a good thing.
Come on.

142
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,576
- Oh, you know what?
She forgot her snack. - Oh.

143
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:21,977
Where'd she go?

144
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,715
Ow! That hurts!
Ow! That hurts!

145
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:26,678
Oh, Lily, honey!

146
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,607
Sweetheart, come here.
Come here.

147
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:32,792
If you ever put your hands
on my daughter again,

148
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:35,420
I will string you up by your feet,
run you up the flagpole,

149
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:38,188
and let the birds
peck out your eyes.

150
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:39,976
You understand?

151
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,502
Mr. Tucker, put that boy down!

152
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,742
He pulled my daughter's hair.

153
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,474
Please apologize to Connor

154
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,715
for using your hands
instead of your words.

155
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:54,690
Sorry, little fella.

156
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,666
- I would like to see you in my office.
- Right.

157
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,547
- Now, please.
- Me, too? Oh.

158
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,413
Stop it.
Leave him alone.

159
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:19,787
Mr. Tucker, what happened
out there was unacceptable.

160
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,229
I agree. Is this kindergarten
or "The hunger games"?

161
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,073
I'm speaking of your behavior.

162
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:25,624
We've never had
an incident like this,

163
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,225
and now we've had
one on the first day,

164
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:28,554
before circle time.

165
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,312
What the fudge were you thinking?

166
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,513
Now the boy's parents
are coming in, and trust me,

167
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:33,941
they're mad as Hello Kitty.

168
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:35,918
Oh, you told his parents on us?

169
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,126
That is-- that is so not cool.

170
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:39,525
Well, I'm sure once they
hear what their boy did,

171
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:40,974
they will be understanding.

172
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,707
All right, whoever
made our son cry

173
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,435
has messed with the wrong moms.

174
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:48,459
Lesbians.

175
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:51,459
While often lumped together,
gay men and lesbians

176
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,497
have less in common
than one might think.

177
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,337
Like in the Venn diagram
of sexual identity,

178
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:57,712
you have gay men...

179
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,883
And straight men.

180
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:01,191
Both the same gender.

181
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,118
Then you have gay men...

182
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:04,616
And straight women.

183
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,027
Both attracted to the same gender.

184
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,235
But gay men and lesbians?

185
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:11,135
No.

186
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,138
Nothing.

187
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:14,947
I am so sorry
we have to meet like this,

188
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,728
but I'm sure you can
understand, as parents,

189
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,810
the instinct to protect your child.

190
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:21,648
Yeah, it's what makes me want
to punch you in the neck right now.

191
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:23,918
Wow. I see where your son
gets all of his aggression.

192
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,881
Okay, let's all take a time-out.

193
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:27,989
That's a good idea.
This is getting a little heated. Right?

194
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,934
Yeah, Pam, we don't want another
incident like at the lumberyard.

195
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,654
Oh, my God. You guys
go to the lumberyard, too? D--

196
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,613
I didn't know they
had a ladies' night.

197
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,215
Not the bar, Sally.

198
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,245
Okay, you know what?
He's trying to be nice,

199
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:40,539
and you just called him "Sally."

200
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,644
Yeah, you're not being very helpful,
Peppermint Patty.

201
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,311
Okay. Let's just stick
to our actual names.

202
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:45,710
Enough.

203
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,945
I'm gonna give you
a little homework assignment.

204
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:50,874
I want you and your kids
to have a family playdate.

205
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,265
Maybe if the four of you
can get along,

206
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,571
you can set a better
example for your children.

207
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:56,853
I think that's a wonderful idea. Pam?

208
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:58,951
- Fine.
- Cam?

209
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,831
Fine. We'll host, obviously.

210
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:01,703
"Obviously"?

211
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:02,427
Well, I assume you have

212
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,279
an unfinished woodworking
project at your house.

213
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,578
You've got a lot of nerve.

214
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,718
Yeah, and you've got half
a canoe in our living room.

215
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,148
I look forward to your frittata.

216
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,535
Oh. Why, are you visiting us in 2008?

217
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,728
Oh, my God.

218
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:17,950
Okay, thanks.

219
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:20,524
Baby for you.

220
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,065
You have some explaining to do.

221
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,192
I'm so sorry that you had
to find out like this, Jay.

222
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,354
Wow, you two are really far along.

223
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,704
We're, uh, we're still
in our first trimester.

224
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:32,939
Ay, that's nice.

225
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, we've been trying
to get pregnant for ages.

226
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,258
She's latina.
You just gotta look at her funny.

227
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:41,727
Okay, now that
everyone has their doll,

228
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:43,705
let's talk about swaddling.

229
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,450
Now you want to start by turning
one corner of the blanket

230
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:48,395
toward you, like a diamond,

231
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,497
and folding the top down,

232
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,416
like this.

233
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:55,371
I think they made a mistake
at the hospital.

234
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:58,800
Tough room.

235
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:02,143
Now we are going to pull
the other corner 'round,

236
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,895
and tuck it in nice and snug

237
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,284
like a burrito.

238
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:08,454
Done! I win.

239
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,904
It's not a race.

240
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:11,556
You're darn right.
It wasn't even close.

241
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:18,144
Okay, it's good,
but it's a little tight.

242
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,883
It's a burrito.
You don't want the meat to fall out.

243
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:22,948
Here. And try like this.

244
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:26,745
And see?

245
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,865
Now your baby can breathe.

246
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:35,621
I wrapped my son with
one hand while driving a stick.

247
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,685
I think I know
how to keep a baby safe.

248
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:43,410
Man, I love being
back in the dorms.

249
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,899
It's like I never left.

250
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:48,584
Throw up a David Copperfield poster,
this could be my room.

251
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,430
Honey, Haley and I have
to go fill out some paperwork.

252
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,974
Why don't you throw
the linens on the bed?

253
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,225
- Oh, and move the car
before they tow us. - Okay.

254
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:57,797
Oh, my God.
What is that shirt?!

255
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,335
Pretty sweet, huh?
"Haley Dunphy moving Co."

256
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,618
'Cause we're moving you
here and here.

257
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,059
And also...

258
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,036
Here. Mm.

259
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,807
Man, you used to love it
when we swung you like that.

260
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:10,604
I bet we could still do it.

261
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,993
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

262
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:13,210
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

263
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,998
Don't you dare pick me up!
And take that shirt off.

264
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,209
- What? Why?
- It's cute!

265
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,556
It's not cute! Do you see
what's happening out there?

266
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,737
People are walking around
and judging each other.

267
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:22,862
No, they're not.

268
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:23,457
Oh, really?

269
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,948
You didn't see the way
muffin top across the hall

270
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,121
was looking at me? People can be cruel.
So take it off.

271
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,592
Fine.

272
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,296
Oh, my God! Put on a shirt!

273
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,236
I don't know what
you want from me!

274
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:37,855
"You only get one chance
at a first impression.

275
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:41,200
I suggest Julia Child,
because it's easy to do."

276
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,849
"Save the giblets."

277
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:47,626
Time to go to the beach!

278
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,560
- You're gonna go to the beach with a dog?
- That dog on the beach.

279
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,392
- I don't know what I did to deserve this.
- Yeah.

280
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,530
I want to show Connor my toys.

281
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,141
Oh, okay. You do that, sweetie.

282
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,163
Hey, Connor, uh, no hair pulling.

283
00:10:58,445 --> 00:10:59,619
Thank you for that.

284
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,629
Okay, we have an assortment
of spring rolls here.

285
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:05,016
All vegetarian, of course.

286
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:07,871
Oh, 'cause I'm a lesbian,
I'm automatically a vegetarian?

287
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,442
Well, I saw it on "The L word."
I assume they have consultants.

288
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:12,210
I'm just saying
it's an offensive stereotype.

289
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,880
Okay, Pam, you are a vegetarian.

290
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:15,723
Wow!

291
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:16,524
Knock it off.

292
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,442
Worked out.

293
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,006
Yeah. So glad
that we are doing this.

294
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,840
- Yeah. Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,905
I mean, we're the only
gay parents in the class.

296
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,431
Yeah, we should be
supporting one another.

297
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,269
I mean, we have so much in common.

298
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,347
Exactly.

299
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:34,883
So...

300
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,231
Tell us about yourselves.

301
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:38,017
I'm an environmental lawyer.

302
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,517
Uh, and I'm a homemaker.

303
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,226
And-- and, uh,
and what do you do?

304
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:45,064
I'm a financial consultant.

305
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,425
I'm a contractor.

306
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,316
You thought I was a P.E. teacher?

307
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,406
- Well, figured.
- Mm.

308
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:52,464
Hey, I have a question real quick.

309
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,538
How do you guys get
the car seat on the motorcycle?

310
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,014
Uh, you know, Connor
is having a birthday next week.

311
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,327
Maybe Lily would like to come.

312
00:11:58,328 --> 00:11:59,516
Oh, she would love that.

313
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,085
Oh, great.
Are you guys having a clown?

314
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,294
Oh, God, no.

315
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:04,457
I hate clowns they're so creepy.

316
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,758
Maybe you just don't like them
because they wear makeup.

317
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:10,234
You know what? I'm out.

318
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:11,212
Okay. Pam.

319
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,566
Uh... Connor, we're leaving!

320
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,673
Pam! Pam! You-- you don't understand.
Cam used to be a clown.

321
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,207
"Used to be"?
Once a clown, always a clown.

322
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,009
God! Not now! Not now!

323
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:19,523
Connor, let's go.

324
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:20,556
Pam.

325
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:25,271
Why is this door locked?

326
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:26,641
Here. Let me, please.

327
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,345
Lily, open this door right now.

328
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,223
Okay. I'm not hearing anything.

329
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:33,412
I'm sure they're fine.

330
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:34,813
Oh, how are you sure?

331
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:36,570
Connor!

332
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:37,916
- Lily!
- Connor!

333
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:38,995
Lily!

334
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,859
Make the water comfortably warm

335
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,271
90 to 100 degrees max.

336
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:53,296
And never leave
the tub unsupervised.

337
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,214
Is there something you two
want to share with the class?

338
00:12:58,215 --> 00:12:59,783
No. It's dirty.

339
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,912
Excuse me.
We're trying to learn here.

340
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:06,880
Don't worry so much.
Babies are tougher than you think.

341
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,887
When I was 5 years old,
my babysitter was a goat.

342
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:10,773
What?

343
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:12,559
Ay, please.
You know about Lupe.

344
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,708
You never said she was a goat.

345
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,870
You know, it's great that we have

346
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:18,039
a couple of experienced
parents in the class.

347
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,604
Perhaps you can share some
of your wisdom with the rest of us.

348
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,460
Absolutely.
It's not rocket science.

349
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:25,221
It's babies.
They're hungry, you feed 'em.

350
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,761
They're teething,
you give 'em some scotch.

351
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:27,321
Scotch?

352
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:28,930
Really? Are you serious?

353
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:29,971
What?

354
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:31,564
So we left.

355
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:33,725
I didn't need a lecture
from Mary Poppins.

356
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,686
And I was suddenly
in a mood for a burrito.

357
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,523
I'd like admission
to your student body.

358
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,357
Aah! Oh, my goodness!

359
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:49,057
I am so sorry.
I thought you were my wife.

360
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:49,885
What's going on?

361
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:51,489
He grabbed me and said--

362
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,410
I thought she was my wife.
My wife works out a lot.

363
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,491
Dad?

364
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:55,452
How'd he grab you?

365
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,389
He squeezed my butt.

366
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:58,150
He what?

367
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:59,773
- Phil!
- I thought it was you!

368
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,070
Believe me, sir.
I'm a respected realtor.

369
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,165
This is an innocent mistake.

370
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,911
Honey, turn around and
show him your-- your butt.

371
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,479
- It-- it's uncanny.
- Dad.

372
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:09,172
I am very normal. Please do not
judge me based on them.

373
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:10,807
Are those your My little pony sheets?

374
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,114
What? No!

375
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,017
Mm. Oh. I ordered them online.

376
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,311
They must've sent the wrong ones.
I'm very sorry.

377
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,736
- That's what was in the box.
- Oh.

378
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:20,781
Okay.

379
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:23,850
Uh, for the record,
I am a respected realtor.

380
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:25,688
Those are not my condoms.

381
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:27,194
She bought 'em.

382
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,264
Oh, my God.

383
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:29,905
Apparently, that's
what people do these days--

384
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,340
- buy condoms for their kids.
- Uh-huh.

385
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:32,313
When I went to college,

386
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:33,781
my parents bought me
a bicycle helmet.

387
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:35,045
That was their idea of safety.

388
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:36,441
Certainly didn't need condoms.

389
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,293
Mm, not if you were wearing

390
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,179
a bike helmet around campus,
you didn't. Am I right?

391
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,405
Why don't we let you guys finish,

392
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:44,622
and we'll come back later?

393
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,088
- Okay.
- Okay.

394
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:46,637
Yeah.

395
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:47,928
Yeah. Yep. Yeah.

396
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,097
Yeah, that sounds good.

397
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:50,902
See you on parents weekend!

398
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,399
They seem nice.

399
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,807
- Guys.
- I-- I know. I know.

400
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,303
Look, we need
to reorganize a little.

401
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,404
Your dad will go out and
get us some new sheets.

402
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,557
You and I can hang up
all the pictures on the walls.

403
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,133
You know what?
I think it's best if you guys get going.

404
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,639
But we-- we wanted
to help you, sweetie.

405
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,340
No, I got it.

406
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,541
W-what if you wanna move
the furniture around?

407
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,519
And we were gonna take you
to dinner before we left.

408
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,032
I like the furniture where it is,
and I'm not hungry.

409
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,052
So...

410
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,484
- Okay.
- Okay.

411
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,776
Um, well, uh, before we leave,

412
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:20,295
- I wanted to give you a little present.
- Ohh.

413
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:21,680
It's actually not a little present.

414
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,018
It's probably the best present
you're ever gonna get.

415
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:26,874
- It's a collection of all
the things I've learned-- - Thanks.

416
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:30,365
Attention.

417
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,985
Dorm meeting in the common room.

418
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,274
Okay, so...

419
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,612
I better go.

420
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:35,757
Okay.

421
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:37,846
Okay, come here.
That's my girl.

422
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,397
- Let me get in there.
- Okay.

423
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:42,134
- All right.
- Bye!

424
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,294
Bye.

425
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,398
"The most amazing things that
can happen to a human being

426
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,686
"will happen to you

427
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:53,222
if you just lower
your expectations."

428
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,330
Oh, they've got
something over the hole.

429
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,006
- Lily!
- Connor!

430
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,656
We can't see anything from outside.

431
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:01,961
The curtains are closed.

432
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,475
Open up, Connor!
We'll let you have a hot dog!

433
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,111
What if something
happened to them?

434
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,731
What kind of hazards
do you keep in there?

435
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,535
Well, let's see.
That's where we keep our gun collection,

436
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,734
our abandoned refrigerator,

437
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,199
and our chocolate-covered
hypodermic needles.

438
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,929
Why are gay men
always so sarcastic?

439
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,047
It's my coping mechanism!

440
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,172
Okay, that's it!

441
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:19,525
Lily, Connor, if you can hear me,

442
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,009
back away from the door.
I'm gonna break it down.

443
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,597
I'll help you.

444
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,660
I don't want Connor to go!

445
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,110
I wanna stay!

446
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
Oh, thank God they're alive!

447
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:28,733
I love him!

448
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:31,838
No, you love the idea of him.
Now open this door, sweetie.

449
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,389
Can we really have hot dogs?

450
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,614
Yes, we promise.

451
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,179
Oh! Come here, sweetheart.

452
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:40,740
If you ask me,

453
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:43,412
sometimes we get so hung up
on our differences,

454
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,374
we forget the one thing
we have in common.

455
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,238
When it comes to the safety and
well-being of our children,

456
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,323
we're all a little bit nuts.

457
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,514
You have dainty little hands,
just like your daughter.

458
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:56,052
You have boots like my dad.

459
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:01,803
I'm not saying that the goat put me
to sleep or brushed my teeth.

460
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:04,114
It just stayed outside
my bedroom window

461
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,818
and scared all the strangers away.

462
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,795
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm a little disappointed.

463
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,901
Hey, kid!

464
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:11,424
Jay, mom, how was class?

465
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:14,334
It was great.
It was very educating and--

466
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:16,743
and now we know
everything about the baby, no?

467
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:20,095
Interesting, because
your teacher called,

468
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:22,112
and you forgot your sunglasses
when you left...

469
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,682
Three hours early.

470
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,249
Ay, Manny, don't be mad.

471
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,746
I'm not mad.
Just disappointed.

472
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,646
I hate this.
I prefer when he screams.

473
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,189
Manny, it's no big deal.

474
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,545
They weren't telling us anything
we didn't already know.

475
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:36,877
We're going to have a baby.

476
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:38,466
Am I the only one who's terrified?

477
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:39,697
But why?

478
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:42,363
Why are you so terrified?

479
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,201
What if it doesn't know
not to pick up knives

480
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:46,050
or stick its finger
in an electric socket?

481
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,662
You were pretty lax, mom.

482
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:48,822
I was the one who told you

483
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,269
to turn the pot handles
towards the stove

484
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,231
so I couldn't reach them.

485
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,073
Manny, I didn't worry
about those things

486
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,378
because you worried
for the both of us.

487
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,623
What if this baby
doesn't think things through?

488
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,544
It's part Jay.

489
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,753
No offense taken.

490
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:03,039
If the baby's different,
we'll be different.

491
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,535
Hey.

492
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:06,419
When you were growing up,

493
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,714
you had to be the man
of the house and the kid.

494
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,963
Now I'm here.
You just have to be the kid.

495
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,475
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to the baby,

496
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:16,724
just like I'm not ever gonna let
anything happen to you.

497
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:17,701
Okay?

498
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,223
Okay. That is a load off.

499
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,501
Although you forgot to pick me up
last week after tango class.

500
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,902
We didn't forget.
We were just ten minutes late.

501
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,831
Ten minutes is a long time
in a sketchy neighborhood.

502
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:31,272

a Gymboree and a Pottery Barn.

Yeah. No, I'm...

I'm-- I'm-- I'm good.
You?

509
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:50,638
Fine. Yeah.

510
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:52,498
Great.

Haley. Hi, honey. You okay?

519
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,316
Yeah.

520
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:29,985
Where are you guys?

521
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,370
Almost home, honey.

522
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:33,150
Dad, I really like that book.

523
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:34,796
You do?

524
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,979
Sweetheart, is everything okay?

525
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:40,751
Yeah, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything,

526

you know, today and stuff.

527
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:46,931
O-of course.

528
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,889
- Sure. - Of course.
If--if you need anything at all...

some more condoms soon.

some Care Bear sheets.

Anyway,

534
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,914
I should probably get going.
We have orientation at 7:00 a.m.
