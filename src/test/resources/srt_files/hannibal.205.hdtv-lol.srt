He consults me with cases if I keep
investigating murders he's accused of.

4
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:11,022
Good. It seems
you have an admirer.

5
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:13,439
You think someone sent me
in here because they admire me?

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,823
This killer wrote you a poem.

This is of course Freddie
Lounds, who you know.

She will be assisting me today,

- What have you taken, Bella?
- My morphine.

10
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:23,280
- Have you seen Jack? - No. There was
some sort of emergency with his wife.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,020
If Hannibal's the ripper, what's
he doing with his trophies?

She knew she couldn't
beat the cancer, so she...

00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:39,143
decided to beat it
to the finish line.

I suppose I can't blame her for

She wanted to die.

At aproximately 9AM this morning I've
received a phone call from Freddie Lounds.

36
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:04,070
Acting on an anonymous tip,

37
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,955
she discovered a female body,

38
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,338
immediately contacted my office.

39
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,891
I was amongst the first
on the scene.

40
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,762
The victim has been identified
as our colleague,

41
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,815
Special Agent Beverly Katz.

42
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,185
She will be memorialized

43
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:22,471
at FBI Headquarters and Field Offices
so that her ultimate sacrifice

44
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:26,108
will always be remembered.

45
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,713
That's all.

Leave us alone.

00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,256
Let's go!

51
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:52,431
You said you just
interpret the evidence.

52
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:55,150
So interpret the evidence.

53
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,744

I strangle Beverly Katz...

54
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,965
...looking in her eyes.

55
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:02,384
She knows me.

56
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:07,723
And I know her.

57
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:11,443
I expertly squeeze
the life from her...

58
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,447
...rendering her unconscious.

59
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,875
I freeze her body...

60
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,496
...preserving shape and form

61
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:34,216
so I can more cleanly
dismantle her.

62
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:43,141
She cuts like stone.

63
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,430
I pull her apart,

64
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:51,316
layer by layer...

65
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:57,439
...like she would a crime scene.

66
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:59,992
This is my design.

67
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,145
I will leave

68
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:06,448
no usable evidence,

69
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,585
but she found something.

70
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,821
She found me.

71
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,541
What she found is already gone.

72
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:20,746
What did I take from her?

73
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,896
It's the Chesapeake Ripper.

74
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:42,901
It's the Ripper

75
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,937
and the Copycat.

76
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,408
It's the same killer.

77
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,693
Two masks...

78
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,665
Beverly helped me see it.

79
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,238
Help me see it.

80
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,024
She was looking

81
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,528
for a connection between
the Copycat and the Ripper.

82
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:11,813
You think she found it?

83
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:17,402
She found something.

84
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:24,476
Where were you last night?

85
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:30,916
In the hospital.
With my wife.

86
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,285
I told Beverly

87
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:36,705
to go to you,

88
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,641
tell you everything she knew.

89
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:48,450
Instead, she went
looking for evidence.

90
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,522
She met the Ripper
last night, Jack.

91
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,557
She...

92
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:58,310
she will be...

93
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:01,496
missing organs.

94
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,482
He had to take his trophies.

95
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,617
Who is he, Will?

96
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:21,883
Beverly made her
connection to the Ripper.

97
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:27,706
You have to make
your own, Jack.

98
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:31,610
Then what did I
bring you here for?

99
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,600
To say goodbye.

100
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,938
Would you like to talk
about what happened at the observatory?

101
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,700
You discussed my therapy
with Hannibal Lecter, Frederick.

102
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,324
Counter to our agreement.

103
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:06,361
I gave him a peek before
I snatched down the shades.

104
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:08,930
I have appearances to maintain.

105
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,237
Beverly Katz paid you a visit
before she was murdered.

106
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:19,312
- What did the two of you discuss?
- What, you weren't listening to that one?

107
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:23,695
You met her in
the privacy room.

108
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:27,198
It is the only room in the facility I
am not legally allowed to monitor.

109
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:29,350
And you let that stop you?

110
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:36,591
We talked about
the Chesapeake Ripper.

111
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,127
Then she went and found him.

112
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:44,666
Psychopaths can be indifferent
to those sorts of setbacks.

113
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,568
I know something of the monster

114
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:50,071
you are dealing with.

115
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:52,840
He is a well-educated man.

116
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,777
A socially competent man.

117
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:58,846
He has surgical experience or,
at the very least, know-how.

118
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,616
You thought Abel Gideon
was the Chesapeake Ripper.

119
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,069
Evidently, I was
wrong about that.

120
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:07,905
- Gideon knows who the Ripper is.
- And I suppose you do, too.

121
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:13,111
Wouldn't it be interesting if we
both said it was the same man?

122
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,198
Yes, it would.

123
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:20,084
It's a shame we can't
talk to Abel Gideon

124
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,637
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

125
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:24,622
Well, just think, Frederick,

126
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:27,842
you could be the one
who catches him after all.

127
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,226
Beverly isn't
your responsibility.

128
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,095
You should be allowed to grieve. You
shouldn't have to wade through it.

129
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,565
We're not running away
from this, Jack.

130
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:52,933
Beverly wouldn't.

131
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:54,935
Good.

132
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:56,921
I double-checked
the autopsy report.

133
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:59,991
What you found at that
observatory wasn't all Beverly.

134
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,626
What do you mean?

135
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,328
These kidneys, they were
placed inside her body

136
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,615
after she was killed. I typed
them against DNA samples

137
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:11,452
and, uh, they belong to the
Mural Killer. James Gray. - James Gray.

138
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,337
So, whoever killed
James Gray and sewed him

139
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:16,758
into his mural also murdered Beverly.
Swapped out their kidneys.

140
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,343
Right now, the only thing
we have to go on

141
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,979
is we find her kidneys
and we find her killer.

Group therapy with the man

you are the pretender

Yes, how do you think
I found you?

163
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:26,587
He sent me to kill you, Abel.

164
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:31,642
Am I your evidence?

165
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:34,178
Oh, you're in trouble,

166
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,814
Mr. Graham.

167
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:38,816
Why would you protect him?

168
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,868
You were quite happy to try

169
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:43,404
and kill me yourself.

170
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:46,023
You have it "in you,"
as they say.

171
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,632
He is the Devil,
Mr. Graham.

172
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,934
He is smoke.

173
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,905
You'll never
"catch" the Ripper.

174
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:03,591
He won't be caught.

175
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,843
If you want him...

176
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,680
...you will have
to kill him.

177
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,352
Fair enough.

178
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,519
You and I are both proponents
of unorthodox treatments of the mind.

179
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:30,787
Strategies others might not
choose to understand.

180
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,626
What I'm trying to understand

181
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:37,693
is why you would transfer Abel
Gideon back to your hospital

182
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:39,803
for the unworried unwell.

183
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,446
It was not for selfish reasons.

184
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,005
Ah, selfishness.
The original sin of man,

185
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,480
according to Judeo-
Christian morality.

186
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:51,432
We are not talking about
morality or ethics here,

187
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,403
are we, Dr. Lecter? But rather,
concealing their absence.

188
00:20:57,707 --> 00:21:00,742
Gideon disemboweled you,
Frederick.

189
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,328
Brave of you, or perhaps wise,

190
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:06,081
to keep the evidence
of your misdeeds

191
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:09,184
- under your own roof.
- My misdeeds and yours.

192
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,252
Neither of us

193
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,254
controls our stories well enough

194
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:16,958
to get anything from exposing
the other's misdeeds.

195
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:22,230
Here's to that.

196
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,575
I brought Gideon back because...

197
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,977
I thought he may be useful

198
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,246
in Will Graham's therapy.

199
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:43,168
He shot Gideon, yet
he has no memory of it.

200
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,754
We know memories, emotions,

201
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:49,174
and even spiritual experiences

202
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,509
can be manipulated
while under hypnotics.

203
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:55,597
I'm trying to set Will on the path
to rebuilding his broken brain,

204
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,683
picking up your pieces,
as it were.

205
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,355
You've analyzed my patient;

206
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,891
perhaps you'll allow me
to analyze yours.

207
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,063
I'd like to interview
Abel Gideon.

208
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:31,299
You don't need
to stand way over there.

209
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,401
I'm a cutter, not a pisser.

210
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:39,090
Hello, Dr. Gideon.

211
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:41,392
Our brains devote more space

212
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,678
to reading the details of faces

213
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,847
than any other object.

214
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,516
Dare I say,

215
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,135
I've never seen yours before.

216
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,107
I'm Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

217
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:59,744
I was Will Graham's
psychiatrist.

218
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,913
Well, he's not
a very good advertisement

219
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,048
for your abilities,
Dr. Lecter.

220
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,850
That remains to be seen.

221
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,753
Oh,

222
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,589
I bet you're a devil
at the bridge table.

223
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,794
- It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure's mine.

224
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,796
[But now I know your name,]

225
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,798
[of course I am aware
of you by reputation]

226
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,251
[and I see why Chilton]

227
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,137
[both reveres you
and resents you.]

228
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:28,957
Esteem in psychiatric circles
still eludes him,

229
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,943
yet it clings to you
like soap to a baby's eyes.

230
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,980
He very much wants to be you.

231
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,716
He should be more careful
what he wishes for.

232
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,903
And you should have been
more careful with Will Graham.

233
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:44,438
That young man
has got a bone to pick.

234
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,292
As a therapist, I'm
concerned with finding ways

235
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,295
of overcoming resistance.

236
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,297
Not building it up.

237
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,683
Well, you built up something,

238
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:58,036
Dr. Lecter.

239
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,507
(birds chirping)
(camera shutter clicking)

240
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,427
That was rude, Miss Lounds.

241
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:09,931
Did you really think I was
above that sort of thing?

242
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,133
Hm... you seem

243
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,185
- disappointed.
- We evolved

244
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:17,689
the ability to communicate
disappointment to teach those around us

245
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,640
good manners.

246
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,328
Unfortunately, I did not evolve
the ability to feel shame.

247
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,647
You should explore
that in therapy.

248
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,784
I saw a psychiatrist once and
it was under false pretenses.

249
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:33,821
Happy to entertain you for
a more genuine conversation.

250
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,707
So, what brings you

251
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:39,627
to the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane?

252
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,963
I am interviewing Will Graham.

253
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,948
At his request.

254
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,718
Imagine that.

255
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,520
I'm trying.

256
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:53,007
Do not pass anything but soft
paper. No pens, no pencils.

257
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,227
Do not accept anything he gives
you. Do not let him touch you.

258
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:59,063
You do not touch him.

259
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,086
- I will be right outside.
- I know the drill.

260
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,961
It's good to see you again,
Will. Let me rephrase that.

261
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:15,863
It is good to see you in here.
Where you belong.

262
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,732
Thank you for coming.

263
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,969
- Why am I here?
- I have an admirer.

264
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,907
And he seems to fit
your demographic.

265
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,209
My demographic

266
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,345
is murderers and people
obsessed with murderers.

267
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,598
I'm talking about the man who killed
the bailiff and the judge at my trial.

268
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,050
Ah.

269
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,221
And you think he's your admirer?

270
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,477
He killed the bailiff
to give me an alibi.

271
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,496
He killed the judge

272
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,616
because he threw that alibi out.

273
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,369
So is your admirer crazy?

274
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:57,505
I don't think anybody
as careful as he is

275
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,757
could be crazy.
I think-I think he's different.

276
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,510
Maybe a lot of people
believe him to be crazy,

277
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:04,962
and the reason for that is, he
hasn't let people understand much

278
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:08,116
- about him.
- But you understand him.

279
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:14,305
Are you trying to catch him

280
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,357
or contact him?

281
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:23,798
I would like to establish
a line of communication.

282
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,701
And your website
seems like a good place

283
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:29,037
to do that.

284
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:31,272
I could open it up for you.

285
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:33,774
Ads, editorial,

286
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,445
online chat rooms, monitoring
incoming mail. I could be discreet.

287
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,948
In exchange for?

288
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,783
Exclusive rights to your story.

289
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:55,963
It's all yours, Freddie.

290
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,853
You want to talk
to your admirer,

291
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,355
we'll have to send
an invitation.

292
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,994
"Sadly, other killers have drawn
<i>inspiration from Graham.</i>

293
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,413
"As he stood trial for his life,

294
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:14,532
<i>"one such killer</i>
<i>even constructed an ode</i>

295
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,701
"to Graham's grisly techniques.

296
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,120
<i>"Graham believed this man</i>
<i>wanted to help,</i>

297
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:21,522
<i>"even though his motives</i>
<i>for that are unclear.</i>

298
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,541
<i>"He killed people in his name,</i>

299
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,544
<i>and he'd like to ask him why."</i>

300
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:32,266
Would you like
a book, Mr. Graham?

301
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,687
I have my imagination.

302
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,725
I read your TattleCrime
interview.

303
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:42,827
You're a very articulate man.

304
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,481
I agreed with a lot
of what you said.

305
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:49,717
You're right.

306
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,320
People don't understand much

307
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,405
about me.

308
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,874
Or about you.

309
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,543
But at least

310
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,212
we understand each other.

311
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,549
There's something
we don't have.

312
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,202
Or maybe we just
evolved not to need.

313
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,757
You were hiding in the FBI.

314
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:16,177
That's talent.

315
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:18,763
If you hadn't gotten sick,
they never would've found you.

316
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,735
You found a great
place to hide.

317
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,737
Spend time in
a mental hospital,

318
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,739
you pick up the drill.

319
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,808
You could pass as an orderly,

320
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,910
get a job doing it
when you get out.

321
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,796
They may never
know you were in.

322
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,748
Obviously you realize

323
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,733
Chilton records
every word said in here.

324
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,869
Who do you think
wired the mics?

325
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:45,756
- Or unwired the mics, as they currently are.
- You killed the bailiff

326
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:49,277
- during my trial.
- I thought it would exonerate you.

327
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:53,297
I had read your file
often enough.

328
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,867
Easy to recreate your work.

329
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,269
It was so specific.

330
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,955
Though the bailiff was a bitch
to get on that stag's head.

331
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,940
And the judge?

332
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,809
I killed the bailiff.

333
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,944
The judge was...

334
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,946
somebody else.

335
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,315
(keys jingling)

336
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,981
Why are you trying to help me?

337
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,317
Have you seen the way
that smaller birds

338
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,319
will mob a hawk on a wire?

339
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,355
You and me, we are
hawks, Mr. Graham.

340
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:53,357
Hawks are solitary.

341
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,143
And that's their weakness.

342
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,415
Enough of those smaller birds get
together, and they chase hawks away.

343
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:07,872
Imagine if the hawks
started working together.

344
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,682
Why did you want to talk to me?

345
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:20,768
(door unlocking)
I need a favor.

346
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,608
I'm always happy to do
a favor for a friend.

347
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:31,679
Just say the words.

348
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,239
I want you to kill
Hannibal Lecter.

349
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,077
Will?

350
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,663
Hi.

351
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:46,769
Hi.

352
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:49,300
I'm sorry to drop in
unannounced like this.

353
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:52,464
- What's on your mind, Dr. Bloom?
- You.

354
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:54,883
You gave an interview
to Freddie Lounds.

355
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:58,069
You despise Freddie Lounds.
It just seemed, um...

356
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,923
What, suspicious?

357
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:05,026
And slightly worrying.

358
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:09,147
You don't have
to worry about me.

359
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,134
I know you feel powerless

360
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,604
about what happened to Beverly,

361
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:17,605
and you want to do
something about it.

362
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:19,941
Would that be so bad?

363
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:22,327
Depends on what you're
thinking about doing.

364
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,782
But there's no solution
to grief, Will. It just is.

365
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,252
Beverly died because of me.

366
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:34,422
Because she listened to me.

367
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:38,843
I'm not gonna let that
happen again.

368
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,381
Will, what have you done?

369
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,804
Just what I had to do.

370
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:11,710
What is it about you,
Dr. Bloom?

371
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:14,713
The most sinister
neurochemistry in the field

372
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:17,716
cannot help percolating
in your presence.

373
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,885
The interesting ones
all fall at your feet.

374
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:23,638
Will Graham, Abel Gideon,

375
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:25,673
they're chatty as can be.

376
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:27,809
You are like
catnip for killers.

377
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:31,196
I see Abel Gideon
has returned to the roost.

378
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,916
I believe you and I are his
only surviving psychiatrists.

379
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:37,168
Pulled the tongues
out of all the rest.

380
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:39,955
Pulled more than
that out of you.

381
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:44,075
Have you noticed anything
different about Will

382
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:46,144
- since Gideon arrived?
- Gideon is here

383
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:50,048
as part of Will's therapy,
helping him reclaim his past.

384
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:54,169
Can I see him?

385
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:56,171
<i>Dr. Bloom--</i>

386
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:59,391
You are like a flower
blossoming amongst the weeds.

387
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:02,010
I'm glad to see you
alive, Dr. Gideon.

388
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:04,545
Well, Mr. Graham didn't do
a particularly good job

389
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:07,015
of killing me. He was sick.

390
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:09,634
- And a very poor shot.
- Good enough shot

391
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:12,404
to get a bullet in you
before you put a blade in me.

392
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:15,940
And for that,
I am sincerely grateful.

393
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:19,961
Been wondering
about that night.

394
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:21,896
How do you know where I live?

395
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:25,400
A little birdie
wanted me to kill you.

396
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:28,586
Or a little birdie
wanted Mr. Graham

397
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:31,706
to have reason to kill me.
But either way,

398
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,210
you and I are equally
expendable.

399
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:37,245
You were trying to find
the Ripper that night.

400
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:40,265
- Did you?
- I found Will Graham.

401
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,133
Will isn't
the Chesapeake Ripper.

402
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:45,470
Not yet.

403
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,326
All the things
that make us who we are...

404
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,311
What has to happen

405
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:56,214
to make those things change?

406
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:59,167
So much has happened
to Mr. Graham.

407
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:05,173
He is a changed man.

408
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:07,175
Maybe he's looking
for redemption.

409
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:10,211
But revenge,

410
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:13,465
now that is a trinket
he could value.

411
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:18,753
He thinks that he knows
who killed Beverly Katz?

412
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:22,190
For the courtesy
you have always shown me,

413
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:24,476
I am going to give you a gift.

414
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,478
I'm going to give you a chance

415
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:28,646
to save Will from himself.

416
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:31,649
How?

417
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:35,070
He is in a biblical
place right now,

418
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:37,572
but that rage will pass.
And when it does,

419
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:39,974
Will Graham will either be
a murderer or he will not.

420
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:42,177
Up to you.

421
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,529
He's institutionalized.
He's really

422
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,414
in no position to be
killing anyone.

423
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:49,117
Not with his own hands.

424
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:53,204
But if he only had
a little birdie

425
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,091
who could whisper murder
into a sympathetic ear...

426
00:35:58,094 --> 00:36:00,578
Who does he want
to kill, doctor?

427
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,116
He's not here.

428
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:30,868
There's nothing
in his calendar.

429
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:33,796
What is it you think Will's done?
(phone ringing)

430
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:37,331
Hold that thought.
This is Jack Crawford.

431
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:40,317
Yes. Thank you.

432
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:43,487
We've got a trace
on his cell phone.

433
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,347
Judas had the decency

434
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:45,532
to hang himself in shame
at his betrayal.

435
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:48,102
But I thought

436
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:51,071
you needed help.

437
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:54,358
Did you know that the phrase
"to kick the bucket" came

438
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:58,395
from exactly this situation? You could kick it
out right now yourself and it'd all be over.

439
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:00,731
Quicker than bleeding out.

440
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:07,087
You're a nurse at the hospital.

441
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:12,209
You're setting a new
standard of care.

442
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:19,266
Will Graham is not
what you think.

443
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,253
He's not a murderer.

444
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:25,939
He is now.

445
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:27,941
By proxy.

446
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:30,194
(grunting)

447
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:32,196
He asked you to do this?

448
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,481
What are friends for?

449
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,986
Now I'm going to ask you
a few yes or no questions

450
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:41,238
while you still have enough blood
coursing through your brain

451
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:44,908
to answer them. You ready?

452
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:47,778
Ready.

453
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:51,632
Did you kill that judge?

454
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:56,754
I can ask you
yes-or-no questions,

455
00:39:56,788 --> 00:39:58,756
you don't have to say a word,

456
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,725
and I'll know
what the answer is.

457
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,727
The pupil dilates

458
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:06,129
with specific mental efforts.

459
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:08,766
You dilate, that's a "yes."

460
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,602
No dilation equals "no."

461
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,608
Are you the Chesapeake Ripper?

462
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:25,415
How many times have you watched
someone cling on to a life

463
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,601
that's not really worth living?

464
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:31,488
Eking out a few extra seconds.

465
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:34,658
Wondering why they bother.

466
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:37,511
I know why.

467
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:39,546
Life is precious.

468
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:10,377
The Chesapeake Ripper.

469
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:13,213
I wonder what
they're gonna call me.

470
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:15,833
You know, the Iroquois
used to eat their enemies

471
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,868
to take their strength.

472
00:41:19,587 --> 00:41:23,006
Maybe your murders
will become my murders.

473
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:27,010
I'll be the Chesapeake
Ripper now.

474
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:28,879
Only if you eat me.

475
00:41:28,897 --> 00:41:31,765
(laughing)

476
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:40,824
Put your hands
where I can see them.

477
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,609
He's got a gun, Jack!

478
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:02,498
Hold on!

479
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:04,856
Hold on, hold on.

480
00:42:05,141 --> 00:42:07,134
Get an ambulance!

481
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:30,253
