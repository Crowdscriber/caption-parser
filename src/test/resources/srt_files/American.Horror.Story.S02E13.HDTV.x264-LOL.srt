<i>Tales from Briarcliff</i>
by Lana Winters,

3
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,488
read by the author.

4
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,555
LANA: Chapter six,

5
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:27,791
"The Gathering Storm."

6
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:31,093
Behind the stone walls
of Briarcliff,

7
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,690
time had no meaning.

8
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:36,547
The days themselves seemed
to exist (birds cooing)

9
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:39,835
in a kind of perpetual twilight.

10
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:42,790
Life there was just a series
of numbing cruelties

11
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:44,480
and humiliations,

12
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:47,870
all masquerading
as something else.

13
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:50,991
You weren't conceived in love,
but in hate.

14
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,508
I couldn't wait to give you up.

15
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,768
(echoing):
You're an abomination.

16
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,828
<i>You should</i>
<i>never have been born.</i>

17
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:04,537
I was in the third week
of my confinement,

18
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:06,734
and a storm was coming.

19
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:09,164
The nor'easter of '64

20
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,931
that brought
so much devastation with it,

21
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:13,161
and for me, something else,

22
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,825
something far more savage
even than nature.

23
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:20,940
(distant screaming)

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,040
Oliver Thredson was,

25
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:27,401
to all appearances,

26
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,189
a kindly figure,

27
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,611
fatherly in his manner.

28
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:36,060
This face he showed the world,

29
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:38,117
this face of sanity
and benevolence,

30
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,968
that was his real mask.

31
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,325
Underneath lurked

32
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:45,285
the real Oliver Thredson,

33
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:47,213
an unspeakable monster.

34
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:53,067
I loved you even when you were
still in your mother's womb.

35
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,166
I would have given anything

36
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,930
to be a real father to you,

37
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,463
but she kept us apart.

38
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:02,056
<i>I had so much love</i>
<i>to give you, son.</i>

39
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,487
<i>She stole it from you.</i>

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,673
From both of us.

41
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,166
(thud)

42
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,496
LEO: ♪ Here comes the bride. ♪

43
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:19,459
THERESA: Oh, my God.

44
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:21,717
(laughter)

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,241
THERESA: The Catholic
Church bought this place

46
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:27,803
in '62,
and turned it into a sanitarium

47
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,367
for the criminally insane.

48
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:33,697
Legend has it that once you
were committed at Briarcliff,

49
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,093
you never got out.

50
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:40,786
The most famous resident
was a serial killer named...

51
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,783
LEO: Bloody Face.

52
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:44,549
Say Bloody Face.

53
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,480
THERESA: Bloody Face.

54
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,097
Maybe it's Bloody Face.

55
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,529
Maybe it's just old pipes.

56
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:10,413
Let me see.

57
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,377
What? You scared, pussy?

58
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:13,974
(chuckles)

59
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,600
Oh, my God! What? What's wrong?

60
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,598
You're such a prick.

61
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,195
You are such a prick.

62
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,925
Speaking of which...

63
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:28,656
No. I want to know
what's in there.

64
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:32,019
Do it again and I'll blow you.

65
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,452
Give me your phone.

66
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,812
(screaming)

67
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,573
And who did this drawing of you?

68
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,342
LANA: Bono.

69
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:28,709
(chuckles)

70
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,377
He was a bit tipsy
on the airplane

71
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:31,646
coming back from Somalia

72
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,615
and drew it
on the cocktail napkin.

73
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,450
He's quite good, isn't he?

74
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,686
Be sure and get
an insert of that, Pete.

75
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,122
So with six bestsellers,

76
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,125
a reputation as the only one
the men will open up to,

77
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:49,031
world leaders, stars,
disgraced politicians,

78
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,699
who's the one that got away?

79
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,767
Is there anyone you lusted after
that you missed?

80
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,169
That's easy:
Mao and Rielle Hunter.

81
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:58,039
And she's still lusting
after Julian Assange.

82
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:00,074
Uh, look, I know

83
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,709
I said no on-camera appearances

84
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:02,978
for you, but I love

85
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,412
this whole bringing

86
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,447
the chardonnay thing,

87
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,282
super casual, loving.

88
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,551
What about just that?

89
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,719
I'm April, by the way.

90
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,720
Marian.

91
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:12,821
What a pleasure.

92
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,323
I saw your Norma at the Met.

93
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,191
Transcendent.

94
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,127
She's doing it in Bologna
this summer.

95
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:19,895
Thank you.

96
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,463
I've got rehearsal;
I've got to take off.

97
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,631
I'll be back by 5:00.

98
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,735
We have that Sondheim dinner
birthday thing tonight.

99
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,737
Mmm.

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,908
Am I not
the luckiest woman alive?

101
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,779
A little higher, babe.

102
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,280
Attaboy.

103
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,182
Mm-mm, higher still.

104
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,386
Oh, what are they teaching
these kids in film school?

105
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:45,721
God knows

106
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,155
it's not how to make us old gals

107
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:48,356
look more gorgeous.

108
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:49,824
Nothing old about you, Lana.

109
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,659
Well, thanks to a very talented
surgeon in Paris

110
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,495
and a great dermatologist.

111
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:56,397
So, what are we covering today?

112
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:58,132
Well, since it's
a Kennedy Center honor,

113
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,601
I'd say
it's a pretty big canvas.

114
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,101
Jesus, darling, I hope

115
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:02,770
this isn't going
to feel like a eulogy.

116
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,206
I will certainly ask you

117
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:06,974
about your notorious
nail-to-the-cross

118
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,242
prison interview with Madoff.

119
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,777
But before all that,

120
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,679
I'd like to go back

121
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:13,180
and start with the early years.

122
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,815
The awful.

123
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,550
Bloody Face saga.

124
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:19,487
I said I wouldn't talk
about that.

125
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,655
People want to hear about it.

126
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,222
It's what made you famous.

127
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,689
My point exactly.

128
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:26,156
He's become a goddamn
household name.

129
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,025
Like some kind of Heath Ledger,

130
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:29,893
Hollywood movie star villain.

131
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:31,395
He was an evil monster

132
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,365
who used murder and torture

133
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,166
to keep himself
from feeling like a eunuch.

134
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:38,235
End of story.

135
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:42,372
I refuse to give him
one more second of air time.

136
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,874
So then let's start
with the event

137
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,542
that made your reputation
as a crusader for change,

138
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,612
the Briarcliff exposé.

139
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,147
We good to go, everyone? Honey,
hand me that mirror, will you?

140
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:51,816
I like to do my own eyebrows.

141
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:02,829
How do I look?

142
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,597
Like a million bucks.

143
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:06,199
(chuckles)

144
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:07,533
But they're still not
gonna let us

145
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,068
in that front door
with a camera.

146
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,870
Oh, I know how to get in.

147
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:13,540
MAN: Jesus, how did
you find this place?

148
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,642
LANA: Listen, when we get
inside, no matter what happens,

149
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,377
or what anybody says,
you keep shooting.

150
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:19,346
We need to document
the conditions, the filth,

151
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:21,215
these people are forced
to live in.

152
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,250
I want the footage
to shock the public

153
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:25,052
out of their complacency,
you understand?

154
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,987
I want moral outrage.

155
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:29,490
I want to put America
in the asylum.

156
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:32,393
APRIL: The fact that
you would voluntarily

157
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:34,662
go back into the place
where you almost died,

158
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,398
that's why you were held
in such high esteem

159
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,133
by all of America
and your peers.

160
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:42,570
Did you always have
this need for justice?

161
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,872
That's the myth.

162
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,041
Lana Winters, crusader.

163
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:50,543
It was a story that I helped
to perpetuate,

164
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:53,914
but, uh, it's time I come clean.

165
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,017
It wasn't justice

166
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,151
that got me back to Briarcliff.

167
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:58,886
It was ambition.

168
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:01,222
I knew my future
wasn't in print.

169
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:03,457
You had an abrupt career change.

170
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,759
I knew television
was the future.

171
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:08,462
So I got started in local news,

172
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,531
then an NBC affiliate

173
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:13,067
before I landed my own series
of investigative reports.

174
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,901
<i>America Unmasked.</i>

175
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,104
With TV, words,

176
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,539
they're less important.

177
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,441
You need something people
can see,

178
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,643
visual stimulation,

179
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,612
and believe me, there is nothing
more stimulating

180
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,847
than crazy people.

181
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,982
But you need more than that.

182
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,952
You need an angle, a hook.

183
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,856
And boy, did I have a doozy.

184
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:42,296
(beeps)

185
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,465
<i>I heard from very reliable</i>
<i>sources that Sister Jude,</i>

186
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:49,369
<i>the nun that imprisoned me</i>
<i>at Briarcliff, was still alive.</i>

187
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:52,773
<i>In fact, she had become</i>
<i>a patient there herself.</i>

188
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,142
<i>I was going to go</i>
<i>into that snake pit</i>

189
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,544
<i>and rescue her</i>
<i>from the very place</i>

190
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:59,981
<i>she had me committed.</i>

191
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:02,383
Milo, I told you
to keep rolling.

192
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,619
Get the camera up
and pointed at me.

193
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:07,822
At Briarcliff Manor,

194
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,058
it's not uncommon to see
patients left on their own

195
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,694
without supervision,
without stimulation,

196
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:16,797
for hours on end.

197
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,734
The squalor, the filth,

198
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,003
the decay of this institution

199
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,105
is a shocking indictment

200
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,540
of the abandonment
of her most needy

201
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:28,910
by the state of Massachusetts.

202
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:40,119
(beeps) The Church
sold Briarcliff Manor

203
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:43,823
to the state of Massachusetts
in the fall of 1965.

204
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,393
Since then,
conditions have deteriorated.

205
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:50,163
The images and sounds
are far more...

206
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,398
(sighs)

207
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,966
Ready? You need a slate?

208
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:54,467
(indistinct talking) Are...

209
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,303
Yeah, are you sleeping?
Come on.

210
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,771
(beeps)

211
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,581
Three, two, one.

212
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,117
The church sold.

213
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,053
Briarcliff Manor
to the state of Massachusetts

214
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,188
in the fall of 1965.

215
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,792
Since then, conditions
have deteriorated.

216
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,829
These images and sounds
are far more powerful

217
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,166
than any words
that can be spoken.

218
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,307
(distant shrieking)

219
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:34,445
(coughing)

220
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,947
(woman screaming)

221
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,250
(coughing)

222
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:40,518
LANA: But how can I

223
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,921
describe to you
the way it smells?

224
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:44,589
It reeks of filth, of disease.

225
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:46,090
It smells of death.

226
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:47,225
MAN: Who are you?

227
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:51,195
Do you...

228
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:53,697
have permission to do this? You are
the first attendant we've seen

229
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:55,165
the entire time
we've been here.

230
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,101
Is it the policy to
leave patients unclothed

231
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,402
and unclean, some of them

232
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,770
smeared in their own feces?

233
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:03,340
Uh... I'm sorry, there's...

234
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,575
just too many for us
to take care of.

235
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,745
Right now I'm
interested in one.

236
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,448
I demand to see Judy Martin.

237
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:12,583
(man screaming)

238
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
LANA: Give me some light.

239
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,040
Judy Martin?

240
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:39,877
Do you remember me?

241
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:44,716
You were committed
to Briarcliff

242
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:46,852
to cover up the abuses
the church and science

243
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,121
had perpetrated
against patients here.

244
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,656
You were left to die.

245
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:52,157
Alone.

246
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,759
Abandoned.

247
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:57,195
I've come back to help you.

248
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,798
I'm going to get you
out of here, Sister Jude.

249
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,069
It's okay.

250
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,916
Lana... Banana.

251
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:25,824
APRIL: <i>Such a powerful
scene you describe.</i>

252
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,226
<i>I'm embarrassed to say</i>
<i>I don't remember it.</i>

253
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:30,895
That's because it
never happened.

254
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,864
LANA: <i>By the time I
got to Briarcliff,</i>

255
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,865
<i>Jude was gone.</i>

256
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,168
I should've gone back sooner.

257
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:39,171
But you did shut
down Briarcliff.

258
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:42,007
Yes, but it's not
the ending I wanted.

259
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,876
It was one hell of an ending,

260
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:46,845
just not the one I wanted.

261
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,015
And there's your promo.
(laughs)

262
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,284
Let's take a break.
I need to freshen up.

263
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:53,518
Ms. Winters needs a break.

264
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:54,819
Five and we're back.

265
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,020
Would you like
something to drink?

266
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,788
I'd love a sparkling water.

267
00:13:57,856 --> 00:13:59,790
Would you get Ms. Winters
a sparkling water, please?

268
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,901
Thanks.

269
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,169
You're a doll.

270
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:14,471
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.

(laughs)

279
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,417
I was just watching the news.

280
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:49,452
You did it.

281
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,686
You really did it.

282
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:51,788
You shut down Briarcliff.

00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,032
And I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

287
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,533
Questions? Yes.

288
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,602
Like who's Betty Drake?

289
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,770
And is she here?

290
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:13,975
I'll talk to you, Lana,

296
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:33,196
I was still trying
to find Jude.

297
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,931
But of course.

298
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,534
Jude hadn't existed for years.

299
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,169
The Monsignor saw to that.

300
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,704
(sheep bleating)

301
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,773

LANA: <i>And then I found this.</i>

305
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,624
Betty Drake,

306
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,160
released to the care
of Kit Walker,

307
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,462
March 27, 1970.

308
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,763
That was just
a few months after

309
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,899
you came to see me
at the book signing.

310
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,401
It's Jude, isn't it?

311
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,438
Why do you care now, Lana?

312
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,643
Hmm?

313
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,044
We all just part of your story?

314
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,478
It's not just my story, Kit.

315
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,080
It's yours, too. And hers.

316
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,949
You went back for her.

317
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,952
Why?

318
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,956
(sighs)

319
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,825
'Cause it was
something I could do.

320
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,494
I mean, I couldn't
shut the place down,

321
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,196
I couldn't lead them all
out of there like Moses.

322
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,966
But, Jude, whatever she was,

323
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:43,035
she didn't belong there
any more than we did.

324
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,373
<i>I couldn't just</i>
<i>leave her there.</i>

325
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:51,144
<i>After Alma died, I...</i>
<i>started visiting her there.</i>

326
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:58,318
<i>At least once a week.</i>

327
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,387
<i>Sometimes twice.</i>

328
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,523
<i>There was still life there.</i>

329
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,726
<i>There was still someone buried</i>
<i>deep inside.</i>

330

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,126
and the other half would have
had me banned from the state.

496
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:26,194
Can we talk about what happened
with Cardinal Howard?

497
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:28,230
At the time,
he was a powerhouse,

498
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:30,499
a rising star in the church.

499
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,835
The man had avoided
me for weeks.

500
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:35,504
<i>I went through all</i>
<i>the official channels,</i>

501
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:37,940
<i>but he ignored every request</i>
<i>I made for an interview.</i>

502
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,944
<i>So, finally, I cornered him</i>
<i>on his way to Easter Mass.</i>

503
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,478
Cardinal Howard.

504
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:44,747
I have nothing to say
to you, Miss Winters.

505
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:47,017
With or without your comments,
I'm airing a report

506
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,552
tomorrow night
on Dr. Arthur Arden,

507
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,621
a man you hired to run
the medical unit at Briarcliff.

508
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,089
We finally gained access
to his files.

509
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:54,292
Did you know he was
conducting human experiments?

510
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,161
We found some
very disturbing evidence.

511
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:59,464
Cardinal... Would you mind
switching that off, please?

512
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,800
A number of patients
disappeared under his care.

513
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,768
Do you have any idea
what happened to them?

514
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,003
It was over seven years ago.

515
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,571
You can't expect me to remember

516
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,640
anything about patients
I wasn't responsible for.

517
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,342
I'm afraid you are responsible.

518
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:11,643
Everything that happened
at Briarcliff

519
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:12,912
happened under your authority.

520
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:14,513
And there is no
statute of limitations

521
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,981
on murder, Cardinal Howard.

522
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,549
The police have found remains,

523
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,884
human bones in the woods
outside Briarcliff.

524
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,287
They're going to start
asking hard questions.

525
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:23,922
And since the notorious
Dr. Arden has disappeared,

526
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,457
they're going to be looking
to you for answers.

527
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:26,992
Get out of my way.

528
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,159
What are you running from,
Cardinal Howard?

529
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,194
Out of the way, Miss Winters!

530
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:31,763
What are you running from?
Happy Easter.

531
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:32,731
Answer the question.

532
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,466
(tires squeal)

533
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,570
APRIL:
<i>To this day, people still</i>

534
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:40,840
blame you for what
happened to him.

535
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:43,543
I've got broad shoulders,
but I can't take credit

536
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:45,378
for what his guilty conscience
made him do.

537
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:57,990
<i>That man was a particular kind</i>
<i>of liar,</i>

538
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:02,028
<i>the kind who lies to himself</i>
<i>about being a liar.</i>

539
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:06,566
He was so corrupt and deluded,
he believed his own lies.

540
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:10,804
Lies are like scars
on your soul.

541
00:30:10,872 --> 00:30:14,342
They destroy you.

542
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:18,413
I have a feeling
we're not just talking

543
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,747
about Cardinal Howard anymore.

544
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,483
Is there something

545
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:24,085
you'd like to share with us?

546
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:27,822
I'm going to come clean
about a lie

547
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,292
I've told for over 40 years.

548
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,494
In my book <i>Maniac,</i>

549
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,363
I write about the abuse,

550
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:37,899
the rape, the pregnancy.

551
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:41,803
I say that the baby
died in childbirth.

552
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:46,574
I even wrote about
a kind of poetic justice

553
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:49,911
that the child hadn't lived.

554
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:53,615
That child is alive.

555
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:58,287
I didn't raise him,
but someone did.

556
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,758
(baby crying)

557
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,762
Don't ask me to do that again.

558
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:11,567
<i>He'll need to learn</i>
<i>how to live without me.</i>

559
00:31:13,937 --> 00:31:17,740
I just prayed really hard

560
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,675
that somebody else
could give him

561
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:21,711
the kind of mothering he'd need.

562
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:23,713
I couldn't muster it.

563
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,482
I tried, but I couldn't.

564
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,184
That's quite a secret, Lana.

565
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:30,586
The only person
I've told is Marian.

566
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,255
Do you mind if I ask,

567
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:34,524
has there been
any contact since?

568
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,128
There was a period in the
mid-'70s where I suffered

569
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,698
a terrible remorse
about giving him up.

570
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,468
<i>I used all my skills</i>
<i>as a sleuth,</i>

571
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,271
<i>which are myriad as we know,</i>
<i>to track him down.</i>

572
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:51,840
<i>I just needed to see him.</i>
<i>I didn't have a plan.</i>

573
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:54,676
What you got in here?
You like dinosaurs?

574
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,845
You want to suck
a brontosaurus dick?

575
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:58,480
BOY: Shut up, asshole!

576
00:31:58,548 --> 00:31:59,815
Who are you calling asshole,
faggot?

577
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:04,920
Hey, you, you little shit.
You back off before I hurt you

578
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,489
in ways you haven't
even dreamt of.

579
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:16,266
Are you all right?

580
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,233
Yeah, I'm fine.

581
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,909
You know he's
the asshole, right?

582
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:28,077
Yeah, I know.

583
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,266
You should report him.

584
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,339
<i>That was the last time</i>
<i>I saw him.</i>

585
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,742
I wasn't his mother.

586
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,412
Not in any meaningful way.

587
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,049
I would only confuse him.

588
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,920
But I thought
about him so often.

589
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,322
Wondering where he was.

590
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:14,491
How he turned out.

591
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,829
APRIL: Did you ever think about
having children after that?

592
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:23,701
It was a different time
for gay women.

593
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,439
Most of us were resigned
to not having children.

594
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:30,275
But I was close
to my friends' children.

595
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:33,678
In fact, Kit... Kit Walker...

596
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:38,317
he asked me to be
godmother to his kids.

597
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:42,154
<i>Kit got married again.</i>

598
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,189
<i>He met a great girl named</i>
<i>Allison down at the co-op.</i>

599
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:47,326
<i>I don't know who loved her</i>
<i>more... Kit or those kids.</i>

600
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:16,715
<i>Kit always believed the kids</i>
<i>were destined for great things.</i>

601
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:20,886
They grew up with that message,
and they lived up to it.

602
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:23,489
Thomas is a law professor
at Harvard.

603
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:27,825
Julie is a leading neurosurgeon
at Johns Hopkins.

604
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:30,527
Kit would be so proud of them.

605
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:33,629
Is he no longer with us?

606
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:37,099
When he was around 40, he
developed pancreatic cancer.

607
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:40,102
<i>By the time they found it,</i>

608
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:43,471
<i>the tumor had metastasized</i>
<i>to the liver.</i>

609
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,774
<i>They gave him chemo, but...</i>

610
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:49,710
<i>it was just a waiting game.</i>

611
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:53,046
<i>The kids both offered</i>
<i>to look after him,</i>

612
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:56,449
<i>but he wouldn't hear of it.</i>

613
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,586
<i>In those last months,</i>
<i>he seemed more peaceful</i>

614
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:03,955
<i>than I'd ever seen him.</i>

615
00:35:04,023 --> 00:35:05,790
<i>And then the strangest</i>
<i>thing happened.</i>

616
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:09,359
He disappeared.

617
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,827
I don't understand.

618
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:12,795
No one did.

619
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:16,199
And no one could explain
exactly what happened.

620
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:26,641
(thunder crashing,
loud rattling)

621
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,889
<i>No note, no tracks, no clues.</i>

622
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:43,157
<i>And no funeral.</i>

623
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,961
<i>Kit's children insisted</i>
<i>there was no reason to mourn.</i>

624
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:50,197
Ms. Winters, I can't
tell you what an honor

625
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:51,264
this has been for me.

626
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:52,632
Oh, try not to, darling.

627
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,032
I just hope you got
what you need.

628
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,367
Are you kidding?
I thought we'd just

629
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,868
be doing your greatest hits,

630
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,769
but all the personal stuff...

631
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,837
fantastic, unexpected
and very moving.

632
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:04,339
See you at the Kennedy Center.
Mm-hmm.

633
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:20,219
(siren blares in the distance)

634
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:38,302
Can I pour you a drink?

635
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,972
Why don't you come out now?

636
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,836
You don't need to hide.

637
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:48,606
Not anymore.

638
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,263
Let's get this
over with, shall we?

639
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:17,259
JOHNNY: So I guess you've had
a pretty great life, huh?

640
00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:19,829
It's been eventful.

641
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:21,564
It's about to end.

642
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:25,301
You get that, right?

643
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,870
I knew it the moment I saw you.

644
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:31,641
Mind if I ask you something?

645
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:32,775
No.

646
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:35,211
I don't mind.

647
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:39,382
How did you manage
to get yourself on the crew?

648
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:41,317
(chuckles)

649
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,052
That shit was easy.

650
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,654
I've been waiting
outside the building,

651
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,657
got friendly with the doorman,
he told me about the interview.

652
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,493
When the first guy showed up

653
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,362
at dawn... the guy
with the doughnuts...

654
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:56,531
I cut his throat.

655
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,034
He's in the trash bin.

656
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:03,772
(snickers)

657
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,907
This isn't how I pictured it.
Really?

658
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:09,644
Because this is exactly
how I pictured it.

659
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,149
I always knew
this day would come.

660
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,246
I didn't think
you'd recognize me.

661
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,625
How did you?

662
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:24,961
Oh, Johnny.

663
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:28,064
How could I not recognize
my own baby boy?

664
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:30,500
<i>I've never seen him before</i>

665
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:32,235
in my life.

666
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:34,771
His name's Johnny Morgan.

667
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,973
48 years old, unmarried.

668
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,842
In and out of jail
since his teens.

669
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:40,477
Nothing major till now.

670
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:42,245
We think he's responsible
for the deaths

671
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:43,879
of at least five people.

672
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,782
Including the elderly
couple who lived

673
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:48,818
in the house formerly owned
by Oliver Thredson.

674
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:50,520
The place you were
held at and tortured

675
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,755
in '64, Ms. Winters.

676
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:54,524
Are you sure
you don't recognize him?

677
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:55,959
No.

678
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:09,340
You look like him, you know?

679
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:10,908
Your father.

680
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,209
It's easy for me to forget

681
00:39:12,277 --> 00:39:14,078
just how handsome he was.

682
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,848
Until you shot him in the head.

683
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,717
Yes, I shot him in the head.

684
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:22,253
How did you find out?

685
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,255
That you murdered my father?

686
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,523
About who you were.

687
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,860
Who told you?

688
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:31,896
You did.

689
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,165
That day

690
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,400
on the playground.

691
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:39,270
I felt something.

692
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:42,173
And I saw you on the TV.

693
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:45,376
"That's my mother,"
I'd tell people.

694
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:48,146
And they'd just laugh
at me, but I knew.

695
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:54,720
And I dreamed one day
that you'd come back.

696
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,722
Then I heard the tape,

697
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:00,393
and, uh...
I knew you never would.

698
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:03,797
What tape?

699
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:06,733
I found it on eBay.

700
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:09,270
LANA: <i>This monster you
planted inside me,</i>

701
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:11,538
<i>I'm getting rid of it,</i>
<i>and since I'm stuck here,</i>

702
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,774
<i>I'm gonna have to get creative</i>
<i>with this coat hanger.</i>

703
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:16,310
THREDSON:
<i>Lana, no. Lana, no, please!</i>

704
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,211
LANA:
<i>No baby should have to grow up</i>

705
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:19,646
<i>knowing Daddy is Bloody Face.</i>

706
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:22,849
My father loved me.

707
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:25,919
I could hear it in his voice.

708
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:27,420
That's when
I started loving him.

709
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:28,722
And hating you.

710
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:33,193
He never loved you, Johnny.

711
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:34,194
And you did?

712
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:36,363
No, I didn't love you.

713
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,565
I couldn't.

714
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:40,734
That's why I gave you up...

715
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:43,236
so you'd have
some shot at a life.

716
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:44,638
You'd have a chance
at a life, you mean!

717
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:45,706
Right?

718
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,040
This fancy life!

719
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:48,709
Without me!

720
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:07,763
So what's it
going to be, Johnny?

721
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,531
I don't imagine, at my age,

722
00:41:09,598 --> 00:41:11,266
you'd be much interested
in the skin.

723
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,302
(sighs)

724
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:18,973
I've thought about this.

725
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,477
I've thought about this a lot.

726
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:29,217
My own gun...
I wasn't expecting that.

727
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:32,486
Your father once told me
he didn't believe in guns.

728
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:35,857
Of course, he was
lying about that, too.

729
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:38,769
You don't get to talk about him.

730
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:40,028
What are you
so afraid of, Johnny?

731
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,930
The truth about him

732
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,832
or the truth about you?

733
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,004
I just want him
to be proud of me.

734
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,776
I...

735
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,547
I can't measure up.

736
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,548
No...

737
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,782
Johnny.

738
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,485
He was a monster.

739
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,886
No. Yes, he was.

740
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,954
No, he wasn't.

741
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,955
Yes he was, baby.

742
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,292
But that's not you.

743
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,295
You could never be like him.

744
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:19,735
Not that...

745
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,904
sweet little boy

746
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,239
I met on the playground.

747
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:30,778
Even then, I knew

748
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:32,846
you were a better man
than he was.

749
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,858
(quietly): Don't.

750
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,935
It's not just him
that's in you.

751
00:42:56,706 --> 00:42:58,774
I'm a part of you, too.

752
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,281
(low sobbing)

753
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:10,352
I've hurt people.

754
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,226
It's not your fault, baby.

755
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,299
It's mine.

756
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,033
(body thuds)

757
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:32,404
(siren blares in the distance)

758
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,911
LANA: <i>She's talking about
the maniac, Bloody Face.</i>

759
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:42,145
That he's going to be
admitted here today.

760
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:43,213
Is there any way
I could meet him?

761
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:45,182
You're out of your depth,

762
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:47,050
Miss Lana Banana.

763
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:49,251
You want a story?
Write this down.

764
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,722
A girl like you,
you like to dream large.

765
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,358
I'd venture you
already have Briarcliff

766
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,360
in your rearview mirror.

767
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,628
You make ambition
sound like a sin.

768
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:03,731
No, I'm saying it's dangerous.

769
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:05,500
What about you?

770
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:08,002
Saving the souls of
madmen and killers

771
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:10,204
is a pretty lofty ambition,
wouldn't you say?

772
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:13,074
And you cannot imagine
what it took to get here.

773
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:15,076
I'd love to hear
your story someday.

774
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:16,911
(laughs) No.

775
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:20,147
I don't think you and I are
destined to meet again.

776
00:44:20,215 --> 00:44:23,017
But I do hope you know
what you're in for.

777
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:25,153
The loneliness,

778
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:27,055
the heartbreak,

779
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,757
the sacrifice you'll face
as a woman

780
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:30,425
with a dream on her own.

781
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:34,729
You don't have any idea
what I'm capable of.

782
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:38,066
Well, then. (Laughs)

783
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,635
Look at you, Miss Lana Banana.

784
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:43,615
Just remember...

785
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,576
if you look in
the face of evil.

786
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,978
Evil's going to look
right back at you.

787
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:56,282
(clicks tongue)

788
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,619
Please, after you.

789
00:45:15,668 --> 00:45:18,403
(woman singing peppy
folk song in French)
