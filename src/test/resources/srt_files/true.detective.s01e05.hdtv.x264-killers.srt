00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:28,950
See, everything
outside our dimension...

493
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:32,685
that's eternity,

494
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:36,358
eternity looking down on us.

495
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,859
Now, to us,

496
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:43,162
it's a sphere,

497
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,729
but to them...

498
00:33:47,498 --> 00:33:49,131
it's a circle.

499
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:58,183
Mr. Cohle?

500
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:09,385
Mr. Cohle, what
happened in 2002?

501
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,523
COHLE: Guy Leonard Francis.

502
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:20,017
They say you killed two people
in Livingston.

503
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:25,798
They say you're
a drug store robber.

504
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:30,004
You know they already
got a nickname for you?

505
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:35,308
Southern Fried Pharmacy
Firearm Thief.

506
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,306
You like that?

507
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:39,410
Got a nice ring to it,
a bit of a mouthful.

508
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:41,642
Fuck, telling you, man,

509
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:43,043
the shit they got
these days--

510
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:46,017
technology,
fingerprints, DNA--

511
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,314
you got to be a fucking genius

512
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:48,785
to get past that shit.

513
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:49,785
Let's face it, Francis.

514
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:52,154
You ain't no fucking
genius, are you?

515
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:53,825
First, you come in and say,

516
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,722
"I got the drugs
from somewhere else."

517
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,164
Then you say, "No.
I don't remember.

518
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:01,500
I don't remember
where I got the drugs."

519
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,205
You're making it
too complicated.

520
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:04,437
You're creating
a maze for yourself

521
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,741
that you ain't never
gonna get out of.

522
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:07,804
They got you.

523
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:10,678
You just got
to change your play.

524
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:13,585
You got to plead impairment.

525
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:15,922
You know what that means?

526
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:18,122
That means that you
cannot be held

527
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:21,797
accountable for your actions.

528
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,798
Well, I don't think
I ought to be blamed--

529
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,403
well, entirely blamed--
for things I did

530
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:31,406
when I was under the
influence of anything.

531
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:34,604
I don't think
you should, either.

532
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:35,940
That's what I'm saying.

533
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,750
PCP. Stuff makes
a man crazy.

534
00:35:39,783 --> 00:35:42,452
One time, famous case,

535
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:45,986
guy, he cut off his own
face on that shit.

536
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,251
- For real?
- Hell yeah.

537
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:48,524
You mix that with meth,

538
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:49,653
that's an insanity defense

539
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:50,955
if I ever heard one.

540
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:52,994
How you gonna say a man
who's not on anything

541
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,564
is insane because he
did something crazy

542
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:56,796
but a man who's on something

543
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,962
that made him crazy is sane?

544
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:00,464
You know what I mean?

545
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:02,329
- Works both ways.
- Yeah, exactly.

546
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,304
I mean, I'm not even saying
that I remember anything.

547
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,800
I was shit hammered.

548
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,767
There we go.

549
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,302
That's your play right there.

550
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,537
Fuck this amnesia story.

551
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:16,578
That dirt don't stick,
but an insanity defense,

552
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,681
that's your ticket.

553
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:22,018
That's your way out, all right,

554
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:23,857
because you're sobered up now.

555
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,088
You got your mind right.

556
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:28,395
You back.

557
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:30,562
You got to show them
the difference

558
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:33,360
between that madman
in that pharmacy

559
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,263
who blew them two people away

560
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:39,198
and the man who's
sitting here right now.

561
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,436
You got to show shock,

562
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,939
terror, and
re-fucking-morse.

563
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:47,306
I am. I do. I'm--

564
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,369
- I'm scared, sir.
- Oh, yeah.

565
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,744
You should be, right?

566
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,443
Yeah. What'd you say
to the pharmacist?

567
00:36:56,612 --> 00:37:00,582
I said,
"Give me everything."

568
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:04,349
And then what?
Boom. Boom.

569
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:08,419
Blew that fucker
away, didn't you?

570
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:11,660
You want forgiveness for that?

571
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:15,262
- Yeah.
- Say it.

572
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:18,430
- I want it.
- You want what?

573
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,502
Forgiveness.

574
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:27,807
You see what you just did?

575
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:32,079
You just copped
to a double murder.

576
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,355
They got you now.

577
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,660
But--

578
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:46,241
I want to make a deal.

579
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:49,406
A deal about what?

580
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,575
I know things.

581
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:54,546
Oh, what you know
now all of a sudden?

582
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:58,883
I know--

583
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,989
I know who you are, and I know

584
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:04,157
about that woman y'all
found out in the woods

585
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,701
way back, the antlers.

586
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:09,868
Hmm.

587
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:13,237
That don't mean shit.

588
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,269
That was in the newspaper.

589
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:17,341
What you know?

590
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:19,373
You don't know shit, do you?

591
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:23,876
No. Y'all never caught
the man that did that.

592
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:27,516
He's been out there killing.

593
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,055
You're talking
out your ass, boy.

594
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:32,326
You don't know a fucking thing.

595
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,653
You're just trying
to buy some time,

596
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:35,429
ain't you?

597
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:38,727
I met him once.

598
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:41,770
There's big people
who know about him,

599
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,474
big people.

600
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,738
Ah, ain't no deal

601
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,044
because there ain't no people.

602
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:47,181
You make me a deal.

603
00:38:47,214 --> 00:38:48,918
You deal with me
with these murders.

604
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,814
Ain't no deal.

605
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:50,814
You ain't got nothing

606
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:51,854
because you're full of shit,

607
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:52,886
and there ain't nobody alive

608
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,886
that did none of that killing.

609
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:57,483
He's dead, boy.

610
00:38:57,524 --> 00:39:02,398
I'll tell you about
the Yellow King.

611
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,669
What the fuck you say, boy?

612
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:13,236
Give me a name.

613
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:15,573
Give me a fucking name.

614
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:18,048
You want to fucking play, boy?

615
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:20,482
The Yellow King!

616
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:21,786
Oh! Aah!

617
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,157
Get the hell off me!
Get off me!

618
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,029
Get off of me!

619
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:29,628
Deal with me,
you son of a bitch.

620
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:33,634
You deal with me!
I want a deal!

621
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:35,233
Easy. Come on, man.

622
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:36,833
Calm down, dude.

623
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:39,204
Now take a deep
breath, all right?

624
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:40,236
You got the confession.

625
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,405
then you made it inadmissible.

626
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,605
What do you fucking mean?
He's still talking.

627
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:43,477
Shucking and jiving.

628
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,509
He knows exactly who you are.

629
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:45,909
You called me in here, huh?
You did.

630
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,380
I know, and if we need
anything else,

631
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,347
we'll let you know.

632
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,612
We appreciate the
assist, Detective.

633
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,350
What the fuck is going on here?

634
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:52,389
We have to salvage
a double murder

635
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:54,787
confession, is what's going on.

636
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,859
If he wasn't just
running you in there,

637
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:58,662
you'll get anything we get.

638
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,527
You have my word.

639
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,063
Come on. Ease up, baby.
Calm down.

640
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:03,031
And I'll be back...

641
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:04,263
Oh, I got it.

642
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:06,302
...tomorrow.

643
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,438
Stay the fuck back.
I got it.

644
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,074
♪

645
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:37,038
COHLE: In eternity,
where there is no time,

646
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:39,404
nothing can grow.

647
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:42,141
Nothing can become.

648
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,784
Nothing changes.

649
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:50,153
So death created time

650
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:53,126
to grow the things
that it would kill...

651
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:58,633
and you are reborn

652
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,801
but into the same life

653
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,073
that you've always
been born into.

654
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:06,370
I mean, how many times have we

655
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:09,244
had this conversation,

00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,180
Left a burnout, junkie rumors.

820
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:01,580
Do you think 10
years on the sauce

821
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,044
has made him more reasonable?

822
00:54:04,085 --> 00:54:06,348
GILBOUGH: Think about this.
You said it.

823
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:08,220
He'd been there 3 months,

824
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:09,453
and you two catch a heater

825
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:11,087
like you've never
had before or since,

826
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,727
one that he shines on.

827
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,892
You're saying he did
such a great job.

828
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:19,256
Didn't he get you
every bit of evidence?

829
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,760
Didn't he push you
where he wanted it to go?

830
00:54:21,793 --> 00:54:23,897
PAPANIA: He brought
you Rianne Olivier.

831
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,035
She wasn't one of Ledoux's.

832
00:54:26,068 --> 00:54:28,540
She was one of his.

833
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:30,770
What'd he say,
"Life is a disease"?

834
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:32,409
When he heard the Abbeville
prisoner Francis

835
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:34,746
knew something, he got on it.

836
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:35,874
He shut it down.

837
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:36,912
You ever thought if he made

838
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:38,040
that phone call
to the prisoner,

839
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,407
like-- I don't know--

840
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:40,711
the guy was trying
to blackmail him?

841
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,113
He got on that, too, didn't he,

842
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:45,121
the idea that the Lange
killer was still out there?

843
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,954
Yeah.

844
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,227
Yeah. He did.

845
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,596
Looking for a new patsy, maybe.

846
00:55:38,113 --> 00:55:40,710
HART: Y'all given me
a lot to absorb.

847
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:43,116
PAPANIA: Goddamn right
it's a lot to absorb.

848
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:45,181
- So help us out.
- Yeah.

849
00:55:45,214 --> 00:55:46,820
Whatever you can tell us

850
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:48,483
about, you know,
from when he got

851
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:50,988
on the Lange killer
you up to when

852
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:52,859
you two had your altercation.

853
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,658
Whatever that was about.
