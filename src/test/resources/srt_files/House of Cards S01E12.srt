1
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:31,136
Hey. Excuse me. I'm Paul Capra.
I'm here to see Christina.

2
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:34,098
Oh, right this way, Mr.
Capra. She's expecting you.

3
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,523
- Paul.
- Hey, Christina.

4
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:45,443
Hi. It's good to see you.

5
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,069
- Yeah, you too.
- Can I get you anything?

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,737
Nah. I grabbed some
breakfast on the way down.

7
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,989
- Okay. Have a seat.
- All right. Thank you.

8
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,247
I asked you down here because
I spoke to D-Trip and the D.N.C.

9
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:02,249
We'd like you to run for Peter's seat.

10
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,876
As you probably know,

11
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:06,920
the election's been set for
the first week of February.

12
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,589
You want me to run?

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,090
With your stature in the community,

14
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:11,842
your grass roots organizing experience...

15
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,302
Christina, hold on.

16
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:14,761
I know it's a lot to consider.

17
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,096
It's only been a month.

18
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:18,265
Well, we still have to govern, Paul.

19
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,684
I thought you asked me down here

20
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:22,061
because you wanted to talk or something.

21
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,021
I do. About the election.

22
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:27,400
I mean about Peter.

23
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:31,237
How come you didn't go to the funeral?

24
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,989
I couldn't.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,908
How you been holding up?

26
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,203
I'm all right. It's been hard
keeping the office on track.

27
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:41,205
Jesus. Screw the office.

28
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,665
What about you?

29
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,543
You're allowed to grieve, Christina.

30
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:47,587
Paul...

31
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:50,548
there are 600,000 people counting on us.

32
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,051
I can't let my feelings
get in the way of that.

33
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:56,970
Will you hear me out about
running for Peter's seat?

34
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:03,229
Well, you've passed the vetting
process with flying colors.

35
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,772
- Is there anything we might have missed?
- No, sir.

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,318
Tell me about your experience

37
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,904
as the chair of the
oversight reform committee.

38
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:16,116
It's been very rewarding.

39
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,830
What are the biggest
challenges you've had to face?

40
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,166
Partisanship.

41
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:34,968
Well, I suppose a room
filled with 435 big egos

42
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:38,055
isn't the most hospitable
place for oversight.

43
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,400
Do you want to be Vice President, Tabitha?

44
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:52,528
It would be a great honor, sir.

45
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,661
We'll be in touch.

46
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,956
- That's all?
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,792
- For the time being.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

48
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,381
We have to cross her off.

49
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,425
I agree. She could put
a crack addict to sleep.

50
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,676
Then what is she doing on the goddamn list?

51
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:18,596
Tabitha's a very gifted legislator.

52
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,639
I don't want people
who make sense on paper.

53
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,601
I need at least one viable option.

54
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:27,313
The two of you created this list and have
proceeded to cross off every name you've put on it.

55
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:29,856
It's just a first pass, sir.
We need time to fully vet all...

56
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:31,942
Jim is gonna win this thing in
Pennsylvania, and we're no closer

57
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:34,236
to naming his replacement
than we were a month ago.

58
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:37,781
Let us take another crack at it and
give you a few more names to consider.

59
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:41,160
- I just want one name.
- We'll have something for you by tomorrow morning.

60
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,287
Thank you, Mr. President.

61
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,876
He's ready to say yes to anything.

62
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,546
Yeah, for this to work, I don't think you
can be there. Not when I first mention it.

63
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:53,964
I agree. You bring it
up in your morning brief,

64
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,715
and when I show up, I'll act surprised.

65
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:57,468
Assuming he's open to the idea.

66
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,386
Look, all we have to do tomorrow
is plant the notion in his head.

67
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,972
I'm sure you'll be persuasive.

68
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,974
Hello?

69
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,268
- Mr. Capra?
- Yeah. Who's this?

70
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,312
Janine Skorsky from Slugline.

71
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,605
We spoke when I wrote the piece

72
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,315
about Congressman Russo's passing.

73
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm done giving interviews
about Peter, okay?

74
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:16,736
He was a troubled guy. End of story.

75
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:18,489
This is not about his death.

76
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,535
I'm calling you because my
sources at the D Triple C

77
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:25,329
are telling me that you
might be running for his seat.

78
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,788
I'm not talking about that.

79
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,415
But you did have a meeting this morning

80
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,459
with Christina Gallagher, correct?

81
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,794
I'm driving right now. I really
shouldn't be on the phone.

82
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,507
If you do run, I would like
to know about your involvement

83
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:39,468
in the closing of the
Philadelphia shipyard.

84
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:42,137
That decision was made in Washington.

85
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:45,015
The association wasn't consulted.

86
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:47,809
Forgive me. I find that hard to believe.

87
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,397
I read all of the transcripts
from the brac commission.

88
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,899
Congressman Russo didn't
give any testimony.

89
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,985
So are you saying that he didn't
consult with you once before you...

90
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:59,613
somebody was strong-arming
him, okay? It was politics.

91
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,907
Do you know who would've pressured him?

92
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:04,243
Look, I don't know. He just
said people up the food chain.

93
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,453
Did he say anything more specific about...

94
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,706
you know what? There's traffic. I gotta go.

95
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:12,084
Mr. Capra, I would... 

96
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,346
Should I be prepared to do press?

97
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:27,349
If he's amenable.

98
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,851
What do you think our chances are?

99
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:35,023
Better than 50-50, if I had to say.

100
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:38,360
We won't announce until
after Matthews wins, though.

101
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,739
I hate to admit it, but I'm nervous.

102
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,282
So am I.

103
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:45,409
It's just the last time,
we found ourselves...

104
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,953
that's my fear too.

105
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:50,872
All right. You call me, either way.

106
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:57,254
In no more than nine hours.

107
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:12,185
Linda's been in there far too long.

108
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:15,188
If the President takes this much
convincing, it doesn't bode well.

109
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:19,151
I can feel it... his hesitation
on the other side of that door.

110
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:22,446
I know it's pointless to worry
until I know what cards I'm holding.

111
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,365
Perhaps he just got interrupted by some...

112
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:28,285
He wants to tap Raymond Tusk.

113
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,913
- What?
- He thinks it's a bold idea.

114
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:34,583
It's an idiotic idea. The
man's never held public office.

115
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,252
That's one of the things the
President said he likes about him.

116
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:41,173
The President wants to nominate a
multibillionaire in a struggling economy?

117
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,717
- He'll alienate half the country.
- Which is exactly what I said,

118
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:47,220
but he made it very clear he does
not want me to fight him on this.

119
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,431
- So you didn't mention me at all?
- I never had the chance.

120
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,809
His mind was made up
before I could say a word.

121
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,268
Well, we have to unmake it.

122
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,354
Well, you can try, but if you do,

123
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:58,190
my guess is he's gonna cut you
out of the process altogether.

124
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:00,025
He seemed adamant.

125
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:02,110
We should go in there.

126
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:11,537
- Mr. President.
- Morning, Frank.

127
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:14,039
Will you give us a few minutes, Linda?

128
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,124
Of course.

129
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,130
Linda fill you in?

130
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:29,555
I think Raymond Tusk

131
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:34,017
is an exciting, bold idea.

132
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:37,187
Well, I'm glad you agree.
Linda didn't think so.

133
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:39,815
He's a proven businessman.
Brilliant, but down-to-earth.

134
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,149
Do you know him personally?

135
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,485
I met him briefly once at a fund-raiser.

136
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:46,071
Last night when I called him was the first
time we had a meaningful conversation.

137
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:48,281
Did he seem open to the idea?

138
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,783
I sensed a good deal of reluctance.

139
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:51,451
He wanted a few days to consider.

140
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:53,746
Well, good. That gives us
time to start vetting him.

141
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:55,873
He's clean. I had him vetted last year

142
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:59,084
when I was considering him
for secretary of the treasury.

143
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,086
And did he say why he's reluctant?

144
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,130
No. Didn't give a reason.
Just wanted to mull it over.

145
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:10,220
I want to send someone to St.
Louis to speak to him in person,

146
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,472
convince him to accept the nomination.

147
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:14,307
And who are you thinking about?

148
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:17,018
I'd send Linda, but there's so
much work for her to do here,

149
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,855
and, well, she can be abrasive at times.

150
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:22,399
Yeah, she can be a bit tough.

151
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,985
I want someone with gravitas.

152
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:29,615
Birch is a possibility, but he's
not always been our strongest ally.

153
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:33,702
I'm not sure I would trust
Bob with something like this.

154
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:36,329
I would be happy to go myself, sir.

155
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,877
I can use a light touch and
give him the respect he deserves.

156
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:45,422
Good. I'll let his
people know you're coming.

157
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:47,800
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Frank.

158
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,513
Tell me, Francis.

159
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,808
It's good we were prepared for anything.

160
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:58,351
I have to fly to St. Louis tonight.

161
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,395
"Somebody was strong-arming him,"

162
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:02,314
and when I asked him who, he said, quote,

163
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:04,566
- "people up the food chain."
- It's Washington.

164
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,152
Congressmen get strong-armed all the time.

165
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,863
My gut says it was Frank Underwood.

166
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,365
He had nothing to do with Russo
before the shipyard closing,

167
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:14,075
and then suddenly he's propping him up?

168
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:15,577
That doesn't mean he was...

169
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:17,871
Let's cut the bullshit
once and for all, Zoe.

170
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:19,997
I know he's been feeding you your stories.

171
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:23,627
I don't want to screw you over, but
I'm not gonna stop digging on this.

172
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,504
I won't say he was a source.

173
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:27,255
But you do know each other.

174
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,177
Show me your notes, and I'll talk to him.

175
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:35,138
These are the notes from the Capra call.

176
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,474
And these are the transcripts
from the brac hearing.

177
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:41,561
When they got to the Philadelphia
shipyard, Russo doesn't say anything.

178
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,273
That's fine.

179
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:48,610
Yeah, I would just put
both of them in that file.

180
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:51,488
Claire, I just got a call
from the P.R. office at Sancorp

181
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,699
saying they wanted to send
a film crew to take footage

182
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,492
of our filtration project in Botswana.

183
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:59,621
Right. They're just using
that for promotional material.

184
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:03,000
Sancorp fought us on the watershed bill.

185
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,794
They helped us get the
filters out of South Sudan.

186
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,420
I thought that was the state department.

187
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,047
No. You remember Remy Danton?

188
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:11,424
You met him in your office

189
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:13,552
right after you started working here.

190
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:15,888
- The lobbyist.
- I asked him for his help.

191
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:19,016
We're just returning the favor, that's all.

192
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:25,355
Claire, they're against
everything we stand for.

193
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:27,774
It's harmless. They'll send the video

194
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,443
to a few of their investors
and make some commercials.

195
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,487
This makes me very
uncomfortable... the idea...

196
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:34,781
they are sending the film crew, Gillian,

197
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:37,367
so please work with them on that.

198
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,797
One of my colleagues is
looking into Peter Russo.

199
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:55,052
The assumption is you strong-armed
him into closing the shipyard.

200
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,554
Where does your colleague
get their information?

201
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:59,389
I don't know.

202
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,809
Allocating the D.O.D. budget
is always a free-for-all.

203
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,394
Did you pressure him?

204
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,021
There were certain people
that were gonna benefit

205
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:07,689
from the base closing
sooner rather than later.

206
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,399
I didn't strong-arm Peter.

207
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,694
I advised him to trade in a
losing hand for a winning one.

208
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,320
How did he stand to win?

209
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:16,573
He made allies out of enemies.

210
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,408
That's a very valuable thing in Congress.

211
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:20,159
I wish I could give you something juicier,

212
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,371
but the shipyard closing
was just politics as usual.

213
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:27,084
I assume your colleague is Ms. Skorsky.

214
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,378
Does she know we're talking?

215
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,965
No. Of course not.

216
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:35,050
Be in touch.

217
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:41,556
More than you ever wanted to
know about Raymond Alan Tusk...

218
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:45,102
the companies he controls,
political contributions.

219
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:47,687
A GQ article entitled
"Backwoods billionaire"

220
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:49,689
is about his humble midwestern lifestyle.

221
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,817
- Jesus.
- There's also a copy

222
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:54,903
of the financial disclosure requirements
and details of the blind trust.

223
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,990
I think the trust is
where you want to focus.

224
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,950
Could Linda be behind all this?

225
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:01,493
To what end?

226
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,495
To get you out of town for a few days

227
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,664
while they continue the search
without your interference.

228
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:08,041
The President has no reason to mistrust me.

229
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,502
Unless Linda told him you
want the vice presidency.

230
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,879
No. She's in way too deep.

231
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,298
We misjudged her on the
secretary of state nomination.

232
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,300
That was different. She blindsided me.

233
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,427
Now she knows my eyes are wide open.

234
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,429
Do you want the gaffney
bag or regular business?

235
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,057
Regular business. Tusk can
dress down if he wants to,

236
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:25,517
but I'm representing the White House.

237
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:27,602
Oh, and get Walter Doyle onto Tusk.

238
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:29,855
- Let's see if we can dig up anything.
- I'll call him right now.

239
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:32,190
And keep your eye on Janine
Skorsky while I'm away.

240
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,151
She's been prying into Russo.

241
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,528
- What does she know?
- She knows the right questions to ask.

242
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,822
I want to make sure she
doesn't get the right answers.

243
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:39,948
I'm on it.

244
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,909
McCuddin.

245
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,497
McCuddin.

246
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,248
What was that?

247
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,584
Mccuddin Air Force Base.

248
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:53,419
Brac hearing.

249
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,630
Was there on April 12th.

250
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:59,217
David Rasmussen stepped
down less than a week later.

251
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:00,802
Womack takes his place. So maybe...

252
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,221
Wait. Slow down.

253
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:05,223
McCuddin is in his district.

254
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:07,184
Is that the shipyard thing?

255
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,146
Janine, call me back.

256
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:13,481
I think it was Womack who pressured Russo.

257
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:18,195
Russo was probably just earning
a favor he could cash in later.

258
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:19,821
I'm around.

259
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:24,201
Did you ever have to
fight her to kill a story?

260
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:26,203
- Janine?
- Yeah. When she worked for you.

261
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,580
Only when I knew she was wrong.

262
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,708
She's trying to draw up
this whole conspiracy thing

263
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,336
with Russo and Frank Underwood
and the whole shipyard closing.

264
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:36,880
But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.

265
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,882
Pretty sure isn't the same as certain.

266
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,800
- No. I am certain.
- How do you know?

267
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,928
- I have sources.
- Underwood?

268
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,304
No.

269
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:48,516
No. Never mind. I'll figure it out.

270
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:39,025
- Mrs. Tusk?
- Jean, please.

271
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,027
You must be Frank. Come in.

272
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:43,071
So nice to meet you.

273
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,657
The guest room is this way.

274
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:48,701
It is very kind of you to
have invited me to stay here.

275
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:52,080
Why waste the taxpayers' money on a hotel

276
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,124
when we have a perfectly good bed?

277
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,709
Well, both they and I are very grateful.

278
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,587
I'm sorry Raymond isn't awake to greet you.

279
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:02,381
- He goes to bed at...
- I know he's an early riser.

280
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,634
I understand.

281
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:07,137
Would you like a wake-up knock?

282
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,681
No. I have an alarm on my phone.

283
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:11,308
Sleep tight.

284
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,392
Thank you so much.

285
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:58,355
I would say good morning, but
it's the middle of the night.

286
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:05,028
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- And you too.

287
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:08,740
Was I making too much noise?

288
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:11,201
No. I smelled bacon.

289
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,496
Here.

290
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,584
Coffee? Booze?

291
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:21,669
At 2:00 A.M., you can go either way.

292
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,755
Just water for now.

293
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:40,397
It's filtered. Your wife would approve.

294
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:43,441
You ever been to St. Louis before?

295
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:45,777
Just the airport.

296
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:47,153
What do you think so far?

297
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:49,197
Well, I've only seen your neighborhood

298
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,283
and whatever I could see out
the window on the interstate.

299
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,451
Good enough. It's all pretty much the same.

300
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,203
Excuse me.

301
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,343
Listen, um, I still haven't showered.

302
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,845
My mind is on China here.

303
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:16,141
Uh, what do you say you get a few more zs

304
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:19,602
and we try this again in a
few hours with our clothes on?

305
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:21,187
Sounds like a plan.

306
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,939
Meet me at my office at 9:30.

307
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,067
I'll have a driver pick you up.

308
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:28,778
Can I ask why you do that?

309
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,197
- Do what?
- Tap your ring like that.

310
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:33,491
I've seen you do it on
TV. Two taps every time

311
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:36,161
you get up from a table or leave a lectern.

312
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:38,079
Something my father taught me.

313
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,747
It's meant to harden your knuckles

314
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,958
so you don't break them
if you get into a fight.

315
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,377
It also has the added
benefit of knocking on wood.

316
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:47,046
My father believed that success

317
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:50,049
is a mixture of preparation and luck.

318
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,052
Tapping the table kills
both birds with one stone.

319
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:56,473
Your father was a peach farmer?

320
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:01,519
Yes, he was. Not a very successful one.

321
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,981
- Lack of preparation or lack of luck?
- Lack of both.

322
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,775
He was better at giving
advice than following it.

323
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,277
Hmm.

324
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:40,080
Miss? Miss, your card.

325
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,748
Thank you.

326
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:59,058
Ms. Gallagher, my name's Janine
Skorsky. I'm a reporter at Slugline.

327
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,935
- I wrote the profile on Congressman...
- I remember.

328
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:04,855
- Do you have a minute?
- If this is about Peter, I...

329
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:07,524
No. It's about Paul Capra.

330
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:11,111
We know that he might be running
for Congressman Russo's old seat.

331
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,821
I can't comment on that.

332
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:14,573
We're just trying to do some background

333
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,158
on the shipyard closing last April.

334
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,327
Listen, I just want to eat my breakfast.

335
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:22,206
We have sources that are
saying that the Congressman

336
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:26,835
was being pressured by someone
to not fight the closure.

337
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,671
- Who?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

338
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:33,800
This is completely off
the record, I promise you.

339
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:36,720
- Hi, Christina.
- Doug, hi.

340
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:38,764
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay.

341
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,307
I'm... I'm good.

342
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:42,726
I saw you sitting over
here. You mind if I...

343
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:43,977
No. Please.

344
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:45,979
Ms. Skorsky, right?

345
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,941
I believe we spoke a few times
when you used to work at the herald.

346
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,109
Whenever I could get past

347
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,651
the press office gauntlet to you.

348
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:54,196
- We do like to run a tight ship.
- Mm.

349
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:56,156
So what brings you to the capitol?

350
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:58,409
I was just asking Ms.
Gallagher who's running

351
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,535
to fill the vacant seat
in Pennsylvania's 1st.

352
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,747
Well, the honest answer is we don't know.

353
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,797
Thank you for your time, Ms. Gallagher.

354
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,477
Anyone starts harassing you

355
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:24,104
with questions you don't want to answer,

356
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,438
you let me know.

357
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,316
I'll handle them.

358
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:30,110
You got enough on your plate right now.

359
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:33,655
Thanks, Doug. I appreciate that.

360
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:35,741
Hang in there, okay?

361
00:22:58,264 --> 00:22:59,556
Yes.

362
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,435
Ah.

363
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:07,314
Uganda, Peru,

364
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:11,318
Nepal, Indonesia...

365
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,861
Nicaragua.

366
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:16,156
Well, you are quite the well traveled man.

367
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:18,575
No. I'm the man who stays at home.

368
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,702
Jean brought those back for me.

369
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:22,955
- Mr. Tusk, I am...
- First names.

370
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,624
After all, we have broken bacon together.

371
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,252
We can safely assume that we're familiar.

372
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:31,004
Raymond, I realize that
you are a very busy man,

373
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,924
so I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

374
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:36,260
The President sincerely would like you

375
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,304
to become the next Vice President.

376
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:39,805
That part I already knew.

377
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,433
And I'm here to convince you to say yes.

378
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:44,517
Another thing I already knew.

379
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:47,354
Well, I don't know that I can tell
you anything you don't already know.

380
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:51,482
But perhaps you can tell
me what your hesitation is.

381
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:56,529
Speak.

382
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:03,162
Yes.

383
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,705
Now, I understand you
might have some concerns

384
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:08,106
about the financial disclosures leading...

385
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:12,754
Speak.

386
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:18,344
No.

387
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,474
I have eight people representing me

388
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,018
at eight simultaneous meetings

389
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,936
in six time zones right now.

390
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:30,439
I sit here and answer their questions,

391
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,358
provided they come in the form

392
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:35,652
of a single yes or no proposition.

393
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:39,031
Well, then, let me give that a try.

394
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:42,826
Would you like to be the Vice President?

395
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:44,328
Yes or no?

396
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,917
Hold on a minute.

397
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:52,752
I am very sorry.

398
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:56,382
Let me have 20 minutes
to wrap up these meetings.

399
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:59,218
And then what do you say
we get out of the office

400
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,387
and away from this damn phone?

401
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:02,721
Meet me at my car.

402
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:05,682
Betty can tell you where it's parked.

403
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,267
Go ahead.

404
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:09,686
He's deflecting.

405
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,688
What I can't tell is whether it's because

406
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:14,983
he's inclined to say no or
wants to be wooed to say yes.

407
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:17,819
Either way, I'll have to ease
him into the conversation,

408
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,696
not be so blunt.

409
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:22,699
This trip may take longer than I thought.

410
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,328
We've looked through all the file cabinets.

411
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,288
They're not on his computer?

412
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:31,582
Not with the Congressman's
handwritten notes.

413
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,794
All right. I'll check his office.

414
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:06,637
Ah.

415
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:11,891
There is a comfort to these woods.

416
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,482
Like they're my backyard.

417
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:24,622
Well, they are my backyard,
in a way. I own them.

418
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,373
How much land?

419
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:28,668
Six thousand acres.

420
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:32,755
You think I could get a tour of
your fulton plant while I'm in town?

421
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:36,091
If you'd like.

422
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:38,302
But I don't know why you'd want to be there

423
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:39,929
when you could be out here.

424
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,181
I've never seen a nuclear plant.

425
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,141
Not much to see.

426
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:47,561
Steel, concrete, a lot of steam.

427
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,564
The President hasn't exactly been

428
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:52,566
a big supporter of nuclear power.

429
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:55,402
Is that, uh, part of your hesitation...

430
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:57,571
that fear that the administration...

431
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,366
He's just being savvy.

432
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:04,453
Nuclear energy is a tough sell after Japan.

433
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,998
But it's the only option we have right now

434
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,459
that doesn't completely trash the planet.

435
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,130
The argument against nuclear
power is an emotional one.

436
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:19,126
And you don't make
decisions based on emotion.

437
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:25,423
Decisions based on emotion
aren't decisions at all.

438
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:28,802
They're instincts,

439
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:31,304
which can be of value.

440
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:34,682
The rational and the irrational
complement each other.

441
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:38,937
Individually, they're far less powerful.

442
00:28:38,938 --> 00:28:40,855
And which category do your thoughts

443
00:28:40,856 --> 00:28:44,192
on the vice presidency fall into?

444
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,363
Do you hear that song?

445
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:52,242
It's a hermit thrush.

446
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,954
Can't see him.

447
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,124
"Solitary, the thrush..."

448
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:08,382
"The hermit, withdrawn to himself,

449
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:11,385
avoiding the settlements,

450
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:14,681
sings by himself a song."

451
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:20,145
- Do you know the poem?
- No, I don't.

452
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,688
It's Walt Whitman.

453
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,815
It's about the death of Abraham Lincoln.

454
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:26,193
He's over there somewhere.

455
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,778
Yes, I know the damn poem.

456
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,780
We studied it at the Sentinel.

457
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:32,949
I said to my Professor,
"why mourn the death

458
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,868
of Presidents, or anyone for that matter?

459
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,286
The dead can't hear us."

460
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:38,330
And he asked me if I believed in heaven.

461
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,706
I said no.

462
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:42,003
And then he asked if I had no faith in God.

463
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:43,838
I said, "you have it wrong.

464
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,591
It's God who has no faith in us."

465
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,970
Deeper into the woods.

466
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,930
I think you're being paranoid.

467
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:55,016
He came up right after I
sat down. It was creepy.

468
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:57,894
- I'm telling you, it was womack.
- Is that what Underwood said?

469
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,354
He didn't name names. But who else?

470
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:03,357
What's the big deal?
Congressmen trade favors.

471
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:05,693
One of these congressmen committed suicide.

472
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:08,155
I think you're stretching here,
Janine. To try and connect...

473
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,948
I have gone after big fish before.

474
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:11,950
I know what it feels like to be watched.

475
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:20,083
Underwood's education
bill went to the floor

476
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,669
just three days after womack
became majority leader.

477
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,880
You leaked the education bill. And
then there was the Kern article.

478
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:28,549
- Those were two completely different stories.
- Wait. What was the guy?

479
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,594
Uh, what was his name?
He's the one who told

480
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:33,638
that Kern wrote the article
for the school paper.

481
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,849
- Roy Kapeniak.
- You should go talk to him.

482
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,893
- There's no link.
- Except you.

483
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:43,564
Underwood's been using you, Zoe.

484
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:45,692
Don't you want to know why?

485
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:50,280
Hi.

486
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,073
Remy Danton's on line two.

487
00:30:52,074 --> 00:30:54,450
He says it's important.

488
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:57,620
- Hello, Remy.
- Hey, Claire.

489
00:30:57,621 --> 00:30:59,998
I got a call from the P.R. team at Sancorp.

490
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:02,500
They said Gillian Cole
isn't being cooperative.

491
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:05,837
Hasn't gotten back to them, you mean?

492
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:09,216
No. Told them point-blank she
doesn't want the film crew there.

493
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:11,592
I'm looking at an e-mail.
She wrote that they would be

494
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,678
disruptive to the project
and local community.

495
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,722
Is that her, or is that coming from you?

496
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:18,850
No. I made it very clear that
I wanted her to work with them.

497
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:22,645
Well, it seems like
she's doing the opposite.

498
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,647
I will speak to her,

499
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:27,317
and then I'll sort things out
with the P.R. team personally.

500
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,944
- Thank you, Claire.
- You bet.

501
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,542
Is Gillian at lunch?

502
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:47,587
She didn't come in yet
today. She's not feeling well.

503
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,089
Let me know when she gets here.

504
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,091
- What time is your flight?
- 6:40.

505
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:53,260
We should get going.
There's gonna be traffic.

506
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:54,969
Almost ready.

507
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:00,392
I've been thinking.

508
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:03,477
The, uh, older man you were with.

509
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:05,939
Was it Underwood?

510
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:16,283
So, what this is really about
is covering your own ass.

511
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:19,535
- That is not true.
- You don't want anybody to know you were sleeping with him.

512
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,579
Not exactly objective reporting, is it?

513
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,998
Don't fucking lecture me
on journalistic ethics.

514
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,293
How many of the stories you brought me
at the herald were because you were...

515
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,961
I'm not gonna have this conversation.

516
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:29,963
Fine. Maybe you should
take a cab to the airport.

517
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,589
Don't punish me for being honest.

518
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,549
You haven't been honest. I had to ask.

519
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,803
- And you still haven't given me a straight answer.
- Yes.

520
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,889
It was him.

521
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,435
I... I don't know if I can do this, Zoe.

522
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:46,062
- Do what?
- You fucked a Congressman to get ahead.

523
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,731
I'm not the first person to ever
do something like that, Lucas.

524
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:50,317
But I'm not sleeping with
those other people, am I?

525
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,692
What, so you just hate me now?

526
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:52,860
No. I probably love you.

527
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:55,905
That's the fucking problem.

528
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:04,247
Let's go. I'm parked illegally.

529
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:09,585
So I hear you went stomping
through the woods today.

530
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:11,545
We did, and then Raymond was kind enough

531
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:14,090
to arrange a tour of the fulton plant.

532
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,925
And I'm sure you were wondering,

533
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:19,179
"when is this old fool gonna
get around to brass tacks?"

534
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,473
I'm here to simply answer questions.

535
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:24,309
I figured that you would make
up your mind when you're ready.

536
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:28,771
There are two minds here.

537
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:31,565
We know all about the blind trust.

538
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:34,652
Does it concern either of you?

539
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:37,197
The words "blind" and "trust"

540
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,699
are not among my favorites
in the English language.

541
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,619
But I have no problem with it in theory.

542
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,289
Not managing our assets for a few years

543
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,042
could unburden us from
a great deal of stress.

544
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:51,378
Well, then, what does
your reluctance stem from?

545
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,213
Why do you think the President wants me?

546
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:55,923
Well, I can't speak on his
behalf, but if I were to...

547
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:59,511
Aren't you here to do just
that... speak on his behalf?

548
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:04,224
If I were to speculate, I think
the President would prob...

549
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,642
Speculation is a poor form of investment

550
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:08,978
and an equally poor form of politics.

551
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:11,272
Tell me what you know.

552
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:14,650
I don't know what you mean.

553
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:17,695
Well, what do you think I should do?

554
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:19,655
You, personally, Frank Underwood?

555
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:21,449
My opinion isn't what matters here.

556
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,785
It does to me. Should I do it? Yes or no?

557
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:29,290
Well, there's a great number
of things to consider...

558
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,252
And I'm sure you've considered them all.

559
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,170
Yes or no, Frank?

560
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:40,134
No, I will not answer that question.

561
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:43,012
- Because you think I shouldn't.
- Because it's not relevant.

562
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:47,100
All right, then. Let
me ask you another way.

563
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:50,228
- Would you take the job?
- It hasn't been offered to me.

564
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:52,480
What if it were?

565
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:55,316
I have a distaste for hypotheticals

566
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:57,693
just the same as you have
a distaste for speculation.

567
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:01,906
All right, all right.

568
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:05,076
That's enough business for now.
We can discuss it more tomorrow.

569
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:02,925
Oh!

570
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:05,595
Get in. Get in there, Bruce.

571
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,639
Sorry. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

572
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,765
Um, I'm looking for Roy Kapeniak.

573
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:12,352
I thought his trailer was over
here. Am I in the right place?

574
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:14,728
You're in the right place a month ago.

575
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,272
He got evicted.

576
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,566
He was shootin' off his
gun too much in the yard.

577
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,652
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Why?

578
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:23,863
I'm a relative. His... his niece.

579
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:25,281
Skipped town is what I heard.

580
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:28,701
Had a girl livin' with
him. Maybe she knows.

581
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:30,328
- Name was Echo.
- Echo?

582
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:33,206
That's what she went by, at least.

583
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:35,583
Works at the titty bar over on 40.

584
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:37,751
- Highway 40?
- Mm.

585
00:36:37,752 --> 00:36:39,337
Across from the Burger King.

586
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:40,630
Okay. Thank you.

587
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:55,019
- Girls get in free.
- Oh.

588
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,812
- I'm looking for Echo.
- Who?

589
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,105
Echo.

590
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,292
Roy was a fucking wacko.

591
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:20,420
I was stupid to live
with him as long as I did.

592
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,755
- Do you know where he is now?
- I don't know, and I don't care.

593
00:37:22,756 --> 00:37:25,007
He ever talk about the article I wrote?

594
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,510
All the time. He had it framed.

595
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,763
Bet it's still in the trailer if
it's not in a junkyard right now.

596
00:37:30,764 --> 00:37:32,724
Did he say why he called me?

597
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:35,435
- Did he ever tell you?
- I was there.

598
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,978
- Where?
- When the guy showed up.

599
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:39,980
Who?

600
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:45,612
I won't name names.

601
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:47,614
Fuck Roy Kapeniak.

602
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,699
You don't owe him shit.

603
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:54,287
Some guy who said he was a Congressman.

604
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,086
Was it...

605
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:03,713
Him?

606
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,465
No.

607
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:07,508
He was younger, tall,

608
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:10,136
not much hair, pretty good-looking.

609
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:17,477
- Yeah, that was him.
- You're absolutely sure?

610
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:19,895
He brought bourbon, blow,
stayed the whole night.

611
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,481
The whole thing was his idea.

612
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:24,150
What, to say that Kern wrote the editorial?

613
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:26,819
That guy didn't write
anything. It was all Roy.

614
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,155
Okay, look, I know I said
that I wouldn't name names,

615
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:31,031
and I won't if that's what you want.

616
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:33,117
But you could be famous overnight.

617
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:35,495
- Talk shows, TV, the whole country...
- No way.

618
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:38,414
You wouldn't have to dance anymore.
You could do whatever you want.

619
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:42,502
Don't use my fucking name, okay? I
already said more than I should have.

620
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,128
- Stamper, it's midnight.
- Two things, boss.

621
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:05,423
First, Janine Skorsky ambushed
Christina this morning.

622
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:08,217
I intercepted her before
she could ask too much.

623
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:11,011
- Should we be worried?
- I can keep this contained, sir.

624
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:13,681
- I just wanted you to know.
- All right. What's the other thing?

625
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:15,808
Doyle came back with his research.

626
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,851
I just e-mailed it to you.

627
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:20,354
The President told you he and
Tusk didn't know each other, right?

628
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:24,233
Yeah. He said they met once,
I think, at a fund-raiser.

629
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,943
That would appear to be a lie.

630
00:39:25,944 --> 00:39:27,612
All right. I have it in front of me now.

631
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:29,863
Doyle catalogued all the
instances he could find

632
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:32,116
in which the two of them were in
the same city at the same time.

633
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:34,827
Items in red are events
that they both attended.

634
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:36,454
And he found something else.

635
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,790
Back in Walker's private sector days,

636
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:41,083
he was the C.E.O. of Pioneer Airlines.

637
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:45,171
Guess who owned a third of the
stock when it was sold to united?

638
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:46,922
Raymond Tusk.

639
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:49,925
My guess is that he and Walker
know each other quite well.

640
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,221
All right. Let me look this
over. I'll call you back.

641
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:05,441
I'm being played.

642
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:09,487
But why?

643
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:19,913
- Did I wake you again?
- No.

644
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:21,541
I'd like to talk.

645
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,751
Give me a moment.

646
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,602
Carolina Parakeet.

647
00:40:54,603 --> 00:40:56,937
You're wrong, but you're close.

648
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,107
This is the Sun Conure.

649
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,984
They look very similar,

650
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:05,029
but the Carolina Parakeet is extinct.

651
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,640
Was killed off because
it was considered a pest.

652
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:10,643
Interesting species, though.

653
00:41:10,644 --> 00:41:11,670
Voracious appetite.

654
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:14,561
And he was poison. Cats who ate him died.

655
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,029
This bird is not the only
thing you've misidentified

656
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,864
since you've been in St. Louis.

657
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:23,658
You and Walker are old friends.

658
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,994
I wasn't sent here to vet you.

659
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:28,080
Very good.

660
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,249
Tell me why I am here, then.

661
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,125
So I can vet you.

662
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:34,878
For the vice presidency?

663
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:39,549
The President values my advice,
and he tends to follow it.

664
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,095
Like when I advised him not
to make you Secretary of State.

665
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:49,184
That was very bad advice.

666
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:51,103
Yes, it was.

667
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,188
One of the larger mistakes I've made,

668
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:56,858
and I very rarely make
mistakes of any size.

669
00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:01,821
You've proven yourself
to be quite difficult.

670
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:06,785
Kern, the teachers' strike, now Matthews.

671
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:08,828
You attribute all that to me?

672
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,872
If I had to guess.

673
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:15,127
A smart man once said to me that
speculation is a poor form of politics.

674
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:17,212
Why don't you stick to
what you know, Raymond?

675
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:23,468
What I know is you are extremely effective

676
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:25,637
at what you set your mind to.

677
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:27,555
That is valuable to me,

678
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:31,351
and I've already told Garrett
that it could be valuable to him...

679
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:36,022
somebody at his side with one
foot in the executive branch

680
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:37,649
and one in the legislative.

681
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,402
He is very open to the idea.

682
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:45,782
My turn to speculate.

683
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:48,827
Your recommendation...

684
00:42:48,828 --> 00:42:50,912
comes at a price.

685
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:58,211
Fact.

686
00:42:58,212 --> 00:43:01,173
I have something that you want.

687
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:04,259
You have something that I want.

688
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,761
Have I said something amusing?

689
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:10,432
Oh, I've just sat too many
times on your side of the table

690
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,559
not to enjoy the irony of
finding myself on this side of it.

691
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,812
Would you like to hear what I want?

692
00:43:15,813 --> 00:43:18,398
I don't shackle myself
to people I don't know.

693
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,818
What I want is one favor.

694
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:25,405
One and only one.

695
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,739
Which is?

696
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,741
I need to be certain you'll grant it

697
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,411
before I'll take the risk
of being more specific.

698
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,996
A blank check.

699
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:34,789
Of sorts.

700
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,876
You would never grant anyone a blank check.

701
00:43:37,877 --> 00:43:41,171
No. But I'm not sitting
on that side of the table.

702
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:46,301
We still believe in
handshakes where I come from.

703
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:48,345
Do they still mean anything in Washington?

704
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:51,848
- Who are you calling?
- Car service to get me to the airport.

705
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,434
Frank,

706
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:58,355
I will tell the President
that I want until Friday

707
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:01,024
to think things over before
I make my recommendation.

708
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:02,650
Let me know if you change your mind.

709
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:04,319
And let me arrange the car for you.

710
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,654
Hi. I'd like to arrange a car, please.

711
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:15,038
- How are you feeling?
- Better than yesterday.

712
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,291
But I might take off early
if, uh, the nausea comes back.

713
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:22,962
I find it interesting that you stay home the
day after you blow off the sancorp people.

714
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:26,258
You weren't feeling sick, Gillian.

715
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:31,137
I find it extremely offensive that you'd
accuse me of hiding behind my pregnancy.

716
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:33,515
You knew what I wanted.

717
00:44:33,516 --> 00:44:35,016
The Botswana project is mine.

718
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:37,936
Under my umbrella, using money I raised.

719
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:40,439
You promised me autonomy.

720
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:44,650
Um, excuse us for a moment, please.

721
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:51,866
I promised to empower you.
That's not the same thing

722
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:54,660
as you doing as you choose
without consulting me.

723
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,705
I'm not gonna allow a project I've put
almost three years of my life into...

724
00:44:57,706 --> 00:45:01,000
your project wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for sancorp.

725
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,668
I didn't ask for their help.

726
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:05,547
How about consulting me
before you struck a deal?

727
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:07,549
Let's get something very clear.

728
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,303
I run the organization. You work for it.

729
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:14,055
Our agreement is an affiliation, Claire.

730
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:17,559
- Worldwell isn't your vassal.
- Yes, it is, entirely,

731
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,227
if we're going to be blunt about it.

732
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:21,438
That's not what you
proposed six months ago.

733
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:23,523
It's what you signed up for
when you signed the contract.

734
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:25,733
There was a good faith
understanding that...

735
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:27,944
And you dissolved that
good faith by disobeying me.

736
00:45:29,321 --> 00:45:32,240
- Disobeying you?
- Yes.

737
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:37,370
I threaten you, don't I?

738
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:40,039
Nothing about you threatens me.

739
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,834
But maybe you should
take a leave of absence.

740
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:45,003
Are you firing me?

741
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:47,547
That's up to you, but
right now you should leave.

742
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:54,513
Did you get her on record?

743
00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:56,473
No. She wouldn't talk to me otherwise.

744
00:45:56,474 --> 00:45:59,267
We need hard proof that
Underwood was behind it.

745
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:01,811
This whole thing is
making me really nervous.

746
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:03,938
That you'll be exposed?

747
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:06,441
Not that.

748
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:09,444
It's Francis.

749
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:12,322
If this really goes as deep as we
think, and he's already watching you...

750
00:46:12,323 --> 00:46:15,033
- You think he's dangerous?
- I know he is.

751
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:18,911
Then that's why we have to keep going.

752
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:21,080
He crushes people...

753
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:28,796
- Hey, Callum.
- Hey.

754
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:37,681
Look, if you weren't afraid,
you wouldn't be doing your job.

755
00:46:37,682 --> 00:46:40,058
The only articles that I have ever written

756
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:42,394
that truly mattered
scared the shit out of me.

757
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:46,064
We need to know about anything
that might've happened with Russo.

758
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:49,401
Something Underwood
could have held over him.

759
00:46:49,402 --> 00:46:51,444
We have to go back to Christina Gallagher,

760
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:53,154
see if she'll give us something.

761
00:46:53,155 --> 00:46:55,574
It can't be me. If I go
back for a second time...

762
00:46:55,575 --> 00:46:57,492
I'll do it.

763
00:46:57,153 --> 00:47:00,780
You honestly had no idea that
the President and Tusk were close?

764
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:03,200
He never showed up once on any call sheet,

765
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:06,578
phone log or schedule during the
campaign or since we've been in office.

766
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:09,373
I'd love to believe you, Linda,
but I'm finding it very difficult.

767
00:47:09,374 --> 00:47:11,291
What would I gain by
keeping you in the dark?

768
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:12,751
I am as shocked as you are, Frank.

769
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:14,544
Well, don't let on that you know.

770
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,838
- Of course not.
- What's the President saying?

771
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:19,465
He wants to meet with you Tuesday
to get your report on Tusk.

772
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:22,886
- That's a farce.
- Should I come up with a reason to delay the meeting?

773
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:25,597
- No. Maybe we'll learn something. What time?
- 2:00 P.M.

774
00:47:25,598 --> 00:47:28,600
All right. I'll be there. Thank you, Linda.

775
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:31,853
- We have one week.
- To accomplish what exactly?

776
00:47:31,854 --> 00:47:35,399
To force Tusk's hand. He
wants me beholden to him? No.

777
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,318
We have to make him come crawling to me.

778
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,405
What's his weakness?

779
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:42,864
His fortune.

780
00:47:42,865 --> 00:47:44,950
Wouldn't you say that's his strength?

781
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:47,160
Not if it's slipping away.

782
00:47:47,161 --> 00:47:49,537
- How do you make 40 billion disappear overnight?
- We can't.

783
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:51,915
But maybe we can create the
illusion that it's in danger.

784
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:54,000
The brief you gave me on his assets.

785
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:59,214
How much of his total net
worth is... in nuclear power?

786
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:02,634
About a third. Sixteen reactors
here in the states, 37 worldwide.

787
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:04,677
Well, that's what we hit him with.

788
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:06,305
We go after his nuclear interests.

789
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:09,099
Even so, he's got 25
billion in other investments.

790
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,351
Doug, this is a man who built
his fortune from nothing.

791
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:13,270
The money doesn't mean anything to him.

792
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:15,147
It's what it represents.

793
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:17,190
- Which is what?
- His life's work.

794
00:48:17,191 --> 00:48:19,734
Get Remy Danton on the phone. Set
up a meeting as quickly as you can.

795
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:22,528
You got it.

796
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:26,116
Tusk understands the difference
between power and money.

797
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:28,201
That's precisely what makes him dangerous.

798
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:32,164
He doesn't measure his wealth in
private jets but purchased souls.

799
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:35,959
I've worked too hard to get
within arm's reach of the prize

800
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,046
only to have my hand cut
off just before I seize it.

801
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:43,467
Zoe Barnes, here to
see Christina Gallagher.

802
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:46,970
I'm sorry. I don't see an appointment.

803
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:48,972
Oh, there must be a
mistake. I have an 11:30.

804
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:50,514
One second.

805
00:48:52,017 --> 00:48:54,186
My name is Zoe Barnes.

806
00:48:54,187 --> 00:48:57,397
I work at Slugline. You spoke
to my colleague Janine Skorsky.

807
00:48:57,398 --> 00:49:00,692
- Miss...
- Oh, we're fine, thanks.

808
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:02,444
You can't just come in here...

809
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:04,612
there are things you
don't know about Peter.

810
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:08,532
- I wrote the article about Roy Kapeniak.
- Please leave. Right now.

811
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,994
It was Peter who convinced
him to talk to me.

812
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:14,414
What? I don't... I don't understand.

813
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:16,708
- Why would he...
- Somebody pressured him to do it.

814
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:21,171
The night of January 24th. That's
when he went to speak to Kapeniak.

815
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:24,966
Do you remember anything strange
around the time of the inauguration?

816
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:27,427
- Anything that could have been held over him?
- No, I don't.

817
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:32,057
If he was mixed up in things that in
any way contributed to his suicide,

818
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:34,184
wouldn't you want to know?

819
00:49:34,185 --> 00:49:36,602
I'm not trying to cause you any more pain.

820
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:38,771
I just want the truth.

821
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:40,940
And you deserve that more than anyone.

822
00:49:43,402 --> 00:49:45,695
- What was the date?
- The 24th of January.

823
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,509
