00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,901
<i>Previously on "Vikings"...</i>

2
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:04,452
Earl Ragnar,
you seem to forget I am king.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,654
Ragnar Lothbrok wants to be king.

4
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:09,323
His fame eclipses even yours.

5
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm supposed to be eternally grateful
to my husband's killer.

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,130
Everything that I was
has been stripped away from me.

7
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,332
I want my old position back.

8
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,669
I helped Ragnar rise
and now he is earl.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,970
Earl Ragnar.

10
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,308
And our little world waits upon him
and eats from his hand.

11
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:31,312
King Horik understands the gods
better than Ragnar.

12
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:33,114
There is something about him.

13
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:35,049
You talk about trust. You!

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,284
I am a trustworthy person.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,422
We know the things we like
and those we hate.

16
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,691
I have a proposition to put to you.

17

27
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:38,946
That's it, my boy.

28
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,414
Show your brother
how to tighten them.

29
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:42,316
I must help your father.

30
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,697
Klaus! Hurry!

31
00:01:58,037 --> 00:02:00,077
Erik, come here.
We have some work to be done.

32
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,168
What is it?

33
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:03,604
Floki.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,007
Floki, it's me.

35
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,947
Helga!

36
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,117
Hey...

37
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:33,300
We have a child, Helga.

38
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:36,971
Yes, we have a child.

39
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:39,440
- A beautiful girl.
- A girl!

40
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,176
You did not come,
so I brought her to see you.

41
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,268
A girl!

42
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:49,149
- I don't want to drop her.
- You won't drop her.

43
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,457
A girl...

44
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,063
A beautiful, beautiful girl.

45
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:05,466
How is it possible?

46
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:13,941
Take her back.

47
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,112
Take her back.

48
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:25,252
What shall we call her, hey?

49
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:28,489
Angrboda.

50
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:32,882
- The name of Loki's first wife?
- Yes, yes.

51
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,194
But she's...

52
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,864
What's wrong with that?

53
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:40,301
They thought she was evil.
They had monstrous offspring.

54
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:45,139
She was a great giantess, Helga!

55
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,645
Will you come back with us?

56
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:54,882
Will you get to know your daughter?

57
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:59,486
No. I have to stay in Kattegat.

58
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:03,257
But you, you must go home.

59
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,425
Can't I stay awhile...

60
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:09,229
You don't understand, Helga!
You have to leave!

61
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:13,400
Leave! Leave!

62
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,062
Oh, there!

63
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:49,503
They're here, father!

64
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:57,144
- Father!
- Let's go!

65
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,251
Hey! Erlendur!

66
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:07,554
Welcome! Welcome to Kattegat!

67
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,656
Sisters.

68
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,993
Darlings!

69
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,495
Are you well?

70
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,157
Yes, all of us are well now.

71
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:21,235
Come! Come, family!
I want you to meet Ragnar. Huh?

72
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,404
Are you hungry?

73
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,956
Welcome!

74
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,897
Ragnar Lothbrok, my friend and ally,

75
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,833
and all your family gathered,

76
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:56,369
let me properly present to you
my wife, Gunnhild,

77
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,537
and my children.

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,508
Ragnar,
you and I have formed an alliance

79
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:04,511
on which the future of our country

80
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,379
and its people depends.

81
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:07,948
In this endeavor,

82
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,418
I see you more than ever as an equal.

83
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,623
Between us...
and, of course Earl Ingstad...

84
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:19,526
we have already accomplished so much.

85
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:21,895
We have land and opportunity
in Wessex...

86
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,866
But that is only the beginning.

87
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,869
We know already there are
many other worlds to discover,

88
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,004
and we shall do so together,

89
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:36,009
united even more
by the bonds of family...

90
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,844
for you have many sons

91
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,480
and, as you can see,
I have many daughters.

92
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:46,353
It is our custom to celebrate
such an alliance

93
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:50,657
as the gods celebrated theirs...
with feasting and with pledges.

94
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:53,593
Yeah!

95
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:05,639
You must be the famous
shield-maiden Lagertha.

96
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,841
Oh, you are more famous, Gunnhild.

97
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:09,609
The poets talk of your exploits.

98
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,078
They tell how you killed
Swein Forkbeard

99
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,546
when he invaded Gotaland.

100
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,883
And they say that you are
now an earl in your own right!

101
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:19,118
How did it happen?

102
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,689
I killed my husband
when he invaded me.

103
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,245
- What is it?
- Don't you remember?

104
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:48,548
You were going to put
a proposition for me?

105
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,650
Was I?

106
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:54,187
Yes! And I am still waiting!

107
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,289
The thing is, Floki,

108
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,728
I'm not entirely sure I can trust you.

109
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,665
Over here!
I have something for you!

110
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:06,866
Bring it with you!

111
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,245
Porunn,

112
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:22,148
you are a free woman now.

113
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,083
What will you do with your freedom?

114
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:28,221
I will use it to choose.

115
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:32,025
- To choose what?
- You don't understand.

116
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,228
When I was a slave, I loved you.

117
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:39,832
You were the first to treat me
as if I was not a slave.

118
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:43,303
But now, I have choices.

119
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,575
There are plenty of other women here.

120
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:52,578
That is your first mistake.

121
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:07,260
Hey! Hey!

122
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,606
Ah, Torstein...

123
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,209
Up to your usual tricks I see.

124
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,270
These two beautiful women
approached me.

125
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:29,015
They chose you for the size
of your silver pouch

126
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,183
and nothing else.

127
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,151
I don't think about it too much.

128
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:35,955
If these women don't love me,
what do I care?

129
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:39,158
They will still make me happy.

130
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,128
Here! Have some more!

131
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,904
Siggy.

132
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:54,807
I am pleased to see you.

133
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,910
I would like to know your plans
while you are here.

134
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:02,015
My wife is here,
and my children are here.

135
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,017
That's all you need to know.

136
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:07,053
You again! You again!

137
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,040
Why did you come back, priest?

138
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:29,275
Nobody wants you here.

139
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:33,312
You betrayed the gods!

140
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,949
You betrayed all of us.

141
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:40,686
It's your fault Rollo's going to die.

142
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,546
Forgive me, Floki.

143
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:10,716
I know I should trust you,
but I need proof.

144
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:12,552
- Proof?
- Yes.

145
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:14,320
Prove to me I can trust you.

146
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,556
Prove to me you are on my side.

147
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,825
How can I prove it?

148
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:22,161
Kill someone. Someone who matters.

149
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:16,349
Erlendur!

150
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,722
Take your time, Torstein.

151
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,694
You missed it!

152
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,195
Yeah!

153
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:04,797
Floki!

154
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:25,618
Have you made up your mind?

155
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:28,154
Yes.

156
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:33,659
I know who I will kill.

157
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,914
Next summer,
I say we should return to Wessex,

158
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,283
claim our land from King Ecbert.

159
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:32,888
Those who wish to farm should do so,
and divide the land between them.

160
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,890
What should the rest of us do, hmm?

161
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,826
Those who do not wish to be farmers.

162
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,996
Those can join King Ecbert
and Princess Kwenthrith

163
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,765
in the battle for Mercia.

164
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,801
I am sure they will be rewarded well.

165
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:47,769
I agree with you.

166
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,172
I think we should claim the land,

167
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:53,608
but I do not like the idea
of being Ecbert's handmaiden.

168
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,976
I still have a score
to settle with him

169
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,913
and unlike Ragnar,
I do not trust him.

170
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:01,216
But isn't it best to test him
to see if he is honest?

171
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,785
I believe he is telling the truth.

172
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:07,122
Then you are still innocent.

173
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,790
So you agree with me?

174
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,960
No. I agree that those
who wish to farm should do so

175
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:17,065
and also ask
for King Ecbert's protection.

176
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,241
But for some of us,
those of us who still want to raid,

177
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,204
we will go elsewhere,

178
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,307
explore and discover new places.

179
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:46,595
How is he?

180
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,598
He's alive.

181
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,168
Will he ever walk again?

182
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,737
Only the gods know.

183
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,853
Do you watch over him
day and night?

184
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:18,860
Listen.
I'll stay with him for a while.

185
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,595
- You get some sleep.
- No, I...

186
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,698
Go get some sleep, Siggy.

187
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,169
You deserve it. I will watch him.

188
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,239
Thank you.

189
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:59,868
You put me in a bed
like this once, Rollo.

190
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,637
Do you remember?

191
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,017
I brought you something.

192
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:20,222
Look!

193
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,992
It's the food of the gods.

194
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,764
Eat!

195
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:17,979
- Catch me again!
- I'm warning you!

196
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,081
Ubbe!

197
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,918
Give this gift to Torstein.

198
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,923
Say that they are
from his good friend Floki.

199
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,526
Oh! And one more thing.

200
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:35,897
You must never tell anyone
that it was me who gave them to him.

201
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:39,567
That must be our secret.
Do you agree?

202
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:43,238
Good. Because if you don't
keep this secret,

203
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:46,541
something terrible will happen to you.

204
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,810
Do you know what will happen?

205
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,745
I'll tell you.

206
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:54,616
When the God Loki had done
something terribly bad,

207
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,986
the other gods took him
to a nasty dark cave.

208
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:02,223
And there they chained him
on three sharp rocks,

209
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:06,227
and above him
they fastened a vile snake

210
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:10,031
so that its poison would
drip, drip, drip

211
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:13,068
forever on Loki's face.

212
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,671
Now, you wouldn't want that
to happen to you, would you?

213
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,045
Well, go and give my present
to Torstein,

214
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,781
but keep the secret.

215
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:10,024
My friend Torstein has been murdered.

216
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,192
I swear by all the gods,

217
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,028
whoever did this
will pay a heavy price.

218
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,635
We'll find the guilty one!

219
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:23,705
And we shall flay the skin
from his body

220
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,008
and use horses to tear him apart!

221
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,224
You did well.

222
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:48,430
Now I know I can trust you.

223
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:57,145
So, what is your plan?

224
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,908
I will kill them all.

225
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,143
- All?
- Yes, all.

226
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:04,579
- Ragnar?
- Of course Ragnar.

227
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,948
And Lagertha, and Aslaug.

228
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:09,284
All of them.
All their bastard children.

229
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:12,687
I will wipe his family
from the face of the earth.

230
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,927
And Bjorn? What of Bjorn?

231
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,765
Bjorn Ironside.
He is difficult to kill.

232
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,534
Perhaps the gods are protecting him.

233
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:29,103
You must find a way to kill him.

234
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,772
I have no doubt you will manage.

235
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,208
I know you will manage.

236
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,644
When?

237
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:40,748
Tomorrow.

238
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,017
Be prepared, my friend.

239
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:26,045
The gods are coming.

240
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,481
I know.

241
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,288
It's not goat. It's mutton.

242
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,561
- Two more?
- Yeah, two more.

243
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,468
How many do you want?

244
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,838
Porunn.

245
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,340
Forgive me for what I said.

246
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:57,944
I don't want other women.
I want you.

247
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,879
What do you want from me?

248
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,914
Respect.

249
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,884
You know I respect you.
I worship you.

250
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,220
I don't want to be worshipped.

251
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:11,090
I spent my life as a slave.
Your words are ridiculous.

252
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,493
What can I do?

253
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,829
You can fight me.

254
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,166
- Fight you?
- Yes.

255
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:54,166
It's no use!

256
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,069
Don't give up.

257
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:07,513
What do you care if I give up or not?

258
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,891
Do you want an honest answer?

259
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,860
I don't know.

260
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,464
But I think you might
still be useful somehow.

261
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,935
To whom?

262
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,459
Shouldn't you be with your wife?

263
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,161
Doesn't she have need of you?

264
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,263
- Don't play games.
- There are no more games.

265
00:24:57,364 --> 00:25:01,067
Yes, there is,
and this is the final one.

266
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:05,237
You once promised you would
tell me Ragnar's weaknesses.

267
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,506
I don't ever remember you
delivering on that promise.

268
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,742
Well, you wasted
all your seed on a promise.

269
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,578
Tell me now.

270
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,984
Is it not obvious?

271
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:22,288
Ragnar's weakness is his children.

272
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,827
Then this is what you must do.

273
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:30,863
You must go to the Great Hall
at sunset

274
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:35,201
and you must kill
Ragnar's young sons.

275
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,975
What do I get in return?

276
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,211
I will marry you.

277
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:48,314
Gunnhild is my only wife
at the moment.

278
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,349
I will take a second.

279
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,818
I will make you a queen.

280
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,024
You will rule again, as you once did.

281
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,436
What was that?

282
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:56,749
Porunn! Please, stop.

283
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,484
Please what?

284
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,518
Porunn!

285
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,361
Porunn, I'm sorry!

286
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,533
It was an accident!

287
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,804
Porunn! Where are you?

288
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,105
Porunn!

289
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:09,086
This is the Sword of Kings.

290
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:11,688
One day, if the gods will it,

291
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:15,225
this sword will belong to you.

292
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:21,331
Today we must do
something extraordinary.

293
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:23,800
We must overcome the magic
of Ragnar Lothbrok,

294
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:27,237
which threatens our power
and survival.

295
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:31,541
The gods have spoken,
and I have listened.

296
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:34,378
We must cut and kill in such a frenzy
none can survive.

297
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:38,115
For, believe me, if even one
of that family survives,

298
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:42,352
then the day will come when
he will rise again and destroy us.

299
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:48,425
Put yourself in the hands
of the gods, do their will.

300
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:52,429
And then, for certain,
they will grant you this sword,

301
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,531
and a kingdom.

302
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,675
Come.

303
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:25,395
I've seen you praying
to your God.

304
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,802
Will you teach me one of your prayers,

305
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:33,904
so I can learn?

306
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:02,056
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

307
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:06,269
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

308
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,399
Hallowed be thy name.

309
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,643
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven...

310
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:20,217
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.

311
00:32:23,354 --> 00:32:25,489
Give us this day our daily bread

312
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,357
and forgive us our trespasses,

313
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,594
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

314
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:33,196
And forgive us our trespasses,

315
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:36,366
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

316
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:39,469
Boys! Come with me!

317
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:44,040
And lead us not into temptation,

318
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,610
but deliver us from Evil.

319
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,846
Forever and ever, amen.

320
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:03,493
Forever and ever...

321
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:12,269
Amen.

322
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:18,441
- Bring it here, girl.
- Yes, mistress.

323
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:48,965
Erlendur!

324
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:09,152
And deliver us from Evil.

325
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,321
Floki, where have you been?

326
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:22,058
Looking after you, Bjorn...

327
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,995
like I promised your father.

328
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,678
Earl Ingstad,

329
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,616
you should leave now.

00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:47,587
I have orders from Earl Ragnar.

331
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:26,893
Ragnar Lothbrok!

332
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:07,867
Floki, you have betrayed the gods.

333
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:15,441
No, King Horik,

334
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,210
I only betrayed you.

335
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:26,085
I was always true to the gods.

336
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:28,187
And Ragnar.

337
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,230
Ragnar, if you can find it
in your heart,

338
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,669
spare my son.

339
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,649
Go.
