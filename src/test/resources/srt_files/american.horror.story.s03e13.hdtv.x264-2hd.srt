55
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,335
MYRTLE:
The great Leonardo da Vinci,

56
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:51,946
who I'm certain was a warlock,

57
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,349
although it's never been proven,

58
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,600
in his masterpiece

59
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,802
<i>The Last Supper,</i>

60
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:57,270
depicted grilled eels,

61
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,939
bread and wine on the table.

62
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,341
I've chosen caviar
from the Caspian Sea.

63
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:04,343
Served on billinis.

64
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,279
Along with champagne.

65
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,898
As fitting stand-ins

66
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,950
as we partake
of our own last supper.

67
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,686
For one of you,
a last moment of freedom

68
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,071
and anonymity

69
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,356
before assuming the Supremacy.

70
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,859
For any one of you others,

71
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,527
possibly a last meal.

72
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,713
CORDELIA:
Since the beginning

73
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,799
of this coven, it has been
every outgoing Supreme's duty

74
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,001
to identify her successor.

75
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,536
Which Fiona

76
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,204
not only neglected to do,

77
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:34,056
she actually tried to kill

78
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,591
her successor.

79
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,560
So we are doing something

80
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,980
never done in our history.

81
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,598
We are going to give
all four of you

82
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,717
the chance to prove yourselves.

83
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,320
Only one of you will succeed.

84
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,989
To quote the Bible...

85
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:50,990
loosely...

86
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,409
"When I was a child,

87
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,945
"I spoke like a child,
I understood

88
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,197
"like a child,
I thought like a child.

89
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,500
"But when I became a woman,

90
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,870
I put aside childish things."

91
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,175
Childhood is over, my girls.

92
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,794
Put aside fears,

93
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,963
reservations and petty things.

94
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,551
Kick ass tomorrow.

95
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,722
MYRTLE:
<i>The Seven Wonders.</i>

96
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:26,692
Usually we move
from easiest to hardest.

97
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,928
But since we're breaking
with tradition this year,

98
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,314
let's begin with my
personal favorite.

99
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,232
Telekinesis.

100
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,378
MISTY:
What if I can't do it?

101
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,413
Then you're not the Supreme.

102
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,048
And you can go back
to your swamp.

103
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,616
Misty,

104
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,717
you're first.

105
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,230
Intention.

106
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:21,030
I did it.

107
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,249
I did it.

108
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,368
Almost sounds like you want it.
It's not about want.

109
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,871
You either are
or you aren't a Supreme.

110
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:29,872
Maybe I am.

111
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,157
Queenie?

112
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,880
Yup.

113
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,332
Madison, obviously

114
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:41,884
this is your bailiwick.

115
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,469
Whatever that means.

116
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,896
Last but not least, Zoe.

117
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,570
MYRTLE:
<i>Concilium.</i>

118
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,521
Commonly only known
to the public

119
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,407
as "mind control."

120
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,858
It's a tricky little craft.

121
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,326
When properly exercised,

122
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:10,195
can bend the strongest
of wills to your desire.

123
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:13,132
Now, let's see
which of you fillies

124
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,367
has really got the stuff.

125
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,089
QUEENIE: Stare all you want,
flower child.

126
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,175
Nobody controls my mind but me.

127
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,712
Oh, shit.

128
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,231
Knock it off!

129
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,566
This is fun.

130
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,151
(yells)
Next.

131
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:36,689
No hard feelings about...

132
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,326
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow,

133
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,944
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

134
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,729
Next.

135
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,216
He's not part of this!
He is now.

136
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,472
Well done.
I'm not done.

137
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,650
Now, lick it.

138
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,520
That's enough.

139
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,155
Let's move on.

140
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,639
Having fun yet?

141
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,975
Yeah, it's a real party.

142
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,201
The descent into the nether
world will be your next test.

143
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,538
Getting to hell will be simple
for girls of your talents.

144
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,758
It's the getting back, darlings,
that is the challenge.

145
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,510
If your soul hasn't returned
to your body by sunup,

146
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,995
you'll die.

147
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:28,801
What do you think
it'll be like?

148
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,503
I was hoping to never find out.

149
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,678
Girls, you may begin.

150
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,016
(all take a long, deep breath)

151
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:47,870
ALL:
<i>Spiritu duce, in me est.</i>

152
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:52,241
<i>Deduc me in tenebris vita</i>

153
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,827
<i>ad extremum,</i>

154
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:59,331
<i>ut salutaret 'nferi.</i>

155
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,802
<i>Descensum!</i>

156
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,754
(sizzling)

157
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,481
(gasps)

158
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,049
You're the first to return.

159
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,550
Damn.

160
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:21,353
I saw the same people

161
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,988
in the same line
for the same chicken.

162
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,724
(gasps)

163
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,326
It was horrible.

164
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,079
I was stuck on a
network musical.

165
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,731
It was a live version
of <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

166
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,283
I wasn't even the lead.

167
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,901
I was Liesl.

168
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,838
(gasps)

169
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,507
What happened to you?

170
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,510
Kyle and I kept breaking up.

171
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,428
On a loop.

172
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,913
He said he didn't love me.

173
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,266
Over and over,

174
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,435
over and over.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm right here.

175
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,587
(crying)
KYLE (whispers): I'm right here, it's okay.

176
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,025
Are we all back?

177
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,529
Everyone but Misty.

178
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,771
(frog croaking)

179
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,709
BOY:
Freak.

180
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,827
You're a freak.

181
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,662
Mr. Kringley, she did it again.

182
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,467
Where's the dissection frog?

183
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,087
It's right there, she brought it back to life.
Shut up, Bobby.

184
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,289
She snuck a live one in
to trick you,

185
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,957
but the trick's on her.
Pick up the scalpel.

186
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:33,475
No, please don't make me.

187
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,511
If you won't dissect
a dead frog,

188
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,430
then you will dissect a live one.
No, I don't want to kill

189
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,566
a living thing, please,
you can't make me.

190
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,152
You kill it, or I'll have
a talk with your parents.

191
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,520
(croaks)

192
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,106
No!

193
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,319
(croaking)

194
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,421
BOY:
Mr. Kringley, she did it again.

195
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,157
If you won't dissect
a dead frog,

196
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,825
you'll dissect a live one.
No, you can't make me kill a living thing.

197
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,677
Please, you can't make me!

198
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,662
(screams)

199
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,160
Mr. Kringley...
If you won't dissect a dead frog,

200
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:15,935
then you'll dissect a live one.
No, no, no...

201
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,938
(screams)

202
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,173

No, no...

204

(screaming)
If you won't dissect a dead frog...

206
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,975
If you won't dissect
a dead frog...

207
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,156
She's stuck.

208
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,524
We have to help her.

209
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,362
There's nothing we can do.

210
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,197
She has to get back on her own.

211
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,248
CORDELIA:

212
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,170

Before we recommence,

226
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,666
I would like to take a moment

227
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:49,947
to remember our fallen
sister witch, Misty Day.

228
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,292
MADISON:
Can we get on with it?

229
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,867
I didn't really
know her that well.

230
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:54,323
You're a stone cold bitch.

231
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,457
MADISON:
When you play

232
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,376
with fire, you get burned.

233
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,495
She's right.
Misty's gone.

234
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:00,712
There's nothing
we can do about it.

235
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:01,914
QUEENIE:
All right, then.

236
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:04,800
Let's get on with
finding the new Supreme.

237
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,202
The next task before
our candidates

238
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:08,370
is transmutation.

239
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:11,924
Tag, you're it.

240
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:15,677
Now you're it.

241
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:19,848
Gotcha.
(gasps)

242
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,600
QUEENIE:
No tag-backs.

243
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:27,689
Tag.

244
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,779
Tag, you're it. (giggles)

CORDELIA:
Careful, girls!

246
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:35,831
It's not a game!

247
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:36,898
It's the best game,

248
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,168
and we need a goddamned break!

Oh, God, Zoe! Zoe!

Then do it.

Would that make me Supreme?

Madison, if you refuse this,

then you don't deserve
to be Supreme.

You can't disqualify me.

Either I'm Supreme or I'm not.

I let this coven fall
into ruin.

MYRTLE: Don't be so hard on yourself,
Delia. You did all you could.

311
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,037
Not enough.

312
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:32,040
If Madison Montgomery really
is all that's left to us,

313
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:34,176
maybe it is better this way.

314
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:36,928
Maybe we deserve to die out.

315
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,848
I'll confess, I've had
similar dark thoughts.

316
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:43,418
I was so certain
about Misty Day.

317
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:46,855
Or even our dear Zoe.

318

That's not true.

330
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,573
She was never right about you.

Well, I guess it's different
when it's your own family.

332
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:44,663
How true is it that a prophet
is never recognized

333
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,164
in his own country?

334
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:49,251
Madison was not born
to the Supremacy.

335
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:51,920
But you, Cordelia,

336
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:54,623
you have royal blood
in your veins.

337
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,326
What are you saying?

338
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,629
I was a fool not
to have realized it earlier,

339
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,464
seeking all this time
in the dust

340
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:05,050
for that which may have been
right before us all along.

341
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,719
I-I don't understand.

342
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:10,055
First, you were suppressed
by your mother,

343
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,224
then by your own theories.

344
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,344
You have great power,
my girl, power that

345
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:19,281
has been seeking expression
in these young vessels.

346
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,116
But it's in you.

347
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:23,785
You must let it out.
You must

348
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:26,204
perform the Seven Wonders.

349
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,907
You think I could be
the next Supreme?

350
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:31,293
I'd stake your life on it.

351
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,002
(sighs)
I know what you guys are doing.

352
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,637
You want me to finish
the Seven Wonders,

353
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:44,556
so you're trumping up
some competition.

354
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,374
I'm not stupid.

355
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,209
Yes, you are.

356
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:49,919
Are you ready?

357
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,066
(scoffs)

358
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,641
(piano thumps)

359
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,865
CORDELIA:
<i>Descensum.</i>

360
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:58,152
(gasping)

361
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,636
What did you see?

362
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,689
(panting)

363
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:03,268
Me,

364
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,359
trying to get Fiona's approval

365
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:07,144
and getting bitch-slapped
for it.

366
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:09,113
Not exactly new.

367
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:10,751
Transmutation.

368
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:12,627
That's five Wonders
accomplished.

369
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:15,519
Let us move to the sixth,
divination. Cordelia...

370
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:17,304
Fine. Okay,
I'm back in.

371
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:19,606
(chuckles)
What? It's only fair.

372
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:21,358
This thing started
as a competition.

373
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:22,810
I say we end it like one.

374
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:24,528
Divination.

375
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:25,896
Let's rock.

376
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,614
Hidden in this house are items

377
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:30,183
belonging to former Supremes.

378
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:34,538
Cordelia, divine

379
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,290
in the pebbles the location
of the item

380
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,692
which belonged
to MiMi DeLongpre.

381
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,304
Who knew the test
came in Braille?

382
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:51,471
Shh.

383
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:59,263
Southwest corner.

384
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:00,647
Up the stairs.
Second door

385
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:02,549
down the hall,
beneath the dresser.

386
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:15,696
The antique broach presented
to Supreme MiMi DeLongpre

387
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:17,414
on the night
of the Great Ascension.

388
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:18,565
Correct.

389
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:23,036
Your turn, hotshot.

390
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,180
MYRTLE:
Divine for us

391
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:34,715
the location of the object

392
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,417
belonging to Supreme Anna
Leigh Leighton, Madison.

393
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:44,691
This is stupid.
I'm not doing it.

394
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,642
Because you can't?

395
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,611
Let me show you some real power.

396
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,062
Let's go into the greenhouse

397
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:51,097
right now, and I'll bring
Zoe back to life.

398
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:53,450
Divination first.
We're doing this by the book.

399
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,035
I'm sick of your book.

400
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:57,704
I have so many powers,
I could tear this room apart

401
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,623
until there's nothing left
but your little trinkets

402
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,825
but, no, I have to do
this bullshit!

403
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,460
Fail.

404
00:23:03,544 --> 00:23:05,445
(exhales)

405
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:06,747
Wait.

406
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,082
(exhales)

407
00:23:15,006 --> 00:23:17,257
The vase above the fireplace.

408
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:26,800
Wrong.

409
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:28,602
The piano. I meant...

410
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:31,471
I meant the piano. There's
something in the thing.

411
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:38,862
Girl, no.

412
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:41,365
This is bullshit.

413
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:42,783
Cordelia did it.

414
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,418
Because the game is rigged,
Queenie.

415
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:45,318
Wake up!
You would accuse us

416
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,319
of chicanery?

417
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,372
You bet your bony ass.

418
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:51,491
I never had a shot
at running this shit hole coven.

419
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:53,794
(grunts)

420
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,382
I didn't even want to come here
in the first place.

421
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:01,184
It's all just some jacked-up
version of <i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

422
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,853
I'm out of here.

423
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:04,855
Thus endeth your Seven Wonders.

424
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,606
Oh, no shit, lady!

425
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:09,309
I'm going back to Hollywood
where people are normal.

426
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,727
And I suggest
you change the locks

427
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:13,447
because when I tell
TMZ everything,

428
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:16,483
it won't be long
before torches, pitchforks

429
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:19,853
and Molotov cocktails become
a real big part of your day.

430
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,488
Peace <i>out!</i>

431
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:29,129
(whimpers)

432
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,083
(whimpers, sighs)

433
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,224
What do you want, dumb-ass?

434
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,593
(whimpering)

435
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,347
You let her die.

436
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,382
(gasps)
<i>Why...</i>

437
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,934
did you let her die?

438
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,486
I...

439
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:53,720
(shrieks)

440
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,895
(exhales loudly)

441
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:05,032
(wooden creaking)

442
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,667
You know that dark place! We've both
been there! (loud, raspy breath)

443
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:09,235
We both came back.
(whimpering)

444
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:10,236
Why?!

445
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:11,788
I did it for us.

446
00:25:11,873 --> 00:25:13,507
I love you.

447
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:16,126
I love you. Please. Please.

448
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,178
(sobbing)

449
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:23,850
You're not that good an actress.

450
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:26,553
(gasping)

451
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:28,889
(yelling):
Stop! No!

452
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,815
(gasping)

453
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,734
(screams)

454
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:45,438
(guttural gasping)

455
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,790
(grunts)

456
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:49,209
(airy gasp, grunts)

457
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:51,545
(Kyle grunts, Madison gasps)

458
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:56,950
(loud, high-pitched gasp)

459
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:00,337
(Zoe coughs)

460
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,057
(gasps)

461
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:43,288
She'd already started packing.

462
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,330
That's helpful.

463
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:52,485
No one will wonder where
the body went once we bury her.

464
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:59,477
Who the hell are you?

465
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:09,187
The help.

466
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:17,411
CORDELIA: <i>The hallmark
of any rising Supreme</i>

467
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:19,247
<i>is glowing, radiant health.</i>

468
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:21,398
(echoing):
<i>...glowing, radiant health.</i>

469
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:56,934
Behold. The one, true Supreme.

470
00:27:56,985 --> 00:28:00,238
MAN: Since your extraordinary
public statement last month,

471
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:02,490
there has been quite
a bit of fanfare.

472
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:04,992
This frank revelation
about your cult--

473
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:07,495
that's sparked quite a brouhaha
in the media, and...

474
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:09,163
Let me clarify that, Bill.

475
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:10,998
We are not a cult.

476
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,833
We-we don't proselytize.

477
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:15,119
We have no agenda,
we're not recruiting.

478
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:20,258
Women who identify
as witches are born as such,

479
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,644
and their abilities--
which we call powers--

480
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:28,399
are part of who they are, part
of their DNA, if you will.

481
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:30,568
BILL: Oh, I see. So,
in fact, you're saying

482
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,469
that it's not a choice,
being a witch.

483
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:34,855
CORDELIA:
That's exactly what I'm saying.

484
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,659
There are so many young witches
who have resisted their calling

485
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:40,978
because they're afraid...

486
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,832
of how they may be perceived,
or what's expected of them.

487
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,284
But there are
still hate crimes.

488
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,119
That is true, but, you know,

489
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,920
when you hide in the shadows,

490
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:53,257
you are less visible,
you have less protection.

491
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,092
We'll always be targets
for the ignorant.

492
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,461
It is what it is.

493
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:59,463
But we are strong women, Bill.

494
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,132
So, what would you like

495
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:05,269
to say to all those girls
watching and wondering

496
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:07,855
if they might be witches?

497
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,690
Hmm?

498
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:12,610
Call us, e-mail us

499
00:29:12,677 --> 00:29:15,146
or just come to New Orleans.

500
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:18,566
There is a home and a family
waiting for you.

501
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:30,411
MYRTLE:
I'm so proud of you.

502
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:35,666
We need to discuss the Council.

503
00:29:35,717 --> 00:29:37,385
We've never had

504
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:39,220
young witches on the Council,

505
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:41,422
and Queenie and Zoe deserve an
elevated role here at the school

506
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:42,556
to set them apart.

507
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,558
What do you think?

508
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,344
I would start by telling them

509
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:48,145
that being an authority figure
requires you

510
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:50,815
to make hard, unpopular
decisions for the greater good.

511
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:53,550
They've matured so much,
I think they can handle it.

512
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,436
I was talking about you.

513
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,738
Me?

514
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,573
You have every chance

515
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:01,859
to be the greatest Supreme
this coven has ever seen.

516
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,411
Stop.

517
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:05,396
Delia, I have something to say,

518
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:08,833
and your tasteful modesty is
out of fashion, so knock it off.

519
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,618
Thanks to you,

520
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:12,403
we're entering a new era.

521
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:14,171
You've planted the seeds,

522
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,540
but in order to
reap their harvest,

523
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:18,509
you have to clear the rot
of the past.

524
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,928
Myrtle, you know
I love your metaphors,

525
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:22,797
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

526
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:24,081
Me. I'm talking about me.

527
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,967
We all know
what happens to a witch

528
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:28,413
who grievously harms
another witch.

529
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,810
I hope you're not suggesting...

530
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:38,362
I'm not suggesting.
I'm insisting.

531
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:44,935
You want to be burned
at the stake?

532
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:47,321
Again?

533
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:49,990
Want has nothing to do with it.

534
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:52,076
At the start
of your glorious reign,

535
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:54,712
the last thing you need
is an ABSCAM or Watergate.

536
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,631
I killed, and I
must pay for it.

537
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,583
Now, before word leaks,

538
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,618
and you are tainted by my hubris
and actions, however deserved.

539
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,053
Myrtle,

540
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,122
stop talking.

541
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:07,174
I didn't hear this.

542
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:09,477
I didn't.
Listen to me, child.

543
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:13,647
Now that you're in charge,
my life's work is fulfilled.

544
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,316
I've made many painful

545
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,134
mistakes in my life.

546
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,236
I want my death
to have some meaning.

547
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:20,354
No!

548
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,306
No way!

549
00:31:22,357 --> 00:31:24,608
You were my mother,

550
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,144
my true mother,

551
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:29,646
just as you promised
you would be,

552
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:33,167
and I can't do this without you.

553
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,369
Stiff upper lip, my dear.

554
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,789
Everything you do or say ripples
through the entire coven.

555
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,708
You cannot be a hypocrite.

556
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:41,992
I won't stand for it.

557
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:44,328

00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:34,878
as reigning Supreme
of this coven,

567

my sweet daughter...

I have never been more proud.

577
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,795
Any last words?

578
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,348
Only one.

579

00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,142
Line's around the block.

588
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:06,585
Where are we gonna
put all these girls?

589
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:09,997
We'll buy more houses
if we have to.

590
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,482
Look at you.

591
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,200
You two are powerful witches

592
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,320
with more skills and confidence
at your young age

593
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,656
than I had for much of my life.

594
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:21,425
I need both of you to
help me fulfill the promise

595
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,878
of all this coven can be.

596
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:29,767
A place to protect, develop
and celebrate witches.

597
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,303
You will not only be
my right hands,

598
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:34,505
you will be my Council.

599
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,892
What do you say?

600
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,360
I got your back.

601
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,861
Good. And you?

602
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,897
I'd be honored.

603
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:47,451
Should we open the doors now?

604
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,521
(Fiona laughs distantly)

605
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,156
Not yet.

606
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,859
Stay here.

607
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,628
(echoing footstep)

608
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,797
There's just one more thing
I need to deal with.

609
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:04,585
(echoing footsteps)

610
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,253
I saw you die.

611
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,089
Look again...

612
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,374
now that you have real vision.

613
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,595
We had a deal.

614
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,930
It wasn't notarized,

615
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,231
it wasn't on paper,

616
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,766
but we had a deal!

617
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,385
(Fiona laughs)

618
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:25,072
You men, with
your fragile egos.

619
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:28,726
We still have a deal, babe.

620
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:32,530
I'm going to Paris
for just a couple days.

621
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:35,449
Just until Cordelia
gets her little dwarves

622
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,702
to perform the Seven Wonders

623
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:41,672
and I find out
who the next Supreme is.

624
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,125
Why? Why would she
decide to do that?

625
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,460
Because the old Supreme
will be dead.

626
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,345
Or at least that's
what she'll think.

627
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,582
Well...

628
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:59,056
But I'm gonna need your help.

629
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:02,860
I mean, it won't
be pleasant for you.

630
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,197
But if you do it right...

631
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,616
I promise you the world.

632
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,234
Hmm.
(soft laugh)

633
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:13,287
I'm gonna put something
inside you.

634
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,905
Well, a...

635
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,107
A young gypsy girl
tried that on me once,

636
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:20,961
I almost hit the ceiling, I jumped so high.
(laughs)

637
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:24,832
No. In your brain, sweet boy.
Oh.

638
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,167
A vision.

639
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,334
A memory.

640
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:33,257
What happens when I wake
up from this vision?

641
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:34,892
You'll figure it out.

642
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,600
Now drink.

643
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:45,319
No.

644
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,488
If you're gonna
offer me your spit,

645
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,807
I'll take it straight
from the spigot.

646
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:51,525
(chuckles)

647
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:56,280
(glass clatters)

648
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,290
(door slams shut)

649
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:12,830
FIONA: I ruined a perfectly
good pair of Jimmy Choos.

650
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:16,050
But I knew you'd
get rid of him for me,

651
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,520
once he served his purpose.

652
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,438
Whose blood was it?

653
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,026
A goat's.

654
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,028
I never killed anybody.

655
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:30,064
Not yet.

656
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,700
But that <i>is</i> what
you came here to do.

657
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,351
(short laugh)

658
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,740
That was the plan.

659
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,626
Let you do the dirty work.

660
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,362
Identify the Supreme and then
I come in and take her out.

661
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,248
Makes it a little harder
when it turns out

662
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,032
to be your own daughter.

663
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,202
Not really.

664
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,839
(quick laugh)

665
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,675
You didn't come
here to kill me.

666
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,760
You were hoping
I'd put you out of your misery,

667
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,762
but I don't need to.

668
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,315
You're close.

669
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,817
I doubt you'll make it
through the night.

670
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,320
Might make you
feel good, though.

671
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,021
(chuckles)

672
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:14,241
Is that why you were
always so awful to me?

673
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,910
Because you knew I was going to

674
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,445
take your power some day?

675
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,564
You took my power...

676
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:23,167
the minute I gave birth to you.

677
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,403
A woman becomes a mother,

678
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:29,340
she can't help but
see her mortality

679
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:33,243
in that cherubic little face.

680
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,764
Every time I looked at you

681
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,749
I saw my own death.

682
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,519
You were a constant reminder...

683
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,254
of my worst fears.

684
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:46,557
Oh, and all this time,

685
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,926
I thought you just
didn't like me.

686
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:51,729
It was nothing
personal, darling.

687
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,606
I loved you plenty, though.

688
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,716
Just my own way.

689
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,336
Which, I'll admit,
had its limitations.

690
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:19,840
Your fault was

691
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:24,061
you were always looking for
another version of motherhood.

692
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,734
(exhales)

693
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:34,822
I can feel the power
vibrating off of you.

694
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,358
It feels good,
doesn't it? Hmm?

695
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,195
It's mine, you know?

696
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,830
When it came into you,

697
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:44,665
it left me.

698
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,819
The law of conservation
of energy.

699
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,088
I have to die
for you to truly live.

700
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,179
Crying over me.

701
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,331
Isn't that the ultimate twist.

702
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:05,269
I'm not crying over you.

703
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:09,172
I'm crying for me.

704
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:11,775
You were the monster
in every one of my closets.

705
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,531
A lifetime spent either
trying to prove myself to you,

706
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,700
get close to you

707
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,618
or get away from you.

708
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,690
I'm crying for the girl in me

709
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:28,792
who dies when you die.

710
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:32,713
Then kill them both right now.

711
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,498
Huh?

712
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:36,717
They both hurt too much.

713
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,753
And when we're finally gone

714
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,039
you will fulfill your destiny

715
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,508
and lead this coven.

716
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,062
God knows you'll do a better job
of it than I ever did,

717
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,681
though you won't look
half as good doing it.

718
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,768
Come on.

719
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,107
For God's sake...

720
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,559
have mercy on me.

721
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,394
Put me out of my misery.

722
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,115
I hurt everywhere.

723
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,041
You're scared,

724
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:24,181
maybe for the first
time in your life.

725
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,851
No powers, no magic.

726
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:31,388
Just a woman facing
the inevitable.

727
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,557
A divine being

728
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:36,393
finally having
a human experience.

729
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,397
(sniffles)

730
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:46,269
No one can help you, Mother.

731
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:49,272
You have to do this alone.

732
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,210
And the only way out...

733
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,661
is through.

734
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:59,282
So, feel the fear

735
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:02,002
and the pain.

736
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,088
Let it all in...

737
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,291
...and then let it all go.

738
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,134
(short sob)

739
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,358
I don't think we ever hugged.

740
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:29,613
(short, sniffling breath)

741
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:40,290
(sniffles)

742
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:45,963
(coughing)

743
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,000
(rooster crows)

744
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:51,885
(birds chirping)

745
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,346
(dog barking outside)

746
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:10,120
(rooster continues crowing)

747
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,359

00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:20,247
(man whistling a tune)

749
00:43:24,886 --> 00:43:27,221
AXEMAN:
Oh. Sweetness.

750
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,872
You're up.
I hope you're hungry.

751
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:32,142
I brought you some, uh,

752
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,878
some catfish, I'll fry it up.
Granddaddy's favorite.

753
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:39,183
Oh, get those goddamn things
out of my face.

754
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:41,318
Why you always got to be like this?
Huh?

755
00:43:43,438 --> 00:43:45,656
Always got to be like what?

756
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,491
Huh?

757
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,443
"Be like"--
what do you mean?

758
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,246
Every morning you wake up,

759
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,498
and you act like you
don't know where you are.

760
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,899
And then we fight.

761
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,419
I'm... I'm tired
of fighting.

762
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,071
Every morning?

763
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,075
How long have we been here?

764
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:06,576
Well, now,

765
00:44:06,628 --> 00:44:08,245
you can't put a clock...

766
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:09,630
on eternity.

767
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,634
Oh, no.

768
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:16,086
Jesus Christ.

769
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:18,922
(rooster crowing)

770
00:44:18,973 --> 00:44:21,975
If want a stiff one,

771
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,810
come over here.

772
00:44:27,982 --> 00:44:29,650
Don't be vulgar.

773
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,702
Oh!

774
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,121
Maybe you ought to...
(groans)

775
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,373
...lay off the sauce
for a while.

776
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,659
(breathing heavily)

777
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:41,111
Drink in the... the fresh air.

778
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,000
(groans)

779
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,003
(spits)

780
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,091
Delia did this.

781
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:56,310
No, nobody sent you here...

782
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,562
but you, baby.

783
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,647
We had a deal.

784
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,267
Oh, God.

785
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:05,602
I can't spend eternity here.

786
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:10,991
This place--
it reeks of fish

787
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,744
and cat piss.

788
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,162

789
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,530

790
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,081
Knotty pine?!

791
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,916
I want Delia.

792
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:22,085
I want...

793
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,987
It's too late for that.
I want my daughter.

794
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:26,006
No, come on, you're here.

795
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,507
(whimpering)
You're here.

796
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,676
With me.

797
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:33,163
Nobody is going anywhere.

798
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:36,333
I'm in heaven.

799
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:38,385
So just, uh...
Oh, no.

800
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,971
relax. You're here.

801
