1
00:00:01,132 --> 00:00:02,832
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:06,115
I have never known anyone
more honest, ethical,

3
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:08,702
and patriotic
than Garrett Walker.

4
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:11,036
- You set me up, Frank.
- Let's say

5
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:14,712
that what the president
has accused me of is true.

6
00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:17,491
Would that be so bad?

7
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:20,496
<i>My enemies want me dead. You're asking
me to give them confirmation.</i>

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,793
And we're giving you
safe haven in return.

9
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:25,316
This is a one-time
offer, Mr. Feng.

10
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:28,303
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,362
Did you ever use these contributions
to bargain for political favors?

12
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:34,093
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

13
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:37,456
Having trouble starting it?
She needs to be gone.

14
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,216
But you said you didn't care
if she was here.

15
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,872
I don't need to explain myself.

16
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:42,792
I don't want you here! OK?

17
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:44,902
I don't love you the way
that you love me!

18
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,575
What I don't think is brave is
Claire Underwood

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,577
dodging this debate and having
you fight this battle for her instead.

20
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:53,057
I'm actually working with
her now. I'm withdrawing the bill.

21
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:54,363
After what she did to me?

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,725
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right,
you are a fucking coward.

23
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,166
- But he prescribed us medication.
- Have you mentioned it?

24
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,237
The medication?

25
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:02,039
our president is seeking
psychological treatment,

26
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:03,784
and chose to hide this
from the American people.

27
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,873
I believe our colleagues
in the House certainly

28
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,528
have enough to consider
articles of impeachment.

29
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:10,619
What you're asking
is just shy of treason.

30
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:14,720
Just shy, which is politics.

31
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:20,996
We have a president
who not only took

32
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:24,762
mind-altering medication,
a man who has his finger on the button

33
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:26,842
while US ships
are squaring off with China,

34
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:30,124
but then instructed his White
House counsel to coach a...

35
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:34,332
- Allegedly, sir, not proven.
- To coach a witness.

36
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,133
Which is behavior either
resulting from the use of those drugs,

37
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,773
or worse, a deliberate attempt
to obstruct the law.

38
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:42,493
Wouldn't you call
either scenario impeachable?

39
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:45,373
That's for the United States
Congress to decide, sir, not me.

40
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:47,933
Were you aware that the president
was taking any form of medication?

41
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:51,452
- No, I was not. - Did you notice him
acting in a bizarre fashion?

42
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,174
- Unstable, incoherent?
- No, sir.

43
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,413
- Any odd behavior?
- No, sir.

44
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:58,774
Not even firing his chief of staff
in the midst of a trade war?

45
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,933
He didn't fire me. I resigned.

46
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:05,413
- Would you tell us why?
- I resigned because I felt

47
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:08,374
I could no longer serve the president
to the best of my ability.

48
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,294
And what changed? How did you
come to that conclusion?

49
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,612
I had some fundamental
differences of opinion

50
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:17,532
with certain people
in the White House.

51
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,013
- Like who? The president?
- No, sir.

52
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,172
What "certain people" then?

53
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:24,573
One person, actually.
The vice president.

54
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:27,813
- Frank Underwood.
- He wanted you gone?

55
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,333
I can't speak as to what
the vice president did or didn't want.

56
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:35,813
Was he trying to hide anything?
Was he afraid you might expose something?

57
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:37,692
You'd have to ask him, sir.

58
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:40,334
What's happening in the
Judiciary Committee is a farce.

59
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:43,973
- The Republicans are exploiting...
- Excuse me, Mr. Vice President,

60
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:46,172
but it's not just Republicans.

61
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:50,253
A number of Democrats have come out
saying they would support impeachment.

62
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,733
Including the majority whip,
Jackie Sharp.

63
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:56,374
Which is egregious, since the committee
hasn't stopped hearing testimony,

64
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,053
nor has the special prosecutor
completed her investigation.

65
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,093
You vigorously
defend the president,

66
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:03,492
but there are reports that
you've had a falling out,

67
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:06,332
- that you haven't spoken in weeks.
- That is simply not true.

68
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,773
I've spoken to senior staff
at the White House

69
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:12,613
who say the president is worried
you want to run against him in 2016.

70
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:15,493
And just today Linda Vasquez
intimated that you...

71
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,812
Look, I fully expect that
the president will run in 2016,

72
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:22,053
and I hope that he's generous
enough to invite me to be his running mate.

73
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:24,572
Impeachment, conviction,
let's say it happens.

74
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:26,573
It won't.
He's completely innocent.

75
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,533
Let's say it does happen.
You become president...

76
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,492
That is not a scenario
I'm going to entertain.

77
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,773
The thought must
have crossed your mind.

78
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:36,373
And one could make the argument that the
president wouldn't be in this predicament

79
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:40,533
if it weren't for you. It's your staff's
involvement with Feng and Lanagin

80
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,812
that expanded Dunbar's
investigation,

81
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,173
- which resulted in the travel logs...
- These impeachment hearings

82
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,534
are the result
of political maneuvering, not...

83
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,334
Your maneuverings,
or the Republicans?

84
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:53,453
Morley, I've always liked you.
You ask the tough questions.

85
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:55,493
And you can certainly
question my judgment,

86
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:57,853
but do not question
my patriotism.

87
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:01,613
I serve this nation
and my president, not myself.

88
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:04,814
- He's lying through his teeth.
- What we're doing is working.

89
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:06,693
We keep the whisper
campaign alive.

90
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,213
We spin him as power hungry,
as duplicitous.

91
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,652
- Focus attention on him, not you.
- What's the latest?

92
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:16,214
- Twenty percent? - Zogby has you at 24.
Your speech made a difference.

93
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:20,173
The approval numbers
are moving in the right direction.

94
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,333
We need to do more
than play the spin game.

95
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,493
We need to destroy Frank.

96
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:28,214
Offer his head instead of mine.

97
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:31,493
- We use Raymond Tusk.
- How?

98
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:34,933
At his hearing.
When he goes to the judiciary.

99
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:38,093
Sir, you're already being
accused of coaching one witness.

100
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,372
- If you take steps to coach another...
- Not coaching. The truth.

101
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,094
Raymond admits
to the money laundering,

102
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,933
puts Frank at the center of
this, and says I knew nothing.

103
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,854
And then we'll reward him
for his honesty.

104
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,534
You mean a pardon?

105
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:56,772
- I want you to talk to him.
- And put myself at risk?

106
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:58,933
You're not part of this
administration anymore.

107
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:02,093
There's no law that says you can't
pay Raymond Tusk a visit.

108
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:07,374
And in return, resignations
don't have to last forever.

109
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:14,774
If I do this, you have to be
a million miles away.

110
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,533
Tricia and I will
go to Camp David.

111
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:22,213
It's not a million miles away,
but it'll do the job.

112
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:24,053
I can go after Linda,
dig into her past...

113
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:26,613
Neutralizing her won't
neutralize the bigger problem.

114
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:29,613
- The president is after blood.
- Then what's his move?

115
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:33,372
He can't ask me to resign,
he'd have to force me out.

116
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:37,493
And to do that, if I were him...

117
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:40,293
...I would return
to the hand that first fed me.

118
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,373
- Raymond Tusk?
- Exactly.

119
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,653
He'd have to implicate himself
to implicate you.

120
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:46,493
Not if he gets a pardon.

121
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:49,893
It's the one thing that only
a president can offer.

122
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:51,813
Tusk is a hand grenade.
If he pardons him...

123
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:53,253
You're right.
Tusk is a hand grenade.

124
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:55,253
We need to pull the pin
and throw him at Walker

125
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,133
before Walker pulls the pin
and throws him at us.

126
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,854
I want to meet with Raymond.
One-on-one.

127
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:02,813
Let me speak on your behalf.
That way if anyone finds out...

128
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:05,773
I know Raymond. He won't
respond to anyone but me.

129
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:09,013
- When's his hearing scheduled?
- Day after tomorrow.

130
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:11,652
- Two p.m.
- That gives us...

131
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:15,453
- ...40 hours to make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:06:17,063 --> 00:07:47,063

134
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,614
I think it's mine.

135
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:08,013
Seth, it's four in the morning.

136
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:10,732
- When?
- I want you to go with her.

137
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,253
I'll get it cleared right now.

138
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:14,174
Thank you.

139
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,133
Meechum says the plane
will be ready in 30 minutes.

140
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:21,212
- OK, good.
- Think it was just a panic attack,

141
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:22,973
- or was she really trying...
- I don't know.

142
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,173
It was bad enough they felt
they had to keep her overnight.

143
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,733
I'm gonna call the White
House physician's office,

144
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,493
- see if they can recommend anyone.
- OK.

145
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:31,853
- Oh, wait, my phone.
- It's in your hand.

146
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,813
I'll be back sometime tonight.

147
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,532
Impeachment is our only chance.

148
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,773
Here are the seats that are still in
contention in the midterms.

149
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:46,813
These 13 we're gonna lose, no matter what
we do. But even if we win all the rest,

150
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:50,052
that only leaves us
with a five-seat majority.

151
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,333
We either save the party
or we save the president.

152
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,492
Anyone who votes
against impeachment

153
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,653
is gonna get pummeled by attack ads
between now and election day.

154
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:00,293
- How many do you have already?
- We need 18.

155
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:04,853
- I have six.
- So 12 more to go.

156
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:08,933
Look, Donald,
I know this is a big ask,

157
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:13,132
- and you prefer to focus on policy...
- Jackie, you can stop.

158
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,452
- I'm on board.
- Really?

159
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,653
One hundred percent.

160
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:19,772
I have to say
I'm a little surprised.

161
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,732
When you rolled those dollies
into the cloakroom,

162
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:26,492
you said, "Work with me,
I'm not Frank Underwood."

163
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:31,373
And then you helped get my stimulus
package through, just like you promised.

164
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,053
And what do you
expect this time?

165
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:38,012
That you never
become Frank Underwood.

166
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:41,733
You must realize, if we're successful,
he will replace Walker.

167
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:45,732
I don't like Frank, but I hate being in
the minority even more.

168
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,413
We can't let the Republicans control
both houses of Congress.

169
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:51,932
You've changed
since I joined the leadership.

170
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:55,573
Just getting better
at playing the game.

171
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,734
I guess you can teach
an old liberal new tricks.

172
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,533
I guess so.

173
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,972
So tell me who you still need.

174
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:08,932
My lawyers are saying
fifty-fifty that I survive a trial.

175
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:13,333
Now, I'm not a big fan of those
odds, but I'm willing to take them.

176
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:15,652
If your lawyers are
putting it at a coin toss,

177
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:18,133
then you're paying them too
much to be overly optimistic.

178
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:21,333
How can I trust Garrett? He turned his
back on 20 years of friendship.

179
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,894
He could accuse you of the same.

180
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:31,373
Nobody on this planet wants to see
Frank Underwood go to jail more than I do.

181
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:33,573
I just don't want to be
sharing a cell with him.

182
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:35,413
That won't happen.

183
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:38,852
All you've given me
to go on is Garrett's word.

184
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:41,013
He's asking you
to tell the truth.

185
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,293
Good things happen to those
who do the right thing.

186
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:50,133
And you just expect
Frank to lie down, throw in the towel?

187
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:53,333
We don't even give him the chance.
Your testimony knocks him out cold.

188
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,413
Excuse me.

189
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,093
Yes? Oh, thank you.

190
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,733
Hold on.

191
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,413
There you go.

192
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,653
Care package, from my wife.

193
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:29,373
Now, you were saying.

194
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,013
I just want to warn you,
she's not herself right now.

195
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:39,012
They had to put her
on some heavy doses.

196
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:41,812
- Of what?
- Lithium, mostly.

197
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,932
It was either that
or commit her for 30 days.

198
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:48,653
She just took some,
so she might be a little...

199
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:57,172
Megan?

200
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,894
Stop.

201
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:36,373
Your mom told me
they found you in the lake.

202
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:40,334
- What do you care?
- I care very much.

203
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:44,534
No, you don't.

204
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:48,733
You don't use
somebody you care about.

205
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,972
Whore.

206
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:58,772
Slut.

207
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:01,174
Bitch.

208
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,452
Traitor.

209
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,933
That's what they call me,

210
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:10,373
in my mail, online.

211
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:14,412
I wish I had never called.

212
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:17,012
I wish I had never met you.

213
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:22,692
I feel so stupid, believing what you
told me, thinking that you did care.

214
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:26,293
I was getting better.

215
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,493
You did this to me.

216
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,893
Every time I take one
of these, I think of him.

217
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,293
And the next face I think of?

218
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:40,534
It's yours.

219
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:47,973
I'm sorry that you felt used.

220
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,973
You weren't.

221
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,174
I just, um...

222
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:02,613
Like I told you, the political
landscape shifted and we...

223
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:05,174
...found...

224
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,333
Megan?

225
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:29,533
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I got your text.

226
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,372
I know I shouldn't be reaching
out to you, but I thought...

227
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,611
<i>No, that doesn't matter.</i>

228
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,893
I'm glad you did. How is she?

229
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,212
In bad shape.

230
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,092
I'm surprised they even let her
out of the hospital, to be honest.

231
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:46,532
Is there anything I can do?

232
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,172
Should I contact her family,

233
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,692
<i>or go out there myself?</i>

234
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:53,493
We should probably
leave her alone.

235
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:58,052
<i>- Are you OK?</i>
- I'm fine.

236
00:14:58,053 --> 00:15:02,373
- How about you?
- <i> Holding up.</i>

237
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:06,053
I spent the whole day
talking to lawyers.

238
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:09,612
It's hard on the kids.

239
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:14,011
They're embarrassed, and
frightened, but we'll get through it.

240
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:18,492
I thought the speech you
and Garrett gave was very moving.

241
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,653
<i>Well, it seems</i>
<i>to have helped some.</i>

242
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,533
I was inspired by you, actually.

243
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:27,292
When you admitted
to the abortion on TV.

244
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,254
<i>The truth is a powerful thing.</i>

245
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:38,011
Tricia, I want... to apologize.

246
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:39,931
<i>What for?</i>

247
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,012
I feel partly responsible
for everything

248
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:44,333
your family is going through.

249
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:49,892
It was my suggestion
that you get counseling.

250
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:52,612
And had I known then,
I never would have said a word.

251
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:57,013
Claire, please.
Counseling was a godsend.

252
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:01,893
Garrett and I needed help, and it's made
things better. I should be thanking you.

253
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,452
And thank you for letting me
know about Megan.

254
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,492
It was kind of you
to make that trip.

255
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:09,732
<i>You're a good person, Claire.</i>

256
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,813
<i>Be well.</i>

257
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:01,612
I take it
this is about my hearing?

258
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,372
Did Walker get to you first?

259
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,493
Barely.

260
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:08,612
But sometimes barely is enough.

261
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:10,932
I'm sure he
offered you a pardon.

262
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,653
Always better to offer something
your competitor can't.

263
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,252
- Oh, but I can.
- Hm.

264
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:23,572
Last time I read the Constitution,
the most a vice president could offer

265
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:26,332
was a... smile and wink.

266
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:30,332
I think I've proven that I'm
not your typical vice president.

267
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,932
Typical or not,
you've lost, Frank.

268
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,533
I have an out. You don't.

269
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:39,212
Garrett will not
survive impeachment.

270
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:44,173
If there's one skill you can't deny,
it's my ability to whip votes.

271
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:47,332
In the House, not in the Senate.

272
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,292
Which the Constitution
makes me the president of.

273
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:52,172
And you saw what
I did with entitlement.

274
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,534
Hubris is giving you delusions
of grandeur, Frank.

275
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,292
Let's say Walker squeaks by.

276
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:02,133
Yes, you get your pardon,

277
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:04,292
but you've bound yourself
at the hip to a man

278
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,733
- who has zero
political capital.

279
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,452
And if he gets convicted,
we all go to jail.

280
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:17,293
- There's no pardon for anyone.
- I'll roll the dice.

281
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:24,332
Raymond, think
like a businessman.

282
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,132
Haven't you built a fortune
by minimizing risk?

283
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,892
Isn't that why you stacked
Congress all these years,

284
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:35,733
why you guided Garrett to the Oval
and why you kept me on as whip?

285
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:39,452
Walker is a junk bond
quickly depreciating,

286
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:43,771
whereas I can end the conflict with
China and keep you in the black.

287
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,732
You can't promise better
relations with China.

288
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,531
I wrecked them,
I can repair them.

289
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:56,533
Now, let's work together,
as we always intended to do.

290
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:10,773
When they put you in that box
barely bigger than a coffin...

291
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:17,333
...remember how beautiful
the music was tonight.

292
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:22,293
It might give you
some small degree of comfort.

293
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:30,734
Puccini's a downer. I prefer
something much more optimistic.

294
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:42,612
- They won't touch
Brown. The trial date is set.

295
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,772
- They can reduce the charges.
- Dallas won't give.

296
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,692
If I keep pressing,
it'll start to look suspect.

297
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:52,612
What I can do is make sure
you don't get prosecuted.

298
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:55,532
- And I stop working for you.
- Not quite.

299
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,612
I told the US attorney that we
wanted to bring you on with us,

300
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:03,052
- cyberterrorism division. You'd get
a clean slate... - No fucking way.

301
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,252
They're not gonna let your case go
unless we give them a compelling reason.

302
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:08,132
- There's no...
- I've spent half of my life

303
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,732
- fighting the bureau.
- It's the only way I could sell it.

304
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:14,652
Take this opportunity, Gavin,
before they change their minds.

305
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,132
I want to meet
with Douglas Stamper.

306
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:21,212
No. The deal was
I find you a way out...

307
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,692
No, the deal was you help out
Brown and give me my freedom.

308
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:26,572
You haven't done shit for Brown and
you want me to keep me under your thumb.

309
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:29,692
So I meet Stamper,
or any kind of deal is off.

310
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:45,372
Raymond said no.

311
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,172
He said neither yes nor no.
I'll keep the pressure on.

312
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,812
- So he could still name you.
- He could. Anything's possible.

313
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,812
- You have to stop him.
- I'm trying.

314
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,652
Trying's not enough, Francis.

315
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,652
Well, I can't sit next
to him in the hearing room

316
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,171
with a gun to his head.

317
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:01,332
- That sounds like an excuse.
- It's a reality.

318
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,532
You promised me I wasn't going
to have to prepare for the worst.

319
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,131
- And I intend to keep that promise.
- Well, I want to be sure.

320
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:09,652
- I want both of us to be sure.
- The only surefire way

321
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:13,292
- is for Walker to call him off personally.
- Then make that happen.

322
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:18,732
I cannot force a man who thinks I'm
his enemy to suddenly call me his friend.

323
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:22,092
I've done what I had to do.

324
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:25,051
Now you do what you have to do.

325
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,532
Seduce him.
Give him your heart.

326
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,693
Cut it out and put it
in his fucking hands.

327
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:38,892
<i>Dear Mr. President.</i>

328
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:42,532
<i>I'm writing you on an Underwood</i>
<i>portable my father gave me</i>

329
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,292
<i>when I left for the</i> Sentinel.

330
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:47,292
<i>It was the words my father said</i>
<i>when he gave it to me</i>

331
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:52,972
<i>that resonated even more</i>
<i>than this 70-year-old machine.</i>

332
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,052
<i>"This Underwood built</i>
<i>an empire," he said.</i>

333
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:59,451
<i>"Now you go</i>
<i>and build one of your own."</i>

334
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:04,173
<i>Those words have been a large part
of what has motivated my life.</i>

335
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:09,132
<i>I've only written one other</i>
<i>letter with these keys.</i>

336
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,212
<i>It did not fail me then.</i>

337
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:14,932
I hope it will not fail me now.

338
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,172
<i>You said I wanted</i>
<i>to diminish you.</i>

339
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:18,972
The truth is I don't.

340
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:22,012
You said I wanted
to challenge you in 2016.

341
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:23,972
The truth is I don't.

342
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:26,091
You said I wanted
the presidency for myself.

343
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:31,612
The truth is... I do.

344
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:34,132
What politician hasn't dreamed
about what it would be like

345
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:37,652
<i>to take the oath of the</i>
<i>highest office of our land?</i>

346
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:40,611
<i>I've stared at your desk</i>
<i>in the Oval and coveted it.</i>

347
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,012
<i>The power. The prestige.</i>

348
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:46,532
<i>Those things have a strong</i>
<i>pull on someone like me,</i>

349
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:51,372
<i>who came from a small South Carolina
town with nothing.</i>

350
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:56,091
<i>But since you assumed office,</i>
<i>my only aim has been to fight,</i>

351
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:58,051
<i>for you and alongside you.</i>

352
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,571
<i>Whether that be in Congress</i>
<i>or, as now,</i>

353
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:02,851
<i>the battle over impeachment.</i>

354
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:06,892
<i>Maybe one day I'll have my</i>
<i>chance to serve as president.</i>

355
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:10,211
<i>But not while you</i>
<i>are the nation's leader.</i>

356
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:14,252
<i>And in you, sir,</i>
<i>I see a brave man.</i>

357
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,052
<i>A just man.</i>

358
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:18,452
<i>A president whom</i>
<i>I would follow anywhere,</i>

359
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:22,573
<i>no matter how strong</i>
<i>the wind blows against us.</i>

360
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:30,371
<i>I want to tell you something</i>
<i>I have never told anyone.</i>

361
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:33,932
<i>When I was 13, I walked in</i>
<i>on my father in the barn.</i>

362
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,852
<i>There was a shotgun</i>
<i>in his mouth.</i>

363
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:39,611
<i>He waved me over.</i>
<i>"Come here, Francis," he said.</i>

364
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:42,532
"Pull the trigger for me."

365
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,452
Because he didn't have the
courage to do it himself.

366
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:49,452
I said, "No, Pop," and walked out, knowing
he would never find that courage.

367
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:52,052
<i>The next seven years</i>
<i>were hell for my father,</i>

368
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,932
<i>but even more hell</i>
<i>for my mother and me.</i>

369
00:25:54,933 --> 00:26:00,051
<i>He made all of us miserable,</i>
<i>drinking, despair, violence.</i>

370
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:02,292
<i>My only regret in life</i>

371
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:04,812
<i>is that I didn't</i>
<i>pull that trigger.</i>

372
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,652
<i>He would've been</i>
<i>better off in the grave,</i>

373
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:09,091
<i>and we would have been</i>
<i>better off without him.</i>

374
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:11,131
<i>I'm not going to put you</i>
<i>in the same position</i>

375
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:13,012
<i>as my father put me in.</i>

376
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:17,051
<i>You will find enclosed,</i>
<i>on a separate sheet,</i>

377
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:19,931
<i>a confession to the crimes</i>
<i>you have been accused of.</i>

378
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:24,332
<i>They're false words, but my signature</i>
<i>will make them true.</i>

379
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,572
<i>Use them if you must.</i>

380
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:31,171
<i>If you truly believe</i>
<i>that I have only served myself,</i>

381
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,812
<i>then I have forever</i>
<i>lost your trust.</i>

382
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:39,491
<i>All I can do now is give you</i>
<i>my freedom to save your own.</i>

383
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:41,612
<i>I said I would</i>
<i>take the fall for you,</i>

384
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:45,092
<i>and now I give you the means</i>
<i>to make that happen.</i>

385
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:48,372
<i>I am pulling the trigger myself.</i>

386
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,852
<i>We all must make sacrifices</i>
<i>to achieve our dreams.</i>

387
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:55,532
<i>But sometimes we must sacrifice</i>
<i>ourselves for the greater good.</i>

388
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:59,172
It is my honor to make
such a sacrifice now.

389
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:02,691
Your loyal friend, still in my
heart, if not in yours...

390
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:05,452
<i>...Francis.</i>

391
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,212
The Constitution sets forth
the general principle...

392
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:18,693
Sir, the president's
on the phone.

393
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:35,892
- Mr. President.
<i>- I got your letter.</i>

394
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:38,853
I had Tricia read it too.

395
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:42,132
<i>I'm torn, Frank.</i>

396
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,172
<i>Half of me wants to think</i>
<i>you're genuine.</i>

397
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:47,332
The other half
doesn't trust a word of it.

398
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,211
<i>Does Tricia feel the same way?</i>

399
00:27:49,212 --> 00:27:53,092
She believes in Claire,
which inclines her to believe in you.

400
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:55,052
I meant every syllable.

401
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:57,211
I wanted you to know
beyond a shadow of a doubt

402
00:27:57,212 --> 00:28:00,652
that I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary.

403
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:03,572
Then why can't
I shake the shadow?

404
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,491
<i>Because I'm a liar, sir.</i>

405
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:10,171
Because I lack scruples and some
would even say compassion.

406
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:13,012
But that's just the image
that I present to the world

407
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:17,292
<i>because it elicits fear and respect.</i>
<i>But it is not who I am.</i>

408
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:22,453
My hope was that my letter
would prove that to you.

409
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:25,812
Even if you are being genuine,

410
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:28,891
that doesn't do much for me.

411
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:32,571
I won't survive impeachment because
I got along with my vice president.

412
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:37,051
No, I agree you need more
than my good intentions.

413
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:40,532
Proof, that's what
I want to see, Frank.

414
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:45,092
Not just falling on the sword.
Show me results,

415
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:47,812
and then I'll reconsider whether
you're worth any of my trust at all.

416
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:52,091
- You're talking votes.
<i>- Whipping votes is your strong suit.</i>

417
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:54,412
<i>That's the side</i>
<i>of you I want to see.</i>

418
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:57,251
- I've already begun, sir.
- You have a count?

419
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:59,532
<i>An approximation,</i>
<i>the sands keep shifting.</i>

420
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:03,011
- Can we survive the House or not?
- Possibly. But Jackie Sharp

421
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:05,531
- is making it very difficult.
- <i> Give me numbers.</i>

422
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:07,572
Over half of the 18
that she needs,

423
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:10,331
which is why I'd like to start
focusing on the Senate.

424
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,211
- Don't you think that's premature?
- <i> We should be prepared.</i>

425
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:16,653
The key battle is making sure
that you avoid conviction.

426
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:20,011
You keep whipping,

427
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:23,771
you keep getting me information,
I'll answer your calls.

428
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:27,332
But don't take that as a sign
of reconciliation, Frank.

429
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:32,211
I'll sing for my supper, sir.
I don't expect it for free.

430
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:37,851
<i>- Let's talk again tomorrow.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. President.

431
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:40,532
- You said you wanted options.
- Frank didn't leave me options.

432
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,451
- He fucked me. - You fucked him first,
when you sided with Tusk.

433
00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:45,251
But who cares what
happened each inning?

434
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:47,332
It's the final
score that counts.

435
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:51,011
Eight years I spent
busting my ass in this office,

436
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:53,932
- I can't seem to escape it.
- Are you going to help us or not?

437
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,172
- I need to know what I gain.
- You'll be taken care of.

438
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,171
Specifically.

439
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:01,571
We'll see what makes sense
when all the chips have fallen.

440
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:04,652
So you just want me to leap off a cliff
and hope for a soft landing beneath?

441
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:07,372
No one will touch you now.
Nobody except us.

442
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,051
We're as soft
as you're going to get.

443
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:14,252
- A job at the White House?
- No promises.

444
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:19,011
Other than something commensurate
with your loyalty and experience.

445
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:21,731
I could just walk away
from it all, start a new life.

446
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:24,571
No, you can't.
You know you can't.

447
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,011
You'd wither away anywhere
but the Hill.

448
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:29,531
It's never been about the money,
no matter what you tell yourself.

449
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:33,411
When I left,
Frank begged me to stay.

450
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:37,891
Power vs. money, he said.
Don't reduce myself to a tax bracket.

451
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:40,531
He was right.
And I doubt he begged.

452
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:44,812
He was half right. Power is better
than money, for as long as it lasts.

453
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:49,532
- But it never lasts.
- What's your answer?

454
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:58,852
You've gotten colder since
you've taken over this job.

455
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,611
It makes things easier.

456
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,092
- On the outside.
- And the inside.

457
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:12,212
I miss you, Jackie.

458
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,292
Tell me if you'll cooperate.

459
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:25,453
Excuse me one second.

460
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:28,012
Mr. President?

461
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,932
<i>I want you to call</i>
<i>Tusk. Tell him the deal is off.</i>

462
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,371
- What?
- <i> You were right.</i>

463
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:34,211
I don't want to take the risk.

464
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:35,972
<i>But I already spoke to him.</i>

465
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,812
Well, so speak to him again,
and tell him there's no pardon.

466
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,452
Sir, I was skeptical
of this strategy at first,

467
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:44,091
but now that we've gone down
this road, we should stick to it.

468
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:46,452
<i>Linda, do you</i>
<i>still want your job back?</i>

469
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:50,212
- Of course, sir.
- Then make the call.

470
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:58,052
I'd rather see what happens in the House
before I get involved in any way.

471
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,532
But if you come out vigorously
in defense of the president,

472
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:02,051
it might convince
the judiciary committee...

473
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,971
To be honest, I'm not
particularly inclined

474
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:05,891
to be doing Walker any favors.

475
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:09,531
Now, Michael, I know
he revoked your nomination.

476
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:12,171
- He didn't fight for me at all.
- He had just been elected.

477
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:15,491
- He wasn't in a position...
- Wrong. He had a clear mandate.

478
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:17,572
He was in a strong position
to defend me.

479
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:21,652
You're right.
If I'd been president,

480
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,451
I wouldn't have
given in so easily.

481
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:26,371
I would've stuck by you after
that article came to light.

482
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:29,732
In fact, if you'd been our secretary
of state instead of Durant,

483
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:31,572
I don't think we'd be
in the mess we are with China.

484
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,091
The truth is I wouldn't have
nominated you

485
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:35,610
for secretary of state
in the first place.

486
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:36,771
I would have nominated you

487
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:38,011
for secretary of treasury.

488
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:39,731
Because your expertise
in economics

489
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,771
is even better than your grasp
on foreign affairs.

490
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:45,612
Now, if I were president,
you'd be secretary of treasury.

491
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:51,930
- If you were president.
- That's right.

492
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:54,293
You can't do this.

493
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,292
What happened?

494
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:01,973
Was it Frank?

495
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,973
Linda, listen to me...

496
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:12,291
I understand.

497
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:15,211
Thanks.

498
00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:17,891
- The deal is off.
- Did she say why?

499
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:21,452
No. Other than
he changed his mind.

500
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:23,211
But it must be Frank.

501
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,691
- Then we go back to the original plan.
- That's right.

502
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:28,172
You plead the Fifth, just like you
did before. This is political theater.

503
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,691
- We get past it and focus...
- Jesus Christ.

504
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,211
- What is it?
- Remy Danton is volunteering

505
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,291
to testify to Dunbar, right now.

506
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,291
He volunteered?
He wasn't subpoenaed?

507
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:39,572
- Looks that way.
- He's going to sell me out.

508
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:42,771
That would open
him up to prosecution.

509
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:45,493
Unless he's being protected.

510
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:54,773
- Where's Danton?
- I'll call his assistant.

511
00:33:56,772 --> 00:33:59,892
Did you or did you not
facilitate foreign money

512
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:04,411
being funneled into
political action committees?

513
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:09,531
On the advice of my counsel, I reserve
my right to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

514
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:13,292
Xander Feng claims you not only
facilitated, you orchestrated the scheme.

515
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:17,251
What is your response
to that testimony?

516
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:20,972
On the advice of my counsel,
I reserve my right...

517
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:23,691
You can reserve your right
all day long, Mr. Tusk.

518
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:25,971
But when you appear
in front of a grand jury,

519
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:28,491
as I'm sure the
justice department intends,

520
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:30,491
your silence will
be your downfall.

521
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:31,731
Does the Congressman
have a question?

522
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:34,292
You can hide from us all
you want, sir,

523
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:36,651
you cannot hide
from a jury of your peers.

524
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,611
- Mr. Chairman.
- That's it. I'm done.

525
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,571
I relinquish
the remainder of my time.

526
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:45,651
The chair recognizes the congresswoman
from Tennessee. You have 12 minutes, ma'am.

527
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:49,652
Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently
embroiled in a trade war with China.

528
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:52,411
It has gutted our economy.

529
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:55,131
It has placed our Navy
in harm's way.

530
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,532
- The president who put us there has...
- He knew.

531
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:03,411
- Excuse me?
- My client reserves the...

532
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:05,973
He knew. Isn't that what
you're all wondering?

533
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:12,531
- Quiet, please.
- Knew what, exactly?

534
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:17,171
There was a mechanism by which
a great many contributions were made

535
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:20,971
over the last ten years.
The legality of this mechanism

536
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:26,252
is something I continue to believe
is within the boundaries of the law.

537
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:32,211
<i>But as for the mechanism itself, Mr.
Feng is correct.</i>

538
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:37,371
<i>I orchestrated it, I facilitated it,
and the President knew about it.</i>

539
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:39,651
Danton just cancelled.

540
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:43,491
Screw Danton. We've got Tusk.

541
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:45,732
Get me the attorney general.

542
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:56,371
That won't be necessary, Mr.
Tusk, if you'll come with us.

543
00:35:56,372 --> 00:36:00,171
That's a shame. Handcuffs were
another item on my bucket list.

544
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:03,171
Right this way, sir. You have
the right to remain silent.

545
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:05,211
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

546
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:08,851
We'll want a bond,
for his cooperation in the hearing.

547
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:11,412
I'll talk bonds
if you'll talk a plea.

548
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:14,650
<i>Response to the testimony</i>
<i>has been swift and vocal.</i>

549
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:17,891
<i>Protesters have been gathering in
front of the White House since yesterday</i>

550
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:20,410
<i>demanding President</i>
<i>Walker's resignation.</i>

551
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:24,771
<i>And an online petition has already
accumulate over 200,000 signatures</i>

552
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:26,291
<i>in the past 24 hours.</i>

553
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,611
<i>The list of lawmakers</i>
<i>publicly condemning</i>

554
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:31,011
<i>the president has grown</i>
<i>on both sides of the aisle.</i>

555
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:33,690
<i>This afternoon, the Chinese</i>
<i>ambassador also condemned</i>

556
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,091
<i>the Walker administration,</i>
<i>saying China would not</i>

557
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,132
<i>negotiate with a president</i>
<i>who dealt</i>

558
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,570
<i>with corrupt businessmen</i>
<i>behind Beijing's back.</i>

559
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,731
<i>This at a time when warships</i>
<i>from both countries...</i>

560
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:46,131
<i>Meanwhile, the president and First Lady
remain bunkered at Camp David,</i>

561
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:50,091
<i>and have offered no public response to the
most recent developments in Washington.</i>

562
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:52,211
<i>I'm here with Ayla Sayyad</i>
<i>of the</i> Wall Street Telegraph.

563
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:55,810
<i>I have to begin by saying</i>
<i>that sources on the Hill are telling me</i>

564
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:59,171
<i>that the Judiciary Committee</i>
<i>may bypass debate altogether.</i>

565
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:01,411
<i>No one on the committee has</i>
<i>gone on record about that.</i>

566
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:03,891
<i>But do you think these rumors would be
circulating if there weren't some sort</i>

567
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:07,051
<i>of strong preference to recommend the
articles of impeachment to the House?</i>

568
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:09,491
<i>I think it's safe to assume</i>
<i>there is strong support.</i>

569
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:12,491
<i>Every poll I've seen shows
an overwhelming majority of Americans</i>

570
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:15,251
<i>want this to move forward. I don't think
politicians are going to ignore that.</i>

571
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:18,091
I've talked to a number
of my colleagues already.

572
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:20,090
There is support on my side
of the aisle.

573
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:22,891
- How many do you have?
- Five at this point, including me.

574
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:25,570
That would put us at 60.
We'd still need seven more.

575
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:29,651
You've seen the overnight polls.
He's dipped down into the single digits.

576
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:32,131
Are you willing to make
a public statement with us?

577
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:37,011
I think the country could use a little
bipartisanship right now, don't you?

578
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,292
<i>Do you think they're bluffing?</i>

579
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:41,050
That it's some sort of stunt

580
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,731
to sway the undecideds
in the Senate?

581
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:46,371
Michael Kern is bitter
and small-minded, sir,

582
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:49,771
but he wouldn't have appeared publicly with
Mendoza if they didn't have the numbers.

583
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:51,971
<i>I imagine we're worse off in</i>
<i>the House than we were before.</i>

584
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:55,011
In fact, I had a very productive
conversation with Jackie Sharp.

585
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:57,691
<i>She agreed to stop the attack</i>
<i>if we give her our support</i>

586
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,491
for majority leader after the midterms,
but once Raymond gave his testimony,

587
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,091
she called to say
the deal was off.

588
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:05,771
Raymond really has set us back.

589
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:09,531
<i>- I can't fathom why he lied.</i>
- It's retribution.

590
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:13,252
- For what? The energy crisis?
- <i> No.</i>

591
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:18,931
Did you offer him something?

592
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:21,651
Well, Raymond's testimony hurts,
but it can't finish us off.

593
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,571
It's impossible to prove a lie.

594
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,010
Impeachment is inevitable.

595
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:30,091
Public opinion is the adversary
now. Facts no longer matter.

596
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:33,571
You should give Kern a call.
The personal touch.

597
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:37,332
If he came back to us, it might make
the other Democrats get cold feet.

598
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:42,771
China isn't helping. President Qian won't
return my calls. Beijing must smell death.

599
00:38:42,772 --> 00:38:45,451
They're just exploiting
the situation for leverage.

600
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:49,731
Let's not worry about China for the moment.
One battle at a time, sir.

601
00:38:49,732 --> 00:38:52,531
<i>Maybe I'm finished, Frank.</i>

602
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:55,611
Maybe I need to start accepting
that we won't pull out of this.

603
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:59,810
<i>Mr. President, I know you're tired. I know</i>
<i>this has been hell for you.</i>

604
00:38:59,811 --> 00:39:02,650
And yes, impeachment
would be an awful blow.

605
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:05,011
We'd have to fight tooth
and nail in the Senate.

606
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:09,651
And yes, we'll have to beg and
compromise to regain our political capital.

607
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:14,772
But we have it in us, sir, no matter
how many scars it leaves us with.

608
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:16,930
It's not just us, Frank.

609
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:20,051
It's Tricia, it's my children.

610
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:25,251
I stay awake at night thinking
how much it would crush them,

611
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:27,291
seeing their father hauled off.

612
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,771
Sir, that won't happen,
because I won't let it.

613
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:33,370
If we're confronted by the worst, I'll make
sure you never step foot behind bars.

614
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,052
<i>You have my word on that.</i>

615
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:42,211
He's in the darkness now.
And I'm the only beacon of light.

616
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:45,690
Now we gently guide him
toward the rocks.

617
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:48,931
Mr. President,
you also still have my letter.

618
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:51,650
<i>It's not too late,</i>
<i>if you want to use that option.</i>

619
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:55,330
You're more useful to me
on the Hill than in handcuffs.

620
00:39:55,331 --> 00:40:00,291
I'll call Kern.
<i>- Good night, sir.</i>

621
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:34,010
- How much did Green tell you?
- Enough that I showed up.

622
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:37,491
He probably didn't
mention Rachel Posner.

623
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:40,931
Don't worry, he doesn't know.

624
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:43,371
I do.

625
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:46,451
You have her in an
apartment in Joppa.

626
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:49,731
I have your movements,
I have your text messages,

627
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:53,291
before you destroyed your phone,
but that's more than enough.

628
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:58,611
I'll bet a lot of people would
like to know what she knows.

629
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:01,610
Now you listen
to me very carefully.

630
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:06,451
Whatever you think you've got,
whatever you intend to do with it,

631
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:10,451
I don't respond to extortion
the same way that Green does.

632
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:13,611
What Green promised you...

633
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:16,491
...it can be undone
in a heartbeat.

634
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:19,291
That's why you're here,
to make sure it isn't.

635
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:24,890
You want my protection.

636
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:28,012
I don't trust Green,
or anyone at the bureau.

637
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:36,972
- Who else knows about this?
- No one.

638
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:41,091
Why should I trust you?

639
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:45,412
'Cause we both
have too much to lose, man.

640
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,050
Get dressed.

641
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:12,812
- What are you doing here?
- Put some clothes on.

642
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:17,332
- Why?
- Now. Let's go.

643
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:25,171
Did anyone contact you?

644
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:28,532
- Where are you taking me?
- Answer my question.

645
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:31,971
No, nobody.

646
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:37,251
There's someone
who knows about us,

647
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:39,610
who knows where you are,

648
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:41,731
and when we've met.

649
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:47,891
Are you gonna hurt me?

650
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:50,650
Nothing's going to happen
if you tell the truth.

651
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,972
I am. I haven't been
contacted by anybody.

652
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,771
Stop lying, Rachel.

653
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,771
I will do whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt me...

654
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:05,291
What I want is for you to answer
my questions, so I can help you.

655
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,851
All you have ever done
is fuck up my life!

656
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,170
You fucked up the Fellowship.
You fucked up what I had with Lisa!

657
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,971
Even when I did what you asked!

658
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:15,970
Your sick fucking visits and
reading to you like a fucking child!

659
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,210
What is wrong with you?!

660
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:21,050
Why can't you just leave me be?!
Why do you have to be such a fucking...

661
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,131
Stop!

662
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:07,092
Rachel? Don't be stupid.

663
00:44:16,012 --> 00:44:20,611
Rachel, everything's
going to be fine.

664
00:44:26,491 --> 00:44:29,410
All I've ever done
is try to protect you,

665
00:44:29,411 --> 00:44:31,572
what I'm trying to do now.

666
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:35,850
You have to believe that.

667
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,371
I didn't have to.

668
00:44:38,372 --> 00:44:40,771
It would've been a lot
easier if I didn't.

669
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:46,972
But I did. I did it,
because I...

670
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:54,732
What are you doing?

671
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,131
- Uh!
- Oof!

672
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,931
Yesterday we completed hearings with
regard to articles of impeachment

673
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:21,011
for the president
of the United States.

674
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:23,850
The chair will now entertain
motions from the committee.

675
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,051
- Mr. Chairman. - The chair recognizes
the congressman from Alabama.

676
00:45:28,052 --> 00:45:31,249
I move that we put our
recommendation directly to a vote,

677
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,290
so that debate on this important
matter may take place on the House floor,

678
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,411
open to all 435 members.

679
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:43,691
Are there any objections
to bypassing debate in this committee?

680
00:45:43,692 --> 00:45:45,649
We will now vote
on recommendation of the

681
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,891
articles of impeachment
to the full House.

682
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:50,449
Those in favor of
recommendation say "aye."

683
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,570
- Aye.
- Those opposed?

684
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:55,249
- Nay.
- The "ayes" have it.

685
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,250
This committee officially
recommends articles of impeachment

686
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:00,852
proceed to the House floor.

687
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:20,972
He's here.

688
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:52,330
<i>The vice president is just arriving now</i>
<i>here at Camp David.</i>

689
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:55,210
<i>We expect President Walker</i>
<i>to speak within the hour,</i>

690
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:59,851
<i>announcing his official resignation
as president of the United States.</i>

691
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:15,732
- How are you?
- All right.

692
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:20,450
Mr. President.

693
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:23,411
I have coffee in the kitchen.
Would you like some?

694
00:47:23,412 --> 00:47:25,211
I'm fine.

695
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:38,330
Well, you're about to become the
most powerful man in the free world.

696
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:42,691
- You don't have to do this, sir.
- I spoke to Kern last night.

697
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:46,730
- He's not going to back down.
- So we'll beat him down.

698
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:50,050
No, Frank. My approvals
are at eight percent.

699
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:53,410
Even if I avoid conviction,
I have no mandate to lead, so...

700
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:58,052
...better I step aside with some dignity
so the nation can start to heal.

701
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:06,732
I can never fill
your shoes, sir.

702
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:11,851
You don't have a choice now.

703
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:22,052
Your letter.

704
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:32,290
Well...

705
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:36,332
...shall we go introduce the
46th president of the United States?

706
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:57,451
Effective immediately, I am resigning
the presidency of the United States.

707
00:48:57,452 --> 00:49:01,650
Tricia and I believe that this
is the best course of action,

708
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:04,730
not only for us
and our children,

709
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:06,730
but for country.

710
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:10,051
It's a sad day for us.
I can't deny that.

711
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:12,691
But I take solace in this:

712
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:17,930
Frank Underwood will bring
virtue, experience and courage

713
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:19,810
to the Oval Office.

714
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:22,730
I have been blessed to have him
as my vice president.

715
00:49:22,731 --> 00:49:26,011
But I'm even more blessed
to call him my friend.

716
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:31,690
It has been...

717
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:37,690
...the greatest honor of my life to serve
this country as president.

718
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:40,849
I thank my family, my staff,

719
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,970
and all of those
who have supported me.

720
00:49:43,971 --> 00:49:46,090
Despite the last few months,

721
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:50,690
my faith in this country
has never been stronger.

722
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:52,450
God bless all of you.

723
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:55,771
And God bless
the United States of America.

724
00:49:57,771 --> 00:50:00,171
Thank you, Mr. President.

725
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:18,251
Sir, please raise your
right hand and repeat after me.

726
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:23,129
- "I, Francis J. Underwood..."
- I, Francis J. Underwood...

727
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,732
- "...do solemnly swear..."
- ...do solemnly swear...

728
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:31,411
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

729
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:33,210
Madame Secretary.

730
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:35,569
The rest of the cabinet
is awaiting you at the White House.

731
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,890
We'd like to give you a national
security briefing right away, sir.

732
00:50:37,891 --> 00:50:40,770
I'm aware of the particulars.
Please get Beijing on the phone.

733
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,331
Qian hasn't returned the
president's calls for two days.

734
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,731
Well, there's
a new president now.

735
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:51,090
Please get him on the line.

736
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:55,691
Two hours ago, President Underwood,
in his first act as commander in chief,

737
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:58,809
gave orders to the Seventh Fleet
to vacate Japanese waters.

738
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:02,449
This was a result of a productive
conversation with President Qian,

739
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,010
who gave similar orders to Chinese
naval vessels in the same region.

740
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:09,890
- He moves quick. - Do you mean
with the Chinese, or with Walker?

741
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:12,972
<i>After a grueling night, the four
exiles make their way...</i>

742
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:15,929
- Mr. Feng?
- What is it?

743
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,130
US Justice Department.

744
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:18,769
We need you to come with us.

745
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,570
- Where?
- You're going back to China.

746
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:23,450
- I have asylum.
- No, sir, you don't.

747
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,250
Your asylum has been rescinded.

748
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,609
I have it in writing.
Unconditional and permanent.

749
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,250
Sir, I'm telling you,

750
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,650
your asylum has been rescinded.
Now, please,

751
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:34,611
gather your things
and come with us.

752
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:39,290
Revoking his asylum
will have consequences.

753
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,170
But we're solid
from a legal perspective.

754
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:44,970
Legally, yes. His initial paperwork
hasn't been processed,

755
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:47,930
and we can claim he poses
a threat to our national interests.

756
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:50,610
But it diminishes the integrity
of our State Department.

757
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:55,050
What's more important, Cathy,
integrity or peace?

758
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:59,210
- You know they'll execute him.
- The Chinese are right about one thing:

759
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:02,611
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
the one for the many.

760
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:04,411
Let's get back to Washington.

761
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:16,970
OK, please let me know.
Thanks very much.

762
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:18,770
- Anything?
- Not yet.

763
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:20,810
See if you can track down anyone
from his regular AA meetings.

764
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:22,890
I spoke to the moderator,
he says he hasn't seen

765
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:26,169
Doug in several weeks. I checked all
the hospitals, his landlord...

766
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,970
- Sir, everyone's here.
- When this is all over,

767
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:30,451
I want you to work with
Nancy on finding Doug.

768
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:32,290
I've already alerted
the DC Metro.

769
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:34,850
- They put out an APB on his car.
- We'll find him, sir.

770
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,770
- Claire?
- Just outside.

771
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:38,531
Let's go, Nancy.

772
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:52,291
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President and the First Lady.

773
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,450
Francis.

774
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:41,130
I know your birthday
isn't for a couple of weeks,

775
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,210
- but I got you something.
- What's this?

776
00:53:43,211 --> 00:53:45,050
Open it.

777
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,171
I had a new one made.

778
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,012
- I love you.
- I love you too.

779
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,170
- You go ahead.
- Come on.

780
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:05,930
We earned this together.

781
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,950
Take a few moments
for yourself first.

782
00:54:09,021 --> 00:54:11,137
I'll be out here.

783
00:55:49,256 --> 00:58:06,847
