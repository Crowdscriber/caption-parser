1
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,193
Yo, J, what up, son, where you been?

2
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:15,292
I ain't been nowhere, T.
Just laying low, man.

3
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,192
Now watch, you gonna see
Darnell's little brother...

4
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,493
come on out with that laundry basket.

5
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:24,492
-And the take's in the basket?
-Once in the afternoon, and one at night.

6
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,892
Always the same laundry basket.

7
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,292
How you know?

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,092
That money got to come out somehow, man.

9
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,092
So, we ain't got to blast our way
to the top floor.

10
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,492
We just wait till they're in the street
with their shit.

11
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:43,091
We gonna do them tonight, you heard?
After it get dark.

12
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,490
Just like you say.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,390
Put the basket down now, put it down!

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,891
-Fuck, I said put the basket down!
-Easy girl, chill.

15
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,091
You all niggers, you got caught slipping.

16
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,191
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
because your ass is cute.

17
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,991
But you got got.

18
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,991
Nice, very nice.

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,390
Bitches!

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,690
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

21
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:16,383
No English.

22
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,884
Kunta Kinte...

23
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,684
yabba dabba dabba doo.

24
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:31,584
Mishy gishy gushy gushy
mishy meshy mushy, motherfucker.

25
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:37,883
Negro, you cannot travel
halfway around the world...

26
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:40,083
and not speak any motherfucking English.

27
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,883
English, motherfucker!

28
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:48,783
Two missing, and the rest
ain't saying shit we can understand.

29
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:52,182
I tried to tell you,
with the questions you all are asking.

30
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,182
We step off ship,
English is once again heard, right?

31
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,982
Pretty much, yeah.

32
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:03,083
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.

33
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:06,582
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.

34
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,981
-You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
-Some.

35
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,082
Usually after a pay,
which we made in Norfolk.

36
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:16,582
Choksey actually asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.

37
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:22,081
Nothing here in the way of ID papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.

38
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,381
Anybody else ask for any advances
while you were at sea?

39
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,080
-More than usual.
-Yeah?

40
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,381
A few of them were coming back
day after day, scripting more and more cash.

41
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,981
We figured they were
gambling down in the holds.

42
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,881
And maybe not, right?

43
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,081
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom, outside.

44
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,380
-Did you check that bay?
-I did.

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,080
It's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.

46
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,580
No sign of anything
except a fresh stack of containers.

47
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,579
I'm not gonna lie to you. If you hold us
another day and bring in interpreters...

48
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,479
they're still not gonna say a thing.

49
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,879
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.

50
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:12,778
Sit up, Nicky,
we got paying customers waiting.

51
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,579
Ashley, sit down.

52
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,178
You think I cut it too short?

53
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,279
Just don't make me look funny.

54
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,078
Ashley's preschool called.

55
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:33,077
-They want more money?
-Just what we owe them.

56
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:35,977
-And her teacher says that--
-Teacher?

57
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,378
-They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.
-Whatever.

58
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,876
Ashley's been talking in class
about how Mom and Dad don't live together.

59
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,477
Who asks her about that?

60
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,777
No one asks, she just talks.

61
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,677
Kids notice stuff like that.
They talk, you know?

62
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,477
By the time she's in elementary school,
it's going to be an issue.

63
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:56,377
Time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.

64
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,476
You said that last Christmas.

65
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:01,676
Christ, Aimee!
You pulling it out or cutting it?

66
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:03,876
Listen, Nicky.

67
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:07,776
You want to go get to someplace better,
I'm with you.

68
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:12,577
You wanna keep on like this,
then I got to rethink stuff.

69
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,275
Do what you feel.

70
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:23,076
As soon as I start getting more hours,
the first thing I do is get my own place.

71
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,575
You wanna move in with me, great.

72
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:28,876
You don't want to,
at least I did my goddamn best.

73
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:44,174
You want a streak or something?
I could put a little purple in it.

74
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:46,475
Yeah, and right after that...

75
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:50,174
I'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.

76
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:21,872
Got you good, huh?

77
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,773
You think?

78
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:29,872
No, I mean, not really.

79
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:33,172
Not if Evidence Control
is the posting you want.

80
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:37,871
-Sorry, Lieutenant.
-Fuck it, right?

81
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:42,071
We brought in the case at least.
Heard you were on the boat.

82
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:44,872
Ain't so bad.

83
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,171
How's Kima?

84
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,472
She's inside.

85
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,771
Asset Forfeiture.
And she's second year pre-law.

86
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:58,071
Housecat. That ain't her.

87
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,571
-This coming back?
-Yeah.

88
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,271
It's the Gant case right there.

89
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:07,071
Nathan looked over our weak shit...

90
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,670
told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.

91
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,971
-You got a line on him lately?
-I haven't a clue.

92
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:15,270
Last thing I did
was put him on a bus to New York.

93
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,770
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.

94
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,369
A year or two,
you'll be back in their favor, right?

95
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:27,869
Year or two, and I'll be a lawyer.

96
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,669
I got 22 years in.
I'm putting the papers in this week.

97
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,569
You're gone?

98
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,370
What the hell am I doing down here
with a law degree, right?

99
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:41,868
You take care, McNulty.

100
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,868
You, too.

101
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:12,967
Kimmy, all I'm trying to say is,
if you'd stop lighting up all the damn time...

102
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,867
-maybe you'd understand--
-I'm gonna light up regardless.

103
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,767
-It took us too long.
-You know I love you, but if your ass...

104
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,667
don't get to finishing counting
all my motherfucking money....

105
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:25,467
-Shit, you know I love you, but damn.
-Almost five.

106
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,766
We got them motherfuckers good.

107
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,967
Let's see them motherfuckers slip next time.

108
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,665
Who the fuck is you?

109
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:38,366
-Omar come a-calling.
-Omar? Shit.

110
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:41,866
Ain't that nigger dead?
I heard them project niggers lit him up.

111
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:44,865
No, I heard they ran his ass up
out of this town.

112
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:49,966
Spread the word, darling, Omar back.

113
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,666
Look at the way
Crutchfield spelled "prostrate."

114
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,966
Look at it.

115
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,365
"The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor."

116
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:09,865
"Prostate on the floor."
That's a victim, all right.

117
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,465
That hurts bad.

118
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,265
I love this job, I do.

119
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,364
-You want to hear about Philly, Sarge?
-Just the dirty parts.

120
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:21,664
The ship's a dead end.
The cargo bay that held our container...

121
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,064
is full of new boxes,
nothing to recover there.

122
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:27,864
And all them sailors, they lied to us
in every language past English.

123
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:29,263
Gibbering motherfuckers.

124
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,464
Sailing up the coast right now,
laughing at us.

125
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:33,564
Is that it?

126
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,363
Two guys jumped ship.
We'll put out teletypes...

127
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:38,563
in case that has
anything to do with anything.

128
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,663
One of them left his gear, and we kept that.

129
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:44,263
-Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
-Because it is.

130
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:47,563
But your suspect
had to be on the boat, right?

131
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,163
And your boat has sailed.

132
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:52,463
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?

133
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:56,162
Hold the ship while we chat up
a crew of 40 in 53 dialects? Come on.

134
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:59,263
If that isn't the plan, what is?

135
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,062
-Officer....
-Russell.

136
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,462
I am informed that you are detailed
to this case...

137
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,962
as a liaison with the port police.

138
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,860
I also understand
that you are the only help...

139
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,461
that your department is sending.

140
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,660
That so?

141
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:31,661
Although there is some small charm
to a woman in uniform...

142
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:34,860
the fact remains
we work plainclothes in Homicide.

143
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,861
Which is not to say
that the clothes need be plain.

144
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:41,859
For you, I would suggest some pantsuits,
perhaps muted in color.

145
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,960
Something to offset Det. Moreland's
pinstriped lawyerly affectations...

146
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,561
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Det. Freamon.

147
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,760
Rawls is watching on this one.

148
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.

149
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,059
Tweedy impertinence?

150
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,660
-I like that.
-You know what I'm saying?

151
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:11,558
-It's not here, Major.
-I can see that. Where is it?

152
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:13,959
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.

153
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:17,159
The vehicle log says
they parked it at 22:00 hours...

154
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,058
returning the keys to the OIC.

155
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,359
-And?
-We have the keys.

156
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,859
But not the van?

157
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,657
Are you telling me that a fully equipped...

158
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:32,257
$1 20,000 surveillance van...

159
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:35,857
assigned to the southeastern district
cannot be located?

160
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:56,557
-Around the world....
-In 880 days.

161
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:17,255
-Do we have a plan?
-A plan?

162
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:21,155
-For targeting this guy, Sobotka.
-I don't know.

163
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,356
Maybe find out where his union hangs...

164
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,556
go down there with a CI or two,
make some hand-to-hands.

165
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:31,655
-How about some DNRs on his phones?
-DNRs?

166
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:34,655
See who he's calling,
and look for any kind of pattern.

167
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:37,055
Hand-to-hands for now, I think.

168
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:11,953
600 series, and that's it.

169
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:14,952
That's right.

170
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,953
This is too nice a block for a prison guard.

171
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:21,153
Shit, you couldn't pay me enough
to work in no prison, man.

172
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:24,052
Yeah, right, no.
I want you to drop all the cellular joints.

173
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:29,052
-Yeah, all of them, Nokia, Motorola.
-Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.

174
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,652
All right, so call me, yeah.

175
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:35,352
String, why you so down
on the phone companies, man?

176
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:38,751
While back, I took a stroll through the Pit.

177
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:41,951
I saw that kid
we got running things down there, Poot.

178
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:46,552
He got the cell phone I gave him
for the business, right there on his hip...

179
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,752
but the nigger got another cell phone
that only ring when the pussy called.

180
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:53,351
Now, if this no-count nigger
got two cell phones...

181
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:57,051
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them motherfuckers?

182
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:59,451
That's market saturation.

183
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,651
Look here.

184
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,051
That Tilghman right there.

185
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,549
-Dressed like a prison guard and all.
-Yeah, I see him.

186
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,850
Steel door.
The boy on the step is all, though.

187
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,650
Stump is sitting in the front room window,
staring at the damn television.

188
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,849
-You all could see that from the step?
-There in his damn drawers.

189
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,450
Shut up, dog!

190
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,149
Rat make that trash, he home free.

191
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,949
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.

192
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:52,049
I got $20 on Mr. Rat. Anyone fade me?

193
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,249
Move along. Come on, get there.

194
00:15:57,848 --> 00:15:59,748
$100 says it ain't over.

195
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:02,148
Shit, I got to take easy money.

196
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,348
What the fuck?

197
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:11,148
-Motherfucker.
-Sounds about over now, though.

198
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,947
How the hell you know
what the rat gonna do?

199
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,047
Junk do know his varmints.

200
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:35,446
Yeah.

201
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,046
What's wrong with you, boy?

202
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:48,145
Look, I done told you before, man.
Those two babies don't move me that way.

203
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:51,046
If I come up with a plan
to do Stump without them...

204
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,845
you cut them loose?

205
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,546
Now you gone and got strategic on me?

206
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:59,145
We do like last time,
and wait for him to come out.

207
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:03,146
Only problem is,
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.

208
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:09,344
So, he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what I'm saying?

209
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,945
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.

210
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,544
Steel door, right?

211
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,744
What's it gonna take
for you to be convinced, man?

212
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,744
I don't bag no babies.

213
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,144
What you think?

214
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:54,142
You gonna have to do better than that.

215
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,642
Indeed.

216
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:08,142
Thinking, maybe do a quarter this time,
if it's not too much.

217
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,541
That a problem?

218
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,242
No.

219
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,742
I'm just saying, you back right quick with it.

220
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:22,342
It ain't like them motherfuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?

221
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:26,442
-The shit is everyday, man.
-Sounds right. It count right, too?

222
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,940
Boy'll bring it to you outside.

223
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,641
There's Tilghman.

224
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,940
So, his shit coming from Butchie then?

225
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,540
-All right.
-Lying Butchie.

226
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:02,640
-Santa's elves are short.
-Santa's elves aren't real.

227
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,139
The elves in Lord of the Rings
are, like, real elves.

228
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,940
-Real elves?
-They should be short, then.

229
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,840
Dwarves are short, hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.

230
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,839
If you weren't too scared to watch the movie
then you'd know all about it, doofus.

231
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,139
Bite me, dickbreath.

232
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,139
-Sean, knock it off.
-He started it.

233
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,138
Okay, upstairs right away,
brush your teeth, pajamas.

234
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:27,239
It's a school night, Sean.

235
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,138
Can I tuck them in?

236
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,938
My lawyer's gonna be
sending you something in the mail.

237
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,738
-You're kidding.
-It's not a divorce, it's an agreement.

238
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,737
-A separation agreement.
-A separation agreement?

239
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:46,337
Just read it. Okay? It's for the both of us.

240
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:47,938
It's to protect the both of us.

241
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:49,536
This is about what?

242
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:51,537
It's just....

243
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:55,138
You should just read it, okay?

244
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:00,337
Okay.

245
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:20,235
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothing.

246
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:25,036
-Zig, I don't know why I fucking bother.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

247
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:28,035
One ship today, nothing yesterday.

248
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,435
Wait for Thursday,
a couple ROIROs hit the berth...

249
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:33,136
and congratu-fucking-lations,
you grab a day.

250
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,034
Friday's quiet again.

251
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,435
Look at it this way, you know,
at least you get the day off.

252
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:41,035
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.

253
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:48,235
I can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if I'm gonna get paid.

254
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,734
I got a kid, right? I got a fucking kid...

255
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,833
and a girl that wants
to get married, for Christ's sake.

256
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,634
What the fuck you wanna get married for?

257
00:20:57,934 --> 00:20:59,535
Not saying I do.

258
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:03,134
But fuck if I even could,
without no pot to piss in.

259
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,733
Aimee is like, "What's the plan," you know?

260
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,432
And I'm down here
wondering if I'm gonna get a day or two.

261
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,534
Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?

262
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:21,433
That's your problem, Zig,
one of them, anyway.

263
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,833
You let that thing of yours lead you around.

264
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,833
You know me, whiskey, cock, and 5:00.

265
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,933
-Just get off me.
-Nicky, look.

266
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:31,632
If it's money that you're worried about, shit.

267
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:34,733
Let's pool a few dollars together.

268
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:37,933
I'll get us hooked up
with a little llello, you know...

269
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,932
turn it around this morning,
we make more money before lunch...

270
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:42,832
than we can down here all week.

271
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,832
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

272
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,332
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

273
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,931
so that I get popped for pocket change.

274
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:52,632
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.

275
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:56,730
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll think of something.

276
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:04,732
1 1900 on that one.

277
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:08,431
We're looking for 14580, by the manifest.

278
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,831
Can't be, the numbers don't go that high.

279
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,630
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.

280
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:14,730
Yeah?

281
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,930
Why have anything
other than fake companies...

282
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,230
and addresses on the manifest
if you're moving a can with contraband?

283
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,730
And on the other end, too, right?

284
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,430
You can work it back through customs,
but chances are...

285
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,530
this box wasn't picked up anywhere
near this Rue de Rivoli address...

286
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,829
in Le Havre, France.

287
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:37,529
Hell, there might not even
be a Rue de Rivoli in that town.

288
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,728
A can full of dead girls,
sent to nowhere from nowhere.

289
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:14,428
-He been good business for me, though.
-Yeah?

290
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:16,428
Two, three quarters a week.

291
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,027
Mr. Tilghman's money always right,
always on time.

292
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:21,827
That's why we coming to you for the setup.

293
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:23,928
-You the man to him.
-I'm just saying.

294
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:27,427
I know, the money, and you know
we gonna find a way to make that right.

295
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:30,428
But like I said, I'm not asking for myself.

296
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,327
Now I'm asking for my man.

297
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:38,226
-Avon's call?
-Wouldn't be here otherwise.

298
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:44,127
-Avon is Avon.
-Always.

299
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:52,026
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.

300
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:55,525
That'll work.

301
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,626
You see what I'm saying, right?

302
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:07,525
It makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.

303
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:11,525
You go all that way to dump it on your boss,
and now you're worrying yourself.

304
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,825
-It's got me thinking is all.
-It's a little late for that, McNulty.

305
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:18,426
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the other ones in the can?

306
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:22,323
-If you're right and she isn't local, then--
-She's definitely not local.

307
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:24,124
The low level of mercury viscosity...

308
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:27,024
in the amalgam restorations
says Eastern Europe.

309
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:30,024
-If you say so.
-Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.

310
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:33,324
Eastern Europe?
Can you narrow it down some?

311
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:38,523
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary sometime last year.

312
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:40,623
How'd you know that?

313
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,823
They bought tits there.

314
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:47,324
Three of the girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.

315
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:49,023
We pulled the lot and serial numbers...

316
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:53,323
and they trace back to an outpatient
plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.

317
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:56,423
Would you call them?
Might pull an ID from patient records.

318
00:24:56,522 --> 00:25:00,022
The best they could tell me is the implants
were used some time this fall.

319
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:03,022
Three girls, three surgeries,
same clinic, right?

320
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:05,223
-What else?
-What else?

321
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:08,022
-Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
-Okay, you're a fucking god.

322
00:25:08,222 --> 00:25:11,722
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr. Frazier, sir.

323
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:15,321
You have to admit that whole
Budapest thing was a hell of a pull.

324
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:18,922
-Where's the paperwork on this cat?
-I got it over here.

325
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:20,522
So go on, what else?

326
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:24,321
Not much, except the swabs show
that at least seven of the girls in the box...

327
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:27,320
had vaginal intercourse
within 24 hours of death.

328
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:30,222
Two had anal and six came back positive
on the oral.

329
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,920
You tell Cole about all this?

330
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,521
I sent the findings off to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case, brother.

331
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,422
-No, who is?
-It's your man, Bunk.

332
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,520
And that older guy, his partner, they ate it.

333
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,221
Thanks.

334
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,219
I told you, I brought you a soda.

335
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,719
That better?

336
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:06,020
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.

337
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,320
-Okay?
-Okay.

338
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,820
I'll take care of you.

339
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,218
Mr. Stump!

340
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:43,318
Them boys been teasing Chantelle again.

341
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:54,817
You know it.

342
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:09,013
-Morning.
-Morning.

343
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,813
-Bobby, how you been?
-Not bad.

344
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:20,014
-Working the tier today?
-Yeah, on J.

345
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:27,313
-Have a good one.
-Yeah, you, too.

346
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:30,413
You happy now, bitch?

347
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,913
How was I gonna know
Landsman would pull Cole...

348
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,413
and stick you guys?

349
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,312
You right here with them?

350
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,813
-What did he call Cole?
-"Collateral damage."

351
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:41,812
I'm feeling pretty damn collateral myself,
I got to say.

352
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:45,511
Which is why I went to see Dr. Frazier
and work some things out in my head.

353
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:48,912
Officer McNulty could've
paid this thing no mind, but no.

354
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:51,513
When his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.

355
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,712
Did you see the preliminary?

356
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:56,812
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.

357
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:59,911
No IDs, no passports, no visas,
no real money.

358
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:02,010
And they're coming
across the water like that.

359
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,311
-Yeah.
-McNulty has a theory.

360
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:08,412
-Does he now?
-You deductive motherfucker, you.

361
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:11,911
So he's gonna wander in here
with some Johnny-come-lately bullshit...

362
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:15,111
about how these girls
are all coming over here as prostitutes...

363
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,309
talking about how if they ain't got the cash
to travel better than a container ship...

364
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:22,111
then they sure don't have the money
for a plastic surgeon.

365
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:25,111
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water...

366
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:28,810
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat-down.

367
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,610
But why she got beat?
He's gonna ask us that, like we don't know.

368
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,809
He's gonna answer his own question,
saying her swabs are negative, right?

369
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:40,209
Fuck or fight with all them sailor boys,
and she fought.

370
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,110
So, it got a little rough.

371
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,410
She gets banged around,
she comes up dead.

372
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,409
And then somebody panics,
tosses her in the harbor overnight...

373
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:49,709
before the ship ties up.

374
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,109
But the other girls saw.

375
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:54,509
So now, the other girls,
they get told to get back in that can.

376
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,108
And our man, to cover this shit up...

377
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,109
he gets up on top
and bangs down the air pipe.

378
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:07,107
-Anything else you want to tell us?
-When did you guys get there?

379
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:11,108
Yesterday, when the ship's first mate
told us that while the ship was at sea...

380
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:14,007
half the crew came to him
for advances on their salary.

381
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:16,708
They had one hell of a dice game
going on below deck...

382
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,707
or the boys popped them girls
out of that can.

383
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:20,108
You talk to the crew?

384
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,307
-In what language?
-Crime scene?

385
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:24,407
-Nope.
-Anybody missing?

386
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:27,307
Two guys jumped ship.
One in Philly, one in Norfolk.

387
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,308
But that shit happens all the time,
apparently.

388
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:35,106
-Got yourself a hell of a case.
-Fuck you very much.

389
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:38,707
You know what happens to all the girls
if you don't ID them?

390
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:41,906
Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.
Then a crematorium.

391
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,107
Then that mass grave out at Crownsville.

392
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,707
That bothers you?

393
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:47,407
Yeah, a little.

394
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:48,807
Me, too.

395
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:59,605
-Thanks for hosting this, Father.
-Hope it helps.

396
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:02,205
You guys have really done
the background on this.

397
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:05,306
This is more presence
than the port unions have shown in years.

398
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:08,904
-Is the governor listening?
-It's now or never for us.

399
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:11,704
And not just the grain pier,
but with the dredging.

400
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:14,306
I don't care
what the Corps of Engineers' study says.

401
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,005
-The fact remains--
-Excuse me, Bobby.

402
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:19,805
I just need him to work
the other side of the room on something.

403
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,104
You're wasting time here.

404
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:26,904
Bobby's District 7, which is middle river...

405
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:30,304
which means every vote he gets
is somebody with some port connection.

406
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:32,404
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.

407
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,704
The guys you need to be working
are the guys...

408
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:37,404
who wouldn't have come
if we hadn't been throwing money at them.

409
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:40,403
-Like who?
-Like John Carney, from Anne Arundel.

410
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:43,703
Liz Tobin, from Montgomery.
Clay Davis, from over Westside.

411
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:46,603
Keep hold of them,
some of your stuff stays in the budgets.

412
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,303
-And they're with us?
-Carney is pretty firm.

413
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:52,403
Liz will stay solid if the environmentalists
don't get to her.

414
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:56,702
Clay Davis...that guy, you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.

415
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:58,203
What do you mean?

416
00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:01,702
I mean, we've given forty large
to the Westside Democratic Organization...

417
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:03,502
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

418
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:03,902
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

419
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,703
We spent $40,000 on that guy?

420
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:09,404
Worth it, if he lets your projects
sail through the conference committee.

421
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:13,301
-Forty fuckin' thousand?
-Am I your lobbyist? Are you paying me?

422
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:15,802
Trust me. With the players in this room...

423
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:19,003
the presiding officers and a little help
from the governor's office...

424
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,602
we might squeeze some things out
this session.

425
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:23,401
Now, go make nice.

426
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,400
-Senator Davis.
-Excuse me.

427
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,601
Hey, partner.

428
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:37,900
People tell me
it just might be a good year for the port.

429
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:39,301
Might be.

430
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,101
You all have been stepping up
in a lot of ways.

431
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:46,800
Hope it continues like that.
You all making friends in a lot of places?

432
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,700
We're friendly guys.

433
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,300
So they came back murders?

434
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,600
I admit, I didn't see that coming at all.

435
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,900
Who could've seen that?

436
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,900
For whoever was having
these girls brought over...

437
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,500
-the net loss is in the millions.
-That much?

438
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,199
One of these girls on the circuit,
going club-to-club on the East Coast...

439
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,799
can bring in half a million
over the next two years.

440
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,300
And that's just
for club work and prostitution.

441
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,999
-So somebody messed up.
-In a big way.

442
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,399
You guys called it.
No such address in Le Havre.

443
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,199
Or for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.

444
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,398
The name and ID of the driver
who signed the bill of lading...

445
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:35,998
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.

446
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,899
Dead ends either way.

447
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,998
The girls, they know
what they're coming over for?

448
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:42,197
Some do.

449
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:44,898
Some get told they're gonna dance,
or be secretaries.

450
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:48,399
You gotta understand, they're coming
from places that don't have much.

451
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:50,797
Romania, Moldavia, Russia, Albania.

452
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:54,197
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.

453
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,297
50,000? Jesus.

454
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:59,597
They need a whole new agency
just to police them.

455
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:01,697
What they need is a union.

456
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:07,097
-To Stan and Kate.
-Stan and Kate.

457
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:11,196
Happy anniversary!

458
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:14,297
Thanks a lot.

459
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,496
-Good time here?
-Yeah.

460
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,596
How is my detail coming?

461
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,796
Lt. Grayson is on top of things, right?

462
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,096
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.

463
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:33,496
-It's gonna take a while.
-You think?

464
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,596
Why? What are you doing?

465
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:38,895
Not much.

466
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:43,595
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.

467
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:46,095
We're not collecting tag numbers
or anything.

468
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:49,095
We're not looking for patterns at all.
And that's the thing.

469
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:51,395
I'm trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.

470
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:54,494
If you go in with the idea
you're gonna eat around the edges...

471
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:55,894
you never get a meal.

472
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:59,295
With Barksdale, Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kinds of stuff.

473
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:01,995
DMV records, phone logs,
corporate charter stuff...

474
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:03,794
political campaign contributions.

475
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,094
If Burrell didn't
break the case down so fast...

476
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:09,894
we would've brought back $3 or $4 million
in downtown real estate...

477
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:12,993
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.

478
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:17,693
We were deep, really deep.
I've been trying to tell you.

479
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:22,893
If it wasn't for Burrell,
that would've been a major case.

480
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:37,394
-String.
-You know, I just came to check up on you.

481
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:41,193
-See how you holding it down.
-I'm all right.

482
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:44,593
-Where the little man at?
-I just put him down.

483
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,392
You want something to drink?

484
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:57,392
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?

485
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,291
I'm sure he do.

486
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:05,890
You just reminded me about something.

487
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:20,190
Tag's still on it.

488
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:24,390
He bought it
before he got stopped in Jersey.

489
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,390
Never been worn.

490
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,891
You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.

491
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:37,490
You know,
you can give away the man's clothes...

492
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,090
but that don't make him gone, right?

493
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,390
I ain't forget him.

494
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,489
You ain't been to see him
much neither, though.

495
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,790
-It's been hard.
-It's been hard?

496
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,389
It's been hard on him, too.

497
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:49,590
A lot of bad things
caught up in a man's head...

498
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:52,689
when he's on lock-down.
Man need to see his baby mama.

499
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,189
Need to see his child, too.

500
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:57,289
Only one thing he needs to be secure about,
and if not...

501
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:01,489
then he might start thinking
he can't do that time...

502
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,788
and then we all got problems.

503
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,888
You understand me?

504
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,688
How you set here?

505
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:11,888
The apartment, the car,
the money's all right?

506
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:15,088
-It's good.
-It's good?

507
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:18,588
I know it's good.

508
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:22,487
But you know what I'm talking about, right?

509
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:26,688
We all got a job to do, and your job
is to let D'Angelo know we still family.

510
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:30,687
It's important.

511
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:40,886
I'm an XL.

512
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:47,087
No doubt.

513
00:38:45,384 --> 00:38:48,084
-Your round, Jimmy.
-Jesus.

514
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:50,383
I'm gonna owe the baby-sitter
half my salary...

515
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:52,583
if I don't throw myself out of here right now.

516
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:54,684
-You got kids?
-Two.

517
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:58,282
-Daddy working late, too?
-Not a day in his goddamn life.

518
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:02,483
You barely made a dent.

519
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,682
Good night, gents.

520
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:08,583
-Good night.
-Good night.

521
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:11,883
-What's that about?
-I don't know.

522
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:17,081
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

523
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:19,682
-Solve the fucking case?
-Not a shot.

524
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:25,682
-I'm gonna give this one a name.
-A name?

525
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,982
She's not going
out to Crownsville, this one.

526
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:33,182
-Not on me, she's not.
-So what are you gonna do with her?

527
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:37,181
Pay for a box and a mortician
and ship her back to Bumfuck, Europe?

528
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,582
No, I'm gonna find where her people at.

529
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:43,881
How does that matter?
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.

530
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:47,480
This is that little altar-boy-guilt talking.

531
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,680
What the fuck I got to feel guilty about?

532
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,680
Let me count the ways.

533
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:57,980
Good morning, Major.

534
00:40:21,678 --> 00:40:23,279
What the....

535
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:30,279
Wilmington? Son of a bitch!

536
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,878
-Frank?
-Ring, how's it hanging?

537
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:43,378
Not so good.

538
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,478
-Not right now.
-Yeah?

539
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:51,578
I'm late on my dues. You know that, right?

540
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:53,077
You're late, yeah.

541
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:57,077
And I'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick
two blocks from the house...

542
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:59,277
hoping for a lazy repo man.

543
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:00,978
That bad?

544
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:05,077
I know you ain't been getting hours,
it's been slow.

545
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:07,476
Five days last month.

546
00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:09,476
-That's all.
-Is that all?

547
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:13,176
Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.

548
00:41:14,076 --> 00:41:16,676
-I'm gonna go with 47.
-Do me a favor.

549
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:19,477
Frank, you been fair,
I ain't saying otherwise.

550
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:23,975
It's just there's 60 checkers above me
with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.

551
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:26,475
Do me a favor.
Go down Clement Street tonight...

552
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:30,476
give this to Dolores,
tell her you need a beer and a shot on me.

553
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:34,176
Just do that much.
You have a round on me, you go home.

554
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:38,276
You wanna come in tomorrow, tell me
you're going with 47, I'm with you on it.

555
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:41,375
Thanks.

556
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:01,074
Lane 4, you got a trucker's code and tag.

557
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:12,874
Pick me a winner, Johnny.

558
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:32,573
-You're ugly enough to be a teamster.
-Lick me, you whore.

559
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:37,773
It'll be up on wheels. K-row, slot 1 22.

560
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:40,473
Roger that.

561
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,673
Look, misdelivery.

562
00:42:57,973 --> 00:43:00,372
Can was supposed to go ashore at Norfolk.

563
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:04,972
-Yeah, where you want it?
-I'm gonna need it on wheels at K-1 22.

564
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:07,672
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.

565
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,768
Wrong box, misdelivery.

566
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:19,969
No need to count, Butch.

567
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:22,268
-My shit always right.
-Hearing.

568
00:44:22,468 --> 00:44:23,867
Hearing is believing.

569
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:32,467
Boy'll meet you outside
when you ready to roll.

570
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:34,067
I'm ready now.

571
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,966
No, dog. Not from me you don't.

572
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,166
Later, Butchie.

573
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,867
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.

574
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:54,665
Afraid not.

575
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:08,665
Who you like better?
Ultimate Spiderman or regular Spiderman?

576
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:13,165
-What's the difference?
-See, I'll have to teach you everything.

577
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:24,966
Excuse me, gents.

578
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:31,765
What's up, man? How you liking the library?

579
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,165
It'll do.

580
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:38,365
It's easy on you.

581
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:42,463
I know a lot of people put in for the gig,
but the gig go to you.

582
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:44,463
Funny how that go.

583
00:45:45,364 --> 00:45:47,664
So you want me to say thanks?

584
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:49,663
You ain't got to say shit.

585
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:52,265
But you need to take heed
of what can be done for you...

586
00:45:52,365 --> 00:45:54,063
if you keep your head straight.

587
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:56,563
You're just full of favors, ain't you?

588
00:45:57,764 --> 00:46:01,363
You shut your mouth and open your mind...

589
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:05,163
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.

590
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,363
Just like I'm only gonna do
a year or two on this seven.

591
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:11,062
-Feel me?
-I got priors.

592
00:46:11,162 --> 00:46:15,862
Best I can do is half.
That's 10. I can count to 10.

593
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:20,461
Some shit is coming down, Dee, okay?
You need to think.

594
00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:24,662
You need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.

595
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:27,062
Man, my head is where I want it.

596
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,562
-You look dusty lately.
-So what?

597
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:32,661
What, you my mom up in here now?

598
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,061
That's the weak man's road you're taking.

599
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,161
I ain't never seen you as weak.

600
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:46,062
Look, I'm just, you know,
every now and again.

601
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:49,761
That's all I got
to get my head up out of this shithole.

602
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:52,461
Ain't no more than that?
Because if that's all it is...

603
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:54,861
you should be able
to give it a rest for a few days.

604
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:58,660
-Because it ain't no thing, right?
-Yeah, it ain't no thing.

605
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,760
Then you gonna do that?

606
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,559
I'm asking you, man, out of love.

607
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,460
There's always love, Dee.

608
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,360
All right. Yeah.

609
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:22,959
A few days. Sure, a few days.

610
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:25,759
Right.

611
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,457
All right, what have you got?

612
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:19,956
All digital. Four megapix,
16 megs of memory...

613
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:23,657
3X optical, 4X digital zoom.
That's brand new on the market.

614
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:25,657
That's the Cadillac of cameras right there.

615
00:48:25,757 --> 00:48:27,255
-How many?
-400.

616
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:32,356
-You are talking a big number.
-That's showtime. This ain't the WNBA.

617
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:35,557
I'm thinking with these features,
this brand...

618
00:48:35,656 --> 00:48:38,756
I can get, maybe, $350 each at retail.

619
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:41,455
-All right, cool.
-Nope, not cool.

620
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:42,556
$500.

621
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:46,355
Yeah, I've been calling
some of the local chain stores.

622
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:48,355
You know, Best Buy, Circuit City.

623
00:48:48,455 --> 00:48:52,056
This model goes for $550,
$500 when they're on sale.

624
00:48:52,856 --> 00:48:55,655
Okay, $500.

625
00:48:56,255 --> 00:48:59,555
-Times 400 units, that comes to--
-That's $200,000.

626
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:02,255
What are you looking for?

627
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:06,055
Twenty percent. There's three of us.

628
00:49:07,054 --> 00:49:08,855
I want a woman with thin ankles.

629
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:12,254
But I'm going to go home tonight,
and there's going to be my wife.

630
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:15,554
Eight percent. $16,000.

631
00:49:15,854 --> 00:49:19,054
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.

632
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:23,554
$20,000. Upfront.

633
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:29,054
Because I like you.

634
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:32,653
Look at that.
It's a Kodak moment in the house.

635
00:49:37,554 --> 00:49:40,053
I got to run this by my people.

636
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:42,653
They okay it, I'm going to give you a call.

637
00:49:43,753 --> 00:49:45,153
All right, cool.

638
00:49:52,452 --> 00:49:54,353
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

639
00:49:55,852 --> 00:49:59,452
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?

640
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:03,552
-Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
-I'll see it and raise you back.

641
00:50:04,352 --> 00:50:06,551
-Talk to me, Augie.
-Ten-hut.

642
00:50:11,252 --> 00:50:12,851
Where's the lieutenant?

643
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,251
He's on the street.

644
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,749
I'm not a politician.
I wouldn't even know how to count votes.

645
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,550
Maybe they know it's our time.

646
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:42,949
Tony.

647
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,750
Too soon to call you Commissioner?

648
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:50,649
Excuse me one sec.

649
00:50:53,048 --> 00:50:55,549
-You sent me humps.
-Major?

650
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:58,249
You sent me a detail of humps, Ervin.

651
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:02,149
-We can discuss this tomorrow.
-No, I think we discuss it now...

652
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:05,550
or I'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni...

653
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,249
to vote against this goddamn coronation.

654
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:11,748
And more than that, I'm gonna talk
some shit to some of my friends...

655
00:51:11,848 --> 00:51:14,548
about what happened
at the end of the Barksdale case.

656
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:15,649
You hear me on that?

657
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:18,948
The Barksdale case
was a successful prosecution.

658
00:51:19,048 --> 00:51:21,848
Up until our people
tried to chase the cash, maybe.

659
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:26,048
We have a quorum, I believe.
Council members can take their seats now.

660
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:32,948
Tell you what, Deputy.
You probably still got enough votes...

661
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,448
but I can make it uglier than you want it.

662
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:36,848
What do you want, Stan?

663
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:41,447
I want a real detail,
with real police and a real unit commander.

664
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,047
Fine, done.

665
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:45,347
Give me that black lieutenant
that did Barksdale.

666
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:48,747
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.

667
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:53,347
Did he meet the pension board yet?
I suggest you talk to the man.

668
00:51:53,548 --> 00:51:56,246
-I'll do what I can.
-Don't fuck with me, Erv.

669
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,846
I got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.

670
00:51:58,946 --> 00:52:02,146
And with what I'm learning
about the Barksdale case...

671
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,745
I got all kinds of shit I can throw.

672
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:22,745
-Lock-down in 20.
-All right.

673
00:53:06,842 --> 00:53:08,643
What's up, lce?

674
00:53:10,743 --> 00:53:14,944
-You done with that Green Lantern?
-You can read it, but I want it back.

675
00:53:15,544 --> 00:53:18,142
-You hit Dee?
-Dee ain't up.

676
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:24,042
Four hundred good cameras, Spiros.

677
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,242
Who brought them in?

678
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:33,042
The young stevedore, Niko,
and that idiot cousin of his.

679
00:53:39,242 --> 00:53:41,242
And I think he uses, too.

680
00:53:42,842 --> 00:53:44,141
Stefanos.

681
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,741
I don't give a damn nothing about him.

682
00:53:49,841 --> 00:53:53,141
Listen, I'm paying 10 cents
on the dollar for the cameras.

683
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:55,641
We're going to clear $180,000.

684
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,841
-What about Niko?
-He's smart.

685
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,041
Make the deal.

686
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:12,140
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?

687
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,439
-What?
-You're acting normal.

688
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,940
You know what, Dolores?
I made money today.

689
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,039
Yeah? What ship was in?

690
00:54:24,939 --> 00:54:25,939
Hey, Zig.

691
00:54:28,939 --> 00:54:30,939
Shot and a beer, Dolores.

692
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:34,340
Frank Sobotka says I needed it.

693
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,239
Thanks.

694
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:57,337
-What's this?
-Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.

695
00:55:02,237 --> 00:55:04,637
-Sure?
-It ain't mine, for Christ's sake.

696
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:07,638
If you don't take it, someone else is gonna.

697
00:55:18,237 --> 00:55:20,337
Your pop's a good man, Zig.

698
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,335
Yo, up here!

699
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:24,134
T.C., what's up?

700
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,533
What's going on?

701
00:56:27,633 --> 00:56:31,833
-They falling out, four that I seen.
-What?

702
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:39,133
What the fuck is going on?

703
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,733
Bad package. Hot shots.
