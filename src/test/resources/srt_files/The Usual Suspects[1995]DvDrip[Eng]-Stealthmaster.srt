1
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,458
How are you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,020
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,701
...Keyser.

4
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:40,782
Ready?

5
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:53,585
What time is it?

6
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,106
Twelve thirty.

7
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,402
It all started in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,283
A truck loaded with stripped gun
parts got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:07,603
The driver didn't see anybody
but somebody fucked up.

10
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,524
He heard a voice.
Sometimes, that's all you need.

11
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:14,885
Mr. McManus?

12
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,006
Christ! Don't you fucking
guys ever sleep?

13
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,366
We have a warrant for your arrest.

14
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,846
Fuck you!

15
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,809
Todd Hockney?

16
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:31,529
Who wants to know?

17
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,170
New York Police Department.

18
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,651
Shit.

19
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,451
Freeze!

20
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,333
Sure you brought enough guys?

21
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:25,382
It's quite simple, really. A restaurant
that changes with the taste...

22
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,783
without losing the overall aesthetic.

23
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:31,704
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

24
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:34,865
Well, let me give you an example...

25
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,785
This I had to see for myself.

26
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,266
David.

27
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,627
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

28
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,108
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

29
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,828
Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.

30
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,629
These gentlemen are from the
New York Police Department.

31
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,550
You look good, Keaton.

32
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,990
Better that I would have thought.

33
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,790
You have a problem, Mr. Keaton?

34
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,391
Small matter of a stolen
truck loaded with guns.

35
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:04,832
Mr. Keaton?

36
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,673
Would you excuse us for a moment?

37
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,434
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

38
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,595
No, no, please... sit down.
This is...

39
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,076
This is a small problem.

40
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:21,716
Enjoy the meal.

41
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:46,642
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

42
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,323
I mean, these guys were hardcore hijackers...

43
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:51,764
...but there I was.

44
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:55,805
At that point I wasn't scared.

45
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,565
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

46
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,766
Besides, it was fun.

47
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,967
I got to make like I was notorious.

48
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,687
Allright, you all know the drill.

49
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,928
When your number is called,
step forward and repeat the phrase...

50
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:11,168
...you've been given.
Understand?

51
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:12,129
Number 1...

52
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,529
...step forward.

53
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,211
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

54
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,212
Number 2, step forward.

55
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,453
Gimme the fucking keys, you
fucking cocksucker motherfucker--!

56
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,013
Knock it off! Get back!

57
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:33,934
Number 3, step forward.

58
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,056
Hand me the keys,
you cocksucker.

59
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,737
In english, please.

60
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:47,457
Excuse me?

61
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,138
In english.

62
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:52,419
Hand me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker, what the fuck...

63
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,539
Number 4, step forward.

64
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:57,660
It was bullshit.
The whole wrap was a set-up.

65
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,540
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

66
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:02,461
It was all the cops' fault.

67
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:04,942
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

68
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,182
Who knows what can happen.

69
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:11,143
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

70
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,304
This has really got to be...

71
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,904
...embarrassing for you guys.

72
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,184
They drilled us all night.

73
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:19,545
Somebody was pissed about that truck
getting hijacked, and the cops had nothing.

74
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:22,426
They were hoping somebody would
slip up and give them something to go on.

75
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:25,347
They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.

76
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:26,707
They'd been doing it forever.

77
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:30,428
I mean, our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. I mean, disgraceful.

78
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:31,628
They went after McManus first.

79
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:33,269
Top-notch entry man.

80
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,509
What truck?

81
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,949
The truck with the guns, fucko.

82
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,190
Fucko? Brrr...

83
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:43,351
He was a good guy.
Crazy, though.

84
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:45,271
Wanna know what your
buddy Fenster told us?

85
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:46,432
Who?

86
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:48,952
McManus. He told us
another story altogether.

87
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:52,593
Oh, that one about the
hooker with dysentery.

88
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,234
Fenster always worked
with McManus.

89
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,194
He was a real tight-ass...

90
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,595
...but when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

91
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,235
What are you saying?

92
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,596
I say he'll flip you.

93
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,436
- He what?
- Flip you.

94
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,157
- Flip you for real.
- Yeah, I'm shaking. C'mon.

95
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:07,517
Answer my question.

96
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,037
Can you hear me
in the back?

97
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,518
Hello? I want...

98
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:13,999
...my lawyer.

99
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,679
I'm gonna have your
fucking badge, cocksucker.

100
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,720
Todd Hockney.
Good with explosives.

101
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,321
Without a doubt, a one guy who
didn't give a fuck about anybody.

102
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,681
You guys don't have a
fucking leg to stand on.

103
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,082
You think so,
tough guy?

104
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:29,482
I could put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

105
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:30,683
Really?

106
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:32,443
I live in Queens.

107
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,884
Did you... put that together
yourself, Einstein?

108
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,284
What've you got, a team of monkeys
working around the clock on this?

109
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:40,045
You know what happens if you
do another turn in the joint?

110
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,566
Fuck your father in the shower
and then have a snack.

111
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,367
You gonna charge me,
dickhead?

112
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,847
I'll charge you
when I'm ready.

113
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:48,927
With what?

114
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,608
You know damn well,
dead-man.

115
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:54,368
But Keaton... Keaton was the real
prize for them, for obvious reasons.

116
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,809
It was your mistake,
not mine.

117
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,610
Did you ever
stop to ask me?

118
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:07,012
I mean, I've been working around
with the same face, the same name.

119
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:09,652
I'm a businessman.

120
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:11,573
Yeah, what's that?
The restaurant business?

121
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:15,534
No, from now on, you're in the
"getting-fucked-by-us" business.

122
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,974
I'm gonna make you
famous, cocksucker.

123
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:19,415
Like I said...

124
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,815
...it was your mistake.

125
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,496
Not mine.

126
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,136
Now you charge me
with this shit...

127
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:28,457
...and I'll beat it.

128
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:31,138
Ok?

129
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,938
Let's get back to that
truck, asshole.

130
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,940
So I did a little time...

131
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,101
...does that mean I get
railed every time...

132
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:46,341
...a truck finds its way
off the planet?

133
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,702
Fuck them!

134
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:49,822
Fenster, will you relax?

135
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,023
These guys don't have
any probable cause.

136
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:53,943
You're fucking A-right. No P.C. ...

137
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,544
No goddamn right.

138
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,384
You do some time,
they never let you go.

139
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,384
You know, treat me
like a criminal...

140
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:01,745
...I'll end up a criminal.

141
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,105
You are a criminal!

142
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:06,186
Hey, why you gotta
go and do that?

143
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,267
I'm trying to make a point.

144
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,147
Oh, why don't you
make your point.

145
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:12,628
You're making me
tired all over.

146
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,308
Oh, fuck it then.

147
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,549
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh yeah?

148
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,069
Well, you heard right.

149
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,910
The word I got is you
hung up your spurs, man.

150
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,550
What's that all about?

151
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,790
What's this?

152
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,311
Rumor has it,
Keaton's gone straight.

153
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,911
I hear he's tapping
Edie Finneran.

154
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,072
Who is that?

155
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:31,472
She's a heavy-weight
criminal lawyer from uptown.

156
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,233
I hear she's Keaton's
meal ticket.

157
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,113
How 'bout it, Keaton?

158
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:37,234
You a lawyer's wife?

159
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:39,874
What kind of "retainer"
you giving her?

160
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,916
Hey, Fenster.
Do your friend a favor...

161
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:47,436
Tell him to keep quiet.

162
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:49,957
Dean Keaton...

163
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,758
...gone clean, huh?

164
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:54,958
Say it ain't so.

165
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:56,959
Was it you that
hit that truck?

166
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,359
Forget him.

167
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,159
You got to talk
to your lawyer?

168
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,360
This whole thing
was a shakedown.

169
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,961
What makes you say that?

170
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,761
How many times have
you been to a line-up?

171
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,922
It's always you
and four dummies.

172
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:13,283
P.D. are paying homeless guys
ten bucks a head half the time.

173
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:16,603
And there's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row. No way!

174
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,644
And what's a
voice line-up?

175
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,284
A Public Defender could
get you out of that one.

176
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,045
So why the hell was I
strip-searched?

177
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:23,725
It was the Feds.

178
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,006
A truckload of guns
gets snagged...

179
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:30,047
...Customs comes down to N.Y.P.D. looking
for answers - they come up with us.

180
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,327
They are clutching
at straws.

181
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,288
Ah, the guys fingered
my asshole tonight.

182
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:34,648
Is it Friday already?

183
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:37,849
Yeah, lover-boy.

184
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,529
You want a piece?
Something, I love you.

185
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:42,610
So who in the goddamn place...

186
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,290
...stole the fucking truck?

187
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:46,731
What did you say?

188
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:48,411
Who stole the fucking truck!

189
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:49,892
I don't want to know.

190
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:51,652
Who asked you,
working man?

191
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:54,173
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is who's the gimp.

192
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,173
He's ok.

193
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:58,254
Says you. How do I know that? What
about it, Pretzel-man? What's your story?

194
00:13:58,534 --> 00:13:59,854
His name is Verbal.

195
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:01,855
Verbal Kint.

196
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:02,855
Verbal?

197
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:06,496
Roger, really.
People say I talk too much.

198
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,456
Yeah, I was just going
to tell you to shut up.

199
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,377
We've met before
once or twice.

200
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:12,057
In county. I was in for fraud.

201
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,378
You were in the line-up
then, too. What happened?

202
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:16,418
I walked.

203
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:17,418
Ninety days,
suspended.

204
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:18,499
So you did it!

205
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,139
All right, now look...

206
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,820
We've all been put out by
this whole thing, right?

207
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,421
So I figure we owe it to
ourselves to salvage a little dignity

208
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,501
Now...

209
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:31,542
...me and Fenster heard
about a little job.

210
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,422
Why don't you just
calm down?

211
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:35,543
Why do you care
what he has to say?

212
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,264
I'm just talking here.

213
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,824
And it seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear what I got to say...

214
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:43,585
...and I know Fenster's down.

215
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,025
What about you guy?

216
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,986
I'm interested, sure.

217
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:51,387
There, see?

218
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:54,588
So now I'd like to exercise
my right to free assembly.

219
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,588
Why don't you just shut up?

220
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,910
You're missing the point.

221
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,311
No...
YOU're missing the point.

222
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,112
I don't want to hear
anything from you.

223
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,392
I don't care
about your job.

224
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:20,474
And... I want nothing
to do with any of you.

225
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:22,834
I beg your pardon...

226
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:24,515
...but you can all
go to hell.

227
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:28,236
Dean Keaton...

228
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:30,476
...gone the high road.

229
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,797
What is the world coming to?

230
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:39,799
Fuck him.

231
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
And that was how it started.

232
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,041
The five of us being brought in on a trumped-up
charge to be leaned on by half-wits.

233
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,723
Ok, now I really can't talk
about it much here...

234
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:59,203
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

235
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:02,564
...was that these men would
never break, never lie down...

236
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,285
...never bend over for anybody...

237
00:16:06,485 --> 00:16:07,605
...anybody.

238
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,329
Who are you?

239
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,930
Agent Jack Baer, FBI.
How many dead?

240
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,251
15 so far. They're still pulling some
bodies out of the water, though.

241
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:31,811
Any survivors?

242
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:32,932
Yeah, there's two.

243
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,333
One guy is in county hospital, but he's
in a coma. The D.A. has the second guy...

244
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:38,573
...a cripple from New York, I think.

245
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,974
Listen, the chief wants
this place sealed off.

246
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,134
If you have any questions,
give him a call--

247
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,823
This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in
Los Angeles until tuesday.

248
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,944
If you need to reach me, contact...

249
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:25,385
...Jeff Rabin at the
San Pedro P.D., at extension 112.

250
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:26,665
Have a nice day.

251
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,666
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you...

252
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,627
...the D.A. came down here last night...

253
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,788
...ready to arraign even before
they moved him to county. Ok?

254
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:40,028
Kint's lawer shows up five minutes later...

255
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:43,389
...D.A. comes out of the office looking like
the boogey man smacked him around.

256
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:46,470
Allright? They take the statement
and they cut him a deal.

257
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,870
What? Did they charge
him with anything?

258
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,110
Yeah, weapons.

259
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,711
Misdemeanor two.

260
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,031
What is that?

261
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,192
Listen, I give the D.A. credit for
getting that much, you understand?

262
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,432
Excuse me.

263
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:00,993
This whole thing
has turned political.

264
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,634
The Major was here last night. The chief.
This morning...

265
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,835
...the Governor called, ok?

266
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:09,996
I'm telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the prince of darkness.

267
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:11,076
Take my word for it.

268
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:12,436
When does he post bail?

269
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:13,636
Maybe two hours, tops.

270
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:14,757
I want to see him.

271
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,517
- No, Dave.
- I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

272
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,198
Dave, no!
I can not do this for you.

273
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,558
I came a long way for this.

274
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,439
Dave, please.

275
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,720
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

276
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,841
He's paranoid about
being recorded.

277
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,482
He knows the interrogation
rooms are wired.

278
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:35,442
This won't be an interrogation...

279
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,483
...just a friendly chat
to kill some time.

280
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,523
He will not go into
the interrogation room.

281
00:18:40,763 --> 00:18:42,484
- Just someplace else, then.
- Where?

282
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:47,405
If this was a dope deal,
where's the dope?

283
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,485
If it was a hit,
who called it in?

284
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:53,366
I'm sure you have a host of wild
theories to answer all these questions.

285
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:55,167
- You know damn well what I think.
- That's crazy.

286
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,287
And besides, it doesn't even matter...

287
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:59,168
...the guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

288
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,008
He doesn't know what
you want to know.

289
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,489
I don't think he does.
Not exactly.

290
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:06,449
But there's a lot more
to his story, believe me.

291
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,130
Jeffrey, look... I want to know why
27 men died on that pier...

292
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,051
...for what looks to be 91 million dollars
worth of dope that wasn't there.

293
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:15,932
And above all...

294
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:17,932
...I want to be sure
Dean Keaton is dead.

295
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,293
He's dead.

296
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:21,133
C'mon, two hours.

297
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:22,613
Just 'till he makes bail.

298
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,694
They're all dead.

299
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,774
I don't care how tough a guy
you say this Keaton was...

300
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,415
...nobody on that boat
could have come out alive.

301
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:33,776
Is he talking?

302
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:36,577
He regained consciousness
less than an hour ago...

303
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,097
...he spoke, not english...
then he lapsed.

304
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,418
- Hungarian?
- I don't know. I think that may have been what it was.

305
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:41,978
Yeah, most of them
were hungarians.

306
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:42,898
You've got to put on these.

307
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,419
Burn victims are very
succeptible to infections.

308
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,380
And, of course,
there is no smoking.

309
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,463
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

310
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:01,423
Is he gonna die?

311
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,224
He has burns over 60% of his body,
a number of his ribs are broken--

312
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:05,624
Call Hospital Security.

313
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:07,184
Get a man. Put him on the door
until the police get here.

314
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:08,305
Is he dangerous?

315
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:09,505
Yes!

316
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:10,705
Do it!

317
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:11,665
Do it now!

318
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,347
Joel?

319
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:18,067
Yeah, Baer, down
at L.A. County.

320
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:21,788
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

321
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:23,708
Yes!
Yes, I'm sure.

322
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,749
No, no, he's all fucked-up.
What?

323
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,710
I can't hear you.

324
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,550
Shut up! I'm on the phone!

325
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,311
Yes.

326
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,831
Well, no. Not--

327
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,872
Just send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

328
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,233
Yeah! He's awake and
talking like a Thai hooker.

329
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,713
No, just somebody who--

330
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:44,314
What?

331
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,435
No shit!

332
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:56,036
Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

333
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:58,637
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

334
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:33,846
Verbal, this is Agent
Kujan, from Customs.

335
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:36,006
Nice to meet you.

336
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:38,687
He wants to ask you a few
questions before you go.

337
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,007
What about?

338
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:42,048
About Dean Keaton mostly.

339
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:45,449
But I'd like to start at the
line-up back in New York.

340
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:46,729
Can I get some coffee?

341
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:48,929
I a while.
Let's talk about the line-up.

342
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,370
I'm really thirsty.

343
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,410
I used to dehydrate
as a kid.

344
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,451
One time I got so bad,
my piss came out like snot...

345
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,771
...I'm not kidding--

346
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:57,452
I'll get your fucking coffee.

347
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,172
Get me one too
while you're at it.

348
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:05,934
That guy is tense.

349
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:07,614
Tension is a killer.

350
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,735
I used to be in a barber shop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

351
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:12,695
...the bariton was this guy named Kip Diskin.

352
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:14,696
Big, fat guy.
I mean, like orca-fat.

353
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,216
He was so stressed
in the morning--

354
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,337
Verbal, you know we're
trying to help you.

355
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,177
Sure. And I
appreciate that.

356
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:22,098
And I want to help
you, Agent Kujan.

357
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:23,378
I like cops.

358
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,818
I would have liked to be a
Fed myself, but my C.P. always--

359
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,939
Verbal, you're not
telling us everything.

360
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,739
I know you
know something.

361
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,820
I told the D.A.
everything I know.

362
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,661
Verbal...

363
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,262
...I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man.

364
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:39,902
I know he was good.

365
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:41,342
He was a corrupt cop.

366
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,183
Sure, 15 years ago.
But he was a good thief.

367
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:46,704
Anyway, the cops wouldn't
let him go legit.

368
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:48,624
Dean Keaton was
a piece of shit.

369
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:54,265
Are you trying to get a rise
out of me, Agent Kujan?

370
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,666
I just want to hear
your story.

371
00:22:56,946 --> 00:22:58,066
It's all there.

372
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,067
May I have a cigarette?

373
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,428
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

374
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,430
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

375
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:21,032
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

376
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,113
Run of the mill scams.

377
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,393
That's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

378
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:27,234
Oh, I know.

379
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,954
Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

380
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:34,115
Well, I do have the
weapons charge.

381
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,356
I'm looking at six whole
months hard time.

382
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,396
You know a dealer named
Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

383
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,797
You know a religious
guy named John Paul?

384
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:43,157
You know Ruby is in Attica?

385
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:44,878
He didn't have my lawyer.

386
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:46,038
I know Ruby.
He's big on respect.

387
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,839
He's good friend of mine.
Likes me very much.

388
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,079
Now, I know your
testimony is sealed.

389
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,440
Ruby's well connected.
He's got a lot of friends inside...

390
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,720
...do a lot of favors for him.

391
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,601
What do you think he would say if he found
out you dropped his name to the D.A.?

392
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:00,442
There's nothing in
there about Ruby.

393
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:02,202
I'll be sure to mention
that to him.

394
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,083
First thing on the job, you know what I learned?
How to spot a murderer.

395
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:06,363
Let's say you arrest 3 guys...

396
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:07,684
...for the same killing.

397
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:11,204
You put them all in jail overnight. The next
morning, whoever is sleeping is your man.

398
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,565
You see, if you're guilty and you know
you're caught, you get some rest...

399
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,685
...you let your guard down.
You follow me?

400
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:16,686
No.

401
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:18,606
Let me get right to the point.

402
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:21,887
I'm smarter than you.

403
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,848
And I'm gonna find out
what I wanna know.

404
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:26,848
And I'm gonna get it from
you wether you like it or not.

405
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:29,409
I'm not a rat.

406
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,091
Thanks.

407
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,413
Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we used to make fresh coffee.

408
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:46,133
Right off the trees,
I mean.

409
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:47,173
That was good.

410
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,334
This is shit.

411
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:49,414
But, hey,
I'm in a police station--

412
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,974
Can we get started again?

413
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,455
Now, what happened
after the line-up?

414
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,817
...the Desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell
me that they he couldn't release you.

415
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,698
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged!

416
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:06,338
New York Police!

417
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,299
You know, I want to have
pictures taken of your face...

418
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,300
...take them to the D.A.'s office
first thing tomorrow morning.

419
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Just forget about it.

420
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,901
Absolutely not! I'm gonna have this thing
in front of the grand jury by Monday.

421
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,061
Look, I don't want to
talk about it, Edie. Ok?

422
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,622
So what did Fortier
and Renault say?

423
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:26,303
They asked for some more time
to think about the restaurant.

424
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:28,183
They just want more time! It's ok...

425
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:29,464
More time for what, Edie?

426
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:33,185
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they're still going to find out about me.

427
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:34,985
Give me some credit.

428
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:36,785
I got you this far.

429
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,426
Let's go to the grand jury.
You know, this isn't going to stop if we--

430
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,507
It's never going to stop. Period.

431
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:45,628
By next week, every investor in this city
is going to be walking away from us.

432
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:48,828
It's finished.

433
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:50,669
I'm finished.

434
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,191
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

435
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:01,952
It's never going to stop.

436
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,354
I love you.

437
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:13,674
They ruined me in there tonight.

438
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:16,795
I love you.

439
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:19,676
Do you hear me?

440
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:27,438
What?

441
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:30,959
All right.

442
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,879
Let's just go to my place.

443
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:50,564
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

444
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:01,766
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition.

445
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,247
A fast jump. High risk.
Long money.

446
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:06,007
We all knew it could be done.

447
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,888
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

448
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:11,369
To do it right took five men.

449
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:13,169
Five men meant Keaton.

450
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,410
Keaton took convincing.

451
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,451
New York finest taxi service.

452
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,691
Bullshit!

453
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,653
They don't operate anymore.

454
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:32,094
McManus has a friend in the 14th Precinct.
They're coming out for one job - Thursday.

455
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:34,734
They are picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of South America.

456
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:36,775
McManus already has a fence
set to take the stuff.

457
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:37,775
A fence? Who?

458
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,576
Some guy in California.
His name is Redfoot.

459
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:41,016
I never heard of him.

460
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:42,496
You have to come.

461
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:44,057
What's it to you
wether I do it not?

462
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:47,017
They--
They don't know me. You do.

463
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,258
They won't take me
unless you go.

464
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,419
Look at me.
I need this.

465
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,299
Oh, are you telling me
you don't need this?

466
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:55,820
Is this your place?

467
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,300
I'm not knocking you, you look like you've got
a good little scam going on with this lawyer--

468
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:04,942
Sorry.

469
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,703
It's ok.

470
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:11,063
You say it's the real thing?
That's cool.

471
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:15,024
You're ok?

472
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:16,985
I was out of line.

473
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:20,186
But they're never going to stop
with us, you know that.

474
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:23,266
As clean as you could ever get,
they'll never let you go now.

475
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:26,827
This way we hit the cops where it
hurts and we get well in the mean time.

476
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:32,469
You sure you're ok?

477
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,389
I'll be all right.

478
00:28:48,553 --> 00:28:49,753
Look, I...

479
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:52,394
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

480
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,075
I probably shit blood tonight.

481
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,239
So, how do they want to do it?

482
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,480
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

483
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,041
Fenster?
Hockney?

484
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:24,561
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

485
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:28,042
Now, I've got a way of doing
it without killing anyone.

486
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:30,083
But, as I said, they won't
let me in without you.

487
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,167
Three million?

488
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,448
Maybe more.

489
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:58,050
No killing.

490
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,250
Not if we do it my way.

491
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,139
New York's finest taxi service was
not your normal taxi service.

492
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:41,260
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the
N.Y.P.D. that ran a high-profit racket...

493
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,541
...driving smugglers and drug
dealers all over the city.

494
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,181
For a few hundred dollars a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

495
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:46,982
...and a police escort.

496
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,102
They even had their
own business cards.

497
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:50,503
After a while, somebody
started asking...

498
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:53,223
...questions and the
taxi service shut down.

499
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,784
Ever since then, Internal Affairs had been
waiting to catch them in the act.

500
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:58,625
And that's where we came in.

501
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:00,065
So, how was the flight?

502
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,545
Fucking great.

503
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,346
Will this get me to Staten Island?

504
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:09,027
Kidding me? This will
get you to Cape Cod.

505
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,188
McManus came to us with the job,
Fenster got the vans...

506
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:13,748
...Hockney supplied the hardware.

507
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:16,189
I came through with how
to do it so no-one got killed.

508
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:17,549
But Keaton...

509
00:31:17,949 --> 00:31:19,870
Keaton put on
the finishing touch.

510
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,671
A little "fuck you" from the
five of us to the N.Y.P.D. .

511
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:27,912
All right, watch this.

512
00:31:28,912 --> 00:31:29,952
Careful!

513
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:30,993
Asshole!

514
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,554
Don't move, you fucker!

515
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,274
- Who the--
- Drop it! Now, motherfucker!

516
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:40,675
Drop the fucking gun!

517
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:42,515
Don't you fucking touch
those fucking things!

518
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:44,276
What the fuck d'you guys want?

519
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:46,836
Stupid asshole!

520
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:48,477
Watch it!

521
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,318
You want a buckshot shampoo, Chubby?

522
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,600
Afternoon, my little pork-chops.

523
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,040
Now gimme the shit.

524
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,521
Give him the fucking shit!

525
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:04,601
Give him the fucking shit!

526
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:08,282
Hurry up!

527
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:09,482
C'mon!

528
00:32:09,682 --> 00:32:10,442
Now the money!

529
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:12,443
- There's no money!
- Gimme the money! Right now!

530
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:13,763
- There's no fucking money!

531
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:15,163
Give him the money!

532
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:16,084
The money!

533
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,284
Give me the fucking money!

534
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:19,444
Do it!

535
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:20,925
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

536
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:26,526
Do you peolpe know
who the fuck I am?

537
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,047
We do now, jerk-off.

538
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,409
What's that?

539
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:41,050
What the fuck--?

540
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,050
Holy shit!

541
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:00,815
Keaton made an
anonymous phone call...

542
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,135
...the press was on the scene
before the police were.

543
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:05,616
Strausz and Rizzi were
indicted three days later.

544
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:08,016
Within a few weeks, 50 more
cops went down with them.

545
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:11,457
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

546
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:13,458
It was beautiful.

547
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,100
I owe you $2.50 .

548
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,022
There's more here than I thought.

549
00:33:30,262 --> 00:33:31,582
When does the fence come?

550
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:34,823
Redfoot never comes to see me,
I always go to see him.

551
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,384
In California?

552
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:40,944
Yes, Verbal, in California.
Fenster and I will--

553
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:43,105
Wait, wait...
Hold the fucking phone...

554
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:44,465
...you and Fenster?
No, no, no...

555
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:47,026
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

556
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:48,266
Ok. So...

557
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:49,707
...who's gonna go?

558
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,307
We all go!

559
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,468
What's your fucking
problem, man?

560
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:58,989
My fucking problem, man, is that you and
Fenster are off honeymooning in California...

561
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:00,349
...while the rest of us are
sitting here holding our dicks.

562
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,350
Hey!
The job's over.

563
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,990
Cool it.

564
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,271
L.A. is a good place
to lay low for a while.

565
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:12,312
Wanna dance?

566
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:20,634
Ladies...

567
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:30,157
I would like to propose a toast...

568
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:32,637
There you go.

569
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:36,798
...to Mr. Verbal...

570
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,119
...the man with the plan.

571
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:54,603
We're gonna miss the flight.

572
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,083
Don't do this.
Send her a note - something.

573
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:00,764
I said we'll make it.

574
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:35,253
We're gonna miss the plane.

575
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:38,413
She'll understand.

576
00:35:57,258 --> 00:35:58,738
That's heartwarming.

577
00:35:58,938 --> 00:36:00,019
Really.

578
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:02,779
I'm weepy.

579
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,620
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

580
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:11,982
You guys wanted to know what happened
after the line-up. I'm telling you.

581
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:13,342
Come on, Verbal.

582
00:36:13,782 --> 00:36:15,342
Who do you think
you're talking to?

583
00:36:16,183 --> 00:36:18,383
You expect me to believe
that he retired?

584
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,464
For a woman?

585
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:23,504
Bullshit!

586
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:25,265
Keaton was using her.

587
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:26,625
He loved her.

588
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:27,625
Sure.

589
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:30,906
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the
taxi service wasn't his idea either?

590
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:32,627
It was all Fenster and McManus.

591
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,627
C'mon, Keaton was
a cop for 4 years!

592
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:37,868
Who else would know the taxi service better?
That job had his name written all over it.

593
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:39,428
But Edie had him
all turned around.

594
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:41,349
Let me tell you something.

595
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:42,829
I know Dean Keaton.

596
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,750
I've been investigating him
for the past 3 years.

597
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,351
The guy I know was a
cold-blooded bastard.

598
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:52,712
I.A.D. indicted him on three counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force.

599
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:54,912
So don't sell me the hooker
with the heart of gold.

600
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:56,753
You got him all wrong.

601
00:36:57,993 --> 00:36:58,793
Do I?

602
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:03,594
Dean Keaton was under indictment a total
of 7 times while he was on the force.

603
00:37:03,874 --> 00:37:07,155
In every case the witnesses either
reversed their testimony to the grand jury...

604
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:09,796
...or died before they could testify.

605
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:14,797
When they finally nailed him for fraud
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

606
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:16,918
He killed three
prisioners inside.

607
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:19,798
Of course
I can't prove this.

608
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,839
But I can't prove
the best part either:

609
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,360
Dean Keaton was dead.

610
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Did you know that?

611
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,641
He died in a fire
two years ago...

612
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,962
...during an investigation into
the murder of a witness...

613
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:35,242
...who was going to
testify against him.

614
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:38,323
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

615
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,123
...just before it blew up.

616
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:43,204
They said he went in to
check a leaking gas main.

617
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:47,525
It blew up, and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

618
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:50,766
Within three months
of the explosion...

619
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,806
...the two witnesses,
they were dead.

620
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:55,407
One killed himself in his car...

621
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,368
...the other fell down an
open elevator shaft.

622
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:03,089
Agent Baer.

623
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,129
This is not what we discussed.
There are far too many people in this room--

624
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,490
Look, doctor, I promise we'll be out of
here before he blows his porcelain. Ok?

625
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,091
I have a noon meeting, Baer.

626
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,931
- Agent Baer, five minutes.
- Look, everyone just calm down. All right?

627
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:16,372
I want you to ask this man about the shoot-out in the harbor.

628
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:28,655
He says they were buying--

629
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:31,016
Dope, we know.

630
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:40,018
He doesn't know what they
were buying, but not dope... people.

631
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:41,138
What?

632
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,501
He needs guarantees...

633
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:51,621
What is he talking about?

634
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:53,781
He says his life's in danger.

635
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:58,423
He saw the devil.
Looked him in the eye.

636
00:38:58,663 --> 00:39:00,983
- I'm on my way.
- No, no. Wait a minute.

637
00:39:01,223 --> 00:39:03,944
Ask him to tell him what he told me.

638
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:05,784
About the devil.

639
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:07,825
Who's the devil.

640
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,626
Keyser Soze.

641
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:21,428
He was in the harbor...

642
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,709
...killing many men.

643
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:25,829
He saw Keyser Soze?

644
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:33,311
He saw his face.

645
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:37,032
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

646
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:38,712
Describe him.

647
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:48,395
Six weeks ago I get an anonymous
phone call telling me...

648
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,396
...I could find Keaton eating at Mondino's
with his attourney. And there he is.

649
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,956
Now, because he never
profited from his alleged death...

650
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:58,437
...and because we convicted someone
else of the murder we tried to pin on him...

651
00:39:58,677 --> 00:40:00,238
...we had to let him go.

652
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:04,119
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

653
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,959
And then he had lunch.

654
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,680
I don't know about that.

655
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,520
Oh, I don't think you do.

656
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,481
But you say you saw Keaton die.
I think you're covering his ass...

657
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,481
...and he's still out there somewhere.

658
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:17,602
I think he's behind that
whole circus at the harbor.

659
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:21,083
My bet is he's using you because your're
stupid and you think he's your friend.

660
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:23,523
You tell me he's dead?
So be it.

661
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,444
I want to be sure he's dead
before I go back to New York.

662
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:29,165
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

663
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:31,165
What lawyer.

664
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:32,966
What lawyer, Verbal?

665
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:35,846
You know, back when I was with that
barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois, I--

666
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:38,247
You don't think I know
you held out on the D.A.?

667
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:39,967
What did you leave
out on that testimony?

668
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:41,888
I can be on the phone to
Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.

669
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:43,648
The D.A. gave me immunity.

670
00:40:43,848 --> 00:40:47,129
Nos from me. You get no immunity
from me, you piece of shit.

671
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:50,490
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

672
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,571
...every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

673
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:55,691
Now you talk to me...

674
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:58,292
...or that precious immunity they
seem so fit to grant you...

675
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:01,653
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

676
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,374
There was a lawyer.

677
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:09,095
Kobayashi.

678
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:11,455
Is he the one that killed Keaton?

679
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:14,536
No.
But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

680
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,737
Convince me.

681
00:41:16,937 --> 00:41:19,057
Tell me every last detail.

682
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:41,183
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' friends, Redfoot.

683
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,343
He had a good reputation.

684
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:45,264
Seemed like a good guy.

685
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,184
Still, we should have known better.

686
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:48,144
How're you doing?

687
00:41:48,624 --> 00:41:51,425
- Good. You?
- Not bad.

688
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:53,506
- How's it going, Fenster?

689
00:41:54,906 --> 00:41:56,506
No need to open it, right?

690
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:04,068
You must be Keaton.

691
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:06,829
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

692
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,469
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

693
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,990
Verbal. The man with the plan, huh?

694
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,150
You guys interested
in any more work?

695
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:15,631
We're always looking
for extra work.

696
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:17,111
We're on vacation.

697
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:19,992
Oh well... that's too bad.

698
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:22,273
I have a ton of work and I
don't have any good people.

699
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,473
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job.

700
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:27,554
There's this jeweler out
of Texas named Saul.

701
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,674
He rents a suite in some
downtown hotel...

702
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:33,235
...does free appraisals for people.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

703
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,996
Anyway, the word is he
carries around a lot of cash.

704
00:42:36,836 --> 00:42:40,597
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

705
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:43,278
- It's simple.
- What about security?

706
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,758
A couple of bodyguards.

707
00:42:45,038 --> 00:42:46,519
Nothing you couldn't handle.

708
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:48,519
Give me time to check it out.

709
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:50,840
I'd expect nothing less
from you, man.

710
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,361
- Good to see you. We'll call you.
- Good to see you too.

711
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:57,041
Enjoy L.A., huh?
Get yourself laid.

712
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:05,523
A friend of mine in New York tells
me that you know Spook Hollis.

713
00:43:06,604 --> 00:43:08,124
The way I hear it...

714
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:09,404
...you did time with old Spook.

715
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,405
Good man, wasn't he?

716
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:13,445
I used to run dope for him.

717
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,046
Too bad he got shivved.

718
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:19,407
Yeah. I shivved him.

719
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,968
Better you hear it from me now
than somebody else later.

720
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:28,449
I appreciate that.

721
00:43:29,729 --> 00:43:31,010
Just out of curiosity...

722
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,610
...was it business or personal?

723
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:37,291
A bit of both.

724
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:43,093
Well, like I said, you give me
a call if you're interested.

725
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:49,614
Is there a problem?

726
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:54,255
One job. That was the deal.

727
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:01,057
One job?

728
00:44:03,698 --> 00:44:05,178
One job!

729
00:44:06,538 --> 00:44:08,299
That's a good one, Keaton.

730
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:14,020
Keaton followed the best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

731
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,021
He can convince anyone he's
someone else, but never himself.

732
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,542
It took one day with McManus nagging
and we went back to work.

733
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,431
Give me the case!
Give me the fucking case!

734
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:04,032
Give me the fucking case!

735
00:45:04,352 --> 00:45:06,033
I'm telling you for the last time...

736
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:07,913
...give me the fucking case!

737
00:45:48,723 --> 00:45:50,324
Now just hand over the case.

738
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,204
Hand over the fucking case!

739
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:21,171
Bad day. Fuck it.

740
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:52,899
Looks like a lot of China to me.
Shit.

741
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:00,741
Guys, c'mon.

742
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:04,302
- What are you doing?
- What does it look that I'm doing. I'm gonna kill him.

743
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:06,222
Look, we did it your way.
Now we're gonna do it my way.

744
00:47:06,422 --> 00:47:08,263
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm going to deal with him.

745
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,383
You better deal with him--

746
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:11,544
Shut up.

747
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:19,506
What I am supposed to do with that?

748
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:22,586
I don't know. Feed it to the gimp.

749
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:24,347
Eases pain. I don't know what that is.

750
00:47:24,627 --> 00:47:26,147
- What do you mean you don' know?
- Shut up.

751
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:28,148
I don't know. I got thrown
this job by some lawyer.

752
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,188
Yeah, who?

753
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:31,549
I don't know. Some Limey.

754
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,349
He's a middle man for somebody.
He doesn't say. I don't ask.

755
00:47:34,629 --> 00:47:36,270
- You're fucking full of shit.
- Fuck you!

756
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,231
Listen to me. We want to meet him, ok?

757
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:43,072
That's funny. Called me last night...

758
00:47:43,912 --> 00:47:46,072
...he says he wants to meet you guys.

759
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:49,793
Ok. We'll meet him.

760
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,674
- I'll call you.
- Good. Do that. No problem.

761
00:47:51,874 --> 00:47:53,114
I don't like the deal.

762
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:55,194
One more thing, tough guy.

763
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:58,035
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

764
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:03,276
You're such a top guy McManus.
But do me a favor, right?

765
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:04,877
Get the fuck off my dick!

766
00:48:07,758 --> 00:48:09,358
Put a leash on that puppy.

767
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:14,799
It's an awful shame about
Saul getting waxed.

768
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,200
Cops are gonna be looking
for the guys who did it.

769
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,721
Sooner or later they're
gonna come 'round asking me.

770
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,082
You have a sweet night, ladies.

771
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,925
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

772
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:41,766
- ...came from Redfoot.
- Right.

773
00:48:42,246 --> 00:48:44,527
And why leave this out
when you talked to the D.A.?

774
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,727
Dave. Someone to see you.

775
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:53,809
Jack. I've been looking all over for you.

776
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:57,650
You still after that coke that took a walk out
of that blood bath in the harbor yesterday?

777
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,571
- Yeah.
- Well, you can stop looking. It was no coke.

778
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,851
I've been in L.A. county talking
to a guy they pulled out...

779
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:05,852
...of a drainpipe in San Pedro
yesterday after the shoot-out.

780
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:07,812
He came to this morning.
He started talking.

781
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,613
He was part of a Hungarian mob there to do
a deal with a bunch of goats from Argentina...

782
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:13,494
...and he says it was
definitely not a dope deal.

783
00:49:13,694 --> 00:49:14,614
- But the 91 mill--
- Yeah, we know.

784
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:16,895
Our man says
no way on the dope.

785
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:20,415
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch
was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

786
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,976
They had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it.

787
00:49:24,176 --> 00:49:25,937
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

788
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,858
No one doing the deal knew,
except for a few key people.

789
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:31,418
They all were very hush
about it, he says.

790
00:49:31,618 --> 00:49:33,939
Whatever it was,
it's very sensitive.

791
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:35,259
I don't get it.

792
00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:39,780
They tell me you got that cripple there
from New York. Did he mention Keyser Soze?

793
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,940
Who?

794
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,261
Just bear with me here.

795
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:45,982
Who's Keyser Soze?

796
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:47,342
Oh, fuck!

797
00:49:48,142 --> 00:49:51,543
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

798
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:55,464
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

799
00:49:55,664 --> 00:49:57,345
What we need to do is think.

800
00:49:58,025 --> 00:49:59,185
Think back.

801
00:50:00,305 --> 00:50:01,506
Somebody...

802
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:03,146
...with power.

803
00:50:03,386 --> 00:50:06,227
Somebody who was capable of tracking
us from New York to Los Angeles.

804
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:08,027
Come on, Dean. What the
hell are we doing here?

805
00:50:08,227 --> 00:50:09,508
We're waiting.

806
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:12,028
- Bye now.
- Sit down.

807
00:50:12,228 --> 00:50:13,589
- No, I'm fucking bored--

808
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:17,349
- Mr. Hockney, do stay. Mr. Keaton...

809
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:21,871
...Mr. Fenster I recognize from his
mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus.

810
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:26,752
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

811
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:30,833
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

812
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:33,273
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

813
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:36,594
I have been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal...

814
00:50:36,874 --> 00:50:37,914
...to you gentlemen.

815
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,955
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services gentlemen.

816
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:46,517
One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.

817
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:49,877
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

818
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,878
...will have 91 million dollars
to divide between you...

819
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:54,879
- ...in any way you see fit.
- Who's your boss?

820
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,360
- I work for Keyser Soze.

821
00:51:10,683 --> 00:51:12,523
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Judging by the sudden change in mood, Mr. Kint...

822
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:16,004
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.

823
00:51:17,044 --> 00:51:19,845
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

824
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:21,445
An order, actually.

825
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,486
What do you mean, an order?

826
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:25,286
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,...

827
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:28,847
...you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

828
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,528
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

829
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:36,449
...and which was destined for Pakistan,
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

830
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:39,770
A most profitable violation
of U.N. regulations.

831
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,650
You had no way of
knowing this, Mr. Keaton...

832
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,771
...because the fellow shipping the
steel was working for Mr. Soze...

833
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:46,611
...without his knowledge.

834
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:48,252
Earlier this year...

835
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:53,013
...Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.

836
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:57,254
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring. Also set for Pakistan.

837
00:51:57,934 --> 00:52:01,815
Two months ago, Mr. Hockney
stole a truck carrying gun parts...

838
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:02,895
...through Queens...

839
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,296
...gun parts which where set to be
destroyed by the State of New York.

840
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:11,017
They would be "lost" in a weigh
station and rerouted to Belfast.

841
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:13,978
Again, Mr. Soze, using pawns
who had no knowledge.

842
00:52:14,418 --> 00:52:16,699
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

843
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:18,579
Nine months ago...

844
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:21,540
...one of Mr. Soze's
less-than-intelligent couriers...

845
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,981
...was taken in a complicated
confidence scan...by a cripple.

846
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:29,742
He was relieved of 62,000 dollars.

847
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:32,983
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

848
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,664
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

849
00:52:37,064 --> 00:52:38,864
You set up the line-up...

850
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:41,345
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

851
00:52:41,545 --> 00:52:44,306
It seems Mr. Keatons
attourney, Ms. Finneran...

852
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,546
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

853
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:50,187
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

854
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:53,188
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

855
00:52:53,468 --> 00:52:55,668
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people...

856
00:52:55,948 --> 00:52:57,629
...for very long, and they
never know who they're working for.

857
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,870
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

858
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,551
So... why telling us?

859
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:08,552
Because you have stolen
from Mr. Soze, Mr. Fenster.

860
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:09,552
All of you.

861
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:11,752
That you did not know
you stole from him...

862
00:53:11,952 --> 00:53:13,953
...is the only reason
you're still alive.

863
00:53:14,193 --> 00:53:17,634
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

864
00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:19,954
All right, fuck the debt!
And fuck you!

865
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:21,675
How do we know
you work for Soze?

866
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:24,796
I don't think that is very
relevant, Mr. Hockney.

867
00:53:24,996 --> 00:53:29,317
All five of you are responsible for the
murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

868
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:33,678
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement,
and we can see to it that he will.

869
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,838
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

870
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:39,319
Mr. Soze's primary interest...

871
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:41,000
...is narcotics.

872
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,680
He has been "competing", shall we say,
with a group of Argentinians...

873
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,161
...for several years now.

874
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:49,282
Competing with Mr. Soze
has taken its toll.

875
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:53,002
These Argentinians are
negotiating the sale...

876
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:56,083
...of 91 million dollars in
cocaine in 3 days time.

877
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:59,044
Needless to say, this
purchase will revitalize...

878
00:53:59,244 --> 00:54:01,965
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

879
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:05,926
Mr. Soze would like you
to stop the deal.

880
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:09,487
If you choose, you may
wait until after the buy.

881
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:11,927
Whatever money changes hands
is yours.

882
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:17,528
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

883
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:22,370
And then you will be free of
your obligations to Mr. Soze.

884
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,891
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

885
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:30,332
A gift...

886
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,212
...from Mr. Soze.

887
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:36,773
Good day, gentlemen.

888
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,270
They've got my whole life in here!
Everything I've ever done since I was 18!

889
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,071
They fucking know everything!

890
00:55:48,831 --> 00:55:50,871
Everybody I've ever worked
with or did time with.

891
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:10,436
- No... this isn't right.
- I don't know.

892
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:13,157
Who was that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

893
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:16,478
Bricks Marlin.

894
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:19,438
Yeah, he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff.

895
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:22,719
He said he always made 5 times
more money than the job was worth.

896
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,881
This guy's a pipe dream.
Kobayashi is using him for window dressing.

897
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:29,961
I don't know.
This is bad.

898
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:34,082
That's bullshit! This guy could be L.A.P.D. ...
It's a fucking setup!

899
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:37,723
Ah, the way I hear it, Soze...
is some kind of butcher.

900
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,204
A fearless psycho...
fucked up butcher.

901
00:56:40,404 --> 00:56:42,124
There is no Keyser Soze!

902
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:45,685
Who is Keyser Soze?

903
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:50,526
He's supposed to be turkish.
Some say his father was german.

904
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:53,127
Nobody ever believed
he was real.

905
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,248
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him...

906
00:56:56,448 --> 00:56:59,168
...but to hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

907
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:01,809
You never knew.
That was his power.

908
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:06,130
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

909
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:09,131
...was convincing the
world he didn't exist.

910
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:13,132
One story the guys told me
-the story I believe- ...

911
00:57:13,332 --> 00:57:14,932
...was from his days in Turkey.

912
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,653
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

913
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:19,373
They realized that to be in power...

914
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:22,494
...you didn't need guns,
or money, or even numbers.

915
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:26,175
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

916
00:57:26,415 --> 00:57:29,456
After a while, they come into power
and then they come after Soze.

917
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:32,376
He was small time then,
just running dope they say.

918
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:36,377
They come to his home...

919
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:37,738
...in the afternoon...

920
00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:39,298
...looking for his business.

921
00:57:39,618 --> 00:57:40,818
They find his wife and
kids in the house...

922
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:42,739
...and decide to
wait for Soze.

923
00:57:58,463 --> 00:57:59,783
He comes home...

924
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:02,664
...to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

925
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:05,985
The Hungarians knew Soze was
tough. Not to be trifled with.

926
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:07,625
So they let him know
they meant business.

927
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:16,227
They tell him they want his territory.
All of his business.

928
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:20,188
Soze looks over the
faces of his family...

929
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:25,349
...then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

930
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:46,995
He tells him he would
rather see his family dead...

931
00:58:47,395 --> 00:58:49,635
...than live another
day after this.

932
00:58:50,035 --> 00:58:52,796
He lets the last Hungarian go.

933
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,837
He waits until his wife and kids are in the ground
and then he goes after the rest of the mob.

934
00:58:57,277 --> 00:59:00,358
He kills their kids. He kills their wives.
He kills their parents...

935
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,038
...and their parents friends.

936
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:04,719
He burns down the
houses they live in...

937
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,200
...and the stores
they work in.

938
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,161
He kills people that owe them
money. And like that...

939
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:14,361
...he's gone.
Underground.

940
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:16,882
Nobody has ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

941
00:59:17,082 --> 00:59:19,963
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

942
00:59:20,163 --> 00:59:23,084
"Rat on your pop
and Keyser Soze will get you."

943
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:25,924
No one ever really believes.

944
00:59:26,845 --> 00:59:27,805
Do you believe
in him, Verbal?

945
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,246
Keaton always said:

946
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:35,567
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

947
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:39,608
Well, I believe in God.

948
00:59:39,808 --> 00:59:43,489
And the only thing that
scares me is Keyser Soze.

949
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,211
You give any weight to this?

950
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:54,531
I can introduce you to
Dan Metzheiser from Justice.

951
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:58,252
He's got a file on Soze in D.C. .
I'ts been a hobby of his for a couple of years.

952
00:59:58,452 --> 01:00:01,533
A lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on the Incredible Hulk.

953
01:00:06,694 --> 01:00:09,215
- You've heard of him?
- What, on the street?

954
01:00:09,575 --> 01:00:12,016
A few times.
Outside stuff.

955
01:00:12,536 --> 01:00:14,616
Somebody working for a guy
who works for a guy...

956
01:00:14,816 --> 01:00:17,457
...who got some money from Keyser Soze.
Y'know, shit like that.

957
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:19,898
Could be an old badge.

958
01:00:20,098 --> 01:00:21,698
A hex sign to keep people
from fucking with you...

959
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:23,739
...back when a name
was to mean something.

960
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:25,019
But you're here.

961
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:26,019
Shit, yeah.

962
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:28,700
I got a guy trying to walk out of
the hospital on a fried drumstick...

963
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,900
...because he's afraid of Soze.

964
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,461
I'll run up the flagpole.

965
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:36,302
I came clean. I told it like it
happened on the boat.

966
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,022
So what if I left out
how I got there?

967
01:00:38,262 --> 01:00:41,143
It's so full of holes, the D.A. would have
told me to blow amnesty up my ass.

968
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,303
So you got what you wanted
out of me, so big fucking deal.

969
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:44,664
So that's why you
never told the D.A. .

970
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:47,824
Well, you tell me, Agent Kujan...
if I told you the Loch Ness monster...

971
01:00:48,105 --> 01:00:49,585
hired me to hit the harbor,
what would you say?

972
01:00:49,785 --> 01:00:52,145
Turn state's evidence. We'll put you
on the stand, we'll hear it out.

973
01:00:52,426 --> 01:00:54,306
I've got immunity now.
What can you possibly offer me?

974
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:56,987
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

975
01:00:58,387 --> 01:00:59,747
Where's your head,
Agent Kujan?

976
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:01,708
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

977
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,468
Keyser Soze, or whatever
you want to call him...

978
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:05,029
...he knows where
I am right now.

979
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:07,109
He's got the front burner
under your ass to let me go...

980
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:08,990
...so he can scoop me up
10 minutes later.

981
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,910
Immunity was just a
deal with you assholes.

982
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,711
I've got a whole new
problem when I post bail.

983
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:14,831
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

984
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,192
Oh, gee, thanks Dave. Bang-up job so far...

985
01:01:17,392 --> 01:01:19,792
...extortion,
coersion...

986
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:21,793
...you probably pardon me
if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

987
01:01:22,033 --> 01:01:23,713
The same fuckers that rounded
this up and sank us into this mess...

988
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:24,954
...are now bailing me out?

989
01:01:25,154 --> 01:01:26,034
Fuck you!

990
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:31,035
You think you can
catch Keyser Soze?

991
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,876
You think a guy like that comes
this close to getting caught...

992
01:01:34,076 --> 01:01:35,196
...and sticks his head out?

993
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:38,437
If he comes up for anything,
it will be to get rid of me.

994
01:01:38,637 --> 01:01:39,437
And after that...

995
01:01:40,757 --> 01:01:43,238
...my guess is you'll never
hear from him again.

996
01:02:04,523 --> 01:02:06,084
What happened next?

997
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:08,804
We woke up next morning
and Fenster was gone.

998
01:02:09,004 --> 01:02:11,605
He couldn't handle the
idea of slumming for Soze.

999
01:02:11,805 --> 01:02:13,566
He left us a note
wishing us good luck...

1000
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:15,806
...and took a chunk of the
money we'd scraped together.

1001
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:17,647
Then what?

1002
01:02:17,887 --> 01:02:19,007
McManus was furious.

1003
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:21,087
He was talking about tracking him
down and ripping his heart out...

1004
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:22,728
...and all sorts of shit.

1005
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:25,729
That night we got the call.

1006
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,529
What call?

1007
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:30,050
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

1008
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:39,452
All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

1009
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:43,053
We've got to bury him.

1010
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:44,573
With what?

1011
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:46,414
With our hands.

1012
01:02:55,936 --> 01:02:57,416
Oh, this is nuts!

1013
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:00,377
It's dry fucking sand,
McManus. When he rots...

1014
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:02,738
...the surfers are gonna
smell him a mile away.

1015
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:03,898
Dig, you fucker!

1016
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:06,659
Hey, what are we going to do?
This fucking guy is gonna kill us.

1017
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:08,339
I don't know you,
peg-leg, but I can run.

1018
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,540
I got no problem with that.

1019
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,260
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have
a problem with that either.

1020
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:19,022
You run? I won't be digging
a hole for you. You got that?

1021
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:23,423
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

1022
01:03:24,183 --> 01:03:25,503
Fuck you!

1023
01:03:25,703 --> 01:03:27,664
He was my partner
for 5 years.

1024
01:03:28,024 --> 01:03:31,185
We did more jobs, and I saw more
money, than you can ever count.

1025
01:03:31,385 --> 01:03:34,465
So fuck you!
'Cause now it's payback!

1026
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:36,426
It's not payback.

1027
01:03:39,307 --> 01:03:42,147
It's precaution. You want payback?
You wanna run? I don't care.

1028
01:03:46,508 --> 01:03:48,669
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

1029
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:51,029
I'm not doing it for you.

1030
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,350
I'm doing this for me.

1031
01:03:56,231 --> 01:03:58,071
I'm going to finish this thing.

1032
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:01,832
This Kobayashi bastard
is not going to stand on me.

1033
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:24,078
And after they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

1034
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,438
I wanted to. I thought
we could make it.

1035
01:04:26,638 --> 01:04:28,039
Why didn't you say anything?

1036
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,559
Believe me, I tried.
But Keaton wouldn't have it.

1037
01:04:30,759 --> 01:04:32,360
It was too far-fetched for him.

1038
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,840
Keaton was a grounded guy,
an ex-cop.

1039
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,961
To a cop the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

1040
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:42,082
There's no mistery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1041
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:43,882
If you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it...

1042
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,363
...you're going to find out you're right.

1043
01:04:45,603 --> 01:04:48,804
Nobody argued with Keaton.
They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

1044
01:04:59,486 --> 01:05:00,367
They're coming up.

1045
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,167
You hear me?
He's coming up.

1046
01:05:04,528 --> 01:05:05,848
He's on his way down.

1047
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:01,462
Don't move.

1048
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:04,062
Press twenty.
Do it now.

1049
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:24,547
Move.

1050
01:06:27,948 --> 01:06:29,108
The answer is no.

1051
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:30,829
Mr. Soze will be most up--

1052
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:33,069
Listen, you cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

1053
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:34,870
You mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

1054
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,711
Strange threat, Mr. Keaton. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

1055
01:06:44,392 --> 01:06:46,953
We know that you
can get to us.

1056
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:49,913
But now you know
that we can get to you.

1057
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:53,434
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

1058
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:54,835
Mr. So--

1059
01:06:55,195 --> 01:06:58,316
My employer has made up
his mind. He does not change it.

1060
01:06:58,676 --> 01:06:59,396
Neither do we.

1061
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,917
You got Fenster.
But you won't get all of us.

1062
01:07:03,197 --> 01:07:04,997
Not before one of us
gets through to you.

1063
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:08,318
I believe you, Mr. McManus.
I most sincerely do.

1064
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:11,719
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

1065
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:13,839
But I cannot make
this decision.

1066
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,520
Whatever you threaten
me with is... ludicrous...

1067
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,721
...in comparsion to what will be done to me
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

1068
01:07:28,323 --> 01:07:30,443
I'm the guy that's
going to get you.

1069
01:07:32,364 --> 01:07:34,484
I just wanted you
to know that.

1070
01:07:35,405 --> 01:07:37,445
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

1071
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:40,086
I implore you, Mr. Keaton,
believe me.

1072
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:43,847
Mr. Soze is very real
and very determined.

1073
01:07:44,087 --> 01:07:45,207
We'll see.

1074
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:55,530
Before you...
...do me in, Mr. McManus...

1075
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,850
...you'll let me finish
my business...

1076
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:59,571
...with Ms. Finneran first,
won't you?

1077
01:08:04,532 --> 01:08:05,932
What did you say?

1078
01:08:07,012 --> 01:08:10,573
Edie Finneran.
She's upstairs in my office.

1079
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,974
For an extradition deposition.

1080
01:08:14,414 --> 01:08:16,975
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

1081
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:18,935
She flew in yesterday.

1082
01:08:20,856 --> 01:08:22,176
No matter.

1083
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:24,537
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

1084
01:08:28,978 --> 01:08:30,298
You're lying.

1085
01:08:30,978 --> 01:08:32,019
Am I?

1086
01:08:48,743 --> 01:08:50,863
Ms. Finneran's escort while
she's here in Los Angeles.

1087
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,784
Never leaves her
side for a moment.

1088
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:56,985
I thought you'd be glad
to know she's in good hands.

1089
01:09:01,306 --> 01:09:03,866
Now get some rest. The boat
will be ready for you on Friday.

1090
01:09:04,146 --> 01:09:06,427
If I see you or any of
your friends before then...

1091
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:08,708
Ms. Finneran will find
herself the victim...

1092
01:09:08,948 --> 01:09:11,148
...of a most gruesome violation
before she dies.

1093
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:13,549
As, indeed, your
father, Mr. Hockney...

1094
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:17,270
...and your uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

1095
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,030
I might only castrate...

1096
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,991
...Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

1097
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:25,712
Do I make myself clear?

1098
01:09:26,552 --> 01:09:28,592
We will take care of
the two bodies downstairs.

1099
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,993
We'll add them to
the cost of Mr. Fenster.

1100
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,074
Now if you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

1101
01:10:10,363 --> 01:10:12,323
Geez. It's a logistical nightmare.

1102
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:15,404
Close quarters. Ten, maybe twenty men.

1103
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:18,125
There's no telling how many
more are gonna be below deck.

1104
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,725
Can we stealth these guys?

1105
01:10:21,405 --> 01:10:23,886
No. With all that coke,
they are going to be ready.

1106
01:10:25,126 --> 01:10:27,407
Which brings me to
sunny point number two.

1107
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:31,368
Even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still get nothing.

1108
01:10:31,568 --> 01:10:32,968
What if we wait for the money?

1109
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,649
Ten more men at least.

1110
01:10:36,129 --> 01:10:39,010
Look, in my opinion
it can't be done.

1111
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:41,250
Anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive.

1112
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,491
I'm gonna wait for the money.

1113
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:44,091
Me too.

1114
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:45,971
Did you hear
what he just said?

1115
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:48,252
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

1116
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:52,093
There's nothing
that can't be done.

1117
01:10:55,254 --> 01:10:57,654
I just can't believe we're just
gonna walk into certain death.

1118
01:11:04,776 --> 01:11:07,137
News said it's raining
in New York.

1119
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,582
What language is that?

1120
01:11:29,782 --> 01:11:32,663
I don't know.
Russian, I think.

1121
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,984
Hungarian?

1122
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:38,919
Package has arrived.

1123
01:12:59,044 --> 01:12:59,884
You kids are ready?

1124
01:13:01,005 --> 01:13:02,405
I would be if I wouldn't have
to stop and answer you.

1125
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:04,646
I'm ready.

1126
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:07,726
McManus, you better be
set up in ten seconds.

1127
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:10,727
I'm ready.

1128
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:13,888
I want you to stay here.

1129
01:13:15,368 --> 01:13:16,408
But I'm supposed to cover--

1130
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:19,369
Listen, if we don't get out of this
I want you to take the money and go.

1131
01:13:20,169 --> 01:13:22,650
Find Edie, tell her what
happened. Tell her everything.

1132
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:24,370
She knows people.
She knows what to do.

1133
01:13:25,011 --> 01:13:27,891
If I don't get Kobayashi
my way, she'll get him her way.

1134
01:13:28,732 --> 01:13:30,052
Just do what I say.

1135
01:13:31,012 --> 01:13:32,132
Please.

1136
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:36,373
Tell her that...

1137
01:13:40,174 --> 01:13:41,815
Tell her I tried.

1138
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:56,658
McManus. He's on his way.

1139
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,259
I'm there.

1140
01:14:56,473 --> 01:14:58,194
Huh. Oswald was a fag.

1141
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,236
Hi.
How are you doing?

1142
01:15:12,117 --> 01:15:14,277
Is there... a problem?

1143
01:15:39,004 --> 01:15:39,724
Now...

1144
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,731
Old McDonald...

1145
01:16:10,011 --> 01:16:11,331
...had a farm...

1146
01:16:11,732 --> 01:16:14,012
...ee-aye, ee-aye, oh.

1147
01:16:14,932 --> 01:16:18,853
And on that farm
he shot some guys...

1148
01:16:19,253 --> 01:16:21,854
...ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing,
bang-boom.

1149
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:52,742
Elvis has left the building.

1150
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:11,496
Why didn't you run?

1151
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,376
I froze up.

1152
01:19:14,537 --> 01:19:17,257
I thought about Fenster and how
he looked when we buried him.

1153
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:20,698
And I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

1154
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,580
A boy came across a body on the beach
this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned...

1155
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:33,661
...shot twice in the head. Two guys
from the Bureau just identified him.

1156
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:34,501
What else?

1157
01:19:34,701 --> 01:19:37,662
His name was Arturo Marquez,
a petty smuggler from Argentina.

1158
01:19:37,862 --> 01:19:40,503
He was arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

1159
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:44,024
He escaped to California.
They picked him up in Long Beach...

1160
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:47,425
...they're setting up
extradition - he escapes again.

1161
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:48,865
Now, get this...

1162
01:19:49,065 --> 01:19:52,306
Edie Finneran is brought in
to advice in the proceedings.

1163
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:53,746
Kobayashi.

1164
01:19:53,946 --> 01:19:57,027
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony. He was a rat.

1165
01:19:57,227 --> 01:19:58,267
A big fucking rat.

1166
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:01,068
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1167
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:05,069
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

1168
01:20:05,269 --> 01:20:07,510
Guess who he named in finale?

1169
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,830
Keyser Soze.

1170
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,391
There's more.

1171
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:27,034
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1172
01:20:28,675 --> 01:20:31,035
There was no dope on that boat.

1173
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:12,125
Stay quiet!

1174
01:21:12,486 --> 01:21:15,206
He's here!
I know he's here!

1175
01:21:16,006 --> 01:21:17,887
That's him!
I'm telling you that's him!

1176
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:19,807
I know he's here!

1177
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:23,208
You don't understand.
That's him...

1178
01:21:23,408 --> 01:21:24,528
- Shut up!
- That's him, you hear me?

1179
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:27,449
I'm telling you
it's Keyser Soze!

1180
01:23:22,077 --> 01:23:24,918
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know. There's no coke!

1181
01:23:26,318 --> 01:23:28,519
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck. There's no coke!

1182
01:23:28,999 --> 01:23:32,040
I checked the entire ship!
I've been in every fucking room!

1183
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,520
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1184
01:23:34,761 --> 01:23:36,041
Nothing!

1185
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:37,721
You're fucking me!

1186
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:41,602
There is... no... fucking... coke!

1187
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:53,685
I'm outta here.

1188
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:34,935
I told them nothing.

1189
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:37,256
I swear.

1190
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:40,137
I told them nothing.
Please!

1191
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,508
McManus?
What the fuck is going on?

1192
01:25:29,869 --> 01:25:31,669
Strangest thing...

1193
01:26:23,962 --> 01:26:26,843
That's what you said in your statement:
"A man in a suit with a slim build."

1194
01:26:27,043 --> 01:26:27,643
Wait a minute.

1195
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:30,284
I don't have a minute.
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1196
01:26:30,484 --> 01:26:32,284
You told the D.A. you
didn't know who it was!

1197
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:34,125
I know there was
dope on that boat.

1198
01:26:34,325 --> 01:26:35,605
- Stop stalling, Verbal!
- I'm not stalling!

1199
01:26:35,805 --> 01:26:38,046
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1200
01:26:38,246 --> 01:26:40,246
I've got immunity, I don't
have to take that shit.

1201
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:42,207
You know... what
I'm getting at, Verbal.

1202
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:43,127
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1203
01:26:43,647 --> 01:26:44,847
Yes you do... the truth!

1204
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:47,928
- Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
- I don't know what you're talking about. I did!

1205
01:26:48,168 --> 01:26:49,488
You're lying to me!

1206
01:26:49,808 --> 01:26:52,009
You know. You've known
this whole fucking time!

1207
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:55,170
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

1208
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:58,251
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun! Why didn't you help him?

1209
01:26:58,531 --> 01:26:59,811
He was your friend!

1210
01:27:03,972 --> 01:27:05,932
Because I was afraid.
Ok? Afraid!

1211
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:10,013
Afraid of what?

1212
01:27:11,654 --> 01:27:13,334
I know it was Keyser Soze!

1213
01:27:13,974 --> 01:27:17,255
It was Keyser Soze.
I mean, Agent Kujan, the devil himself.

1214
01:27:18,736 --> 01:27:21,016
How do you shoot
the devil in the back?

1215
01:27:25,577 --> 01:27:27,138
What if you miss?

1216
01:27:31,699 --> 01:27:33,979
All right.
Let's get back to the pier.

1217
01:28:53,799 --> 01:28:55,439
Arturo Marquez.
Ever hear of him?

1218
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:56,880
What? No.

1219
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,761
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

1220
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:05,162
He swore out a statement to
Federal Marshals saying that he had seen...

1221
01:29:05,602 --> 01:29:07,002
...and could positively
identify one Keyser Soze.

1222
01:29:07,282 --> 01:29:10,723
It says right here in the report.
He had intimate knowledge of his businesses...

1223
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:12,764
...including, but not exclusive to...

1224
01:29:13,084 --> 01:29:14,644
...drug trafficking and murder.

1225
01:29:14,884 --> 01:29:17,605
- I never heard of him.
- His own people were selling him...

1226
01:29:17,845 --> 01:29:18,725
...to a gang of Hungarians.

1227
01:29:19,165 --> 01:29:22,446
Most likely the same Hungarians that
Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1228
01:29:22,846 --> 01:29:24,006
The money wasn't there for dope.

1229
01:29:24,647 --> 01:29:26,847
The Hungarians were
going to buy the one guy...

1230
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:28,808
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1231
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,208
I said I never heard of him.

1232
01:29:30,528 --> 01:29:31,248
But Keaton did.

1233
01:29:31,608 --> 01:29:32,328
Edie Finneran was...

1234
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:34,249
...Marquez' extradition advisor.

1235
01:29:34,809 --> 01:29:36,129
She knew who he was
and what he knew.

1236
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:39,010
- I don't und--
- There were no drugs on that boat.

1237
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:42,691
It was a hit. A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1238
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:44,892
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1239
01:29:45,252 --> 01:29:46,972
So Soze put some thiefs to it.

1240
01:29:47,572 --> 01:29:49,613
Men he knew he could
march into certain death.

1241
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,373
You say Soze sent us
to kill someone?

1242
01:29:53,494 --> 01:29:54,214
I'm saying Keaton did.

1243
01:29:54,694 --> 01:29:56,094
Verbal, he left you
behind for a reason.

1244
01:29:56,414 --> 01:29:58,055
Just do what I tell you.

1245
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:01,176
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1246
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:04,816
...why did he give you the money to run?
He could have used you on the boat.

1247
01:30:05,216 --> 01:30:06,217
He wanted me to live.

1248
01:30:07,937 --> 01:30:09,738
A one time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world...

1249
01:30:10,018 --> 01:30:12,138
...finds it that it's hard to save...

1250
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,619
...a worthless rat-cripple

1251
01:30:13,899 --> 01:30:14,979
No, sir!
Why?

1252
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:16,819
Edie!

1253
01:30:17,019 --> 01:30:19,420
I don't buy that reform
story for a minute!

1254
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,061
Even if I did, I certainly
don't believe...

1255
01:30:22,301 --> 01:30:25,501
...he would send you to protect her.
So why?

1256
01:30:28,262 --> 01:30:29,903
Because he was my friend!

1257
01:30:30,183 --> 01:30:32,543
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.

1258
01:30:32,783 --> 01:30:34,104
Keaton didn't have friends!

1259
01:30:34,384 --> 01:30:35,184
What are you doing here?

1260
01:30:35,424 --> 01:30:36,384
He saved you...

1261
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:39,065
...because he wanted it that way!
It was his will.

1262
01:30:39,785 --> 01:30:42,146
- Keaton was Keyser Soze!
- No!

1263
01:30:42,466 --> 01:30:44,186
The kind of man who could
wrangle the wills of men...

1264
01:30:44,466 --> 01:30:45,586
...like Hockney and McManus.

1265
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:46,507
The kind of man...

1266
01:30:46,747 --> 01:30:48,627
...who could engineer
a police line-up...

1267
01:30:48,907 --> 01:30:50,628
...from all his years
of contacts in N.Y.P.D. .

1268
01:30:51,228 --> 01:30:53,348
The kind of man that could
have killed Edie Finneran!

1269
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:00,910
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania.

1270
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,951
Shot twice in the head.

1271
01:31:07,592 --> 01:31:09,672
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

1272
01:31:11,233 --> 01:31:13,993
- Edie...
- He used all of you...

1273
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,154
...to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone...

1274
01:31:16,354 --> 01:31:19,355
...he had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

1275
01:31:19,555 --> 01:31:21,955
The one man that could identify him.

1276
01:31:22,996 --> 01:31:24,636
This is all bullshit...

1277
01:31:24,876 --> 01:31:26,677
You said you saw him die?

1278
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:30,037
Or did you?

1279
01:31:30,397 --> 01:31:32,278
You had to hide when you
first heard the police cars.

1280
01:31:32,598 --> 01:31:34,839
You said you heard
the shot before the fire.

1281
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:37,319
But you didn't see him die.

1282
01:31:37,599 --> 01:31:38,920
I knew him.
He would never--

1283
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,280
He programmed you!

1284
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,760
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to!

1285
01:31:43,001 --> 01:31:44,961
He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.

1286
01:31:45,161 --> 01:31:47,962
Where was the political pressure coming from?
Why were you being protected?

1287
01:31:48,162 --> 01:31:50,842
It was Keaton!
Immunity was your reward!

1288
01:31:51,123 --> 01:31:52,683
Why me?

1289
01:31:53,163 --> 01:31:55,044
Why not Fenster or
McManus or Hockney?

1290
01:31:55,244 --> 01:31:57,604
Why me? I'm stupid,
I'm a cripple! Why me?

1291
01:31:57,844 --> 01:31:59,165
Because you're
a cripple, Verbal.

1292
01:31:59,685 --> 01:32:03,045
Because you're stupid.
Because you're weaker than them.

1293
01:32:07,527 --> 01:32:08,687
If he's dead...

1294
01:32:09,247 --> 01:32:12,488
...if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1295
01:32:14,448 --> 01:32:17,089
It was his idea to hit the
taxi service in New York, wasn't it?

1296
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:18,489
Come on, tell me
the truth.

1297
01:32:18,729 --> 01:32:20,290
It was all Keaton!

1298
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:24,331
We followed him
from the beginning.

1299
01:32:25,771 --> 01:32:26,731
I didn't know.

1300
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:29,252
I saw him die.

1301
01:32:29,772 --> 01:32:32,813
I believe he's dead.
Oh, Christ!

1302
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:35,493
You're not safe
on your own.

1303
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:40,655
You think he's--

1304
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:42,415
Keyser Soze?

1305
01:32:43,295 --> 01:32:44,856
I don't know, Verbal.

1306
01:32:46,336 --> 01:32:49,817
Keyser Soze is a shield.
Like you said, a spook story.

1307
01:32:51,177 --> 01:32:54,618
But I know Keaton.
And someone is out there pulling strings for you.

1308
01:32:55,298 --> 01:32:56,499
Stay here and
let us protect you.

1309
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:58,659
No way. I'm not bait.
I post today.

1310
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:00,140
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1311
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,740
Capt. Leo wants you
out of here A.S.A.P. ...

1312
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,821
- ...unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances, thank you.

1313
01:33:06,181 --> 01:33:09,542
If someone wants to get you...
they're gonna get you out there.

1314
01:33:09,782 --> 01:33:12,983
Turn states evidence.
You might never see trial.

1315
01:33:13,223 --> 01:33:14,543
May be so.

1316
01:33:15,943 --> 01:33:18,104
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1317
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:35,508
Fucking cops.

1318
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:01,074
Excuse me.
Can I use your fax machine?

1319
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:06,636
You have to sign for these.

1320
01:34:09,517 --> 01:34:11,277
One watch, gold.

1321
01:34:11,557 --> 01:34:13,518
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1322
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:16,238
And a pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1323
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:18,999
You still got nothing, Dave.

1324
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:21,399
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1325
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,080
Just nothing.

1326
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,601
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1327
01:34:27,441 --> 01:34:30,042
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1328
01:34:30,282 --> 01:34:32,882
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.

1329
01:34:33,482 --> 01:34:35,083
I'll find him.

1330
01:34:35,643 --> 01:34:37,203
Waste of time.

1331
01:34:39,684 --> 01:34:42,165
A rumor is not a rumor
that doesn't die.

1332
01:34:42,485 --> 01:34:43,485
What?

1333
01:34:44,605 --> 01:34:45,445
Nothing.

1334
01:34:47,446 --> 01:34:49,006
Man, you're a slob.

1335
01:34:49,206 --> 01:34:51,967
Yeah, but all has a system, Dave.

1336
01:34:52,407 --> 01:34:55,848
It all makes sense when you look at it right.
You've got to stand back from it, you know?

1337
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,729
You want to see a real horror show?
You should see my garage.

1338
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:38,418
Convince me. And tell me every last detail...

1339
01:35:38,819 --> 01:35:40,939
You know, back when I was in that
barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

1340
01:35:41,379 --> 01:35:42,659
Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

1341
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:43,900
What we need to do is think.

1342
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,020
Think back.

1343
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:46,540
I'm sure you've heard many tall tales...

1344
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,141
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

1345
01:35:48,421 --> 01:35:49,421
- I just want to hear your story.
- Tell me every last detail.

1346
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:51,982
It's all there.
And I'm telling it all straight, I swear.

1347
01:35:52,462 --> 01:35:54,222
- Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
- A gift...

1348
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:56,143
- ...from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me, Verbal.

1349
01:35:56,623 --> 01:35:57,703
What about Redfoot?

1350
01:35:58,063 --> 01:35:59,464
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

1351
01:36:00,064 --> 01:36:02,584
- ...using pawns...
- Big, fat guy. I mean, like orca-fat.

1352
01:36:06,265 --> 01:36:09,226
Back when I was picking beans in
Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee...

1353
01:36:09,586 --> 01:36:10,786
...he was a good man...

1354
01:36:11,106 --> 01:36:11,787
I know he was good.

1355
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:16,388
Tell me every last detail.

1356
01:36:16,628 --> 01:36:17,228
Strangest thing.

1357
01:36:17,508 --> 01:36:18,828
How do you shoot
the devil in the back?

1358
01:36:19,348 --> 01:36:20,949
...this guy is protected
from up on high...

1359
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:22,469
...by the prince
of darkness.

1360
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:24,270
What about it, pretzel-man?
What's your story.

1361
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:26,310
- There was a lawyer...
- What lawyer, Verbal?

1362
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:28,031
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

1363
01:36:29,591 --> 01:36:31,031
Tell me every last detail.

1364
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:32,472
I work for Keyser Soze.

1365
01:36:32,672 --> 01:36:34,712
Convince me.

1366
01:36:49,556 --> 01:36:53,517
Every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1367
01:36:54,117 --> 01:36:55,597
The cripple!
Did you see him?

1368
01:36:55,837 --> 01:36:57,278
The cripple!
Which way did he go?

1369
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,638
Oh, he went out that way.

1370
01:36:58,918 --> 01:37:01,159
I know you know something.

1371
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,039
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I want to know...

1372
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:04,720
...wether you like it or not.

1373
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:08,040
To a cop the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

1374
01:37:08,881 --> 01:37:11,081
There's no mistery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1375
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:13,442
Somebody with power...

1376
01:37:13,642 --> 01:37:15,682
Keyser Soze!

1377
01:37:16,843 --> 01:37:21,084
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

1378
01:37:22,644 --> 01:37:25,445
Because you're stupid, Verbal!
Because you're a cripple!

1379
01:37:25,645 --> 01:37:26,885
What I want to know
is who's the gimp.

1380
01:37:27,085 --> 01:37:29,286
You know.
You've known the whole fucking time!

1381
01:37:30,086 --> 01:37:31,926
If he comes up for anything,
it will be to get rid of me.

1382
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:36,567
I can't feel my legs... Keyser.

1383
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,968
First thing I learned on the job,
you know what it was?

1384
01:37:40,328 --> 01:37:43,289
He mentioned Keyser Soze?

1385
01:37:44,009 --> 01:37:45,090
Who?

1386
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,770
After that...

1387
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:49,931
...my guess is you'll never
hear from him again.

1388
01:38:09,816 --> 01:38:12,016
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

1389
01:38:12,216 --> 01:38:14,737
...was convincing the
world he didn't exist.

1390
01:38:16,777 --> 01:38:17,698
And like that...

1391
01:38:19,418 --> 01:38:20,978
...he's gone.
