4
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:54,726
Oh, don't you worry
about a thing, <i>mon chérie.</i>

5
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:55,843
I got you covered.

6
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:58,146
Oh...

7
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:01,444
Cora, what's gotten into you today?
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:03,809
I-It's just Henry's
first day of high school.

9
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,727
De La Salle.
The white school?

10
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,763
It's integrated.
Earl and I

11
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,147
decided to take a chance.

12
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,298
Give our son the
best opportunity.

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,933
Mm...

14
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:15,154
You're taking
a big chance, I fear.

15
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:16,572
Oh, times are changing, Marie.

16
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:18,724
President Kennedy's
in the White House.

17
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:19,859
Yeah?

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,952
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:23,094
And the White Citizens'
Council of New Orleans

20
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:25,949
warned the city about the
Congolese raping their daughters.

21
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,367
Oh...

22
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:28,501
And the Burr Heads being forced

23
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:29,752
into their schools.

24
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:31,621
I have faith in the future.

Oh, God!

Oh...

28
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:42,349
Get away from Henry!

29
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,486
Get away from my boy!

00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,654

31
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,856

(Cora wails)

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,811
Look what they done to you.

34
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,415
(sobbing)

35
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,316

MAN:

00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,035
Nobody else was gonna help us.

40
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,970
Governor did all he could.

41
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,722

they just keep coming.

FIONA:
Oh. Ooh.

00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,474
FIONA (faintly):
Now I give it to you.

66
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:57,392
Don't be afraid. Use it.

67
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,147
Kill me for the sake
of your coven.

68
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:00,365
MADISON:
No.

69
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:01,649
FIONA:
Yes.

70
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,816
Come on.

71
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,486
Don't be afraid, do it.
Come on, now, do it!

72
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:06,438
MADISON:
I can't!

73
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:08,506
FIONA:
Yes, you can, you stupid girl!

74
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:09,525
MADISON:
No!

75
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,717
FIONA: Do it and feel
my power flow into you!

76
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,878
I know because I was standing
(Madison gasps)

77
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,365
where you're standing!

78
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:16,480
Stop yelling at me!

79
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,049
Do it! Do it!
No!

80
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:20,302
Do it! Do it!

(gasps)

82
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:37,199
She would've made
a lousy Supreme.

83
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:38,722
And that is something

84
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,338
this coven just can't afford

85
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,706
at this moment in history.

86
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,738
It's my duty to stay vital.

87
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:16,934
Huh.

88
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,495
Oh, Spalding...

89
00:07:21,322 --> 00:07:23,118
I must confess...

90
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:28,835
...I've always enjoyed
our little talks together.

91
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,588
Particularly

92
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,373
since you lost your tongue.

93
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,843
It makes you seem...

94
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,429
wiser, somehow.

95
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:41,714
More thoughtful.

96
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,666
(glass shattering)

97
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,518
(Queenie screaming)

98
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:47,503
Deal with that.

99
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,176

00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,945

101
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,281
Cordelia?

00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:05,321
(moans)
(cries out)

103
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:06,222
(moans)

104
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,374
I couldn't stop it.

105
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,960
Jesus, what happened?

106
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:13,630
It hurt me really badly.

107
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:14,914
What? What hurt you?

108
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,867
Oh, God...

109
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,969
(low snarling)

110
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:26,976
Get up.

111
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,145
Cordelia, get up.
I need your help.

112
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,790
CORDELIA:
My God, what happened?

113
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,886
This girl was attacked

114
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:38,812
near to death while you slept.

115
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,059
By who?

116
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:41,991
FIONA:
Not who. By <i>what.</i>

117
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,777
Some minion of hell or other.

118
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:45,945
Summoned by who?

119
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,282
Not one of our girls?

120
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,365
Oh, Christ, our girls couldn't

121
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,250
pull a rabbit out of a hat.

122
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,235
This was dark art voodoo,

123
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:54,420
flat out.

124
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:55,672
Marie Laveau.

125
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:57,674
No doubt.

126
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:00,130
This is your fault.

127
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,628
You went to see her.

128
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:03,463
You deliberately provoked her.

129
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:05,414
FIONA:
How would you know that?

130
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,716
Because she told me.

131
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,717
FIONA:
Yeah?

132
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:08,935
And what were you doing

133
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,470
over that side of town?

134
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:12,255
It was a personal matter.

135
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,607
Christ, Delia!

136
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:15,808
Is that where you were

137
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,426
sneaking off to this afternoon?

138
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:20,313
To the voodoos for some
half-assed fertility spell?

139
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,950
Her <i>Pochaut Medecine?</i>

140
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,451
Huh?

141
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:27,153
How much did she take you for?

142
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:29,822
Nothing, thanks to you.

143
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:31,374
I left there with nothing.

144
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:33,109
Yeah, not even your dignity.

145
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,778
Christ. You as much
as announced

146
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:38,164
that her magic was stronger
than yours. Or mine!

147
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,583
Don't you try to put this on me.
You went there first.

148
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:44,220
I went there to show strength.

149
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:47,340
And you undermined me

150
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:49,792
by showing belly.

151
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:50,894
Mother?

152
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:53,897
She's not breathing.

153
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,600
Move.

154
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,908
(exhales)

155
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:12,315
(exhales)

156
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,150
(Queenie gasps)

157
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,285
(Queenie groans)

158
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,624
I got a heartbeat.

159
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,927
But maybe

160
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:25,011
we should get her
to a hospital.

161
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,380
No, that is out of the question.

162
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:30,266
From now on, we handle
everything internally.

163
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:31,467
The last thing you want

164
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,519
is to have the Council

165
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,054
show up on your doorstep

166
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,440
and question your competence.

167
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,994
Get out of there.

168
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:09,722
She saved me...

169
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,392
that black girl.

170
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:15,895
That monster, it was Bastien.

171
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,264
And the voodoo queen sent him
here for me.

172
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,883
(chuckles) What do you
think, I don't know that?

173
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:26,272
Just keep that information
to yourself, you understand?

174
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:27,490
And get out of here.

175
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,565
What if he comes back?

176
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,501
(chuckles)

177
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:40,953
(softly):
He won't.

178
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,468
(door closes)

179
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,804
LAVEAU:
Mm-hmm!

180
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,690
All right, Miss Cora.

181
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:03,059
(laughs)
Are you ready to be dazzled?

182
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,360
You know I am!

183
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,062
(both laugh)

184
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:09,615
Oh-ho!

185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,118
Cora, you look beautiful.
LAVEAU: She better.

186
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,954
Miss Cora got a invite
to the Mayor's mansion tonight

187
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,739
for the annual Halloween Ball.

188
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,908
Marie dragged my nappy head
in here.

189
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,877
Hey, if your hair's nappy,
white people ain't happy.

190
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,161
(all laugh)
True that.

191
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:25,748
(doorbell buzzing)

192
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,800
Now I want to pay you
this time.

193
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,303
Uh-uh, you keep your
money in your purse.

194
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:32,588
Oh.

195
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,424
(voice breaks):
You too good to me.

196
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,062
Hey, what's that?

197
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,514
We're not expecting hair
from India till next month.

198
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:43,099
It's not from India.

199
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,401
Some freak dropped it off,
didn't say a word.

200
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,737
All right.
Well, open it up.

201
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:54,777
Oh, my God!

202
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,249
(gasps)
No!

203
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,619
No...!

204
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:14,881
Kyle, no!

205
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,802
Kyle...

206
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:24,273
No, Kyle.

207
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:42,875
(sobs)
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,462
I'm so, so sorry.

209
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,498
I didn't mean for it to happen,
any of it.

210
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,868
(sobs, sniffles)

211
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,644
(sobs)

212
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,548
Are you hungry?

213
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,683
God-God, you must be so hungry.

214
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,734
I'm going to... I'm going
to go make you something.

215
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,018
(sets bowl on counter)

216
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,392
Oh, shit.

217
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:02,989
(children chattering happily)

218
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,221
FIONA:
<i>Delphine?</i>

219
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:22,575
Come do me.

220
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,993
Do you know why

221
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:27,063
today is my favorite
day of the year?

222
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,165
It's Halloween.

223
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,567
Is it the end of harvest
already?

224
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,836
Land sakes.

225
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:36,072
I suppose you'll want me
lighting the bonfires

226
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:38,791
and putting out food
to keep the demons at bay.

227
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:41,077
Evil spirits will walk
the earth this night.

228
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:44,347
The dead shall rise
and fearful pranks ensue

229
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,598
should we fail
to protect ourselves.

230
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,184
Oh, Christ, just zip it.

231
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:53,639
(gasps)

232
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,108
Miss Fiona,

233
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,258
you look...

234
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,644
Younger?

235
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,931
I was gonna say beautiful.

236
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:03,316
Oh.

237
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:07,269
Well, both are correct.

238
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,872
And as far as
silly superstitions,

239
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,824
you're behind the times.

240
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,443
Bonfires have become
jack-o'-lanterns

241
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,945
and harvest offerings,

242
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,548
just candy.

243
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:19,632
Do they work?

244
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:21,501
You'll see.

245
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:23,803
Tonight I'm gonna let
the whole world in.

246
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:26,556
Get a good look at me.

247
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,227
Who's the baddest witch
in town?

248
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:41,737
This doesn't concern you.
It does so concern me.

249
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:43,156
If you start a war
with those white bitches...

250
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,474
Me start it?

251
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:48,477
You saw what she did to Bastien.

252
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,863
We had ten years
of trouble, Marie.

253
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:52,999
You weren't even born yet.

254
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,700
Yes, but I grew up
on those stories.

255
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:56,318
Stories about heartbreak

256
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,487
and blood running
through the streets!

257
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,839
Yeah, their blood.

258
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,842
I used it to paint
my dayroom brick red.

259
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:06,012
You were the hero of that story.

260
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:09,632
You sat across from them
and you made peace.

261
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:18,057
<i>They had their territory,</i>
<i>we had ours.</i>

262
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:19,609
<i>Neither side crossed</i>
<i>into the other.</i>

263
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:24,513
<i>No more bloodshed</i>
<i>at one another's hands.</i>

264
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,567
<i>The rest of the world</i>
<i>was cruel enough.</i>

265
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:31,187
Chantal, I know you mean well,

266
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:33,990
but the truce is over.

267
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,876
If we don't fight back,
we may as well lay down

268
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,078
in our beds and wait for death,
because that's what's at stake.

269
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:41,414
And I don't have time

270
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:42,915
to argue with you.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,834
Either you're with me
or against me.

272
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:47,086
And if it's the latter,

273
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:50,940
you best stay out of my way.

274
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,509
CORDELIA:
<i>How's Baton Rouge?</i>

275
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,878
I hate it when you take
foreman jobs out of town.

276
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,847
You know we need the money.

277
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:00,216
What time's your meeting
with Phil Underwood?

278
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,717
(knocking)

279
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:04,520
Oh, actually,
he's here right now.

280
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,689
Call you later.
Okay.

281
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:15,448
Kaylee.

282
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:18,834
(both laugh)

283
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,374
(gasping)

284
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:29,078
(grunting)

285
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:37,887
(Hank yells)

286
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,940
(sighs)

287
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:44,277
(both laugh)

288
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:48,648
(groans)

289
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,950
Happy Halloween.

290
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:52,902
(both sigh)

291
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:54,770
Man...

292
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,874
I always dress up
for Halloween.

293
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,777
It's my favorite holiday.

294
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,665
When I was a little girl,

295
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:07,466
I used to love the candy.

296
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,285
(chuckles)

297
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:13,889
I think Halloween gives people
the permission

298
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:17,093
to be who they
really want to be.

299
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,232
Do you dress up?

300
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,235
Who were you last year?

301
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:28,137
Me?

302
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,741
I was a monster.

303
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,997
Come on, Queenie.

304
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,616
Come on.

305
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:45,588
(gasps)

306
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:46,822
Shh-shh-shh,

307
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:48,157
it's okay.

308
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,925
Hey, hey now.

309
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,493
Am I dead?

310
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:52,795
No, honey, you're not dead.

311
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:56,665
Let me get you a fresh towel.

312
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:10,946
I don't know how to thank you
for saving my life.

313
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:14,283
I guess you'll just have
to work on that then, huh?

314
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:26,712
They're here.

315
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:28,381
The girls are back?

316
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:30,499
Not the girls.

317
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,504
(gates creak)

318
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,054
Wow.

319
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:58,077
I had no idea the Council
would be joining us today.

320
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,945
(whispers):
How screwed am I?

321
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,447
Mm, just breathe.

322
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,033
Council on Witchcraft assembles

323
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,567
only under the gravest
circumstances.

324
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:08,120
And who doesn't love a surprise?

325
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,539
I can guess why you're here.

326
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:15,010
Last night's assault on Queenie
was a horrific tragedy,

327
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:17,413
but I can assure you
she is resting comfortably.

328
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:19,248
Assault?

329
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,417
Elaborate, elucidate.

330
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,269
I didn't see it myself, but...

331
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:25,388
By who?
Well, what, actually.

332
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,892
Something not altogether human.

333
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,143
You should have alerted us
at once.

334
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,778
Yes, I was going to.

335
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:34,146
I just...

336
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:36,198
Yes.

337
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,484
WITCH:
That's not why we're here.

338
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,153
Something potentially far more
grave has come to our attention.

339
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:42,905
Oh, God.

340
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,373
I should never have gone
over there.

341
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,910
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

342
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,797
Shit.

343
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:54,250
You might as well know.

344
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:56,302
I went to Marie Laveau.

345
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:59,455
But it was never my intention
to violate the truce.

346
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:02,308
I see, well, perhaps
we should all sit down.

347
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:05,344
Actually, don't get
too comfortable.

348
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,646
And you? Stop talking.

349
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:11,066
Fiona, it's been a long time.

350
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:13,802
Oh, Myrtle Snow.

351
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,304
Look at you.

352
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,822
Developing a sense of style

353
00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:18,441
when no one
was paying attention.

354
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,811
Quentin, you vicious
old queen, hmm.

355
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,447
(giggles)

356
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:26,115
What's it take for a girl

357
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,533
to get her phone call returned?

358
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:29,535
Oh, my life is pure torment.

359
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,170
One book signing after another.

360
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:33,038
Travel, travel, travel.

361
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,791
It's like get me off
of the best seller list already.

362
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,627
Just remember
whose magic it was

363
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:41,347
that put you there.
Fiona...

364
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,515
you're a caution.

365
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,766
(laughs)

366
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,385
(sighs)

367
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,836
Pembroke.

368
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:51,891
(short laugh) So...

369
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,310
you old hens...

370
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:57,863
what have you come
to cluck about?

371
00:22:57,948 --> 00:23:00,115
We were summoned
by one of your students.

372
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,153
Which one?

373
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:05,571
NAN: Me.
(footsteps approach)

374
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,075
I can't hear her anymore.

375
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,693
Madison?

376
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:13,162
I think she's dead.

377
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,968
That's why we're here.

378
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:32,848
MYRTLE:
<i>Let the record show</i>

379
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:35,317
the official inquiry
into the disappearance

380
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,603
of our sister witch
Madison Montgomery

381
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:39,054
has commenced.

382
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:40,105
Noted.

383
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,657
MYRTLE:
And the penalty

384
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,242
for inflicting
grievous bodily harm

385
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:46,445
against a Salem descendent
can be but one--

386
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,230
death by fire.

387
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,866
Miss Foxx?

388
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:53,168
When was the last time you saw
or spoke with Madison?

389
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:54,403
Yesterday.

390
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:56,238
Madison is a spirited girl.

391
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:59,041
The fact that she stayed out
all night is hardly a shocker.

392
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:00,259
So it's not unusual
for you to lose track

393
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:01,710
of your charges

394
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,440
for extended periods of time?

395
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,764
No, that's not...

396
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,050
Do you read <i>TMZ?</i>

397
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,185
Madison's already spent
more time with us

398
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:12,972
than any rehab facility
she's been sentenced to.

399
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,106
She's a special case.

400
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,090
Did she give the impression

401
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,559
of being a particularly

402
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,477
powerful witch?

403
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:20,662
I mean, she's a movie star.

404
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:22,047
So she's got
that thing, you know?

405
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,298
No, we don't.

406
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,492
What thing?

407
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:26,718
That thing you lack, darling.

408
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,421
Charisma.

409
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,006
QUEENIE:
<i>Madison Montgomery</i>

410
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:33,341
is a stone-cold bitch
who loves hard drinking,

411
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:36,144
big dicks and trouble.

412
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:38,229
If she's dead, it's probably
'cause she got wasted

413
00:24:38,314 --> 00:24:41,599
and offered the Grim Reaper
a hand job or something.

414
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:44,052
(slurping)
MYRTLE: <i>Before her disappearance,</i>

415
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:47,272
was Madison manifesting
any powers,

416
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:50,275
new ones, rapidly accumulating?

417
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,027
CORDELIA:
<i>New powers? No.</i>

418
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:54,029
Mostly we were concentrating
on helping her

419
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,365
control her telekinesis,
not developing new skills.

420
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,417
Where's my rug?

421
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,402
NAN:
<i>Yeah, she had powers all right.</i>

422
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:03,071
Lots of them.

423
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:05,457
She set the neighbor's
curtains on fire.

424
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:06,875
How did she do that?

425
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:08,743
By looking at them.

426
00:25:08,794 --> 00:25:10,345
It was awesome.

427
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:12,511
Who else knew about this?

428
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,677
(music playing on radio)

429
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,616
You brought soup?

430
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,518
There's a vending machine
in the lobby.

431
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,631
It sells all kinds of stuff.

432
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:31,665
Soup...

433
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:32,833
(microwave beeps)

434
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:34,802
Burritos.

435
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:37,104
Can you imagine?
I mean...

436
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:38,472
in my town...

437
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,841
all you could get
from a vending machine

438
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:43,611
was pop and Reese's.

439
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:45,946
I was in a place
in San Diego once

440
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:48,816
where they had sushi
in the vending machines.

441
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,118
The raw fish stuff?

442
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:54,038
That sounds disgusting
even when it's fresh.

443
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:56,157
(laughs)

444
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,826
I always wanted
to go to San Diego.

445
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:00,544
See the zoo.

446
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:01,996
You're quite the world traveler.

447
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,915
Work takes me
to some pretty cool places.

448
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,917
And some crappy ones, too.

449
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:10,387
Mr. Big Shot USDA Agent.

450
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,890
(chuckles)
They call us inspectors, not agents.

451
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:15,059
I'm not a spy.

452
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:18,562
You got an online girlfriend
in every port, 007?

453
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,232
You getting possessive already?

454
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:22,566
No.

455
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:23,934
No, I know you.

456
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,853
I know you're not like that.

457
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:33,110
(grunts)

458
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:37,364
To think I found you
in an online community dedicated

459
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:40,000
to collecting Thomas
Kinkade paintings.

460
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:42,620
(music grows louder)
Hey, to be fair, I found you.

461
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:45,256
Yeah.

462
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,291
You played it smart though.

463
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,261
It was like you knew you had me

464
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:51,745
before I even responded.

465
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:54,748
Other guys online
come on so strong,

466
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,918
so fast. It's like... ten
minutes in and they want

467
00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:01,138
to see a picture of my boobs
or something.

468
00:27:01,223 --> 00:27:03,590
You were...

469
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:05,392
cool as a cucumber.

470
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:07,261
James Bond, right?

471
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,563
Yeah.

472
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:12,983
Well, shit.
(chuckles)

473
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:15,286
What?

474
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,405
I really like you.

475
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:23,327
Is that a problem?

476
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,546
It is if you're gonna
break my heart.

477
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:27,114
Mm.

478
00:27:29,284 --> 00:27:30,584
(chuckles)

479
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,003
(silenced gunshot)

480
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:42,062
You must think
you're very clever.

481
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,848
I do. I do think
I'm very clever.

482
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,768
I am, after all, the Supreme.

483
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,737
Sadly, you are.

484
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:52,323
Though given the state
of this coven and this school,

485
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:54,074
one could be forgiven
for thinking

486
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:56,994
we've been without a Supreme
for the past 40 years.

487
00:27:57,078 --> 00:28:00,164
If you don't like
the way I run things,

488
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:02,916
take it up with the Council.

489
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:05,419
But that's just it:
you don't run things,

490
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,154
you run off.

491
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:09,757
You were absent from last year's
Summit Gathering,

492
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:12,676
three Winter Petitions
remain unsigned

493
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:16,513
and you've failed to appoint a
new Chancellor in over a decade.

494
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:18,716
Has it been that long?

495
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,100
The role of Supreme

496
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:21,802
is more than a figurehead.

497
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:24,838
You must be present for
the betterment of our people,

498
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,774
not just off jet-setting
around the globe

499
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:29,509
to sate your vulgar,
licentious appetites.

500
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:30,978
You go!
FIONA: What's your point, Myrt?

501
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:33,013
Why now, Fiona?

502
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:35,032
Why come back now?

503
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:36,683
I'm sorry.

504
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:41,155
I'm either confused
or really bored, but...

505
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:45,692
am I a rotten Supreme
because I stayed away or...

506
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,961
because I came back?

507
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,381
This is the second time
while you were under this roof

508
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:52,383
that a witch has gone missing
from this place.

509
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,718
And in both instances,
you were the last one

510
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:56,720
to see either one of them alive.

511
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,373
(crying):
Please. She...She's still alive.

512
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:01,558
She has to be.

513
00:29:01,643 --> 00:29:04,428
WOMAN: We all grieve
Anna Leigh, Fiona.

514
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:07,097
But, together,
none of the witches or warlocks

515
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,983
of the Council can detect
her life force.

516
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,653
We must assume the worst.

517
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:15,823
MAN:
<i>You say she was...</i>

518
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,575
heading somewhere
when she spoke to you.

519
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,363
Did she give you
any indication as to where?

520
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:27,584
But she took a fine bottle
of wine with her.

521
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,038
She said it was
a final peace offering.

522
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:35,092
Anna Leigh recently
negotiated a truce

523
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,594
with Marie Laveau,
the voodoo queen.

524
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,765
You don't suspect the colored
witches are involved in this?

525
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,084
I couldn't say.

526
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,804
(sobs)

527
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,106
Gather yourself, girl.

528
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,058
You need to reach deep

529
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:52,810
and exercise your strength now.

530
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,947
We have something to tell you.

531
00:29:57,031 --> 00:30:01,402
<i>In loving memory</i>
<i>of our lost Supreme,</i>

532
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:03,237
<i>Anna Leigh Leighton,</i>

533
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:06,623
we announce
her posthumous selection

534
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:10,577
of the witch she believed
to be her trueborn successor,

535
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:12,546
Supreme Elect,

536
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:14,131
Fiona Goode.

537
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:17,117
(murmuring, chattering)

538
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:19,002
This Thursday night,

539
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:20,587
at the start of the full moon,

540
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:21,788
Fiona Goode will begin

541
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,458
the tests of the Seven Wonders.

542
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:26,927
From time immemorial,
our great people

543
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:29,730
has chosen to uphold and uplift

544
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:32,599
one among us who was
born destined to lead.

545
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,851
Can you believe

546
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:35,686
Fiona Goode.

547
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,489
She'll end up being the youngest
Supreme in history.

548
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:41,275
I can't believe she's
getting away with it.

549
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,527
Getting away with what, dogface?

550
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:46,196
Murder.

551
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:49,199
...adversity.
A witch supreme in power

552
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:51,835
who can heal us
and make us whole...

553
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,489
I'm a Guardian of Veracity
in the Vernacular.

554
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,325
I know when a lie's being told,

555
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,793
and I protect the truth.

556
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,162
(gasps)

557
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:03,514
(murmuring)

558
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:05,332
Spalding.

559
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,438
MYRTLE:
Veritas,

560
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,857
<i>Honorum, Justitia,</i>

561
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:16,777
<i>Sapientia, Scientia.</i>

562
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:18,901
I conjure and command thee,

563
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:21,198
dark lords to the vernacular,

564
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:23,617
summon truth from lying tongues.

565
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:26,186
<i>Fie upon the wicked who dare</i>
<i>to throw sand in our eyes.</i>

566
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:30,491
<i>With force I command thee,</i>
<i>let truth be spoken!</i>

567
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,329
Fiona aced transmutation

568
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,247
and pyrokinesis.

569
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,383
By this time tomorrow,

570
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:40,801
we'll have a new Supreme.

571
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:46,473
You notice how Spalding
spends his life

572
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,976
cleaning up Fiona's messes?

573
00:31:49,043 --> 00:31:50,511
If Fiona did do
something terrible

574
00:31:50,562 --> 00:31:52,429
to Anna Leigh,
Spalding knows about it.

575
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,650
GIRL:
If Spalding does know something,

576
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,051
he's not talking.

577
00:31:58,102 --> 00:31:59,736
He's not going to have a choice.

578
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:02,573
I enchanted his tongue
so it's incapable

579
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:04,575
of speaking a lie.
And I happen to know

580
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,778
the Council is calling him for a
closed session tomorrow morning.

581
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,373
Thank you, Spalding.

582
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:29,583
(man screaming)
(indistinct chatter)

583
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:32,185
(woman screams)

584
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,972
Oh, my God!
(woman screams)

585
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:38,258
What's happening?
Someone's been attacked.

586
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,360
(gasps)

587
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,696
(moaning)

588
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:46,199
(gasps)

589
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,935
Everyone, back to your rooms
this instant!

590
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:55,158
(groaning continues)

591
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:58,278
The time has come for you

592
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,330
to pay for every crime
you've committed.

593
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:03,300
I'm innocent until
proven guilty.

594
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:07,254
And so far, you have not
proven one goddamn thing.

595
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:09,456
The Council reminds you,

596
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:11,758
no witch has been tried,
convicted,

597
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:14,394
and burned
at the stake since 1926.

598
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:17,397
And on a personal note,
I'd like to add

599
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:20,350
I've got a book of matches
in my pocket Fiona,

600
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:23,136
and I'm just dying
to light this fire.

601
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:24,738
Leave it in!

602
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,979
I'd like to call
our final witness, Spalding.

603
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,483
Stand before us.

604
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,661
40 years ago,
our Supreme disappeared.

605
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:50,497
Shortly thereafter,
you were mutilated.

606
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,683
Some call it coincidence,

607
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,468
others call it mystery.

608
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,221
As to me, I can't imagine living
under the same roof

609
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,941
as the monster
who dismembered me,

610
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:03,860
making her breakfast,
pouring her tea.

611
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:07,397
But you have nothing
to be afraid of now.

612
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,616
Justice is so near.

613
00:34:09,684 --> 00:34:15,822
All you have to do is write
the name of the witch

614
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:18,458
who was responsible
for severing your tongue.

615
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,767
(pen drops on table)

616
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,158
MYRTLE:
He's not going to have a choice.

617
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,463
I enchanted his tongue so it's
incapable of speaking a lie,

618
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,551
and I happen to know
the Council's calling him

619
00:35:16,602 --> 00:35:18,586
for a closed session
tomorrow morning.

620
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:23,975
(thunder crashes)

621
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,369
(knocking)

622
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,211
(thunder crashes)

623
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,835
I got your note.

624
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,921
Thank you for coming.

625
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:02,347
These are my last words,
Miss Fiona.

626
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,103
I have always loved you.

627
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,442
(chuckles)

628
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:18,780
Spalding!

629
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,314
(gasping)

630
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:21,282
(screams)

631
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:25,703
This will not stand!

632
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:30,291
You killed Anna Leigh

633
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:33,294
because she was
the last Supreme!

634
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:35,463
And you killed an innocent girl

635
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,932
because she was
the next Supreme!

636
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,717
You got away with it!

637
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,669
She keeps getting away with it!

638
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,805
CORDELIA:
You're wrong.

639
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:47,275
You think my mother killed
Madison Montgomery

640
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:49,176
so she could remain
the Supreme?

641
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:52,363
Yes! You're blind to the ways
of your mother, chicky!

642
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:54,198
You always have been!

643
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:57,118
Madison wasn't the next Supreme.

644
00:37:00,956 --> 00:37:02,824
<i>The hallmark</i>
<i>of any rising Supreme</i>

645
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:06,744
<i>is glowing, radiant health.</i>

646
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,697
<i>Madison had a heart murmur.</i>

647
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:12,083
<i>She kept it monitored,</i>
<i>she kept is secret.</i>

648
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,552
So I'm sorry, Myrtle.

649
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:18,205
For 40 years, you've been
barking up the wrong tree.

650
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:21,642
My mother is the Supreme
for a reason.

651
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,643
Hear, hear.

652
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,316
CHILD: Come on, Mom. Come
on, come on, come on.

653
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:29,623
WOMAN: All right, child.
Come on!

654
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,240
Come on, Mom.
Come on, come on, come on.

655
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:38,026
WOMAN: All right, child.
Come on!

656
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:40,227
And look, don't eat
too much candy, you hear?

657
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,662
Good night.

658
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,952
(quiet drumming)

659
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:58,379
(snake hissing)

660
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:05,386
(snakes rattling)

661
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,485
(growls)

662
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,408
(growls)

663
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,588
(doorbell chimes)

664
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:33,710
Trick or treat!

665
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,114
Oh, little beggar children
all fancied up.

666
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,000
Don't be greedy.
Just take one.

667
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:40,151
You little hooligans!

668
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:42,337
(children shouting and chatting)

669
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,655
(door creaks shut)

670
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:48,677
ZOE:
You're being morbid.

671
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,762
Madison's not dead.

672
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,632
Then why can't I hear her?
Maybe she found

673
00:38:53,683 --> 00:38:54,883
a way to keep you out
of her head.

674
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,334
I know I've been trying.

675
00:38:56,386 --> 00:38:58,854
No. She passed.

676
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:01,536
We should be out
looking for her.

677
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:04,610
Fiona told us to stay inside.

678
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,981
(orchestra plays
old-fashioned gentle melody)

679
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,678
(door creaks open)

680
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,878
♪

681
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,586
FIONA:
Enough rosé.

682
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:23,088
Let's get you a proper drink.

683
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:27,192
Bartender, bring this lady
a Makers neat.

684
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,695
You'll make a bad girl
of me yet.

685
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:32,764
Well, Christ knows,
somebody's got to, darling.

686
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:34,566
(laughs)
Here, cheers.

687
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:40,772
Hmm. Ooh.

688
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:43,375
Okay...
What?

689
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,494
let's play a game.
(laughs)

690
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:47,329
We each ask each other
three questions,

691
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:50,048
and we swear
to answer them honestly.

692
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,416
Is your seat belt fastened?

693
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:52,918
Nice and tight.

694
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,588
Why do you hate Hank?

695
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,675
Are you attracted to him?

696
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,511
Ugh!

697
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:06,732
Because, Delia,
he reeks of bullshit.

698
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:10,602
And I don't understand
how you cannot see that.

699
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:19,144
Number two.

700
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:21,446
And no lying.

701
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:25,200
Did you kill Madison?

702
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:28,987
No. I did not kill Madison.

703
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:30,672
My turn.

704
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:32,007
Who do you believe
is the next Supreme?

705
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:34,826
No, no, no, no, no,
it's still my turn.

706
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:36,628
Yeah? Well, your
questions are boring.

707
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,597
So, answer my question.

708
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,382
Who do you think
is my replacement?

709
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:42,851
You're obsessed, aren't you?

710
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:45,003
Why?

711
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,522
You feel your powers weakening?

712
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:49,608
Hmm?

713
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,893
(laughs quietly)

714
00:41:51,978 --> 00:41:53,945
Keep these coming, mister man.

715
00:41:58,985 --> 00:42:02,120
(vomiting)

716
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,990
(coughing)

717
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:21,506
(sighs)

718
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:26,978
(screaming)

719
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,650
(doorbell chimes)

720
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,235
Hands off.

721
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:34,886
I decide what y'all deserve.

722
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,271
There you go.

723
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:39,324
You don't get anything.

724
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,993
No. I-I'm the
neighbor next door.

725
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,228
I came to drop off these?

726
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:44,562
Oh.

727
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:48,566
Are those for Madison?

728
00:42:48,618 --> 00:42:50,669
Actually, these cookies
are for you.

729
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,003
(gasps)
For me?

730
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,505
I wanted to pay you back

731
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:54,790
for that delicious cake
you brought over.

732
00:42:54,874 --> 00:42:58,343
(loud banging on door)

733
00:43:14,694 --> 00:43:16,311
(whimpers)

734
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:19,114
(banging)

735
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:21,316
(whimpering)

736
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,652
(banging continues)
