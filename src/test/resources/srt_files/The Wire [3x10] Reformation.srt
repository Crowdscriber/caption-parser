1
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,714
Need another bag.

2
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,450
- Mike, where you at?
- Yeah, over here.

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,387
Drug war?

4
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,465
Barksdale's coming back
on my boy Marlo, huh?

5
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,626
Shit.

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,430
Got it.

7
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,273
Man, I don't know where we at.

8
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,177
We are in Baltimore, Lamar.
Baltimore, Maryland.

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,349
That's the second crib of mine
them motherfuckers cracked this week.

10
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,450
Stir up a hornet's nest,
no telling who gonna get stung.

11
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,068
- All paranoid and shit.
- Gotta be.

12
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,582
They got Latroy.

13
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,263
Hey, what the fuck
is y'all on the streets for, man?

14
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,696
Don't y'all know
there's a fucking war going on, man?

15
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,063
Get the fuck in the truck, man.

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
What happened to all them towers?

17
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,232
Slow train coming.

18
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,639
Reform, Lamar. Reform.

19
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,858
We should be up on this shit,
hearing voices.

20
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,227
We get a signature number
on Bodie's phone, we will be.

21
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,631
We got enough PC off the burners alone.

22
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,828
Every time these fucking pen registers
click out a call...

23
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,097
it screams drug conspiracy.

24
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,173
I'm not the one taking the case to court.

25
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,869
Pearlman wants a specific link
to a known drug trafficker.

26
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,677
These drug crews, they're dumping phones
every couple of weeks at best.

27
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,278
So when we do get a wire up,
it's gonna be a limited run.

28
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,914
And dumping phones doesn't meet...

29
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,984
the cellular company's definition
of "exigent circumstance," right?

30
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,160
What's your boss willing to do?

31
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:09,098
Demper? He's a bit too focused
on next year's re-election fight.

32
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,328
How about the feds?

33
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,461
They say they can't do anything for us.

34
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,063
And if you look at how they use
the Federal Communications Act...

35
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,300
they're not lying.

36
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,809
For national security stuff,
they use the Patriot Act.

37
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,811
Everything else gets shorted.

38
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,848
The fact is,
the industry has all of us by the balls.

39
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,680
Pardon my French, Your Honor.

40
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,222
All right, I'll tell you what.
Best I can do for you is this.

41
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,587
You give me a boilerplate affidavit
with the PC from the court report.

42
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,827
And then, as you get fresh numbers
for the new disposables, you call me...

43
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,267
anytime, day or night, to jump phones.

44
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,565
That helps.

45
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,731
But we're still gonna be
getting up on their phones...

46
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,775
- even as they're coming down.
- Yeah, probably so.

47
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,437
- This is so totally...
- Fucked up.

48
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,394
Judge Phelan has you on his mind.
How long has that been going on?

49
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,297
Started with my first jury trial in his court,
I think.

50
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,901
I bet you won all your motions.

51
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,373
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Have a seat.

52
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,345
I wanna thank you
for the loyalty you showed...

53
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,081
moving that body.

54
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,184
It wasn't the most sensible thing,
but I appreciate it, nonetheless.

55
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,019
You're a good man, Sergeant.

56
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,620
You got good instincts...

57
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,132
and as far as I can tell,
you're a decent supervisor.

58
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,967
But from where I sit...

59
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,106
you ain't shit when it come to policing.

60
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,739
Don't take it personal.

61
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,641
Ain't just you, it's all our young police...

62
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,204
whole generation of y'all.

63
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,349
No, you think about it.

64
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,349
You've been here over a year now, Carver.

65
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:11,480
You got nobody looking out for you,
nobody willing to talk to you.

66
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,356
That about sum it up?

67
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,857
Now, that's a problem.

68
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,358
And I didn't think there was any way
I was ever gonna get my head around it...

69
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,094
but then Dozerman gets shot
for some bullshit.

70
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,666
And that's when I about reach my limit.

71
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,975
And that's when the idea of the free zone,
of Hamsterdam, come to me...

72
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,240
because this drug thing,
this ain't police work.

73
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,137
No, it ain't.

74
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,811
I mean, I can send any fool with a badge
and a gun up on them corners...

75
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,184
and jack a crew and grab vials.

76
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,956
But policing?

77
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,783
I mean, you call something a war...

78
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
and pretty soon everybody gonna be
running around acting like warriors.

79
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,260
They gonna be running around
on a damn crusade...

80
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,099
storming corners,
slapping on cuffs, racking up body counts.

81
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,898
And when you at war,
you need a fucking enemy.

82
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,737
And pretty soon, damn near everybody
on every corner is your fucking enemy.

83
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,247
And soon the neighborhood
that you're supposed to be policing...

84
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,614
that's just occupied territory.

85
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,813
You follow this?

86
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,386
I think so.

87
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,119
Look here,
the point I'm making, Carver, is this.

88
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,390
Soldiering and policing,
they ain't the same thing.

89
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,692
And before we went
and took the wrong turn...

90
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,199
and started up with these war games...

91
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,430
the cop walked a beat,
and he learned that post.

92
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,041
And if there were things that happened
up on that post...

93
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,111
whether they be a rape
or robbery or shooting...

94
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,145
he had people out there helping him,
feeding him information.

95
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,849
But every time I come to you,
my DEU Sergeant...

96
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:51,356
for information, to find out what's going on
out there in them streets...

97
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,715
all that came back was some bullshit.

98
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,860
You had your stats, you had your arrests,
you had your seizures.

99
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,728
But don't none of that amount to shit...

100
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,394
when you talking about
protecting the neighborhood, now, do it?

101
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:15,346
You know the worst thing
about this so-called drug war...

102
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,180
to my mind...

103
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,583
it <i>just...</i> It ruined this job.

104
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,047
Major.

105
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,093
- What you got?
- Incoming.

106
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,398
A <i>Sun</i> paper reporter.
Been to the free zones, all three of them.

107
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,632
Meet you at the car.

108
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,338
I was thinking,
maybe we rewrite the affidavit...

109
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,603
add some of the stuff
we're getting from the pen registers...

110
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,303
build the case that way, take it to the judge.

111
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,042
You have a law degree?
If you did, it would be your call to make.

112
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,675
Who would pretend to be a lawyer
that wasn't?

113
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,312
I'm just saying,
I think we're being too cautious on this.

114
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,413
We're going the extra mile for Phelan.

115
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,049
A shortcut now could cost us later
in motions hearings.

116
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,957
We drew Phelan on this wiretap?

117
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,360
That two-faced hack sold me out,
the last go-round.

118
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,797
Relax, he's not running for a new term.
He'll be fine.

119
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,095
Yeah, he's a piece of shit.

120
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,796
We're all pieces of shit
when we're in your way.

121
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,032
That goes with the territory.

122
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,549
Point taken.

123
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,946
So it's these warehouses,
the old Winchester Homes...

124
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,185
and the dead blocks
down by Vincent Street?

125
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,590
All three.

126
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,289
And they're just supposed
to let it go on like this?

127
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,161
Colvin told us
to push the street dealing in these areas...

128
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,326
and then we would start locking people up.

129
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,597
But so far, not a single fucking arrest.

130
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,036
And they know about this downtown?

131
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,970
I don't think
they have a fucking clue about it.

132
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,908
But I'd love to be there
when you pop the question.

133
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,671
This is <i>just...</i>

134
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,740
Tell me about it.

135
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,425
- Got the place looking good.
- Yeah.

136
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,792
Now all that needs doing
is to go out and get you some kids.

137
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,262
Come on, man.

138
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,265
You making it sound easy...

139
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,733
but, tell you the truth...

140
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,271
I ain't got no idea
how to go at these hoppers.

141
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,638
Oh, I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.
Nobody else does, neither.

142
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,019
We got one.

143
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,151
His grandmother.

144
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,552
<i>- Looking for me?</i>
<i>- Look, boy...</i>

145
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,817
<i>there's no reason</i>
<i>to leave your clothes in the washer.</i>

146
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,950
<i>How many damn times</i>
<i>do I have to tell you?</i>

147
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,859
<i>Dag, Mee-maw.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I just forgot, okay?</i>

148
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,023
<i>But I did pick up the laundry soap.</i>
<i>I picked it up.</i>

149
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,964
Laundry soap, that's definitely a code.

150
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,037
Now let's listen to an intercept we made
of Bodie Broadus...

151
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,368
when we were up on those payphones
a couple of years back.

152
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,566
<i>Look, I'm telling y'all, I saw the boy.</i>
<i>He saying he ain't got that thing.</i>

153
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,541
- Same voice, no question.
- I'll let the judge know.

154
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,173
Reference the voice comparison
in the court report.

155
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,114
We're up.

156
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,280
Yeah.

157
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,120
Got it right here, yo. Yeah, that's right.

158
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,319
- Major Colvin, Western District.
- Banisky, <i>Sun</i> papers.

159
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,688
So, this your idea?

160
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,262
Got one, get one.

161
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,360
Mind if we walk?

162
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,271
Apocalypse. Apocalypse.
Got that Apocalypse.

163
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,499
Right here, shorty.

164
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,008
You got dealers selling with impunity...

165
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,409
addicts shooting up on the street...

166
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,049
people down here doing outreach,
giving out needles and all.

167
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,209
I mean, who knows about this
down at headquarters?

168
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,685
Look, Command is
well aware of the situation.

169
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,689
While there was some initial <i>concern...</i>

170
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,884
But they feel
that the cases we're gonna bring in...

171
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,484
- Cases?
- Yeah, prosecutions, sure.

172
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,030
Your officers say
no one's being locked up in the free zones.

173
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,896
Look, my troops are only involved
in pushing the trafficking...

174
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,968
to designated areas.

175
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,469
I mean, they're completely ignorant
of the investigative aspect.

176
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,937
That's run out of CID downtown.

177
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,304
Yeah? Who's the lead detective?

178
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,335
Look.

179
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,738
I already said more than I should.

180
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,306
The bottom line is,
you start throwing calls around right now...

181
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,852
they're gonna shit blue,
thinking there's a leak.

182
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,718
They're gonna come up on the case early,
and we won't get all we can...

183
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,313
out of this good work we did down here.

184
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,758
You're telling me
all this is an enforcement strategy?

185
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,064
What the hell else could it be?

186
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,863
I mean, you think we would
actually let this happen otherwise?

187
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,496
Come on, Banisky.
I mean, look. Look at this mess.

188
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,339
Any other reporter gets on <i>it...</i>

189
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,640
I give it to you,
and you run with it right then. Absolutely.

190
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,585
A week. But then I gotta run something,
no matter what.

191
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,288
- Purple Haze, Purple Haze.
- It's understood.

192
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,558
Right there.

193
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,961
So, brother, what brought you back?

194
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,230
It disturbs me to leave business unfinished.

195
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,466
Heard you was shot
before you even got started down here.

196
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,197
Not like you to get played.

197
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,966
Betrayed, you mean.

198
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,672
I am looking for the man they sent.

199
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,973
From his accent, he's homegrown,
raised on the street.

200
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,173
Skilled, intelligent, late 20s, dark...

201
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:21,143
but with a scar across his face, like so.

202
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,385
- You down with this nigga?
- I know him.

203
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,186
Not to speak to...

204
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,393
but you can't be anywhere near the game
and not know the motherfucker.

205
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,660
- He with Barksdale?
- He with himself.

206
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,732
Except for
when he running with a young boy or two.

207
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,173
Ten months to the primary, and you
right now should be all about money.

208
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,573
I know, I know. Dialing for dollars.

209
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,613
You start this week, and you don't stop
until you hit your numbers.

210
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,511
We're gonna need $1 million
just for television.

211
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,379
Do you really think this is doable?

212
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,816
The odds aren't great, but, yeah.

213
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,487
I think it can be done...

214
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,250
as long as the thousand things
that can go wrong, don't go wrong.

215
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,950
Even for a white guy?

216
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,618
Even for a white guy.

217
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,355
Speaking of which...

218
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,899
I notice
a certain monochromatic effect here.

219
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,303
One thing we're gonna need
is black faces...

220
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,598
and we're gonna need them
in prominent positions.

221
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,695
You're right.

222
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,109
You gotta start thinking
about endorsement by black leaders.

223
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,439
Ministers, community people,
elected officials.

224
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,013
Here comes the hard part.

225
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,777
Splitting the black vote
is the only way to make the math work.

226
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,476
So, Tony Gray's gotta get in the race.

227
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,680
He's gotta stay in the race,
and he's gotta stay viable in the race.

228
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,279
Guy's kind of a lightweight, ain't he?

229
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,518
- He's a good guy, all in all.
- Great.

230
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,426
He's a good guy, but we need him
to siphon votes from Royce.

231
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,499
I don't know. This thing with <i>Tony...</i>

232
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,796
It's not personal, Tommy. It's politics.

233
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,669
Live with it, or lose.

234
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,137
<i>Yo, yo. That boy with the sharp nose,</i>
<i>he going, you know...</i>

235
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,111
<i>- He going to the Apollo.</i>
<i>- The Apollo?</i>

236
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,046
<i>Yeah. He gonna need two tickets.</i>

237
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,015
<i>Damn. Tweety Bird working that shit.</i>

238
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,679
<i>Motherfucker, how many times</i>
<i>I gotta tell you not to use no names?</i>

239
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,588
<i>- Oh, yeah, right. So I holler at you?</i>
<i>- Yeah. All right.</i>

240
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,028
- Apollo, like the theater?
- Like 125th Street.

241
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,066
125 grams, one-eighth of a kilo.
Two tickets means "twice that."

242
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,068
- The only new code so far is Hamsterdam.
- Hamsterdam?

243
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,628
We're thinking it might have
something to do with the stash house.

244
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,471
Well, I'm gonna hook up with Kima,
catch the Tweety Bird meet.

245
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,539
You're happy with what we're getting?

246
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,137
Another week of calls like this...

247
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,515
and we'll have their network fleshed out
and plenty more phones to go up on.

248
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,989
I need a moment with the detectives.

249
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,682
Sure.

250
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,429
IID picked up Prez's shooting.
It's to be expected.

251
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,898
The racial thing alone is tense enough
that they gotta react.

252
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,162
No luck at all to that boy, huh?

253
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,699
For the supervisor's report...

254
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,205
I need to ask
if either of you had any indication...

255
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,436
that Prez harbored racial prejudices.

256
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,845
Well, he harbored some weird shit,
no doubt, but I never got a racial vibe.

257
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,349
Lieutenant, you seriously asking?

258
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,892
Not to start no shit, but you think
Waggoner gets shot if he's white?

259
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,863
- Description called for a number one male.
- I'm just saying.

260
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,262
The good Lord set Sunday morning aside
for churchgoing.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,570
Even Kenny Bird and Peanut,
when they was warring...

262
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,304
had the good sense to respect the truce.

263
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,204
You know them Barksdales sent a hat?

264
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,916
A church crown?

265
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,085
Walked up, rang the bell,
and set it down on the porch.

266
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,882
'Cause they ashamed.

267
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,524
Is Miss Josephine mending?

268
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,618
She bruised up still,
but she all right, though.

269
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,162
But you ain't.

270
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,759
Not until I settle this for good.

271
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,134
Hey, yo, Butch, I want you
to go inside my bank and spread the word.

272
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,178
Omar paying cash money
to get at them people, you feel me?

273
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,439
Hey, save your money.

274
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,608
- Come on now, Butchie, I got to do this, yo.
- I'm saying you ain't got to pay.

275
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,112
Thomkins, up on McCulloh.

276
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,449
What, the funeral home?

277
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,090
You mean to tell me all this time
you had a scope on them clowns...

278
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,328
- and you ain't let loose a mumbling word.
- Caught myself looking out for you.

279
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,994
Fact of the matter is, your chances
of going up against that mob...

280
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,007
and coming back
is as slim as a garter snake.

281
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,407
I can't help that now, Butch.

282
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,151
What the fuck? Where's my people?

283
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,622
Slim Charles pulled them.
Hired new muscle.

284
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,319
Slim Charles? When the fuck did <i>he...</i>

285
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,294
How's the count?

286
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,625
Down bad for the third straight week.

287
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,362
And the shelf-life of the shit we got,
it ain't gonna last, String.

288
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,669
I know. Slim said
they're to stick to you for protection.

289
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,414
- Give it here. Give it here.
- Nice shot.

290
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,547
Dribble it back out. Dribble it back out.

291
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,749
Get your dribble on.

292
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,120
Fucking hack.

293
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,161
Yo, yo, easy, easy.
Y'all just hacking my man up.

294
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,761
Foul machine.

295
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,663
Nice drive.

296
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,965
Kind of unschooled, ain't they?

297
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,906
What the fuck you cherry-picking for?

298
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,808
That observation meant
as just a casual curbside, "Fuck you"...

299
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,746
or are you looking to step up,
maybe help out here?

300
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,777
I'm gonna give it a try.

301
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,876
I'm looking
to get some kids interested in boxing.

302
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,314
Boxing?

303
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,687
Look here. This is my time-out corner.

304
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,594
Where I send children
who can't play nice together.

305
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,935
Listen up.
This man's starting a boxing program.

306
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,732
And from the looks of some of y'all,
signing on might be a good thing.

307
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,033
You gonna need it.

308
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,576
The only thing he know how to do
with his fist is wrap it around his cock.

309
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,508
Fuck you, man! Gonna kick your ass!

310
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,876
Come on, motherfucker, you ain't shit.

311
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,810
Ease up. Sit down, sit down. Sit down.

312
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:35,156
Come on, man. Sit down, man. Sit down.

313
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,997
My man, you dropping your right.

314
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,266
See, if young'un there was trained,
he'd whip you.

315
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,962
Look like he the one that got beat.

316
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,897
Stand up, let me show you something.

317
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,139
Come on, man. I ain't gonna hurt you.

318
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,372
Yellow tops, yellow tops,
got them yellow tops. Yellow tops.

319
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,676
See that?

320
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,983
All right, sit down.

321
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,913
Look, if y'all wanna learn more...

322
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,220
I got a gym down on Gilmor
in the old tire plant.

323
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,857
Y'all are all welcome. All right?

324
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,681
I saw Tweety Bird parked up there.

325
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,518
All we gotta do is wait for the re-up.

326
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,316
I hope these fucks don't dick around
and make us sit here all day.

327
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,983
What, this is eating at you?

328
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,828
No, I'm good.

329
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,128
Yeah, I can see that.

330
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,903
Remember that woman I was talking about?

331
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,871
Politician woman? How's it going?

332
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,400
It ain't. Turned to shit.

333
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,114
Feel like I don't even belong
to any world that even fucking matters.

334
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,012
'Cause you're a cop?

335
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,387
Nah, it's not just that.

336
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,884
It's like, I went to meet her once.
She was in a hotel room, the top floor.

337
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,586
I punched the button on the elevator.

338
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,790
It doesn't even go there, 'cause you have
to have some fucking special key...

339
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,367
to even get to that special fucking floor.

340
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,236
So I go to the front desk,
some sneering fuck calls upstairs...

341
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,773
to give me permission to go get laid.

342
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,303
I listen to the shit she talks about...

343
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,540
first time in my life,
I feel like a fucking doormat.

344
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:41,244
Like anyone with any smarts would do
something else with his life, you know?

345
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,753
Earn money or get elected.

346
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,185
Like I'm just a breathing machine
for my fucking dick.

347
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,296
I'm serious.

348
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,033
I'm the smartest asshole in three districts...

349
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,034
and she looks at me
like I'm some stupid fuck...

350
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,572
playing some stupid game
for stupid penny-ante stakes.

351
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,844
She fucking looks through me, Kima.

352
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,118
Yo, stay in the car, man.

353
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,589
Tall man said to stick to you like...

354
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,150
Tall man gonna be there
when I stomp on your fucking head?

355
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,820
Stay in the car.

356
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,770
Yo, make it short, man,
I got a meet to make.

357
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,368
Oh, fuck the meet!

358
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,142
You harder to get at
than my fat wife's cunt, nigga.

359
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,242
Yeah, you high-and-mighty Barksdales
can afford to sit back and play low-key.

360
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,287
But some of us gotta work
for a goddamn living.

361
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,447
What, you think
this mess ain't fucking up our business?

362
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,755
That means Avon's willing to sit down
and talk with Marlo, work this shit out?

363
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:03,556
Well, if that don't happen, String,
I got you some bad news.

364
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,727
Me and the boys had us a sit-down.

365
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,237
Got a quorum and took a vote that says...

366
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,571
if y'all don't quit this war,
we have a mind to shut you out.

367
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,372
And when I say out, String,
I mean out the package.

368
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,174
The boys don't wanna
extend the good shit...

369
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,250
if it's gonna keep you and your peoples
out on them corners, banging.

370
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,285
What about the boy? What the fuck he say?

371
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,049
Vinson say Marlo willing to talk
if he can keep his corners.

372
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,888
Now hear me on this, String,
we ain't no ingrates.

373
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,987
We all recognize your contribute
to the co-op.

374
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,927
But the feeling is this.

375
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,766
It ain't right for you to be at the head of
our table when you can't call off your dog.

376
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,737
Call it a crisis of leadership.

377
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,848
You're gonna tell them?

378
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,544
Got to.

379
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,279
Between the health-care workers, the
reporter, and my own pissed-off troops...

380
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,118
it's gonna come out.

381
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,521
Either tomorrow or the next day.

382
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,062
We should make a few arrests,
make it look tactical.

383
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:09,860
Nah. You know what happens if we start
locking people up in Hamsterdam?

384
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,103
The whole rest of the district goes back
to being a shithole.

385
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,970
Nah. If Rawls is gonna hand me my ass...

386
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,537
at least give me a chance
to tell the man my story first.

387
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,559
Devonne.

388
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,699
What was that?

389
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,547
It needed doing.

390
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,217
Somebody just got shot!

391
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,453
What you want I should give the snitch
that clued us to the Denali.

392
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,324
I mean, we didn't get Marlo, but <i>still...</i>

393
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,125
No, he kept his end up. Go it all.

394
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,698
Avon, I need a word, man.

395
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,167
Let me holler at you.
Get them niggas out of here, man.

396
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,572
Check it out, String.

397
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,507
This shit got the kill range of, like,
50 meters.

398
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,341
Slim got this from some soldier
coming back from wherever.

399
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,042
You know, I spoke to Prop Joe's people.

400
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,216
- They think we can work this out.
- A sit-down?

401
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,918
It's the perfect time for it, man. I mean...

402
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,693
you done represented yourself, man.

403
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:44,955
Your name ringing out...

404
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,224
now that you done taken Marlo
down a notch or two, man.

405
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,959
So why not quit while we's ahead?

406
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,398
Just let me get this thing right, man.

407
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,231
Then, you know,
we get back to business as usual.

408
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,827
They gonna cut us out, Avon!

409
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,963
Prop Joe and them niggas, man,
they took a vote.

410
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,063
They gonna cut us out.

411
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,336
We ain't gonna have that dope,
so even if we win, we lose...

412
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,277
'cause we ain't gonna have no product
to put on them fucking corners, B.

413
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,904
Avon, look at you.

414
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,711
Fucking shooting dope
without a fucking needle right now, man...

415
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,185
getting high on a power trip,
playing fucking soldier.

416
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,415
Yo, you gotta sit back, man,
and think about our business.

417
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,116
What the fuck you want?

418
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,797
That motherfucker. He good.

419
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,193
What happened?

420
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:34,543
You know, Avon, you gotta think about
what we got in this game for, man.

421
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,647
Was it the rep?

422
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,677
Was it so our names could ring out on
some fucking ghetto street corners, man?

423
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,777
Nah, man,
there's games beyond the fucking game.

424
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,917
Avon, look, you and me, we brothers, B.

425
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,462
We didn't think we'll make it this fucking
far, but fuck if we ain't standing here...

426
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,225
right now, with the whole world at our feet.

427
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,857
The whole world, man,
not these fucking corners.

428
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,629
The whole world, B.

429
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,802
You know what Slim just told me?

430
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,070
Devonne come up dead.

431
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,773
She was shot,
one in the mouth, one in each tit.

432
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,648
You still wanna talk truce, String?

433
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,523
You right when you say
I need to learn more discipline.

434
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,925
But this? You could do this better.

435
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,063
You're the perfect bait, Lamar.
They'll see you as conflicted.

436
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,464
Your homophobia is so visceral.

437
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,863
You see that?

438
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:37,340
I ain't even stepped inside the joint yet,
and you calling me a cocksucker already.

439
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,268
You in the right place?

440
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,363
I'm looking for someone named Omar.

441
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,308
No last name. Scar across his face and shit.

442
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,672
Scarface named Omar?
Sounds different, but I can't help you.

443
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,215
You drinking?

444
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,314
Maybe you wait four years.

445
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,720
No. It has to be now.

446
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,462
It's gotta be a three-way,
and Tony's gonna go this time.

447
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,501
I'm <i>just...</i>

448
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,372
Tony's my oldest friend on the Council.

449
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,403
Well, couldn't you go talk to him first?

450
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,978
Put it on the table?
You know, "May the best man win"?

451
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,581
Truth is...

452
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,149
he can't win alone against Royce, either.

453
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,583
He's got the bumper stickers,
but not much else.

454
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,117
Wants to run on education.

455
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,358
I mean...

456
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,399
where do you go with that?

457
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:14,193
If I level with Tony and he gets out,
then I can't win.

458
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,173
I need him in the race.

459
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:27,384
I feel like shit. I really do.

460
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,975
Don't look like much.

461
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,413
- This don't look like shit.
- Hell, yeah.

462
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,712
- This some weak-ass shit right here.
- Hell, yeah.

463
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,447
Man, we got lockers, got gear.

464
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,285
- It's all peeling and shit.
- Go long.

465
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,789
Hey, hey, hey, pass it here.

466
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,667
- You getting me all dirty and shit.
- Hey, fuck your jeans.

467
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,703
- Fuck you.
- Bitch.

468
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,870
We clocked the meet with Tweety Bird,
stayed on him overnight...

469
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,703
tracked him to a possible stash house...

470
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,367
and then home to nest in Woodlawn.

471
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,411
Got photos, his <i>tags...</i>

472
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,410
- What happened?
- They ditched their phones.

473
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,385
The DNRs and the wire all died around 3:00.

474
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,888
We were online just shy of 30 hours.

475
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,553
I thought we had them on their burners
for a couple of weeks.

476
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,256
Not anymore. It's a week at best.

477
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,332
We just spent $9,000 and change
for 18 intercepts...

478
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,097
five of them non-pertinent.

479
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,633
That's close to $700 per drug call.

480
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,265
Until we see which way this goes...

481
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,345
shouldn't we get back
on Bernard and his girl?

482
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,380
I mean,
get a line on the new phones at least.

483
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,848
But that'll only give us
what we just had, 30 hours.

484
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,614
Any way to get ourselves
ahead of the curve?

485
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,391
If there were some way
to pre-wiretap the <i>burners...</i>

486
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,824
And what then?

487
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,261
Stick them on a rack at Baba-whatever
and wait for Bernard to show up that day?

488
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,560
The problem is the wireless people.

489
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,727
They claim it takes a minimum of four days
to process a court order...

490
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,897
and that's only after I had my office
threaten to go public on them.

491
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,976
Four days to hit a couple of keystrokes.
Bullshit.

492
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,909
Well, what <i>if...</i>

493
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,077
No way.

494
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,377
I know what you're thinking.
I just thought the same fucking thing.

495
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,552
All right, look, man.
When I tell you, put your left foot out, boy.

496
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,356
- Hey, Unc patting my man's feet.
- Yeah, he smelling up my ass, too.

497
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,060
Stop with the damn clowning, man.

498
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,226
How the fuck you gonna learn something,
acting like a damn fool?

499
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,932
Yeah. Ain't no big mystery
why your face got tattooed.

500
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,975
Shit, that man can't talk to you like that.

501
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,442
I seen his raggedy ass up at the spot,
copping vials.

502
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,809
Yeah, probably pimps his ass, too.

503
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,213
- Listen, motherfucker...
- Yeah, bitch, touch me.

504
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,410
Touch a juvenile, see what happen.

505
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,622
Let's bounce. Bitch-ass motherfucker.

506
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,884
Faggot.

507
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,318
- Punk-ass nigga.
- Chump ass.

508
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,797
Lester.

509
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,072
First time I seen him smoking.

510
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,611
Tough habit.

511
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,348
And pacing like a motherfuck, too.

512
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,943
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

513
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,368
<i>Bay Wireless Connect 411.</i>
<i>What city and state?</i>

514
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,202
Baltimore, Maryland.

515
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,012
<i>- How may I help you?</i>
- Baltimore police.

516
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:54,010
<i>- Any particular department?</i>
- Western District police.

517
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,384
<i>- Is this an emergency?</i>
- No. Non-emergency.

518
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,655
Man, they did you with the bum rush.

519
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:08,562
That's what they do.
They past experts at plucking nerves.

520
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,860
You just gotta remember
they barely housebroke.

521
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,960
I'm telling you, man,
you wouldn't believe it.

522
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,904
They was all wild and shit. Wouldn't listen.

523
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,238
Andre, I want you to crowd him.

524
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,573
- Yes, sir, I'll crowd him.
- All right.

525
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,712
Time!

526
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,959
You just gotta set your mind
to stick with it.

527
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,186
When those two stumbled in here,
they was wild as wild.

528
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,996
Now they come in every day.
"Yes, sir. No, sir."

529
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,562
Still pretty rough but, you know,
with the right breaks, they gonna make it.

530
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,641
How?

531
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,777
Well, try as they might, I won't let them fail.

532
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,113
When you do that,
it messes with their mind.

533
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,010
Pretty soon,
they run out of their little bag of tricks.

534
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,080
What do you think of that?

535
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,255
Pretty weak.

536
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,889
He ain't weak. That's the starting point.

537
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,130
Nah, nah, I can't put a name on him.

538
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,409
But I seen him around.
He's off the West Side.

539
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,969
He ain't no drug dealer,
unless he's doing it on the q.t.

540
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,240
You can't go at him, game him?

541
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,343
I don't know, Kima.
I mean, it'd be pressing.

542
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,648
What about her?

543
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,315
Little Squeak off of Lanvale.

544
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,660
Yeah, she used to boost
for Turtle Wells' old mob.

545
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:48,425
She's lost a little bit of weight, too. I mean,
looking a lot better than I remember.

546
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,092
And I remember a lot about that girl.

547
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,535
Damn, Bubs, is there anybody
West Side you don't know?

548
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,470
Just citizens and shit.

549
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,971
My CI knows the girl.

550
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,410
- He can work her?
- He's smooth, yeah.

551
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,213
Check this.

552
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,683
That's Western District.

553
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,316
- What, Stringer's calling the Western?
- Maybe he's surrendering.

554
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,393
After all the work we've done,
I'd never forgive the son of a bitch.

555
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,691
Go down. Go down and out.

556
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,673
Oh, sweet! Look at the hands!

557
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,974
What's up? My knuckleheads didn't post?

558
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,518
Yeah, they did, but they left.

559
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,415
Over here!

560
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,392
Looking for a discount, old man?

561
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,465
Nah, but I'm looking for you.

562
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,397
Why, something come up missing?

563
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,401
Came past to apologize.

564
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,868
I'm new at this coaching thing
and got us off on the wrong foot.

565
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,307
I ain't gonna leave it between us,
with you thinking I gave up on y'all.

566
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:12,371
Motherfucker's memory weak as shit.
We the one bailed out on him.

567
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,649
Anyway, I'm here now.

568
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,060
Let me understand.

569
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,788
You wanna sell drug traffickers
a series of cell phones...

570
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,660
that are pre-approved
for telephonic intercepts.

571
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:32,293
And you want me to sign off
on court-ordered taps...

572
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,963
on a bunch of phones that,
at the time I'm signing the order...

573
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,803
have not been used
for any illegal activity whatsoever.

574
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,639
If you're looking for precedents,
Your Honor, there aren't any.

575
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,613
It's circumstantial PC at best.

576
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,745
What the hell, let's do it.

577
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,815
Let the Court of Appeals sort it out,
if it even gets that far.

578
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,099
Quite the legal mind.

579
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,721
Buy you a drink?

580
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,767
- Why the fuck you coming up behind me?
- I'm sorry.

581
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,212
Bushy top.

582
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,290
He called.
I didn't know if I'd find you here so late.

583
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,689
Just getting ready for COMSTAT tomorrow.

584
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,283
So what's up, Major?

585
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,962
So your unit is still working a drug war,
right?

586
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,730
Working it hard.

587
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,439
Does the name Avon Barksdale
do anything for you?

588
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,505
- He's a player?
- He's the main guy.

589
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,341
We thought he was down,
but he popped up in September.

590
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:27,474
You add him to the equation, it goes
a long way to explaining the violence.

591
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,245
So it wouldn't be a stretch if he got shot?

592
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,912
You heard he got shot?

593
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,157
You know when or where?
I could run it out quick.

594
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,284
Nah, ain't gonna make no difference.
He didn't post up at any emergency room...

595
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,725
from what I hear.

596
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,692
Major, I'm gonna be straight with you.
We're running wires into his people.

597
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,168
But we're barely above the street.

598
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,865
So far,
we haven't even put an eyeball on him.

599
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,311
Supposed to be laying his head there.

600
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,040
I need you to check that out,
get back to me as soon as you can.

601
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,674
You got a CI, huh?

602
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,481
You wanna see
if your man's creds are bona fide.

603
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,082
Don't try to play me, bushy top.
I didn't say male. I didn't say female.

604
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,096
All right.
I'll get surveillance going right away.

605
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,893
According to my source,
Barksdale's name is on the paperwork.

606
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,228
No shit.

607
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,498
Now, you get me a confirmation on that
and call me back on the cell.

608
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,340
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, right.

609
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,366
Sham.

610
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,940
Shamrock.

611
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,972
Run these over to Levy for me.
Tell him I want a read on it.

612
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,712
A read?

613
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,181
Fresh eyes. Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

614
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,052
All right.

615
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,532
Come on, Mr. Bodyguard.

616
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,627
And so we're gonna come at her like that.

617
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,064
So you're gonna give me
these phones to sell?

618
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,997
The money comes back, Bubs.

619
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,434
All of it?

620
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,367
- Is that Beadie Russell?
- Looks like.

621
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,379
Whoa, yo, you can't turn from this lane!

622
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,351
Sweet Beatrice Russell.

623
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,157
I was just gonna say hey.

624
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,326
North and Pulaski.

625
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,936
That photo was taken at 4:00 p.m.,
prime time for the street-level dealer.

626
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,199
That is Riggs and Calhoun.

627
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,737
Mount and Fayette.

628
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,614
Edmondson and Brice.
That's your old foot post, Deputy.

629
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,108
I know where it is, Major.

630
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,852
What I don't know
and very much want to know is...

631
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,424
where is the West Baltimore drug trade?

632
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,360
I hope, Major, these are not staged
photographs you're showing us.

633
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,260
No, sir, they are not.

634
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,500
No, Deputy, I found another approach.

635
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,364
I'm all ears, Bunny.

636
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,205
- I moved them off the corners.
- God damn it!

637
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,900
Don't be coy with me, Major. I can see that.

638
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,842
What I want to know is
how the fuck you managed to move them...

639
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,140
and where the fuck they are now.

640
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,444
Deputy...

641
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,086
I don't know quite how to put this,
but <i>we...</i>

642
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,222
I mean, <i>I...</i>

643
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,958
I began by identifying
those areas of my district...

644
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,085
where drug trafficking was least harmful.

645
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,927
I proceeded to push
all street-level dealing towards those areas.

646
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,692
Now, at first...

647
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,801
dealing with the juveniles on them corners,
I had little success.

648
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,198
But ultimately...

649
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,508
by rounding up
all the mid-level dealers in my district...

650
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,870
and making them
an offer they couldn't refuse...

651
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,609
- I was able to...
- You made them an offer?

652
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,979
Yes, sir.

653
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,692
Either they move their people
to one of three designated areas...

654
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,556
where drug enforcement
was not a district priority...

655
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,965
or they face the wrath
of every able-bodied soul in my district.

656
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,967
Major, I don't understand.

657
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:20,271
The only time we can hold a drug corner
is when we assign officers to stand there.

658
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:24,177
Your slides don't suggest
any concerted deployment on any corners.

659
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,339
How were you able to...

660
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,680
Jesus Christ, you nit,
don't you see what he's done?

661
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,182
He's legalized drugs!

662
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,787
Actually, I elected to ignore them.

663
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:38,328
You lost your fucking mind.
He's lost his fucking mind.

664
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,425
You, in my office. Now!

665
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,033
Okay.

666
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,798
That's it, gentlemen.

667
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,658
- She's a go.
- Showtime, Bubs.

668
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,145
Oh, shit.

669
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,539
- Sister Squeak.
- Bottom-end Bubbles.

670
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,149
Where you been, girl? Been a long time.

671
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,644
T-shirts?

672
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:41,281
<i>- What the hell kind of money is in T-shirts?</i>
<i>- Girl, you just don't know.</i>

673
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,518
<i>But how's your game?</i>
<i>I heard you was locked up.</i>

674
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,755
<i>Shit, I been on paper for a year.</i>
<i>I got some things going.</i>

675
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,924
<i>- Yeah, I can see that. Looking all good...</i>
- How's he doing?

676
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,525
- Talk a cat off a fish cart.
<i>- All right, Bubs, I gotta get.</i>

677
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,732
I'll see you later on.

678
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,167
Yo, Squeak, Squeak! I about forgot.

679
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:05,408
I can sell you one of these real cheap,
if you got use for the shit.

680
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,645
I'm fucking dead.

681
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,520
You mean, we're fucking dead.
We're all dead behind this shit.

682
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,418
Jesus Christ.

683
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,758
You know, what I did,
I did knowingly and on my own.

684
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,424
I mean,
my men had nothing to do with this.

685
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,467
They thought
it was part of some elaborate trap.

686
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:29,294
So if you need me to fall on that sword,
I'm good with that.

687
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,072
You're good with it?

688
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:35,167
Hey, you know I got my vacation time,
and that's 30 in a couple of months.

689
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,312
So if you need me to fall, I'm ready.

690
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:43,415
But don't let me hear that you're taking
any punitive action against my people.

691
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,853
Because I can get on the soapbox,
and I can lie as good as the next man...

692
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,390
if I have to.

693
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,792
Are you threatening me?

694
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,826
I believe I am, sir.

695
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,026
My apologies.

696
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,835
Bunny, you cocksucker,
I gotta give it to you! A brilliant idea!

697
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,807
Insane and illegal,
but stone-fucking brilliant, nonetheless.

698
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,445
After all my putting my foot
up people's asses...

699
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,982
to decrease the numbers,
he comes in and in one stroke...

700
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,883
gets a fucking 14% decrease.

701
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:20,147
Fucking shame it's gonna end our careers,
but <i>still...</i>

702
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:25,422
Look, y'all probably
tired of hearing from me, <i>but...</i>

703
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,467
I brought these letters...

704
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,196
I brought these letters...

705
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:37,335
from community associations,
ministers, business people, citizens.

706
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,433
And they're all positive.

707
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,479
They're all happy
that the dealers are off the corners.

708
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:49,280
You think that's gonna save our asses,
do you?

709
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:55,016
No, I guess not,
but that and my badge is all I got.

710
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:59,786
I might have your badge, Major,
but not today.

711
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,597
I don't wanna draw any attention
to this shit...

712
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,032
before we're ready to speak to it.

713
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:10,896
So if you have any vacation time,
you're taking it now.

714
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:16,274
Do not report for a shift until notified.

715
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,856
One more thing, sir.

716
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,226
A <i>Sun</i> reporter is aware of my deployment.

717
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,827
I told him an investigation was pending.

718
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,300
He promised to delay the article.

719
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,699
How long?

720
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,601
About a week, tops.

721
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,541
I was with Superstroke on the pool circuit
in the early days...

722
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,347
but mostly it was
pickpocketing and short cons.

723
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,447
I did the long-distance access card heist
before cell phones got popular.

724
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,185
You crypt numbers?

725
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,723
Yeah, I favored the airports, yeah.

726
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,320
- Can you still read numbers?
- Whoa, whoa, what's up with this?

727
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,059
Your man think
I brought him bad merchandise?

728
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,931
'Cause if that what he think,
we can just beat feet right now.

729
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:16,938
Damn, Bernard, why you acting all CIA
and shit? We trying to make money here.

730
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,439
If you had to answer to the people I do...

731
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,942
your ass would be damn more sight
cautious, too, that's all I'm saying.

732
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:24,912
I appreciate caution,
'cause I'm hanging out here, too.

733
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,676
Give it a go. Use a cell phone.

734
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:43,460
Marlene, you send that copy off to Paris?
Thank you, darling.

735
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,967
That will work.
I'm at the airport. The shuttle, yes.

736
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,387
3-1-0...

737
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,858
4-4-8-16...

738
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,228
91-7-7-8...

739
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,469
3-1-2.
Now, that last number might be a seven.

740
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,664
I'm not too sure
with these small keypads and all.

741
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,331
We can do business.

742
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:32,872
That's it. One-two, one-two, one-two.

743
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,110
One-two, that's it. One-two, there you go.

744
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,988
All right, there it is. Now you getting it.
Keep that left hand up.

745
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,767
All right. Watch your balance now.
Don't lean forward.

746
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,927
Don't lean too much.
Don't lean too forward, all right?

747
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,767
All right, let's go.
Don't lean too forward, that's right.

748
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:57,840
One-two, pivot.

749
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:02,143
You're kidding. Tell me he's kidding.

750
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,412
You're kidding, right?

751
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:10,216
- He did it without our knowledge.
- Without your knowledge.

752
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,088
Well, that's worse.
You're the Commissioner.

753
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,087
Was the Commissioner.

754
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,891
You think the buck's gonna stop
in this office, you're wrong.

755
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,428
If I might...

756
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,492
these are letters from people in his district.

757
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,735
Ministers, business people, voters.

758
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,135
All glowing reports.

759
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:34,641
And there's the 14% reduction in crime
in the Western.

760
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,471
That's not an anomaly. It's hard data.

761
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,314
Now, we can clean it up, make it go away.

762
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,889
The press might already have wind of it,
but we can explain that...

763
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,652
as some sort of a new initiative.

764
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,384
Trap high-end drug dealers.

765
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,624
14%.

766
00:53:55,799 --> 00:54:00,202
If we handle this right,
we might all get out from underneath.

767
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,097
No mud on anybody.

768
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,471
No. No.

769
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,708
I trusted you, Erv, I really did.

770
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,338
You let me down.

771
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,048
Now, this thing goes wrong,
no telling the damage.

772
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,618
On this, you walk point.

773
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,156
That's the way things work, Erv.
You know it as well as I do.

774
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,921
Thank you, Ervin.

775
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:29,954
I'll be over shortly...

776
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:34,196
to see the detailed plan on
how this shit gets cleaned up immediately.

777
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,753
If you could call this shit
something other than what it <i>is...</i>

778
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,552
Don't even think it.

779
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,628
The way it works is this.

780
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:06,259
If you don't re-up the minutes
on your cell phone before 60 days...

781
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,462
the wireless company recycles
the phone numbers.

782
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,163
And that's where I get them.

783
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:13,140
I put the word out on the street
that I'm buying tossed-off burners...

784
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,608
paying $2 a pop.

785
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,611
Street people bring me hundreds.

786
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,238
I bring them in here to my niece,
she jiggles the computer...

787
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,648
juices them up another 200 minutes
on a bogus account.

788
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:27,323
And that automatically extends
the life of the phone for another 60 days.

789
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,286
She charges me $20 on each phone
on her end.

790
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,226
I double it or more on the street
to make mine.

791
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,025
So what you saying?

792
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,863
Baby, a standard Tracfone with 200,
maybe 400 minutes on it...

793
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,868
gonna run you $150, $200 easy.

794
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:45,263
I charge you an even $100.
You clear $50 on each phone.

795
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,536
That's if you can back them up
with receipts.

796
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,876
I gotta show receipts looking like
they from different places, or I can't play.

797
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,674
Can we accommodate the good man?

798
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,776
Damn, Calvin,
you know I got the bingo tonight.

799
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,234
Look, friend,
I ain't sure you wanna be around here...

800
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,634
and I'm damn sure we're getting
tired of having you. That plain enough?

801
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:19,106
You should know by now, I don't wanna be
around no bunch of cocksucking faggots.

802
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,643
But I ain't gonna stop coming round
till I run up on Omar.

803
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,372
You might want to get the word out.

804
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,675
For the last time, I don't know him.

805
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,443
Then I'm back tomorrow.

806
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,531
Maybe I can help you?

807
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,708
I don't doubt it for a minute.
