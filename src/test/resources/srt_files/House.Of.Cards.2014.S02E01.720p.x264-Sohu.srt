1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,910
Previously on House of Cards.

2
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:04,730
I think we should end it.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,145
All right.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,460
You said we'd keep our
professional relationship.

5
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:11,140
Well, this is what
professional feels like.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,150
As long as we're clear
about what this is,

7
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,670
I can play the whore.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,750
Sounds like she's getting the
better side of the bargain.

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,190
- You think he's dangerous?
- I know he is.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,310
Peter?

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,770
Maybe he wanted Russo
to self-destruct.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,050
Peter Russo is dead.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,685
Suicide.

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,495
And then next week...

15
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,475
The President taps Underwood.

16
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,640
Yes. I want to be
the Vice President.

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,975
Do you feel that? The kicking?

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,645
Ms. Cole claims that you said,

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,595
quote, "I need
employees, not mothers,"

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,510
and, quote, "Go
focus on your baby."

21
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:41,070
What are you doing?

22
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,005
This is serious.

23
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,870
I've investigated
police cover-ups before.

24
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,672
I got death threats for a year.

25
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:47,283
Are you willing to take that risk?

26
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:48,860
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.

27
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,690
It's the last one tonight.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
We could jump in the car if...

30
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,840
We'll wait.

31
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,000
- Did you get the congressman
anything for his birthday? - No.

32
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,555
I got him cufflinks.
Silver, with his...

33
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,300
We don't talk about
birthdays. We don't do gifts.

34
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,250
Why not?

35
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,790
You should return the cufflinks.

36
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,610
Doug?

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,670
Tried calling you.

38
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,890
- I left my phone in the...
- We need to talk.

39
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,495
What's going on?

40
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,900
Christina. I just spoke to her.

41
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:08,705
Did Zoe...?

42
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,555
Yeah. But that's not all.

43
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,140
They tracked down Rachel, too.

44
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,610
Francis?

45
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,280
Tell me about Rachel. Where is she?

46
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,677
I have her under control.

47
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:20,040
That's not what I asked.

48
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,820
I drove her home. We don't
have to worry about her.

49
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:24,720
You said the same
about Ms. Skorsky.

50
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,770
Anyone else involved?

51
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:29,155
Just Janine and Zoe.

52
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,275
They asked about Russo's arrest

53
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,185
and they know he
went to see Kapeniak.

54
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,060
I assume that's as
far as they've gotten.

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
Assume nothing.

56
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,175
I'll alert Barney Hull.

57
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,350
What do you want
me to do about Zoe?

58
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:39,720
I'll handle Zoe.

59
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,215
Get to work.

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,800
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,580
I emptied it.

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,415
You're another year
older on Tuesday.

63
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,960
And we can't have a vice
president who smokes.

64
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,080
Can you finish?

65
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:14,000
What?

66
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm good.

67
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,220
What's wrong?

68
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,655
Nothing. I just said finish.

69
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,740
Well, I don't want
just... if you're not...

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,140
Okay, fine. Whatever.

71
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,980
Zoe, did I do something
that made you...?

72
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,920
No.

73
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,570
Zoe, you can't say something like
"just finish" and then shut down.

74
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,610
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
Good morning, Jackie.

76
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,240
Good morning.

77
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,195
Richard Russell.

78
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,540
Civil Rights Act. 1963.

79
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,670
Not everyone can be on
the right side of history.

80
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,260
No, not even Lyndon for a time,

81
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,780
but he would have never become
majority leader without him.

82
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,325
Well, there's no
Johnson Senate building.

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,380
No. He had to settle for
a presidential library.

84
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,430
So it's been some time since you
and I have had a chance to catch up.

85
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,065
You've been an
outstanding deputy, Jackie.

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,840
Far more effective than your
more seasoned colleagues.

87
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,580
You're a coalition builder,
a fighter when you have to be.

88
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,580
Tell me, where do you
see yourself headed?

89
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,950
I'd like to aim for the
chair of Armed Services.

90
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,350
Or Homeland Security.

91
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,810
Have you ever considered
serving in the leadership?

92
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,555
I figure that might be possible
eight, ten years from now.

93
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,020
Well, what if I suggested that you
could serve in leadership this term.

94
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,490
To replace me. As whip.

95
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,740
You're being tapped for VP.

96
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,270
Let's assume that's true.

97
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,900
- Well, that makes sense.
But me as whip? - Yes.

98
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,225
A third-term congresswoman?

99
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,680
A universally admired incumbent who
also happens to be a war veteran.

100
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,220
Webb is next in
line. Or Buchwalter.

101
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,320
So just consider that for a moment.

102
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,750
They'll draw votes
from one another.

103
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,420
Oh, I'm not saying you
wouldn't have to fight for it,

104
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:22,410
but I'd be willing to
give you the ammunition.

105
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,820
Come over here.

106
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,130
What is this?

107
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,520
My files on Webb and Buchwalter.

108
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:37,670
Why don't you take a look?

109
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,680
We'll speak in a few days.

110
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,175
Oh, and, uh, there's one on you.

111
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,480
You might want to begin
by reading that one first.

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,050
What'd Janine say?

113
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,700
Strip club's not open yet.

114
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,765
You'll look into Kapeniak?

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,540
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.

116
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,000
- Drop me at metro center.
- Not the office?

117
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,260
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

118
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,315
She'll deny everything,
like she did last night.

119
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,920
She can't deny getting into
Stamper's car. You saw her.

120
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,860
Maybe you send a version
of the story, about her dad?

121
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,810
No one would print it.

122
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,335
Rachel doesn't know that.

123
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,265
She said, "Go to town, bitch."

124
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,190
It won't work. I have
to get in her face.

125
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,140
Congratulations.

126
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,595
- We're thrilled for you.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,590
I wanted to fill in Bob
and Terry personally.

128
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,460
Now let's get to it. I have to
leave for Pittsburgh in what?

129
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:53,305
20 minutes.

130
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,270
Home stretch with
Jim. Whistle-stop tour.

131
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:56,265
Looking good out there.

132
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,110
Very good. But we don't
want to take any chances.

133
00:08:58,145 --> 00:08:59,940
Now, your replacement
as whip, Frank.

134
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,590
Bob has already
shared some thoughts.

135
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,545
I like Howard Webb.

136
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,420
Webb is a solid choice. Have
you thought about Wes Buchwalter?

137
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:06,745
Buchwalter's a hot-head.

138
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,725
Well, could you live
with Webb, Frank?

139
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,250
Webb is a good tactician,
but he lacks follow-through.

140
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,800
The problem with Buchwalter
is he's too abrasive.

141
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,032
No charm. Lots of enemies.

142
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,195
Is there a third option?

143
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,440
They're the two most senior members
in the caucus. It's their turn.

144
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,765
Mr. President, what if
we let the caucus pick?

145
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,210
Let it be a wide-open race.
Both men are qualified.

146
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,895
The leadership should
be united in this.

147
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,905
We don't want to be backing
different candidates, Frank.

148
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,880
So we stay out of it and
neither of us backs anyone.

149
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:29,495
I like it.

150
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,570
Caucus will respect someone who
did it the old-fashioned way.

151
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,685
Well, gentlemen, it's
your call to make.

152
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Figure it out amongst yourselves.
Let me know what you decide.

153
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,100
Thank you, Mr. President.

154
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,450
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.

155
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,520
Frank, I don't want to go
to battle with you on this.

156
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:45,652
We've been down that road.

157
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:46,715
I couldn't agree more.

158
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,005
An open race makes me nervous.

159
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,020
Well, look, it was
just a suggestion.

160
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,890
- I'll put some thought into it.
- Thank you.

161
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,380
You know, let me...
let me go work on him.

162
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:58,560
Good luck.

163
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,615
What are you doing here?

164
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,970
Ask me what I want to order.

165
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,105
Have you decided, sir?

166
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,090
I need you to quit your job.
Tell Leon it's your last day.

167
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,440
Why?

168
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,840
Act normal.

169
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,510
Did you want a side with that?

170
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:33,755
They found you once.

171
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,500
We can't take the chance
they'll find you again.

172
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,170
What am I supposed
to do about money?

173
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,270
Do as I say. Go home
and pack your things.

174
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,235
I'll come by around ten.

175
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,010
- Well... but I don't get
a say in any... - Stop it.

176
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,520
One suitcase. That's it.

177
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,560
- Can you at least tell me...
- I'll take the shepherd's pie

178
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:55,420
with a side of Brussels sprouts.

179
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,470
To go.

180
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,840
We don't want a trial. Her
lawyers don't want a trial.

181
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,905
But Ms. Cole won't
listen to reason.

182
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,170
That said, if you give me a
little more time, I think that...

183
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,515
If she wants to go to court,
then let's give her that.

184
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,810
Just because she's being
unreasonable now doesn't mean she...

185
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:10,715
I'm done.

186
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,105
That's a knee-jerk reaction.

187
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,160
I've never known you to be a person
who was irrational or impatient.

188
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,470
Let me check back with her
lawyers, and maybe we can...

189
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:18,320
What's the soonest we
can get a trial date?

190
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:18,840
Claire...

191
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,485
Give me a timeframe.

192
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,610
Six months, at the earliest.

193
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,790
Inform her people, then
no more communication.

194
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,270
As your counsel, it is my duty to
strongly advise you against this.

195
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:35,310
I understand and I
thank you, Oliver.

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,330
Thank you.

197
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,970
- So? - They wouldn't give
me individual contact info,

198
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,880
but here's every doctor
who served in east Africa

199
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,160
during the last three years.

200
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:50,365
And what about the HMO?

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,950
You need a consent form.
And it's in the packet.

202
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,070
Can I help you?

203
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,870
Yeah. I'm looking
for Rachel Posner.

204
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,540
She's not here.

205
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,370
Uh, is she coming in later?

206
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:12,290
Why?

207
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,800
I know her.

208
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,390
Well, your friend
really screwed me over.

209
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:17,575
What happened?

210
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,520
She took off, middle of her shift.

211
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,370
I had to put my hostess
on wait staff duty.

212
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,395
Look, I'm concerned.
Rachel's in real trouble.

213
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,850
I don't care what her
personal issues are.

214
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,060
I just need to know
where she lives.

215
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,005
I thought you knew her.

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,915
I do. It's just been a while.

217
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,240
And she sent me a text message
saying she wants to hurt herself.

218
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,930
And now she won't answer her phone.

219
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,750
She has a history
of mental illness.

220
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,810
You've gotta help me out.

221
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,900
Look, I can't.

222
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,940
Her W-2, the address
is a P.O. Box.

223
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,470
I'll take whatever I can get.

224
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,365
- Let me see what I got in the office.
- Thank you.

225
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,920
If you find her, you
tell her not to come back.

226
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,470
I don't need some nutcase
creating chaos in here.

227
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,480
- Nancy?
- Yes, sir?

228
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,455
Is Doug back yet?

229
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,650
In his office. And, sir?

230
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,665
Birthday cards have started
to arrive. A few presents.

231
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,880
Thank you notes. Inventory the
presents. Anything valuable...

232
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:18,670
Goes in the conference room?

233
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:19,467
Anything cheap...

234
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:20,195
Goes to the interns.

235
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,500
And you know what
to do with the cards.

236
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,480
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,755
I'm picking her up tonight.

238
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,710
I got everything set
up for her in Joppa.

239
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:34,550
Where's that?

240
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,010
Maryland. About 30
minutes north of Baltimore.

241
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,215
That's close to home.

242
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,610
We want her to
disappear, but not on us.

243
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,970
- Fine. Do you have the burner?
- Yeah.

244
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,110
Happy birthday.

245
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,070
It's prepaid. All you need
to do is turn it on and dial.

246
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,825
We still have the phone history.

247
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,150
All the more reason to
be safe going forward.

248
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,510
Where are we with Christina?

249
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:03,420
I'm on it.

250
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,120
Linda's office. I
called her this morning.

251
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,810
Are you Gillian Cole?

252
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,910
Yeah. Uh, have we met?

253
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
No, we haven't met.
You know my husband.

254
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:18,762
Your husband?

255
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:19,910
David Applebaum.

256
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,310
So it's true.

257
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,580
It was a mistake.

258
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,010
You want to see our kids?
I can show you pictures.

259
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,245
Mrs. Applebaum,
I... I'm...

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,490
Who the fuck do you think you are?

261
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:31,645
Look, I'm sorry.

262
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,770
You're sorry? I don't
think you're sorry.

263
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,125
And don't think for a second

264
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,790
you're gonna use that baby
to get money out of us.

265
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,290
He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.

266
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,220
But you knew he was married.

267
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,380
How could you?

268
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,885
- Did he talk about us?
- No.

269
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,265
Lying bitch. Am I embarrassing you?

270
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,970
Did you think about how you
would humiliate me and my kids?

271
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,890
Use a condom the next time
you fuck somebody's husband.

272
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,630
It's been less than 24 hours.

273
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,510
She quits her job in
the middle of a shift?

274
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:24,325
She's scared.

275
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,605
I'd take off, too.

276
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,850
It's Underwood.

277
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,540
He's moving faster than we are.

278
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,910
What about the stripper?

279
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,640
Refuses to talk.

280
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:32,765
Kapeniak?

281
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,100
No current address. No
siblings. Parents are dead.

282
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,165
Rachel's the last loose end.

283
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,140
She must know something
else. Bigger than the DUI.

284
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:41,660
Any idea where she went?

285
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,020
I got a P.O. Box in Dupont, but
none of the clerks have seen her.

286
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,735
I could go stake it out, but...

287
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,440
Have you talked to your guy yet?

288
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,715
In the next day or two.

289
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,390
He's bringing me the police
report on Russo's suicide.

290
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,735
I'll press him for more.

291
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,035
And what's your next move?

292
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,070
Trying to figure out
how to respond to this.

293
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,180
I got it a couple hours ago.

294
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,355
I think he's setting her up.

295
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,940
I know how to handle him.

296
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,050
The less he learns, the better.

297
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,170
We might learn something.

298
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,300
Not with him calling the shots.

299
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,525
I'm choosing the place.

300
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,465
As if that makes a difference.

301
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,870
I'm not gonna fuck
him. Just talk to him.

302
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,620
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

303
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,080
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have... - That's okay.

304
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,190
No, it's not.

305
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,240
I just don't want
you to be careless.

306
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,360
I won't be.

307
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,840
You want no life?

308
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,890
You want more work than
three people can handle?

309
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:36,795
You want a decent chance

310
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,250
that you could be fired
within the first month?

311
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,830
If that tempts you,
we can keep talking.

312
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,155
None of that intimidates me.

313
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,950
I've been running a congressional
district for the past nine weeks

314
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,520
with zero assistance.

315
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,865
Nobody elected me.

316
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,050
Nobody taught me.

317
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,110
I've done it because
somebody had to.

318
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,725
What happened was tragic.

319
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,890
But you won't get sympathy from me.

320
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,540
I don't have time for it.

321
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,810
I wouldn't be sitting here if
I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

322
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,750
Rachel?

323
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,230
Leave.

324
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,930
I said leave.

325
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,975
Are you packed?

326
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,410
I'm not going anywhere.

327
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,680
So you didn't quit today.

328
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,150
I did, but I changed my mind.

329
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,920
This isn't your decision to make.

330
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm keeping my job and
I'm keeping this apartment.

331
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,580
No, you're not.

332
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,280
You promised you'd make
all of this go away.

333
00:17:58,315 --> 00:17:59,175
And you starting
over is the first...

334
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,070
No, I already started over. I
don't want to start over again.

335
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,880
I wish you didn't have to.

336
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,470
Get out.

337
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,285
Get out!

338
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,670
Lower your voice.

339
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,800
I'll fucking kill you.

340
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,610
Go ahead.

341
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,730
I am the only one who can
protect you. Don't you see that?

342
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,920
You have no idea how
much danger you're in.

343
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,970
Start packing.

344
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,240
You know I ask every year.

345
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,850
Nothing, as usual.

346
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,905
I thought we could have dinner.

347
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,930
Only if it's someplace where
nobody will recognize us.

348
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,712
I don't want
anyone walking up...

349
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:15,460
I mean at home.
I'll cook something.

350
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,480
No cake.

351
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:18,287
No cake.

352
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,201
No gifts.

353
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,080
No gifts.

354
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,050
I can do that. How's
the lawsuit coming?

355
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,170
We'll be fine.

356
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,295
We'd like to increase
the size of your detail

357
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,410
to full head of state
status, starting tomorrow.

358
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:31,040
Well, that won't be happening.

359
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,875
It's good to get a head start,

360
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,085
so that by the time
they announce...

361
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,010
These are my last few days
before I never have privacy again.

362
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,440
I intend to savor these
moments for as long as I can.

363
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,037
But, sir, in terms
of safety, I think...

364
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:43,011
Until I'm confirmed
as the Vice President,

365
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:44,950
security is at my
discretion. Is that correct?

366
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,870
Technically,
yes. But...

367
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:47,090
Then that's settled.

368
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,630
All right. We'll wait
until the announcement.

369
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,510
Now, assuming the
confirmation goes through,

370
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:53,005
we'll need to work
out the logistics

371
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,120
of moving you into
the Naval Observatory.

372
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,705
That won't be happening, either.

373
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,030
The congressman will be
remaining in his townhouse.

374
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,860
But it doesn't have the
necessary security infrastructure.

375
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,140
Then you'll need to build it.

376
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,125
We're talking blast-proofing,

377
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,980
hardwired communications
networks, 24-hour office space...

378
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:12,870
Where there's a
will, there's a way.

379
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,010
I'll contact you directly
about setting a plan in motion.

380
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,685
And one last thing before you go.

381
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,740
I'd like to have Edward
Meechum serve on my detail.

382
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:27,855
He's Capitol Police.

383
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,190
For now. You're about to appoint
him to the Secret Service.

384
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,290
That would require an
accelerated training program.

385
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,130
Sir, we have plenty
of qualified agents.

386
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,665
Men and women with
years of experience.

387
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,440
And I look forward to
working with all of them,

388
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,180
as long as Edward
Meechum is on the detail.

389
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,880
Thank you very much for your time.

390
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,280
Thank you, sir.

391
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,070
Nancy, have Meechum
bring the car around.

392
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,380
You know, the last
time was the last time.

393
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,270
I know. But this is important.

394
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,310
You keep selling me that
swampland. I'm done buying.

395
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,665
No more.

396
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,800
Cover-up. You said it went
as high as Barney Hull.

397
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,975
That's not what I said.

398
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,240
When you gave me Rachel
Posner's arrest file...

399
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,950
What I said is that arrests don't
disappear without a big-ass wand.

400
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,235
That ain't the same as proof.

401
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,100
We think the congressional
leadership took part.

402
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:30,855
I don't care.

403
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,030
Yes, you do. I know you do.

404
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,365
No, I really don't.

405
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,555
When you helped me
expose the drug...

406
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,080
They were dirty street cops stuffing
a few grams in their pockets.

407
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,505
This is different.
Powerful fucking people.

408
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,520
Dirty cops are dirty cops.
You want to protect them?

409
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:42,670
I have a pension and a family.

410
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,960
I understand.
But...

411
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't contact me again.

412
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,995
Where's your cell?

413
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,940
Here. It's not recording.

414
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,610
I need to ask you to delete
all of our phone history.

415
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:43,515
Why would I do that?

416
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,390
I'm trying to protect
both you and I.

417
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:46,750
I'm not facing prison.

418
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,100
You didn't cover up the arrest?

419
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,620
Is it because you wanted
him to be governor?

420
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,525
No. He was in trouble, so I helped.

421
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,470
And later he expressed a desire
to run, and I offered guidance.

422
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:01,695
To an alcoholic?

423
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,005
To a sober recovering alcoholic.

424
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,280
Did you want him to self-sabotage?

425
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,075
Absolutely not.

426
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,860
It got Matthews in the race.

427
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,380
I like to back people
who want to succeed.

428
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,085
Take yourself as an example.

429
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,990
You just took advantage
of the situation.

430
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,070
Matthews took advantage. I
didn't seek the nomination.

431
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,910
Russo was in the passenger
seat when he died.

432
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,230
That's not entirely accurate.

433
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,165
I saw the police report.

434
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,005
And I spoke to the
commissioner directly,

435
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,390
because I cared about Peter and
I wanted to know the full story.

436
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,780
He wasn't in the passenger seat?

437
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,040
The passenger door was
open, and he was halfway out.

438
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:49,510
They think that... he might
have had second thoughts.

439
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,270
If I speak to Barney
Hull, he'll confirm that?

440
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,590
What are you suggesting, Zoe?

441
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,995
Maybe there was foul play.

442
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,315
If there was a hint of foul play,

443
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,350
don't you think the police
would have investigated?

444
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:03,270
The same police
that buried his DUI?

445
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,420
And you think I was involved.

446
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,070
There's a connection between you.

447
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,880
listen to you. You sound ludicrous.

448
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,215
I'm just asking questions.

449
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,445
No, you're connecting
dots that don't exist.

450
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,410
You want me to just walk away?
Act as if I don't know anything?

451
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,665
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam.

452
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,655
Yes, I sent him to
speak to Kapeniak.

453
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,575
But beyond that,
there's nothing to know.

454
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,170
Can you blame me if I find it
difficult to trust you right now?

455
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,510
Trust me or not,

456
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,665
but I'm about to be confirmed
as the vice president.

457
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,690
And our relationship extends
to the Oval Office now.

458
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,350
Don't step out of the
sunlight for no reason.

459
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,620
Let's start this new
chapter with a clean slate.

460
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,750
Now you sleep on that,
and I'll be in touch.

461
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,235
We'll start with blood
and hormone tests.

462
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,190
Those results should be
back within a few days.

463
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:56,805
If they're good,

464
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,430
we'll move on to genetic testing
for both you and your husband.

465
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,300
Have you spoken to him yet?

466
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,500
Not yet. I want to
do the tests first.

467
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,310
We can do those anytime this week.

468
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,110
I'll have my office call yours.

469
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,445
I almost forgot.

470
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,510
I've been doing some
research on the Internet.

471
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,250
Be careful of the Internet.

472
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,155
Well, I was looking
into common issues

473
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,160
associated with
post-40 pregnancies,

474
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:20,005
and this drug came up.

475
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,200
But there wasn't much
on it. It's Cruvenae...

476
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:24,980
Cruvenae-tenuestrin.

477
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,840
You probably haven't
found much because it's,

478
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,410
still in the beta stage.

479
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,025
And what does it do?

480
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,845
It helps maximize blood
flow to the placenta.

481
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,420
Until CVT there hasn't been
any viable drug for that.

482
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,400
The jury's still out.

483
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,980
But placental insufficiency
affects women of all ages.

484
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:44,040
I wouldn't worry about it for now.

485
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,340
That's putting the cart
way before the horse.

486
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,725
You know, Matthews
has this locked up,

487
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,265
but conservatives on
the hill are saying

488
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,040
he's gonna return to
Harrisburg with the same myopic,

489
00:25:58,075 --> 00:25:59,800
deficit-growing mentality.

490
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,190
Now, as to who's gonna replace
Matthews when he wins...

491
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,370
Can I at least turn
off the overhead?

492
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,405
Of course.

493
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,590
...someone even more
fiscally irresponsible...

494
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,080
Do you want me to
go work downstairs?

495
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,660
No. That's fine.
Just make some room.

496
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,760
You haven't said a word.

497
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,220
No.

498
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,920
Where does that leave us?

499
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,490
I'm fully prepared.

500
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,550
And I have been for some time.

501
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,030
I know you'll do whatever
you think is best.

502
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,015
But Underwood confirmed it.

503
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,240
He's gonna be tapped for VP.

504
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,395
That doesn't get us any closer.

505
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,605
Well, we know that Russo
cleared the way for Matthews.

506
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,780
It reinforces the theory.
It doesn't give us proof.

507
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:07,820
We can't go after the
guy for playing dirty.

508
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:08,545
That's not news.

509
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,165
Half the fuckers in
Congress play dirty.

510
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,170
He propped up a sham candidate,
just to take him down.

511
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,570
Nobody forced Russo
to drink that night.

512
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:15,565
The guy was an alcoholic.

513
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,315
Okay, we don't know
what happened that night,

514
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,030
other than three days
later he killed himself.

515
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,240
Are you gonna contact him again?

516
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,125
I don't know.

517
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,145
We need to slow down,

518
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,190
take a step back, and reevaluate.

519
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,730
We already let Rachel slip away.

520
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,800
There's no point
until we have more.

521
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:30,267
We should keep him
guessing, not...

522
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:31,700
Wait... have more
from where? From who?

523
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:32,065
I don't know.

524
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,355
But we should exhaust all options

525
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,070
before Zoe reaches
back out to Underwood.

526
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:33,835
It looks desperate.

527
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,305
{an8}But we don't
have any options.

528
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,740
{an8}We are up
against a brick wall.

529
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:37,970
And unless
Underwood...

530
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,330
Zoe...?

531
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,160
I just need to think.

532
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,710
Well, let's think
about it together.

533
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:49,860
I'll call you tomorrow.

534
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,680
Freddy?

535
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,750
Yeah, Frank?

536
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,190
Was there something different
about these ribs this morning?

537
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,710
Better or worse?

538
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,780
I didn't think that they
could get any better,

539
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,270
but these were something special.

540
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,880
Well, tried a new butcher.

541
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,780
Slow-bleeds his hogs.

542
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,392
It ain't legal, but...

543
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:15,935
Well, I won't tell anyone.

544
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,380
I don't know if I'm
gonna go back to him.

545
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,930
Went out to his shop.

546
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,300
He's got a room in the back

547
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,305
where he does it.

548
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,410
Soundproof. A whole setup.

549
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:26,170
W... why
soundproof?

550
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,330
'Cause of how they scream.

551
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,500
They can smell it coming.

552
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,840
You stick that pipe
in their throat,

553
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,200
the next 10 minutes is hell.

554
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,595
Bust your fucking eardrums.

555
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,050
Now, the humane way to
do it is to make it quick.

556
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,420
Bring out a bucket of slop like
it's feeding time and... bam.

557
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,850
Shovel right to the
base of the head.

558
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,750
No screaming.

559
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,980
He's willing to open up the
race, but Birch was very clear:

560
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,930
if he can't endorse
anyone, you can't either.

561
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,090
That's fair.

562
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,930
You really want Buchwalter to win?

563
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,520
I want the best man to win.

564
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,340
That sounds like a cagey
bullshit non-answer to me.

565
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm on the sidelines
for this one, Terry.

566
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,480
You're never on the
sidelines, Frank.

567
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,940
I'll see you around.

568
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,780
Claire. You wouldn't
return my calls.

569
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,460
I'll be back.

570
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,840
My attorney said that I
shouldn't be in contact with you.

571
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,890
Blue Cross said my
insurance was canceled.

572
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,830
The severance package gave me
health coverage for up to a year.

573
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,370
That sounds right.

574
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,720
So there must be
some kind of mistake.

575
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,860
Well, you'll have to talk
to the insurance company.

576
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:03,165
I did. They said it was terminated.

577
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,380
They can't reinstate it
without the employer's approval.

578
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,200
And you want me to get involved?

579
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,370
There's medication that I need

580
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,850
that I can't get unless
it goes through my HMO.

581
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm well aware. I... I
reviewed your records.

582
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,420
- What?
- You signed a consent form.

583
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,050
No. I... I...
I didn't.

584
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,875
You forged my signature?

585
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,240
Did a Mrs. Applebaum
pay you a visit?

586
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,570
You realize what
you're doing is...

587
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,525
Civil. Not criminal.

588
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,520
Have you thought this out?
Because when we go to court...

589
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:41,920
You mean six months from now?

590
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,030
You're expecting in four, no?

591
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,900
That's four months without
the medicine you need.

592
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,370
I'm wiling to let your child
wither and die inside you

593
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:54,820
if that's what's required.

594
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,810
But neither of us wants that.

595
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,470
Now tell me, am I really the
sort of enemy you want to make?

596
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,720
But here's the alternative.

597
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,560
This office, this staff,

598
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,350
22 million a year could be yours.

599
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,435
The CWI could be yours.

600
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,100
And you and me, we wash
our hands of each other.

601
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,885
You're trying to buy me.

602
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,740
No. When we first met, I
promised to empower you.

603
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,400
I'm fulfilling that promise.

604
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:23,275
How do I get screwed?

605
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,040
You don't. I resign.
You take my place.

606
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,700
No strings?

607
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:29,770
None.

608
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,645
Exit polls have
Jim Matthews winning

609
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,620
by anywhere from a nine-to-
twelve-percent margin of victory.

610
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,475
Hello?

611
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,710
Mrs. Underwood?

612
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:38,345
Yes.

613
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,555
Hi. I'm calling from
Dr. Larson's office

614
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,420
to confirm your 10 a.m. tomorrow
for the blood and urine tests.

615
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,300
I can't come.

616
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,385
Well, if tomorrow doesn't work,

617
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,950
we can reschedule for
Thursday or even Monday...

618
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:55,195
No, I won't be rescheduling.

619
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,270
Please tell Dr. Larson I
appreciate all her consultation,

620
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,020
but I've put a great
deal of thought into this

621
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:03,760
and I won't be pursuing
any further tests.

622
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,920
Thank you.

623
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,590
Have you thought about
what we discussed?

624
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,100
I think you're right. We
should start with a clean slate.

625
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,560
What about our text messages?

626
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,530
And the contact?

627
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,490
Are we good?

628
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,550
Yeah.

629
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,935
And we can put all this
other nonsense behind us

630
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,750
and trust one another and
continue to help one another?

631
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,050
I'd like that.

632
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,980
Then consider the slate clean.

633
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,860
Answer me one thing.

634
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,760
The passenger seat.

635
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,920
You said Russo was
trying to get out.

636
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:19,987
That there was
nothing ab...

637
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:20,985
I thought we
just agreed to...

638
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,340
I want to believe you,
but I need details.

639
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,730
More than what you're sharing.

640
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,450
What's your question?

641
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,460
The night Russo fell off the
wagon he was at a fundraiser.

642
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,050
The McNeally
Cancer Institute...

643
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,580
All in the police report.

644
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,360
Rachel Posner was at
the hotel that night.

645
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,160
Who's that?

646
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,340
The call girl who was with
Russo when he was arrested.

647
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,790
I didn't know her name.

648
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,120
She disappeared, Francis.

649
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,080
When?

650
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,360
Don't act surprised. I
showed the bellmen a photo.

651
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,400
One of them remembers seeing her.

652
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,105
The girl's a prostitute.

653
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,300
I'm sure she frequents many hotels.

654
00:34:58,335 --> 00:35:00,170
But that hotel on that night?

655
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,620
Well, now you sound
like Ms. Skorsky talking.

656
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,990
I haven't discussed
this with anyone.

657
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,905
I wanted to ask you first.

658
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,970
I have no idea what
happened that night,

659
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,967
except that Peter
started drinking again.

660
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,930
I don't know who
was or wasn't there.

661
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:15,230
I wish I was.

662
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,780
Maybe I could have stopped him.

663
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,780
Do you know where Rachel is?

664
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,635
Listen to what I am saying.

665
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,230
I am trying to protect us both.

666
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,870
These are questions
anyone could ask.

667
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,980
But no one is, except you.

668
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,650
I can't imagine what you're after.

669
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,230
I took a chance.

670
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,800
Showed up at your house and
placed myself at your feet.

671
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,210
Crossed ethical lines,
professionally, physically.

672
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,420
And I hold myself
accountable for that.

673
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,980
Those were my choices,
and I can live with them.

674
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,135
I'd like to move forward,

675
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,390
but I need to know exactly
what I was a part of.

676
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:53,610
That... that I wasn't
a part of someone's...

677
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,140
Finish your thought.

678
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,740
Part of someone's murder.

679
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,640
Jesus.

680
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,670
I want to believe you, Francis.

681
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,480
I know
you...

682
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,070
Janine!

683
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,940
Come in.

684
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,860
I've been calling you.

685
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,750
Come in. Sit down.

686
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,245
Um, you... you
want something?

687
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,570
Some, uh, water or, um, juice?

688
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,930
You going somewhere?

689
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,370
Hey. You going somewhere?

690
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,940
To my mom's. In Ithaca.

691
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,550
- What?
- I'm leaving.

692
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,720
No. No, no, no. No. No way.

693
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,890
- We have nothing.
- Are you giving up on this?

694
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,980
There are only three people in the
world that know what he has done,

695
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:30,120
and one of them is gone.

696
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,080
If we had anything, Lucas,

697
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,075
any hard evidence

698
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,570
or even a fucking quote from a
source that would go on record for us,

699
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,585
that would be one thing.

700
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,320
But we are grasping, and
he is not fucking around.

701
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,590
You were the one who
told Zoe to pursue this.

702
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,945
She told me what you said.

703
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,620
The only stories that mattered were
the ones that scared you to death.

704
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,610
Okay, this isn't
just death threats.

705
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,110
This is real.

706
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,960
He doesn't know about
you, but he knows about me.

707
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,830
These were in my mailbox.

708
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,160
No return address.

709
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,725
He took these of her?

710
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,190
Who else? You can keep them.

711
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,350
But I don't think
they're gonna help you.

712
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:03,417
We need to stop him.

713
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:04,450
Sick fucking shit.

714
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,735
Janine, you cannot
run away from this!

715
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:13,290
My entire career, I have
always chosen the tough stories.

716
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,080
I have been fearless.

717
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,710
But you know what?

718
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,720
I'm really fucking
scared this time.

719
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,020
He's got power.

720
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,410
He's got a lot to lose.

721
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,605
And right now he is winning.

722
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,620
Please, I need your help.
Please, don't do this.

723
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:28,600
Just wake the fuck up, Lucas!

724
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,675
The incident occurred at
approximately eight p.m. last night

725
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,600
on the northbound tracks of the
Cathedral Heights metro station.

726
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,150
D.C. Police have ruled
the death an accident.

727
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,300
Zoe Barnes was a senior
contributor at slugline.com.

728
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,425
Previously she worked
at the Washington Herald

729
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,960
as a metro reporter and
political correspondent.

730
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,195
Barnes broke several major stories,

731
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,790
include an early draft of the
Education Reform and Achievement Act,

732
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:11,780
as well as a college
newspaper article

733
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,745
that derailed
Senator Michael Kern's

734
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,700
nomination for
Secretary of State...

735
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,420
What'd you think of the files?

736
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,995
There's plenty to work with.

737
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,120
Did you look at your own?

738
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,620
There was nothing there.

739
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,040
Should there be?

740
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,380
No.

741
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,405
Even if you're lying,

742
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,380
the fact that I haven't
been able to find anything

743
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,320
tells me you're very good
at covering your tracks.

744
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,350
That's, uh, valuable to
me. Here's our battleground.

745
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,010
113 votes.

746
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,080
You have the skeletons.

747
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,380
If I lose, they'll come after me.

748
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,170
That's a risk you have to take.

749
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,310
How do I know you're
not just using me?

750
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,345
Throwing a wrench into
someone else's bid?

751
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,190
That's another risk. The
alternative is you wait 10 years.

752
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,400
You chose me for a reason.

753
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,150
I'd like to know what it is.

754
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,200
All right.

755
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,120
How many missile
strikes did you launch?

756
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,760
Enough to keep me awake at night.

757
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,910
But you did it anyway.

758
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:31,815
Yes, I did.

759
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,190
How many women and children?

760
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,080
Too many.

761
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,375
And you launched those missiles

762
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,230
knowing all those
innocent people would die.

763
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:39,215
I had orders to
eliminate the enemy.

764
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,860
Which you carried out
expertly and efficiently.

765
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,240
Have you ever killed anyone?

766
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,870
No.

767
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,380
I watched apartment buildings,
entire villages gone,

768
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,940
like they were never there.

769
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,240
I'd prefer not to talk about
it, if that's all right.

770
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,255
You did what needed to be done,

771
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,490
and that's why I chose you, Jackie.

772
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,500
Service background. Clean history.

773
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,720
Photogenic. The whole package.

774
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
But more importantly,

775
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,200
ruthless pragmatism.

776
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,920
Are we working together or not?

777
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,580
Any public or private
endorsements for Buchwalter,

778
00:43:20,615 --> 00:43:21,445
I come out for Webb.

779
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,550
I'll stay out of the
fray. I give you my word.

780
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:24,750
Same goes for you, Terry.

781
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,640
Thank you, Christina.

782
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,375
Gentlemen.

783
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,060
Mr. President. How
was Pennsylvania?

784
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,800
You like Indian?

785
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,100
Sir? I've seen the news.

786
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,820
I know she was close to you.

787
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,240
Terrible tragedy.

788
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,230
Spoke to Special Agent
Rockland today, sir.

789
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,200
I begin my training next week.

790
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,040
Very good.

791
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,710
I know it's a day late.

792
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,230
Hope it isn't inappropriate,

793
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,280
but I wanted to give you this.

794
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,510
Thank you, Meechum.

795
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,855
That was very nice of Edward.

796
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,070
He shouldn't have spent
this sorta money on me.

797
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,360
I've opened some wine downstairs.

798
00:45:12,395 --> 00:45:13,620
I'll be down in a minute.

799
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,060
Did you think I'd forgotten you?

800
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,050
Perhaps you hoped I had.

801
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,950
Don't waste a breath
mourning Ms. Barnes.

00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:28,160
Every kitten grows up to be a cat.

803
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,075
They seem so harmless at first.

804
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,350
Small, quiet, lapping
up their saucer of milk.

805
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:37,020
But once their claws get
long enough, they draw blood.

806
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,580
Sometimes from the
hand that feeds them.

807
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,800
For those of us climbing to
the top of the food chain,

808
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,560
there can be no mercy.

809
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,730
There is but one rule:
hunt or be hunted.

810
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,760
Welcome back.
