00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:51,725
- Sir, she's still closing.
- We simply cannot outrun her.

3
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,011
We must surrender
while we still can.

4
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,405
Gun crews... at the ready!

5
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:58,226
Gun crews at the ready!

6
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:39,407
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,944
Why aren't you on deck
with the crew?

8
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:45,106
I think the better question
is why aren't they all down here with us?

9
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,694
You could get killed up there.

10
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,488
- Oh, so you're a coward, then?
- Yeah. You, too?

11
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm no coward. I'm a cook.

12
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,094
I've no quarters to man.

13
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:56,363
What do you think the captain would do
if he found out you've abandoned yours?

14
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,607
Well, if he's dead
and I'm alive,

15
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,163
I like my chances.

16
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:02,369
- Fire!
- Starboard side!

17
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:04,507
They shot the muskets!

18
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:08,238
Bear up, damn it!

19
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,882
- You're short!
- Bear up!

20
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,709
Sir, they are out of our range.

21
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:19,182
All crews, fire your...

22
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,463
Get down!

23
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,516
You know who that is out there?

24
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:30,122
That ship flies the banner
of Captain Flint.

25
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,300
Isn't this your problem, too?

26
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,357
Good cooks are in short supply,
even for criminals.

27
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,144
But you, cowering below decks,
dodging a fight?

28
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,157
They'll gut you for sport.

29
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,106
- Give me that.
- No.

30
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,182
- What is that?
- That's nothing.

31
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,182
That doesn't seem like nothing.

32
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,300
Well, maybe when
Captain Flint gets here,

33
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,423
we can let him decide.

34
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,629
You wouldn't want to do that.

35
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:18,548
No? Why not?

36
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,488
Fall back!
Fall back!

37
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,738
- Get up!
- Go!

38
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,118
Get out of the way.

39
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,412
Close us in.

40
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,156
Sir, wait. Mr. Fisher.

41
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,652
Muskets at the ready.

42
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:28,400
Let me in, sir.

43
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,168
- Please, let me inside.
- Move away from that door!

44
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,457
- Sir, there may still be time.
- Move away from the door!

45
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:35,582
If we do not surrender now,
Flint will kill us all.

46
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:36,407
Please let me in!

47
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,100
Please, sir, open the door.

48
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:39,332
Open...

49
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,013
It's over... argh!

50
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:28,751
It's done.

51
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,982
Wouldn't you agree?

52
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:49,070

53
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:37,301
Can't sell that. Leave it here.

54
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:41,343
No.

55
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,400
Shit.

56
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:50,813
Grow up.

57
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,982
What the fuck is this?

58
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:01,169
Well, it's blocked, Mr. Gates.

59
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,194
Hello.

60
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,906
He couldn't handle the thought
of what you might do to him.

61
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:26,444
I, on the other hand,

62
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:29,206
would very much like
to join your crew.

63
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,263
My name is John Silver.

64
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,625
And I happen to be
a very good cook.

65
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,357
Know this...

66
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,688
now that the fight is over,

67
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,551
you have nothing more
to fear from us today.

68
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:59,126
Because we know
this fight was not of your making.

69
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:02,488
It was the choice
of our true enemy.

70
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:05,075
Your true enemy.

71
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,119
The tyrant captain.

72
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:14,644
Many of us once sailed
on ships like this one.

73
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,001
We know what it is
to be slaves to his whim,

74
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,888
his violence,

75
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,963
his shit wages...

76
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:26,188
...his insufferable stupidity.

77
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,644
So we've made for ourselves
a different life

78
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:33,801
where we don't rely on wages,

79
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,044
we own a stake, and where
our pleasure isn't a sin.

80
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,163
It's a virtue.

81
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:44,812
We also know what it's like
to see our brothers die

82
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:47,332
in the service of no end
other than a tyrant's pride.

83
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,162
This one wants to join.
Says he can cook.

84
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,251
Well, if he keeps that up, this one
won't be the only one looking to join.

85
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,300
- Today is a new day.
- Look at him.

86
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:57,976
Thinks he's captain already.

87
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,300
Today their crimes
have been exposed.

88
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:03,301
And they will be punished.

89
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,253
We made a full sweep
of the hold

90
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:18,163
and we found eight more
casks of whale oil.

91
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:19,506
That's all?

92
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,863
Total tally 400.

93
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,101
500, if we manage
to sell the tobacco.

94
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:29,376
Cameron's broken his arm.
Duffy's been shot in the leg.

95
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:34,444
After injury payments,
we will net just under $8 per man.

96
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,406
$8?

97
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,894
The crew will not be happy.

98
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,081
When are they ever?

99
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:48,869
When their end is a hell
of a lot richer than $8.

100
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:51,301
Here, take a look.

101
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:56,726
Captain's log. It's all there.

102
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,776
Vazquez, Port Royal.

103
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,557
Told you this was the ship.

104
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:06,976
Where is the schedule?

105
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:11,287
Minor obstacle.

106
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,207
But we're getting close.

107
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,937
Let me see
if I have this right.

108
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:19,355
This is the fourth
prize in a row

109
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,401
from which the profits
will barely exceed

110
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,826
the expenses it took to win it.

111
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,951
Singleton's out there
trying to convince your crew

112
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,213
to torture that poor bastard
of a captain

113
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:33,676
simply 'cause he hasn't
worked out how to get them to do it to you.

114
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,982
But all is well
because you've discovered

115
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:39,568
that the information
we can't tell anybody we're looking for

116
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:42,612
exists on a page...
that we don't have.

117
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,701
Don't have yet.

118
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,707
Mr. Duffy is dead.

119
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:56,007
I removed the leg,
but he lost too much blood.

120
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,863
Cut his cock!

121
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,832
Yeah!

122
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:14,463
Is this necessary?

123
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:22,057
We paid a heavy toll today.
And for what?

124
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,182
We all know the prize
won't come close to evening the scales.

125
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:28,663
Someone ought to pay
the difference.

126
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,288
Talk to me about recruits.

127
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:42,275
What's he doing?
Just give him a minute.

128
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,357
Where's the schedule?

129
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,544
What are you talking about?

130
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,050
The page that was
torn from your log.

131
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:59,713
If you know where it is,
now would be the time to say so.

132
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:04,113
Five?
You want to bring on five more men?

133
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,180
A carpenter,
two carpenter's mates,

134
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,711
a gunner's mate and the cook.

135
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:09,844
Hard to refuse a skilled hand.

136
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,082
Is it their hands you want?

137
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,407
Or their votes?

138
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,982
What a cunning bastard you are.

139
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:20,338
Squarely in
the captain's pocket,

140
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:23,569
yet you still got the crew
believing you're their advocate.

141
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,526
Shrewdest quartermaster
I've ever come across.

142
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,512
I wonder if you'll afford me
the same wide berth

143
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,893
you give that bastard
once I take his place.

144
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:38,194
You get the cook. That's all
the ship can afford right now.

145
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,628
I told you, I don't have it.

146
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:45,688
- One of my men must have taken it.
- Everyone was searched.

147
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,325
Damn it, if I knew more,
I'd tell you.

148
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:48,624
Now call off your men.

149
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:52,707
Get off it. Get back.

150
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:59,701
Pshaw. You can't, can you?

151
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:03,294
You're their captain,
but you have no control over them.

152
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:08,206
How long before you're the
one they tie to the mast?

153
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:14,932
I won't give you
the satisfaction of crying out.

154
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,031
Good for you.

155
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,801
Where are you going?

156
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:23,288
Justice is about to be done,

157
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,326
and you turn your back.

158
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,363
Sail!

159
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:44,579
Man-o'-war.

160
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:46,935
Royal Navy.

161
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,156
The Scarborough.

162
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,081
Scarborough ports in Boston.

163
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,463
Not today she doesn't.

164
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,293
She's got the wind of us.

165
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,813
Cut us loose. Get us under way.

166
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:25,644
My Boots.

167
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:28,725
Randall.

168
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,626
We've taken on a new cook.

169
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:38,588
Randall, we were clear
this job was only temporary.

170
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:40,501
There's still plenty
for you to do.

171
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,008
He'll be all right.

172
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:50,069
So both watches mess together
at six bells. Don't be late.

173
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,501
Any supplies you need,
see Dufresne.

174
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,658
He'll fund you out of the ship's
maintenance account.

175
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,082
One more thing.

176
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:58,393
No one gets any special treatment
from you of any kind.

177
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,794
No extra rations, no preferences
in cuts of meat.

178
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,738
Not for me,
not for the quartermaster,

179
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,519
not for the captain.
Here, every man is equal.

180
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,287
- All right?
- Even him?

181
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,669
Randall was the ship's
boatswain

182
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:15,644
before he got beaten to within
an inch of his life while taking a prize.

183
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:19,225
He lost his wits,
but not our loyalty.

184
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,363
We like Randall.

185
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:23,138
You?

186
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:25,568
We'll see.

187
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,844
He has the votes. Beg pardon?

188
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,794
Singleton, he has the votes
to remove you as captain.

189
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:19,563
Not every last one.
Haven't finished canvassing yet,

190
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:20,800
but when he gets ashore

191
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,894
and he doesn't have to be
sneaky about it, he'll get what he needs.

192
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,713
I thought you said it would
never get to this. Now hang on.

193
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:29,457
I thought you said you
put loyal men in all the right places

194
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,433
so the crew would never turn.
No, no.

195
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,470
I never said never.

196
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:35,013
I'm too old to be using that word.
Don't give me that shit.

197
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:37,962
I told you there would be some lean days
while we tracked Parrish's ship.

198
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,650
You said the crew
would weather it.

199
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,774
Days. Lean days.

200
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,143
It's been three months
with no profits to speak of

201
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:46,495
and nobody knows
what it's all been for

202
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,612
because you don't trust them
with the truth.

203
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:50,119
I don't trust them
with the truth.

204
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,275
So here we are.

205
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,301
Singleton.

206
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,531
They think he has any idea
how to put money in their pockets?

207
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:07,512
All they know or care
about Singleton right now

208
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,038
is that he isn't you.

209
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:15,926
I just need a few more days.

210
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:19,713
The page is gone.
It could be anywhere.

211
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:22,525
What makes you think
all you need is a few more days?

212
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:26,852
I'm gonna go and see Richard.

213
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:29,300
He can help me
recreate the schedule.

214
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,194
Richard Guthrie? Mm-hmm.

215
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:34,426
You think he's gonna help you?

216
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,725
Yes. Yes, I do.

217
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,130
Let's just for fun
say that he doesn't.

218
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,301
What then?

219
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,738
Then I'll forget
about the schedule

220
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:48,413
and go back to hunting fat, lazy
merchantmen and everyone will be content.

221
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,032
This is one of those times

222
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:55,632
where we pretend
that we both don't know that you're lying.

223
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,237
Landfall.

224
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,676
We're home.

225
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,793
Is this English soil?

226
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:06,899
It was once. Now it ain't.

227
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,473
Whose is it?

228
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,096
Ours.

229
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,668
Wait, I don't understand.
The captain asked for me to go?

230
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:22,150
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

231
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,319
He doesn't know
I'm coming, does he?

232
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:26,632
No, but I have
business here, so the job falls to you.

233
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:28,200
And what is the job exactly?

234
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:30,150
Captain's gonna ask
Richard Guthrie for a favor.

235
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:31,819
Mr. Guthrie is going to say no.

236
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:34,762
When that happens, the captain
will most likely react poorly.

237
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,450
Your job is to restrain him.

238
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,076
Restrain him, you say?

239
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:43,450
No cargo moves off this island

240
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,875
without Mr. Guthrie's
ships and connections.

241
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,587
The last crew that ran afoul of him
couldn't buy or sell shit for two months.

242
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:52,323
That's an outcome
I'd like to avoid.

243
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,198
Wait.

244
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:55,794
He never listens to me.

245
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,388
Nonsense. You're a highly
regarded member of this crew.

246
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:05,856
And I can assure you the captain
regards your input more than you know.

247
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,744
Billy's going with you.

248
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,194
Who's Billy?

249
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,838
What exactly
happens to all this?

250
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,657
It goes to the Guthries.

251
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,426
They pay up front for it,

252
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:26,474
take it someplace civilized
and sell it.

253
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:27,549
The Guthries?

254
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:29,105
Mate, no offense,

255
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:32,300
but the faster we get this loaded,
the faster I can get up the hill

256
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:35,544
and into the arms of
my sweet, sweet Charlotte.

257
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:00,257
Your recipes?

258
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:02,957
I left them with our
captain for safekeeping,

259
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:04,844
but I don't see them with
the rest of the journals.

260
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,436
All the volumes
from the prize are here

261
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:09,300
unless the captain took it.

262
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:12,301
In which case,
it's in his cabin on the ship.

263
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,011
He likes his books.

264
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,938
Is that him? Is this necessary?

265
00:23:25,013 --> 00:23:26,300
He's just a cook.

266
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:29,300
He meets the new ones.
No exceptions.

267
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:31,794
Um, what's going on?

268
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,394
Who wants to meet me?

269
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:35,588
Blackbeard.

270
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:55,138
Whatever you do,
don't show fear.

271
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:27,738
You're not Blackbeard.

272
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh. I see.

273
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,493
If you get lost in there,
give us a yell.

274
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,037
Rules are rules.

275
00:24:51,063 --> 00:24:53,244
And you are ours.

276
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:19,744
Mr. Gates.

277
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:26,857
I need a moment with your boss.

278
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,300
Not a good time.

279
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:31,300
Get the fuck out.

280
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:34,138
You want to run at first
sign of trouble, be my guest,

281
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:36,282
but don't expect me
to fucking help you.

282
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,150
And that goes for all of you.

283
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:40,938
If you want to hunt,
my door is open.

284
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:43,869
But if the mere whiff
of the navy is too much for you,

285
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,132
then God bless
and get the fuck out.

286
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:48,451
Fuck yourself, cunt.

287
00:25:57,301 --> 00:26:00,101
Did you just
tell me to fuck myself?

288
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,632
Mr. Scott, who is this man?

289
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,006
Mr. Sanderson.

290
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,944
Crews with Captain Burgess
of the Trinity.

291
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:11,800
How much was their last haul?

292
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:15,093
- Nearly a thousand in profit.
- Best tally in months.

293
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:21,712
Well, Mr. Sanderson.

294
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:24,738
Pleased to be in your company.

295
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:26,938
Do you know why?

296
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:31,169
Because you're an earner.

297
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:34,419
Can I tell you what happens
when I stand near an earner?

298
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:40,688
My pussy gets wet.

299
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:47,007
In which case,
I will go fuck myself.

300
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,269
Mistress Guthrie.

301
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,694
Now what the fuck do you want?

302
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:58,488
I wish you'd get
control of your men.

303
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:02,549
They come in here spouting off
they've seen His Majesty's Navy out there

304
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,300
and I have three crews
pulling orders

305
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:06,724
because they haven't
got enough balls to get back in the water.

306
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,505
I'll make sure to keep
that in mind, ma'am,

307
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:11,881
but right now the Scarborough is
the least of my concerns.

308
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,126
We have an agitator.

309
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:17,082
Fuck does that mean?

310
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,413
Challenger for the captaincy
of the Walrus

311
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:23,100
capitalizing on our friend's
recent rough patch.

312
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:26,301
I expect him
to call a vote soon.

313
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:29,226
I expect it to be close.

314
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:32,607
Flint's got morale problems.
What do you want me to do about it?

315
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:36,744
I need money
to shore up support.

316
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:38,869
You want a loan?

317
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:41,944
Flint's made you more money
than any captain here.

318
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,531
But lately he hasn't.

319
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:45,824
Yeah, well, that will change.
But mark my words,

320
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,642
without that money,
the most valuable captain on this island

321
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:50,835
will be out of a job tomorrow.

322
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:56,863
Think of it as an investment
in the future.

323
00:27:57,257 --> 00:27:59,413
You steal cargo
at the end of a sword.

324
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:02,300
We sell that cargo
to markets that will never have you.

325
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:06,132
When you are strong,
you are a necessary evil.

326
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,594
When you are not strong,
you are likely soon to be dead.

327
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:12,863
But what you are not ever

328
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,369
is a sound investment.

329
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,457
How much would you need?

330
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:30,301
1,000 pieces of eight,
give or take.

331
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,463
Take this to Virgil.

332
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:47,462
He'll see that you
get what you need.

333
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,657
Thank you, ma'am.

334
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:58,287
What?

335
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,056
I'm wondering what it is

336
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,092
exactly you think
you just purchased.

337
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:04,457
It's my money, isn't it?

338
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,187
Must I answer
for how I spend it?

339
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,650
To me, no.

340
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,212
But this enterprise
belongs to your father.

341
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,844
And I do not believe
he would approve of this...

342
00:29:17,194 --> 00:29:18,506
investment.

343
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:22,437
Well, then I suppose it's a
good thing that my father isn't here.

344
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:44,532
Mr. Smith to see Mr. Guthrie.

345
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,218
He's not expecting me.

346
00:29:58,438 --> 00:30:01,094
What does the crew
think of me, Billy?

347
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:03,880
Beg your pardon?

348
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,566
You're the ship's boatswain.

349
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,197
You know what's said
behind my back.

350
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:15,073
I know they've always
found me aloof,

351
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,507
too educated.

352
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:19,932
But now it seems
they feel I'm...

353
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,288
Too weak.

354
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:25,301
I was gonna say unlucky.

355
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,049
So that's the thinking.

356
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,168
We've been attacking ships
with light loads

357
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,262
because I'm too weak
to do otherwise.

358
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,701
Is that what you think?

359
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:38,751
I...

360
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,038
What the hell
are you doing here?

361
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,025
Now is that any way
to greet a friend?

362
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,513
I much prefer that way.

363
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,601
A sugar factor from Carolina.

364
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:58,587
Who purchases stolen
cargo from you

365
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,300
because he trusts me

366
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:03,688
because I have cultivated
his confidence.

367
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:08,582
And because I keep him
from ever having to lay eyes on you.

368
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:13,013
Then the sooner we get down
to business, the better.

369
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,769
A whore for every finger
on your hand,

370
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:35,938
but your eyes
kept drifting to this.

371
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:39,676
Tell me, what is it
that is so precious to you?

372
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,300
One scream will bring
Mr. Noonan.

373
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:43,594
Bring him.

374
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:47,069
I'll let him know his whores
like to steal from their customers.

375
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:49,331
And he can let
your new captain know

376
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,450
you have withheld something
of great value

377
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,007
that rightly belonged
to his latest prize.

378
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:00,669
So, what now?

379
00:32:01,668 --> 00:32:03,300
This is to sell, is it not?

380
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,900
But you cannot know
who best to sell it to.

381
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,507
I could know that.

382
00:32:08,582 --> 00:32:11,418
Hmm, and what's that
going to cost me?

383
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:13,256
Half.

384
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,300
Pleasure should be
shared equally.

385
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,713
It's the only way
to avoid hurt feelings.

386
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:24,132
Look, this deal,

387
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,300
it's really a terrible idea.

388
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:29,144
There are so many
ways it could go wrong.

389
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:31,132
Me, I can't help myself.

390
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:35,007
I see an opportunity,
I take it.

391
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,626
It's a sickness. Truly.

392
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:41,288
But you, you can
still walk away.

393
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:42,588
Bien.

394
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,707
Now tell me what it is.

395
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:52,738
I don't know.

396
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:26,182
You're not going to throw
your support behind Singleton.

397
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:30,938
I wondered when
this visit would come.

398
00:33:47,794 --> 00:33:49,926
The vote is closer
than you think.

399
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:52,082
I know this

400
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:55,394
because I brought
back 16 votes today.

401
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:58,194
Nelson's men are
always for sale.

402
00:33:58,507 --> 00:34:00,782
Paying Muldoon got me
the Welsh.

403
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:05,413
As of now, Singleton
is only up eight votes.

404
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:08,494
And you and your men hold nine.

405
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:10,037
So...

406
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:12,407
The captain's fate
is in our hands.

407
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,357
In your hands.
Your men vote with you.

408
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:18,782
And how much are you
willing to pay

409
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:20,113
for those votes?

410
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:22,863
Well...

411
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:24,894
nothing.

412
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:27,213
Spent everything I had
getting this far.

413
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:30,969
Think about your men.

414
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:33,244
Think about their future.

415
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:37,063
Is it their future
you wish to protect

416
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:39,107
or your friend's?

417
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:43,588
What difference does it make?

418
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,944
And you will pay us, obviously,

419
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:55,369
from the very first
prize we take.

420
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:00,301
I assumed that went
without saying.

421
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:24,050
You're in a festive mood.

422
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,101
What do you want, Rackham?

423
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:33,144
I'd hoped to toast
your coronation as captain of the Walrus.

424
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:37,051
Alas, I'm not so sure
that's where we're headed.

425
00:35:58,394 --> 00:36:01,701
You should keep your distance till I signal
you to return for me.

426
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:04,581
If anything should happen
and I don't return soon...

427
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:05,500
I leave.

428
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:07,981
Smart girl.

429
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:41,038
Let me tell you a story

430
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:44,301
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

431
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:50,687
A few weeks ago he staggers
into a tavern on Port Royal.

432
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:53,850
Takes a seat next to
an English merchant captain.

433
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:57,657
Vazquez, it turns out,
is dying.

434
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,300
Bleeding to death
from a knife wound to the belly.

435
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:05,493
The knife wound was courtesy
of his former employer,

436
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,957
La Casa del Contratacion,
in Seville.

437
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:10,463
Colonial intelligence.

438
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,250
Naval, more specifically.

439
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,919
One of their top agents
in the Americas.

440
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:19,069
Responsible for the security
of one particular ship.

441
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:23,518
A ship with a cargo so rich,

442
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:27,636
the king of Spain is very
anxious to see it launched.

443
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:30,807
Vazquez warned
that it was too late.

444
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:32,544
Storm season was upon them

445
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,620
and no escort could
be mustered to guard her.

446
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,476
But his superiors
demanded that he sign off.

447
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:41,475
They advised him that if he
couldn't arrange for an escort,

448
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:45,112
he should plot a course for
the ship unknown to anyone but her captain,

449
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:47,880
and consider that route
to be a state secret

450
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,457
of the highest order.

451
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:54,137
When Vazquez refused and threatened
 to report his concerns to the court,

452
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:56,944
things got ugly.

453
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,619
The ship in question...

454
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,444
L'Urca de Lima.

455
00:38:09,563 --> 00:38:13,169
The largest Spanish
treasure galleon in the Americas.

456
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:15,194
According to Vazquez,

457
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:21,275
total cargo in excess
of $5 million.

458
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,907
Marvelous story, Captain.

459
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:29,344
And how exactly
did you come to hear it?

460
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:34,068
A spy in my employ in Port Royal
who overheard the conversation.

461
00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:36,562
I must admit,
I harbored my doubts

462
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:39,568
to its authenticity
right up until yesterday

463
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,711
when I took the merchant
captain's ship

464
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,504
and found Vazquez's story
neatly written into his log.

465
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,413
Most impressive.

466
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:53,573
It sounds like your plan
is neatly resolved.

467
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,411
What could you possibly
want of me?

468
00:38:57,198 --> 00:39:00,185
Not quite entirely resolved.

469
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,169
A page was torn from the log

470
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,775
with the Urca's course
and schedule written on it.

471
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:08,499
Now I could recreate it
from what's left,

472
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:09,562
but I'd need help.

473
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,167
Someone with expert knowledge
of Spanish operations.

474
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:17,301
Your man in Havana.

475
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:20,750
I need you to make
an introduction.

476
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,301
Absolutely not.

477
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:35,212
Five million Spanish dollars.

478
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,619
When I take that ship,
you stand to gain...

479
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,125
When you take it?

480
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:43,925
Do you have idea
how heavily armed that ship is?

481
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,425
Even without an escort.
The risk is all mine.

482
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:50,162
The risk is not all yours.

483
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,000
If I were to even
make inquiries about this

484
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,418
with colonial intelligence,
they'd see me dead.

485
00:39:56,618 --> 00:39:58,686
You may have nothing to lose,

486
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,536
but I have a future planned

487
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:02,500
I'm not so willing
to throw away.

488
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,601
Let me make myself plain.

489
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:09,788
I will have that name.

490
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,032
Billy, put your pistol
on Mr. Guthrie here.

491
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,006
The name, please.

492
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:34,281
I'm telling you it is simply
out of the question.

493
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:36,401
Captain!

494
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,469
- Hold here.
- Aye, Captain.

495
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:52,719
What is it?

496
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:01,782
Captain Hume of
His Majesty's Ship the Scarborough.

497
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:07,819
Captain Hume.

498
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,607
You've caught me at business.

499
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:12,931
I must ask you
to return another day.

500
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:15,163
My apologies, Mr. Guthrie.

501
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,426
May I ask

502
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,300
what sort of business?

503
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:20,806
I'm sorry?

504
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:24,348
I asked what sort of business
you're conducting with these men.

505
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:27,192
Sugar merchants
from the colonies,

506
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:30,716
with business I'd just as soon conclude
without interruption.

507
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:34,222
So please, if you'll excuse us.

508
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:37,256
Tell me something, Mr. Guthrie.

509
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,951
Do you have gossip here?

510
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:41,257
Gossip?

511
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,244
I've often wondered
if it can survive

512
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:45,138
in so remote a location.

513
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:49,125
You see, gossip is what
holds civilization together.

514
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:51,551
It reinforces shame.

515
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:54,238
And without shame, well,

516
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:57,131
the world is a very
dangerous place.

517
00:41:57,744 --> 00:41:58,944
I'm sorry.

518
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:01,557
I don't understand.

519
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:05,301
Do you know what
the gossip is in London about you?

520
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:09,551
The gossip is that
you make your profits

521
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:11,612
selling ill-gotten cargo

522
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,993
stolen by the pirates
of Providence Island.

523
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,889
There's no truth to that.

524
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:21,300
We'll certainly
find out, won't we?

525
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:24,682
Take them into custody.
All of them.

526
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:41,688
You told me you
and your men were with me.

527
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:43,738
You gave me your word.

528
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:45,713
I do what's best for my family.

529
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:47,512
I'm what's best
for your family.

530
00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:49,380
Flint has fucked us all
for long enough.

531
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,032
Can't you see that?

532
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:42,313
Captain Vane.

533
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:51,776
Do I even want to know?

534
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:54,188
It's been a long day.

535
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,300
But I am up one vote.

536
00:43:56,745 --> 00:43:58,745
Looks like Flint is safe.

537
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,838
Mr. Gates.

538
00:44:16,882 --> 00:44:20,438
When he didn't return,
we came looking for him.

539
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:22,906
I found him here.

540
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:26,519
He said one word
before he died...

541
00:44:27,357 --> 00:44:28,551
Vane.

542
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,119
Damn butcher.

543
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:35,219
Yeah, but did you figure
him for a clever one?

544
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,870
I know what you're thinking.

545
00:44:38,832 --> 00:44:43,019
And we'd lose that fight.
At least today.

546
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:46,912
Fuck that. Eleanor.

547
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:48,556
Eleanor!

548
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:01,569
Awfully pleased
with himself, isn't he?

549
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:03,847
Why shouldn't he be?

550
00:45:04,227 --> 00:45:05,283
With Mosiah gone,

551
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,364
Flint no longer holds
the votes to remain captain.

552
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:12,019
Once the Walrus's men
realize Mr. Singleton's limitations,

553
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:16,044
we'll have a host of talented
defectors eager to swell our ranks.

554
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,119
And he only gets stronger.

555
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:20,463
He doesn't get shit
without you bringing up

556
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:22,482
that Singleton business
in the first place.

557
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:26,319
Yes, well, we all
have our roles to play.

558
00:45:29,444 --> 00:45:31,007
I want to fuck.

559
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:33,400
What, because of what
I just said?

560
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,169
Fuck's it matter to you?

561
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:37,301
All right, then.

562
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,001
Ms. Guthrie.

563
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:14,931
Now, would you like
to tell me what that was all about?

564
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:19,194
You fucked me tonight.

565
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:22,119
Flint, his captaincy,
I had an interest.

566
00:46:23,057 --> 00:46:24,338
You'll live.

567
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,481
You'll make it right.

568
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:28,824
Why would I do that?

569
00:46:28,825 --> 00:46:30,318
'Cause if you don't,
you're finished here.

570
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:33,231
I won't sell another
ounce of your cargo.

571
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:36,894
See how long you'll last as captain,
when your crew can't get paid.

572
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,287
Eleanor, your father
sells my cargo.

573
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,519
Whatever it is
you're so upset about,

574
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:45,044
I doubt he feels the same.

575
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,786
When I tell him you put our
biggest earner out of business,He'll...

576
00:46:48,787 --> 00:46:52,062
Remind you that Flint hasn't been
your biggest earner in quite some time.

577
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,382
You'll also be reminded of what
you've always known but never accepted,

578
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:58,088
that if forced,

579
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,400
your father will always
choose profits over daughters.

580
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:09,513
Hate your father?
I wouldn't blame you.

581
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:11,743
Hate me, too, if you'd like.

582
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,596
And if you feel the need,
cling to Flint,

583
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:18,300
and his legend and a past the rest
of us have long outgrown.

584
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:20,381
But make no mistake about it,

585
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:23,900
whatever future
this place has left,

586
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:25,581
I'm it.

587
00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:29,300
And if you ever challenge me
again in front of my crew,

588
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:32,649
I may just forget
that I loved you once.

589
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:51,092
Have you found us a buyer?

590
00:47:51,192 --> 00:47:53,192
Patience, mon cher.

591
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:56,269
Few here are willing
to cross your captain.

592
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:58,157
And those I have in mind

593
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:00,058
must be approached
with caution.

594
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:11,013
Excuse me.

595
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,757
Who did this?

596
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:46,932
Him?

597
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:49,513
I started it.

598
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,931
Why would you do this?

599
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:15,676
When the sea grows rough,

600
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:18,875
you come to Max.

601
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,862
Max is your harbor.

602
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,907
It's all coming apart.

603
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:32,544
This place, I can feel it slipping away...
Shh.

604
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:44,888
You are so ready
to see the worst.

605
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:51,919
You cannot see

606
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:55,857
what is right in front
of your nose.

607
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,125
The world is so full
of surprises.

608
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:39,300
Let it surprise you.

609
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:10,344
What are you doing?

610
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:14,363
I don't believe any of the men have ever
met him face-to-face.

611
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,832
We'll need to find
a safe place to stash him

612
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:18,750
before he comes to
and starts talking.

613
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,995
But in the meantime, I certainly
don't want his clothes giving him away.

614
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,588
You're gonna pretend that
isn't Richard Guthrie?

615
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:28,256
Soon word of Guthrie's arrest

616
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:31,088
will hit the customs
houses of Charleston,

617
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,431
New York,
and eventually Boston.

618
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:36,648
Sooner than later,
Nassau will be unable

619
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:39,092
to sell to any legitimate
market in the Americas.

620
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:41,587
I don't want the men
panicked about that

621
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:43,311
when I need them
focused on the Urca.

622
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,779
Jesus. Can you hear yourself?

623
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:52,018
You spent months lying to us about
what it is we're hunting out here.

624
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:54,811
And now when it's clear
it can't possibly succeed,

625
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:55,963
you want to keep lying.

626
00:51:59,788 --> 00:52:02,544
Maybe Singleton is right.
Maybe it's time we made a change.

627
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:11,507
Think carefully.

628
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:15,956
What lies ahead, Mr. Singleton
cannot see you through.

629
00:52:15,995 --> 00:52:17,082
And what is that?

630
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:20,029
There's a war coming, Billy.

631
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:21,122
One ship isn't a war.

632
00:52:21,147 --> 00:52:23,103
One ship isn't what's coming.

633
00:52:23,887 --> 00:52:24,812
That man Hume,

634
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:27,174
the captain of the Scarborough
told you as much.

635
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:30,057
When a king brands us pirates,

636
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:33,244
he doesn't mean
to make us adversaries.

637
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:35,132
He doesn't mean
to make us criminals.

638
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,401
He means to make us monsters.

639
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,800
For that's the only way
his God-fearing, taxpaying subjects

640
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:46,219
can make sense of men
who keep what is theirs and fear no one.

641
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:49,188
When I say there's
a war coming,

642
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:51,551
I don't mean
with the Scarborough.

643
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,219
I don't mean with King George
or England.

644
00:52:57,582 --> 00:52:59,531
Civilization is coming,

645
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:02,938
and it means to exterminate us.

646
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,656
If we are to survive,

647
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:10,719
we must unite
behind our own king.

648
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:14,663
We have no kings here.

649
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:17,957
I am your king.

650
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:45,125
The crew is assembled
for council.

651
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:47,232
Mr. Singleton
has called for a vote

652
00:53:47,301 --> 00:53:50,625
to select himself
as the new captain of this crew.

653
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:53,401
I need a minute.

654
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,007
What happened with Richard?

655
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:10,382
Oh, Jesus.

656
00:54:25,382 --> 00:54:27,538
I thought you said
you'd deal with this.

657
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:30,757
It fell through.

658
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,732
You need to figure out
what you're gonna say to them.

659
00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:37,488
They don't care about
anything I have to say.

660
00:54:37,489 --> 00:54:39,676
Well, you need
to make 'em care!

661
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:42,463
Or I don't know
what happens next.

662
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:50,394
I can stall 'em
for a few more minutes.

663
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,344
And I am sorry.

664
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:04,876
I'm sorry.

665
00:56:06,301 --> 00:56:07,701
For the short hauls.

666
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:09,762
For the trouble I've caused.

667
00:56:10,274 --> 00:56:11,749
But most importantly,

668
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:15,668
for the disregard
it seems I've shown you.

669
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:19,938
The most important
element of a healthy ship

670
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,133
is trust.

671
00:56:22,818 --> 00:56:24,137
Trust between men.

672
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,794
Trust between captain and crew.

673
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:30,769
Without it,

674
00:56:32,032 --> 00:56:34,032
a ship is doomed.

675
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,718
For the past few months,

676
00:56:39,826 --> 00:56:42,232
you and I
have been on the trail

677
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:44,744
of a prize so rich,

678
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:49,150
it could upset the very
nature of our world.

679
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:54,463
And for that reason,
I felt it necessary to keep it secret.

680
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:57,257
I didn't trust you.

681
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,457
And that was my mistake.

682
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:05,205
Right now I would like to tell you
that that prize

683
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:07,812
is within our grasp
and we are close.

684
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:10,537
So close.

685
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:13,862
But it would appear
that my concerns

686
00:57:13,886 --> 00:57:15,617
about secrecy had merit.

687
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,894
Someone on this crew
discovered my plans...

688
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:25,432
and tore from this log
the very page

689
00:57:25,433 --> 00:57:29,570
necessary to discover
that prize.

690
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,007
Stole it for their own gain.

691
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:35,463
Stole it from us.

692
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:40,576
And then

693
00:57:41,613 --> 00:57:44,562
stoked your resentment
to cover his crime...

694
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:48,651
and make himself your captain.

695
00:57:50,757 --> 00:57:51,757
What?

696
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:56,026
I don't know what
he's talking about.

697
00:57:56,713 --> 00:57:59,488
That's a very serious
accusation, Captain.

698
00:58:00,038 --> 00:58:02,688
Thievery is punishable
by death.

699
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:04,944
As is a false accusal
of the same.

700
00:58:10,638 --> 00:58:13,300
Then, as per the articles,

701
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:15,975
the accused has a choice.

702
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:18,419
He can submit to a trial.

703
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:21,017
With who as judge? You?

704
00:58:21,726 --> 00:58:22,682
No.

705
00:58:23,301 --> 00:58:24,719
No fucking way.

706
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:31,576
Then swords.

707
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:36,463
Perhaps it's better this way.

708
00:58:38,488 --> 00:58:40,713
Be rid of you once and for all.

709
00:59:18,943 --> 00:59:20,311
Come on!

710
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:24,301
Come on, Singleton!

711
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:46,301
Get up!

712
00:59:49,832 --> 00:59:50,832
Come on!

713
01:01:36,664 --> 01:01:38,413
It's the stolen page.

714
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:49,288
Friends,

715
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,301
brothers...

716
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,681
the prize that you and I
have been pursuing...

717
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:01,301
is L'Urca de Lima.

718
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:03,987
The Hulk.

719
01:02:05,113 --> 01:02:07,906
A prize of almost
unimaginable value.

720
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:12,044
Now with this page securely
in our possession,

721
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,538
we can begin our hunt.

722
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:18,194
And we will succeed

723
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,169
no matter the cost.

724
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,113
No matter the struggle.

725
01:02:22,581 --> 01:02:25,087
I will see that prize is yours.

726
01:02:26,894 --> 01:02:29,050
I'm not just gonna
make you rich.

727
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:32,169
I'm not just gonna
make you strong.

728
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:36,476
I'm gonna make you
the princes of the New World.

729
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:44,213
Flint! Flint! Flint! Flint!

730
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:47,301
Flint! Flint! Flint!

731
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,863
He's downstairs.

732
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:31,869
Can I help you?

733
01:03:33,794 --> 01:03:35,794
Perhaps we can help each other.

734
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:41,301
I think I have something
you might want to buy.
