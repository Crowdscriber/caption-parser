1
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:05,454
Yes, I promise I'll call you
as soon as I get the results.

2
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:09,271
Yes, I am aware that hospitals
are a hotbed of infection.

3
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,625
Thank you, Manny.

4
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:12,777
A couple of weeks ago, 
I had a minor heart incident.

5
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:14,017
I am fine.

6
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:16,059
But just to be safe, 
I'm having an angiogram,

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,749
which is when they inject a dye

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,352
to make sure there's no blockage.

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,715
It's--it's no big deal.

10
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,193
- We're not worried.
- No.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,260
If something were to happen,
which it's not...

12
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,253
Not gonna.

13
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,556
I would turn our bedroom
into a shrine to Claire.

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,705
Wow.

15
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,650
And this room into a hall of magic.

16
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:36,611
Luke, please stop
taking appliances apart.

17
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,711
- I'm making something.
- You're unmaking something.

18
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:40,975
- 'Cause I'm giving my notice today.
- Wait. What?

19
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:43,531
But wouldn't we rather have toast
that's already buttered?

20
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:45,844
I love that you're asking
these kind of questions.

21
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:48,129
If only the springs were stronger,

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,608
the toast would be catapulted
into the pool of butter.

23
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:51,766
Really strong springs,

24
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,584
like the ones in your mattress?

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,682
You're unbelievable.

26
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:57,330
What do you mean you're quitting?

27
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,662
Your manager
just started letting you

28
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:00,197
open and close the store.

29
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:01,310
It's boring.

30
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,707
And Jennifer said that I could
get a job at the jewelry store.

31
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,911
Honey, you need to learn
to stick with things.

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,024
You just got the big keys.

33
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:08,845
Where's the coffeepot?

34
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:10,602
Oh, you mean
the soon-to-be coffee bot?

35
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,500
- Luke!
- I need caffeine today.

36
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:13,550
You can have juice.

37
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,359
How late were you
at that party last night?

38
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,282
Oh, please.
She snuck in at 10:00

39
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:19,775
and spent all night reading
under the covers with a flashlight.

40
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:20,906
Alex, what have I told you

41
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:22,517
about staying out
past your curfew?

42
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:24,973
- I need to do it more often.
- Exactly.

43
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:27,174
You need to learn
to have some fun.

44
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:30,525
You are going on that
spring break trip with Nicole.

45
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:31,594
- No! No, I can't.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,347
I have to study for the P.S.A.T.s.

47
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,108
Luke! Phil, talk to your children.

48
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,525
All right. Everybody listen up.

49
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,916
Haley, you're not quitting.

50
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,594
You're resigning.
It sounds better.

51
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,129
- No. Unh-unh.
- Alex, you have all of spring break

52
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,077
to lock yourself
in your room and study.

53
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:45,733
No, no, no, no, no.

54
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,197
And, Luke, coffee bot
is a non-starter.

55
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:49,395
But I do like the idea

56
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,351
of popcorn kernels
in the pancake batter...

57
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,422
so they self-flip.

58
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,578
Stop talking!

59
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,203
Step away from the children.

62
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,491
¿Quién es el hombre
más hermoso de esta casa?

63
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:17,914
Ay, perdón, ¿quién es el otro
hombre más hermoso de esta casa?

64
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:18,891
Manny?

65
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:21,245
Huh? I am telling you
how handsome you are.

66
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:22,677
Oh. Well, next time,
tell me in English

67
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:23,615
so I don't miss it.

68
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,474
You're forgetting all your Spanish.
You never practice.

69
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:28,758
Perdóname, mami,
soy embarazada.

70
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:31,339
You just told me
that you're pregnant.

71
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,600
Congratulations.
You're glowing.

72
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,194
Really? That's what you're wearing?

73
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,221
Really? That's how you talk
to your meal ticket?

74
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,233
Besides, those snobs
don't care what I wear,

75
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:41,330
as long as I bring my checkbook.

76
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:43,881
Today I have an interview
with the Dryden Academy.

77
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:46,311
It's only the most prestigious
prep school around.

78
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:48,360
Their school song has 36 verses,

79
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,661
and I know all of 'em.

80
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:50,734
Settle in.

81
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,896
And the reason
you're not bringing him?

82
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,795
He says that I make him nervous,

83
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:57,979
that I care too much.

84
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,205
That's why I'm not even allowed

85
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,373
to bring him
to his haircuts anymore.

86
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:04,199
I never went to private school.

87
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,189
Hell, I never even finished college,

88
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,409
and look at me.
That Danish I just ate cost 6 bucks.

89
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,532
I didn't even blink.

90
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,765
I've always felt out
of place in public school,

91
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:15,551
like a lone petunia
in an onion patch.

92
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,017
You felt out of place?

93
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,883
Let me tell you something
about your prep school buddies.

94
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:22,373
When I was younger, I had a job

95
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,641
checking coats at a country club.

96
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:26,718
These smug rich kids
used to waltz in there

97
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,168
and throw their coats
at me like I was nothing.

98
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,801
That was before
your high-tech fabrics.

99
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,058
They weighed a ton.

100
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,493
You see that scar?

101
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:34,423
The one you got in the war?

102
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:35,873
That's what I tell people.

103
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,218
I caught the scalloped edge

104
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,835
of a Burberry duffel coat toggle.

105
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,739
Still not sure there
isn't a piece in there.

106
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,529
Kids will always want to quit

107
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,362
when things get hard if you let 'em.

108
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:53,198
This is a girl who
was kicked out of college.

109
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,476
The least she can do
is stick it out at a little--

110
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,829
- Uh, Phil?
- Sorry.

111
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,871
Look, all we can do is give Haley
the time to find out who she is.

112
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,079
Or we could save that time,
and I could tell her who she is.

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,704
Let me know how that works out.

114
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,102
Excuse me?

115
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,383
Oh, sorry, but my TV doesn't work,

116
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,799
and you're all I've got.

117
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,363
- I'm Norman.
- Good to meet you, Norman.

118
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,390
What are you in for?

119
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:13,030
- Triple bypass.
- Awesome.

120
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:15,117
And it sounded like you were agreeing
with my parenting style,

121
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:16,909
so, please, continue.

122
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:18,675
Well, I've raised three kids,

123
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,279
and the main thing I learned is you
have to let them be who they are.

124
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,480
Thank you, Norman.

125
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,620
Just because he's behind a curtain
doesn't make him a wizard.

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,864
Dad, I made you this necklace.

127
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:29,835
It's good for healing.

128
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,956
There's no scientific evidence
to back that up, dad.

129
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:34,085
- I married a doctor.
- I have three degrees.

130
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,828
Girls, where's your little brother?

131
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:38,908
He didn't get his arm stuck
in a vending machine again, did he?

132
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:41,555
Are you getting this?

133
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:42,886
- Yes.
- They sound just like our kids,

134
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,009
- and they all got together
to visit their dad... - Mmm-hmm.

135
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,899
Who apparently did
a pretty good job raising them.

136
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,566
Please.
He sounds like an old hippie.

137
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,406
A wise, insightful, old hippie.

138
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:51,799
- Mm-hmm.
- A Jeff Bridges hippie.

139
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:53,608
- Hey, dad.
- There he is!

140
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,168
Look at that sharp suit.

141
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,377
Oh, my God, Luke gets huge.

142
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,240
You've seen this.

143
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,555
I wore it to Angela's wedding.

144
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:01,416
Oh, yeah.
It's just like the one I had made

145
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,089
for my little Jonathan.

146
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,450
Okay, Mrs. Dunphy.

147
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:06,217
- Time for your prep.
- Okay.

148
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,714
See what happens when
parents get out of the way?

149
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:11,868
Weddings, babies, sharp suits.

150
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,654
You might want to wheel her
by the burn unit.

151
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:15,103
She just got scorched.

152
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:18,472
Wait. You made a suit for Jonathan?

153
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,680
He's a cat.

154
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:22,749
He's a hairless stray.
He needs the suit for warmth.

155
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,371
You know, that thing

156
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:25,695
all of your husbands eventually
stop feeling for you.

157
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,484
I did not come here to be insulted.

158
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,879
I came here for dad.

159
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,358
Dad, I need $500.

160
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:34,311
How can you need money?
You have four divorce settlements.

161
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:37,155
Yeah, sorry I'm not
some sad, lonely exorcist.

162
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:39,403
Archivist. I'm an archivist.

163
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,281
Ugh. This arguing.

164
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:42,882
I might as well have
just stayed in court.

165
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,558
Please be a lawyer.
Please be a lawyer.

166
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,213
How'd it go?

167
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:48,229
I got probation plus
time served. Suck it!

168
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:49,627
Well, maybe now you'll stop

169
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:52,167
siphoning electricity off the grid
with a meat hook.

170
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:53,624
Hey, look at me for a second.

171
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:57,252
When you die alone in your bed,
Jonathan's going to eat you.

172
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,011
Yep.

173
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:05,088
Lily! Time for girls' day!

174
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,620
We've always tried
to make sure that

175
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,857
Lily has a feminine
influence in her life.

176
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,410
Because I'm sure
it is so difficult for her

177
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:14,627
to be around so much
masculine energy all the time.

178
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:15,996
Yeah, and recently, uh,

179
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:19,261
she's been asking a lot of questions
about the female body.

180
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:20,534
And...

181
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,270
Uh, we are not exactly experts,

182
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,159
so we d--just sit on 'em.

183
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,464
We decided to call in the big guns.

184
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:27,692
Hola.

185
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:29,220
Hi, Gloria!

186
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,267
Lily is so excited for girls' day.

187
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:32,479
Yeah, but don't keep
her all afternoon.

188
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,660
- You know how we miss her.
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:34,213
Okay.

190
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:37,076
When am I going
to get real boobs?

191
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:38,822
Okay, so we'll see you whenever.

192
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,927
Um, uh, absolutely.
You know, just have a really great time.

193
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,355
Vamos, mami, vamos.

194
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:45,113
So we'll do a little shopping,

195
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,282
we can have our pretty nails done...

196
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,029
And our pretty hair.

197
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,406
- Do you think that's fun?
- Yeah!

198
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:55,437
And you know what the best part
of having a girls' day is?

199
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,458
That you can ask me
anything you want.

200
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,067
Did you know I'm gay?

201
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,292
This is lucky.

202
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,606
At 2:00, the school's
award-winning bell players

203
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:16,715
will be performing a medley
of civil war drinking songs.

204
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,715
What do they call that?
Unhappy hour?

205
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,059
Hmm. Interesting.

206
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:23,700
This was an all-boys academy
when it was established in 1901.

207
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,393
Thank God they went away
from that tradition, huh?

208
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:27,750
Yeah. I bet the place
is one giant orgy now.

209
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:28,587
Jay, please.

210
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,608
Hey, do you want to grab a coat?

211
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,489
Grab your own coat, college boy.

212
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,630
Uh, I meant for you.

213
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,927
They want us all to wear
a school blazer for the tour,

214
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,294
get the whole Dryden experience.

215
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,087
Right. I-I'm sorry, buddy.

216
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,718
Hello, parents, perspective norsemen.
Welcome.

217
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,797
Our tour will begin this direction

218
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,661
with a view of our renowned
equestrian center.

219
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,732
It took me right back
to 40 years ago--

220
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,516
candy-ass preppies
with too many privileges.

221
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,565
You know what I hated
most about those guys?

222
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,041
They all had these little noses.

223
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,796
What is that?

224
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:03,236
To your left, the world-class
Campbell observatory.

225
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:06,309
Now, of course, if it's stars of
the Hollywood kind that you like,

226
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,200
our award-winning
theater is just here,

227
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:08,905
where this June

228
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,929
Ms. Nicole Kidman
will be appearing in "Picnic."

229
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,124
Okay, gun to my head,

230
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:19,404
maybe I was a tiny bit jealous
of those guys back then,

231
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:22,146
with their cars and
their fancy hair products--

232
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:25,259
your brylcreems and your VO5s.

233
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,264
We'll now take a short break,
where you're free to explore

234
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,073
the treasures of
our rare book library.

235
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,942
You know what was
a rare book in my school library?

236
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:36,303
One that didn't have
genitals drawn all over it.

237
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,083
Who am I kidding?

238
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,382
I wanted what those kids had then,

239
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:43,215
and 40 years later,
I still wanted it.

240
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,624
Manny, write down what
they said about the library.

241
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,070
They're liable to ask you
about that in the interview.

242
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,305
And get the lead out.
We don't want to miss the bell players.

243
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,073
Excuse me!

244
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,314
But she's so young.

245
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,954
Do you really think
that she already--

246
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:56,229
I knew when I was 5.

247
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,008
- Everybody knew when you were 5.
- Not true.

248
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:00,913
Not everyone knew until I threw myself
my second 5th birthday party.

249
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:04,155
Come on, Lily is not gay.
It's probably just a phase.

250
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,089
Oh, my God. Did I just say that?

251
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,899
Do not tell anyone I just said that.

252
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,265
I got my sweater. Can I go now?

253
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,090
Here. Yeah, sweetie.
Have a seat.

254
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:13,842
Oh. Imagine if this was a hay bale,

255
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:14,897
and she was wearing
a prairie skirt.

256
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:15,938
It would be a total flashback.

257
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:16,994
Stay with us.

258
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:19,931
Um, so Gloria was telling us
about something that you said.

259
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,621
- Mm-hmm.
- Something about you being gay?

260
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:22,618
What about it?

261
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,246
Okay, very aggressive.
Just saying.

262
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,122
Um, w-we're--we're just
wondering, you know,

263
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,322
why did you say that?

264
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:28,682
Because I'm gay.

265
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,722
But why do you think
you're gay, sweetie?

266
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,823
We're learning about it in school.

267
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,737
Oh.

268
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,862
My friend Aldo's parents
are Italian, so he's Italian.

269
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:39,783
And you and daddy are gay,
so I'm gay.

270
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,972
First of all, adorable.

271
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:44,751
But that's not how it works.

272
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,779
When Aldo's talking about
him being Italian,

273
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,437
he's talking about his heritage.

274
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,293
Yeah, and that's a totally
different thing than being gay.

275
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,995
See, heritage is, uh...

276
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,407
Well, it's something
that you're born with,

277
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:56,839
and--oh, my God.
What's wrong with me?

278
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,190
And with respect to your heritage,
you're not gay.

279
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,761
You're Vietnamese.

280
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:03,099
What's that?

281
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:06,071
Well, Vietnam
is a beautiful country,

282
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,523
and it's near China.

283
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,902
Uh, it--it's known for, uh...

284
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,711
Its--its farms, with all of the, uh...

285
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,741
- Uh, water buffalos.
- Water buffalo.

286
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:19,512
And... bikes.
Lily, there are bikes everywhere.

287
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,487
- Oh! There are so many bikes.
- So many bikes.

288
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,258
- People are biking around.  And, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,724
And then--and they're wearing hats.

290
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,867
- Hats.
- They have these beautiful sun hats.

291
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,412
That swoop. Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:28,349
Can I go and play now?

293
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,623
- Please. Go. Yes.
- Yes, gosh. Would ya?

294
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,175
Love for you to.

295
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,544
Is that all you know
about her culture?

296
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:36,479
No. I mean, w-we're-- we're saving

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,642
some of the things until she
gets older to tell her about.

298
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:40,309
I-I wanna say the windmills
and the tulips?

299
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,853
Don't.

300
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:43,175
No wonder she has
so many questions.

301
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,680
She doesn't know who she is.

302
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:46,337
Well, I guess we
kind of dropped the ball.

303
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,300
Yeah. You know what?
Forget the pretty nails.

304
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,410
We are all going
to a Vietnamese restaurant,

305
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:53,562
and we are gonna give her
a taste of her culture.

306
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,911
Which one is the best
restaurant around here?

307
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,536
- I wanna say Saigon.
- There's little, um...

308
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,120
You know nothing.

309
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,668
I'll look in the Jelp.

310
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,381
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

311
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,232
Hey, we should go.
Mom's gonna be here soon.

312
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,802
Why don't you stay and say hello?

313
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,109
She'd love to see you.

314
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,951
Why? So she can tell me
how to live my life?

315
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,030
Yeah, I've got my
probation officer for that.

316
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,804
We'll see her on her birthday.
When's the next important one?

317
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,067
I know it's none
of my business, but...

318
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,972
is it possible that your mom
doesn't want you

319
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:26,147
to make certain mistakes
'cause she cares?

320
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:28,019
Oh, my God.
You sound just like her.

321
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,917
Let's roll.

322
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,482
Haley, you are not
quitting your job.

323
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,254
Where is this coming from?

324
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:37,967
It's coming from the future--
your future--

325
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:38,848
and it ain't pretty.

326
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,376
I don't understand.
In the future, I'm not pretty?

327
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:43,272
No, you'll hold up okay.
But this path you're on,

328
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,394
flitting from one thing
to the next,

329
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:47,055
it ends in a pile of ex-husbands
and nicotine fingers.

330
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,565
- Can I talk now, dad?
- No!

331
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:50,417
Hello?

332
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,298
Alex? You don't have to go
on that trip with Nicole.

333
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,321
You can study
as much as you want.

334
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:56,833
Just know that I love you.

335
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:57,907
Okay.

336
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,892
Listen to me, Haley.
You are dangerously close

337
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,471
to getting on a path
you can't get off of.

338
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:02,739
Dad, stop yelling.

339
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,267
Mom, stop crying.
I know I'm not a big nerd.

340
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,334
Here, mom wants to talk to you.

341
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,674
Dad wants to talk to you.

342
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,822
- Hello?
- Hello?

343
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:11,405
Alex, book down,

344
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:12,913
run a brush through your hair.

345
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,413
You're going on that trip
with your friend.

346
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,132
What?

347
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,949
Haley, I love you.

348
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,259
If you don't want
to work in that store,

349
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,925
I'll help you find something
you like better.

350
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,726
Is this reverse psychiatry?

351
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,263
No, honey.
Actually, nothing is.

352
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:26,256
I just want you to be happy.

353
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,076
Mom, you're freaking me out.

354
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,664
Why is everyone screaming?

355
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,801
- Here!
- Here!

356
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,728
This is Luke.

357
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,587
Why are mom and dad
acting so crazy?

358
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,028
I don't know, but it's creepy.

359
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,174
Something's going on.

360
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,020
Do you think it has to do
with mom's heart thing?

361
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:40,626
Like it's more serious
than they're saying?

362
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,205
- We have to go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

363
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:45,064
Okay, everybody, calm down.

364
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,040
Here's what we know.

365
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,340
Mom had to go to the hospital
for a simple procedure.

366
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:53,229
Then mom and dad
start calling us, acting weird.

367
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,918
Open your eyes, people.

368
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:56,620
They've been kidnapped.

369
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:03,308
Well, now that the tour's over,
we can probably take these off.

370
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,004
I don't see the rush.

371
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,715
And you gotta be mentally
sharp for your interview.

372
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:08,681
How you feeling?

373
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:09,651
Pretty good.

374
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,337
You know, parents
are allowed to sit in,

375
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,409
but if you don't feel like it...

376
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,242
Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't miss it.

377
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,037
This is where it all starts.

378
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,293
Sure seems like you've
come around on this place, Jay.

379
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:20,799
How could I not?
This place is unbelievable.

380
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,013
I'm already picturing
those jerks at the club

381
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,558
seeing my son walk in
wearing a Dryden jacket.

382
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,407
Manny Delgado?

383
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,223
I-I guess what I'm trying to say is,

384
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,123
I like books for reading them.

385
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,392
You care to elaborate?

386
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,417
Indeed.

387
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,324
Did you ever see one
of those slow-motion movies

388
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,502
where they destroy an old casino,

389
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,334
and it just implodes?

390
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:49,957
That.

391
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,918
So who are your favorite authors?

392
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,252
That's a long list.

393
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:55,109
I'd probably have to start with...

394
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:58,642
Go ahead. Hard as you can.

395
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:13,061
- Mmm! So good.
- Mmm! Mmm!

396
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:16,379
- I want a cheeseburger.
- But this is a special soup called pho.

397
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,916
You told me not to say that word.

398
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:22,822
It is delicious.
This is the food of your people.

399
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:23,946
Can I get you anything else?

400
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,719
Actually, um, we're just trying
to teach our daughter

401
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,279
about your country.

402
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:29,563
And as I'm saying that,
I'm hoping you're from Vietnam.

403
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:30,837
I was born there.

404
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,100
Uh, so was Lily.

405
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:33,790
Oh. It's a beautiful country.

406
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,961
Um, my family still lives there.

407
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:36,476
I hate Vietnam!

408
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,163
Lily, honey, we don't hate.

409
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,794
I hate Vietnam.

410
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:43,685
Okay, um, we need just a second.

411
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,296
Lily, that was rude.

412
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:46,571
I wanna go home.

413
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:49,238
No. It's important
that you celebrate

414
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,095
the culture of your ancestors.

415
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,927
You are Vietnamese.

416
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,434
No, I'm not.
I'm gay! I'm gay!

417
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,671
Honey, no, you're not gay.
You are just confused.

418
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,961
Oh, my God. What is wrong
with me? It's like I...

419
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,206
Oh, please. We have
tons of lesbian friends.

420
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:05,226
Odd that you would reference
our friends and not us.

421
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:05,904
- I know. I know.
- Also gay.

422
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,612
- We should just go.
- No, nobody's going anywhere

423
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,186
until she finishes the whole soup!

424
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,262
No, Gloria, it's fine.

425
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,459
- We don't wanna push her.
- No, no, no, it's not fine.

426
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,262
That's the problem
with this country.

427
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,935
Nobody cares where
they come from.

428
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,644
They just want cheeseburgers
and prep school,

429
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:20,245
and they have forgotten
about Colombia!

430
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,653
Okay, I can't help but feel

431
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,369
that maybe you're bringing something to the table

432
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,378
that's possibly,
uh, not at all about Lily.

433
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:29,075
I think you're right.

434
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:33,776
It's just that I feel like
I'm losing my children to America.

435
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,588
They're just going to grow up

436
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,991
and become boring
old white people.

437
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:41,197
Uh, most of our friends
are white, actually.

438
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,405
Uh... okay, can everybody
just calm down

439
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:45,052
and go back to
their own conversations?

440
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,244
Just... thank you.

441
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:49,071
Hey. Hey, what's going on with you?

442
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,524
Manny has forgotten
most of his Spanish,

443
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:55,061
and Joe--I'm sure he's not
even going to learn it.

444
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,786
I know this is silly,
but I just don't like

445
00:15:57,787 --> 00:16:01,092
feeling like I'm so different
from the rest of my family.

446
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:02,262
Oh, honey.

447
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:04,289
- It feels so lonely, yes.
- Oh, wait just a second.

448
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,294
Lily, is that why
you want to be gay,

449
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:07,839
to be more like your daddies?

450
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,647
Oh, honey.
No, the three of us are a family

451
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,174
even though we come
from different places.

452
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:14,198
You know,
you were born in Vietnam,

453
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,537
and I grew up in a city,

454
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:16,762
and even though
he never talks about it,

455
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:18,164
your daddy grew up on a farm.

456
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:18,953
Yeah.

457
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,994
The point is, is that we're a family
because we love each other.

458
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:24,468
- Okay.
- And you know what?

459
00:16:24,469 --> 00:16:26,367
You just caused
a scene in a restaurant...

460
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,128
And you can't get any more
like your daddies than that.

461
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:33,071
Maybe I'll just take Manny and Joe
to Colombia this summer.

462
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,525
I think that's a great idea.

463
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,883
I really think that keeping
in touch with your heritage

464
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,635
only enriches our culture.

465
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:41,482
Absolutely. I think
we would all be better off

466
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,099
if people would go back
to where they came from.

467
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,278
I...

468
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:49,972
- I'll pull the car around.
- Yes.

469
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,307
All I can think about are
the good times I had with mom.

470
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,869
Who's gonna walk me
down the aisle?

471
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,647
Stop spinning out.

472
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:01,000
There's no point in imagining
some horrible future.

473
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,338
Hey.

474
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:14,588
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

475
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,686
- You made it.
- Mm-hmm.

476
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,140
You're in heaven.

477
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,661
- That's not funny.
- Okay.

478
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,458
Knock, knock.

479
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,291
Don't bother.
She's not in the mood for jokes.

480
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,468
Your results are great.

481
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,422
Minimal plaque.
Your heart is strong.

482
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,585
Oh. Thank you.
That's such good news.

483
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,202
Well, keep taking your medication,

484
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:29,925
- you'll outlive all of us.
- Thanks.

485
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:31,448
Honey, you nailed it.

486
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,823
You weren't worried, were you?

487
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,196
No.

488
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,466
Mm. Me, neither.

489
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:38,517
I wasn't done with that.

490
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:39,638
Me, neither.

491
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,715
God, do you soak
your hair in cigarettes?

492
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,277
Do you wash your clothes in tears?

493
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:49,680
I have to get home.
My roommate needs these shoes.

494
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:51,688
Weirdos.

495
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:54,220
Luke, don't be so mean.
I can't take it today.

496
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:55,567
I may be your sort of mom now...

497
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,292
And I'm practically
a child myself.

498
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,176
Okay, let's calm down.

499
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:00,609
Mom could be fine.

500
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,712
Oh, come on. They wouldn't be
freaking out if they were fine.

501
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,802
Right, 'cause mom and dad
never freak out over nothing.

502
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:07,177
They don't. They're perfect.

503
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,783
Remember the time
when dad was switching jobs,

504
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,168
and mom threw away
all of our junk food?

505
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,280
That was completely different.

506
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,633
No, no, actually, it's not.

507
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,968
They don't know
how to deal with their stuff,

508
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,481
so they obsess over us.

509
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,552
Maybe that's all this is, right?

510
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,512
I can't believe how relieved I am.

511
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:23,749
Me, too.
I'm just texting the kids.

512
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,699
It's like at a certain age,
"it's probably nothing"

513
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,543
becomes "it's probably nothing."

514
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,995
Like they add italics at 40.

515
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,662
- Well, the good news is...
- Mmm.

516
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:36,722
These situations just bring us
closer and closer together.

517
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,584
By the way, you did a great job
of keeping your cool.

518
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,575
Well, I didn't want
to scare the kids.

519
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,358
You did a pretty good job yourself.

520
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,335
Thanks.

521
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,765
I have a secret.

522
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:47,833
What's that?

523
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,785
We're pretty good
at this parenting thing.

524
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:51,569
I think we are.

525
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:52,689
Kiss me.

526
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:54,657
I'm gonna try.

527
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,442
"Mom OK"?!

528
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:59,276
You guys are the worst parents ever.

529
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:00,852
It's the same every time!

530
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,474
One of you guys goes
through something stressful,

531
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,442
and instead of dealing with it,
you freak out on us.

532
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,344
"Quit your job,"
"don't quit your job"?

533
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,942
"Read more,"
"read less"?

534
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:09,247
Be better at being adults!

535
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,778
Come on, Luke. Let's go!

536
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,283
You're not my mom
anymore, but okay!

537
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:18,355
Save the judgey looks
for another 15 years.

538
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:24,936
What the hell happened in there?

539
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:27,465
I don't know.
I've never choked like that before.

540
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:28,975
You think it's a definite no?

541
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,474
Well, you pointed
to a picture of the dean's son

542
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:31,940
and asked when she's due.

543
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:32,846
Right.

544
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,626
Sorry I let you down, Jay.

545
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:35,539
Me?

546
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,473
I saw how much it meant to you.

547
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,078
It's like I was
on the football field.

548
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,357
You were up in the stands,
all proud of me, rooting me on.

549
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:45,272
I'm not used to that.
I just whiffed.

550
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,408
That's not even the right sport.

551
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:48,682
Why am I trying to blame you?

552
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:50,691
Probably 'cause you should be.
Sit down.

553
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,406
I think I put some
stuff on you that...

554
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:58,075
Is about some guys 40 years ago

555
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,897
with tiny noses and perfect hair.

556
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:02,501
You're losing me.

557
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,703
There's only thing
I want you to understand.

558
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:08,675
If today was the first time

559
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:10,328
you've felt that
I was proud of you,

560
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:12,217
then I should be apologizing,

561
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:14,209
'cause I'm proud
of you every day.

562
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,096
Thanks, Jay.

563
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:18,983
Let's go.

564
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:20,592
Did I really bet him

565
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:21,943
I could fit his whole
cell phone in my mouth?

566
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:24,015
Forget about that guy.
You're never gonna see him again.

567
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,527
I'm not sure about that.

568
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:27,944
Wait here.

569
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,855
- Kernels in?
- Check.

570
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,431
- On the right side only?
- Check.

571
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,835
You know this is the last
of our batter, right?

572
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:42,331
Our backs are against the wall.

573
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,008
Last chance at mastering
the self-flipping pancake.

574
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:46,509
You mean "popcake."

575
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,636
I was thinking "flipjack."

576
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:48,622
Oh, of course!

577
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,640
It's okay.

578
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:51,229
Okay.

579
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,760
This is the one. I feel it.

580
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,108
If this works,
centuries from now,

581
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:56,533
someone's gonna dig
one of these things up

582
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:58,174
and wonder what the heck it is.

583
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:01,882
5... 4...

584
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,940
3... 2...

585
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,095
Flip!

586
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:07,582
Flip, damn you!

587
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,716
- It's over.
- No, it's not!
- It's over!

588
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,115
It's all right.

589
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,219
We left it all out there
on the griddle.

590
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,608
We live to fight another day.

591
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,426
Yeah. I guess.

592
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,777
I can't believe
we wasted all that batter.

593
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,139
Ah, I guess you can't make an omelet

594
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,004
without breaking a few eggs.
Am I right?

595
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,566
Or can we?

596
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:29,103
To the grocery store!

597
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:42,003
