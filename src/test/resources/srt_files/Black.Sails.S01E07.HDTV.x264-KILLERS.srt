we agreed upon an agenda,

62
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:36,262

of mutual cooperation over tea.

63
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,308
So it was bad?

64

00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:59,393
You orate and you dissemble,
and I look the other way,

309
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,247
convince myself
that supporting you

310
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,232
is in everybody's interests.

311
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:06,918
But not today.

312
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,586
Not after what
happened last night.

313
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,705
After what happened last night?

314
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,282
What happened to Billy, Captain?

315
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,578
He fell.

316
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,963
Why? What are you
saying happened?

317
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,101
He thought you saw us
all as expendable.

318
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:26,938
- Expendable?
- Pawns to be used for your own ends.

319
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:30,925
I have fought and bled
alongside my men.

320
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,146
I have sacrificed more than you could
possibly know for their futures.

321
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:39,617
I know what happened
on the Maria Aleyne.

322
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,119
You told me the man you killed

323
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,204
was reaching for a weapon.

324
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:45,206
You told me it was self-defense,

325
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:48,276
but there were no
weapons in that cabin.

326
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:51,279
I went and I looked.

327
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:55,616
And I still kept my mouth shut.

328
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,502
I don't know why,

329
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:01,789
but I know you used the crew
to assassinate those people.

330
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,058
Men died that day.

331
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,626
Our men.

332
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,562
And I suspect there's
been other times

333
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:09,630
when we've been
expendable to you.

334
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:12,901
And if yesterday was
one of those days,

335
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:15,436
then you and I have a problem,

336
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:21,133
because Billy wasn't
expendable to me.

337
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,138
He was a son to me.

338
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:29,617
Then perhaps you
should have acted

339
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:32,203
like a better
father towards him.

340
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:34,289
What the fuck did you just say?

341
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,674
You let his suspicions
run rampant.

342
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:40,295
You let his paranoia fester
to the point at which

343
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,348
when he should have been focused
on the Scarborough's guns,

344
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:47,602
he was focused on hurling
unfounded accusations at me.

345
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,670
So I'm to blame for
what happened to Billy?

346
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,172
Perhaps if you had intervened

347
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:53,341
when he first came to you
with these fantasies,

348
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,843
perhaps if you helped
him understand

349
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,069
the world in which he lived...

350
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,000
he'd still be here right now.

351
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:10,182
Where are you going?

352
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,019
I'm tired of this.

353
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:20,275
I'm tired of the energy
it takes to believe you.

354
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:24,363
To believe in you.

355
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,869
I'm taking this to the crew.
You're their problem now.

356
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,539
I'm taking it.

357
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:41,489
After the Urca has been secured

358
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:44,299
and the money warehoused
before distribution...

359
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:50,081
I intend to sequester
a portion of it.

360
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,224
- Sequester?
- A portion of it.

361
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:57,338
Every man on that crew
will still be richer

362
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:59,707
than their wildest dreams.

363
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:01,575
But you know as well as I do

364
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,577
that no matter how much
money they're given,

365
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:06,180
they will drink, whore
and piss it away.

366
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:08,749
Now, they have a chance at
something better than that,

367
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:11,853
but it isn't gonna happen unless
somebody makes it happen.

368
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:12,970
You're lying to them.

369
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:15,223
And if I don't, who will?

370
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:19,027
Everyone's lied to for
their own good...

371
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:21,279
every mother who
tells their child

372
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:23,614
that everything will be alright,

373
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:25,700
every soldier who's
told by his commander

374
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,268
that courage will
see them through,

375
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:30,395
every subject who's told by...
His King?

376
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:36,110
Is that what you are to us now?

377
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:40,072
A sovereign levying a tax?

378
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:46,003
If no one knows, everyone wins.

379
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:48,622
- <i>Don't play games with me.
- I'm quite serious.</i>

380
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,925
Who loses?

381
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,477
Absent their worst instincts,

382
00:23:52,502 --> 00:23:54,762
their pride, their
greed, their suspicion,

383
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:57,982
in the light of pure reason,

384
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:01,135
who says no to this?

385
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,021
They'll be rich men
in a safe place

386
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:07,549
rather than dead thieves
on a long rope.

387
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:13,647
I'm gonna deliver them, Hal.

388
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:16,308
I'm gonna deliver them
into something better.

389
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:25,760
<i>I will sail with you
tomorrow to take this prize.</i>

390
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:28,930
I'll follow your lead in battle.

391
00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:32,183
And I'll take your
orders as consort.

392
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,302
But when it's done,

393
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:37,671
you and I will quietly
go our separate ways.

394
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:42,134
And I'll thank you
not to protest.

395
00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:58,993
No one else knows about this?

396
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:01,629
Look, as far as I can tell,
it's just the three of us.

397
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:03,697
<i>Then again, this is Randall
we're talking about.</i>

398
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:07,201
If he had told anyone
else, we'd have heard.

399
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:09,837
Does it make any sense to you?

400
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:12,590
Well, Flint finding
that page on Singleton

401
00:25:12,615 --> 00:25:15,367
does seem awfully
convenient in hindsight.

402
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:18,379
Jesus.

403
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:21,549
A fine mess here, Randall.

404
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:23,334
<i><font color="#804040">RANDALL</font>: You're a thief.</i>

405
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:25,520
<font color="#808080">(SIGHS)</font> Quite sure you're wrong.

406
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:28,322
But the good news is it's not
too late to repair the damage.

407
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:30,691
I know what I heard.

408
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:32,243
Randall, you were doped.

409
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,052
<i>You have no idea
what you heard.</i>

410
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:42,286
Say you're successful in
convincing our friends out there

411
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:44,589
to believe your story.

412
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:48,459
I'm not sure you've given proper
consideration to what happens next.

413
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:51,128
Do you think they'd just haul
me up in front of the crew,

414
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:54,182
air your story, and
that's the end of it?

415
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:56,100
No, Randall.

416
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,420
I think you've forgotten
one very important detail.

417
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:01,189
The money.

418
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:03,774
That has to be
considered, does it not?

419
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,444
If we go tell the crew now,
there's a very good chance

420
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,780
they simply hang the cook
right along with the captain.

421
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:11,816
If Randall's right,

422
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,569
<i>that would be the end
of the Urca hunt.</i>

423
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:17,121
Are you suggesting
we keep this secret?

424
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:20,575
Lie to the crew? Right
along with Flint?

425
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,577
He's suggesting
that acting hastily

426
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:25,112
could come with a
very hefty price.

427
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:29,074
Even if I was convinced, there's
still Randall to contend with.

428
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:35,389
Are you suggesting there's some
way to guarantee his silence?

429
00:26:35,414 --> 00:26:37,782
I can think of one way.

430
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:41,729
- They wouldn't.
- Wouldn't they?

431
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:45,566
A one-legged halfwit versus
a chance at a fortune?

432
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:48,486
The odds are decidedly
not in your favor.

433
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:52,023
Well, you were
confused or delirious.

434
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:55,026
Take your pick, but
tell them now.

435
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,144
Then even if they wanted
to go to the crew,

436
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:59,280
they'd have lost
their Chief witness.

437
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:01,389
And no one has to die.

438
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:09,874
- You're a thief.
- I'm a thief. Right.

439
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:12,843
Well, good luck, Randall.

440
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,846
<i>It was nice knowing you.</i>

441
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:19,767
<i><font color="#804040">ALBINUS</font>: For as long
as you sail with him,</i>

442
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,637
<i>his orders are my orders.</i>

443
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,797
And when your work is done,
this place will have you back.

444
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,301
They'll serve you well.

445
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,348
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

446
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:01,416
You were one of ours.

447
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,920
You were just a boy yourself.

448
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:15,013
Could not have been
easy coming back here.

449
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:18,216
Must have taken great strength.

450
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:22,062
<i>Go on.</i>

451
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:23,855
Take these men.

452
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:27,525
Make me rich.

453
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:50,548
You don't know me,
but you once did...

454
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,169
when I was the lowest among you.

455
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:59,734
Now I've returned.

456
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,344
And I offer you a chance
to be free of this place.

457
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:07,148
I'm Charles Vane.

458
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:12,880
And you were a strong crew once,

459
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:14,749
<i>proper pirates.</i>

460
00:29:14,774 --> 00:29:17,001
Feared, as you should have been,

461
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,754
before he dragged you
away from the sea,

462
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:23,891
<i>before he convinced you to
live here like animals.</i>

463
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,644
Because it suits his weaknesses.

464
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,295
<i>There is a place

Randall.

476
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:21,032
I need a word with
Mr. Silver alone.

477

- <font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>
- What's so funny?

478
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:31,602
Just that I warned Randall
something like this was coming.

479
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:33,354
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

480
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:37,441
Mr. De Groot's inclined to
hand you over to the crew.

481
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:39,527
He's given me exactly
five minutes,

482
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:43,096
at which point he intends to call
council so Randall can share his story,

483
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:45,533
after which our hands are clean

484
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:50,011
and you are most
likely, well, dead.

485
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:54,959
What's that?

486
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:56,911
A page from one of
Dr. Howell's manuals

487
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:59,571
and your last chance at living
to see the sun rise again.

488
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:04,218
You have exactly five minutes
to commit it to memory,

489
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:07,421
after which you will reproduce this
page to the best of your ability.

490
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:09,723
If you can do so to Mr. De
Groot's satisfaction,

491
00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:13,510
then maybe... just maybe
he can be convinced

492
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:16,480
to keep your secret for the
sake of the Urca haul.

493
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:18,482
- It's a test?
- Exactly.

494
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:20,959
- It's a terrible test.
- Believe me, I'm aware.

495
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:25,138
If I was the thief, which I
am by no means admitting,

496
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:27,241
I could have read that
schedule a hundred times over

497
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,976
before I was forced
to destroy it.

498
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,978
Whether or not I can
memorize this page

499
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:32,529
in five minutes proves nothing.

500
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:35,816
Mr. De Groot doesn't
believe that he can trust

501
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,701
the information
inside your head,

502
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:39,536
certainly not enough
to risk his own life,

503
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:43,674
not to mention committing poor
Randall to an early grave.

504
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:48,095
He says if he's to go down
that road, he needs certainty.

505
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,988
It's the best I could do.

506
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:52,957

I told her she would not have her guns

<font color="#808080">(SIGHS)</font>

To putting up with her.

522
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:05,405
My decision whether or not to
partake in this consortium

523
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,174
was predicated on her agreement

524
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:10,260
to lift the ban on
Charles Vane's crew.

525
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:13,130
I understand she did.

526
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,082
Begrudgingly.

527
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:19,303
And shortly after, all
eight disappeared.

528
00:34:19,328 --> 00:34:21,755
Left for Port Royal, I am told.

529
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,591
And you think Eleanor had
something to do with this?

530
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:26,093
It doesn't matter either way.

531
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,696
Short of my retrieving eight
corpses from her armoire,

532
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,597
nothing would dissuade
the other captains

533
00:34:30,622 --> 00:34:33,767
from the course
that she's set now.

534
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:37,104
Which I'd wager she
knew would be the case.

535
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,456
I'd wager you're right.

536
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:41,983
I asked you once to get
her under control.

537
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:46,904
The truth is there is no
controlling her, is there?

538
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:54,638
You forced her hand
in front of men

539
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:56,623
whose respect she demands

540
00:34:56,648 --> 00:35:00,144
in order to run this business.

541
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:02,429

what happened then

There is no Joy here.
There is no love here.

things possible here?

You don't get one without

No. You're wrong.

I've opened it for you.

And it requires no war and
no blood and no sacrifice.

581
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,618
It requires an
intolerable sacrifice.

582
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:23,453
To accept a pardon?

583

To apologize.

584
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:27,958
Apologize? Who will you
be apologizing to?

585
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:29,483
To England!

586
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:35,632
They took everything from us.

587
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:39,836
And then they called
me a monster.

588
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:41,821
The moment I sign that pardon,

589
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,508
the moment I ask for one,

590
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:47,627
I proclaim to the world
that they were right.

591
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:50,430

not the other way around.

00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,598
This path you're on...

595
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:04,302
it doesn't lead where
you think it does.

596
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:09,974

he'd agree with me.

Three days with the

three minutes with

599
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:30,520
I'll remind them.

600
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:33,523
Before you go,
just one question.

601
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,809
Harebrained as this test was,

602
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,311
you had to be quite certain

603
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,529
I was the thief to
even think of it.

604
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:42,149
And I don't believe you have
near that kind of faith

605
00:38:42,174 --> 00:38:44,534
in our friend Randall here.

606
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,537
Who told you about me?

607
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:49,263
Billy?

608
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,228
Randall, we need to talk.

609
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:00,367
- You're a thief.
- Randall, pay attention.

610
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:02,970
Right now at this moment,
it is just as likely

611
00:39:02,995 --> 00:39:05,806
you're the one
that dies as I am.

612
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,009
What if there was a way neither
of us had to die today?

613
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:13,347
I go to the crew and I offer
to be your caretaker.

614
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,182
I'll promise to look
after you day and night

615
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:17,550
and give my personal guarantee
should anything happen,

616
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:19,386
it comes out of my share.

617
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:22,155
I think I could persuade
the crew to accept that.

618
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,857
And then you're
back on the ship.

619
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:28,052
All you have to do is

I took the page and
I shouldn't have.

But what can I say, Randall?

628

I'm not a joiner. I
never have been.

629

647
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:05,592
The Walrus crew are unwilling to
manumit a hold full of slaves,

648
00:41:05,617 --> 00:41:08,617

to fill a recent
rash of desertions.

653
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:22,025
The consortium has
reached an agreement

654
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:23,560
with Mr. Dufresne of the Walrus

655
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:26,545
to trade future subsidies and
credits to cover the cost.

656
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:31,735
Six women remain thereafter,

657
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,453
for whom I was able
to scrounge together

658
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:36,323
<i>enough money to
cover their cost.</i>

659

But I hope the events

But there's no reason for
you to feel threatened

669
00:42:03,241 --> 00:42:05,152

Eleanor, Captain Hornigold

If you need me, I

It was Captain Hallindale I saw
leaving your room, was it not?

A man whose sole desire is
to be swaddled in canvas

And the price we have always
charged for mothering

is 20 pieces, not five.

Will your story hold when
I ask him to confirm it?

Or will you confess
your crime now

709
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:13,313

In my experience, if you

journey of their lives?

Probably not.

726

But then there was 36
hours before castoff,

727
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:08,118
so I thought why not
live dangerously?

728
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:12,465
36 hours is plenty of time

729

for them to find
reason to doubt you.

Perhaps a little doubt
in me is called for.

00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:37,396
I did nothing to
dispel that notion,

776
00:50:37,421 --> 00:50:39,699
though it may not take him
a long time to realize

777
00:50:39,724 --> 00:50:42,702
who it was that actually
brought me into this.

778
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:45,755
Well, we'll have to
deal with our situation

779
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,742
as it develops, won't we?

780
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:50,767
Aye.

781
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:57,300
There's something else.

782
00:50:57,325 --> 00:50:59,852
It's Messrs. Howell
and De Groot.

783
00:50:59,877 --> 00:51:01,521
Give them a couple of days.

784
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:04,787
Once we're at sea, the work will
take their focus off Randall.

785
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:10,947
Actually, it's not Randall
that's troubling them.

786
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:12,639
It's you.

787
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:16,152
Having had some time
to think about it,

788
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:19,763
they're not certain that you're
up to doing what's necessary.

789
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:24,827
<i>The lying we could forgive.</i>

790
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:26,379
<i>Singleton we could forgive.</i>

791
00:51:26,404 --> 00:51:28,855
We could forgive all of it.

792
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:32,409
But not Billy.

793
00:51:34,612 --> 00:51:37,164
<i>That requires an answer.</i>

794
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,094
<i>When the time comes,
we need to know</i>

795
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,420
<i>that you won't
stand in the way.</i>

796
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,967
<i>I understand he's your friend.</i>

797
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:52,596
But once we have the
money, Flint dies.

798
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:56,216
<i>No argument.</i>

799
00:52:00,772 --> 00:52:02,806
Not from me.
