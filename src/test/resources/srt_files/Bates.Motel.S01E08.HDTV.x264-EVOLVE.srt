Not well, but I knew him.

he's in the motel for this...

You know that I called
your office this morning.

198
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,495
You know,
I was coming in town anyway.

199
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:18,865
I thought, oh, I'll just pop in
and see him.

200

So anyway, um...

201
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,873
you know, I bought the motel
a few months ago,

202
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:29,475
and no one told me at the time

203
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,744
that the city's planning on
building a new bypass

204
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,914
that would basically
take my motel off the map.

205
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:36,916
Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:41,487
So I'm just trying
to figure out a way

207
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:45,091
that, um, I can fight this
from the inside.

208
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:51,464
Well, I, um, I see that
there's a seat open

209
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:53,566
on the city planning committee,

210
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,769
and I wanted you
to put me forward for it.

211
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,804
Maybe I can influence
their decision.

212
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,176
Why would I do that?

213
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:07,813
Be...cause
I thought you would.

Why?

215
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:12,718
Because...

because of what
we've been through.

about each other.

Don't assume differently

Trimmers are the guys who cut
and process the weed,

and they turn the raw plants
into final product.

He just wasn't feeling
that well.

when I saw him.

- He seemed upset.
- No, he wasn't upset.

279

Well, I tried to tell him
that he couldn't leave campus,

and he was practically shaking.

I took his arm
to lead him back in,

282
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,195
and he pulled it away
pretty violently.

283

Are you supposed to be putting
your hands on the students?

Um, I think we should stick
with the issue here.

285
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,038
Ms. Bates, what we've observed
and what we're concerned about

286
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,408
is your son's
emotional instability.

287
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,976
Instability?

288
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,647
He is emotionally unusual
for a boy his age.

289
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,922
He doesn't interact much
with others.

290
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,857
He keeps to himself a lot.

291
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,461
And based on the behavior
that I have seen,

292
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,630
Principal Hudgins and I

293
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:33,199
would like him to speak with
one of the school psychologists.

294
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:36,869
I don't know if I want him
to be doing that.

295
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,638
And why is that?

296
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:44,044
Because I would rather
that he...

297
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:48,881
you know, I think that he should
see a private psychologist.

298
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:51,217
You know, I would like
to choose the therapist.

299
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:54,020
Okay.

300
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,923
Well, I think that therapy would
be very beneficial for him.

301
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:59,892
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

302
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,494
Yeah, okay.

303
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:04,430
And, um, perhaps I could get
the name of that therapist

304
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:07,833
so that I could maybe explain
to him what I've seen in school?

305
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,019
Okay, of course, absolutely.

306
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:12,388
I will keep in touch.
Okay.

because now they want you
to go see a therapist.

I mean, this is all gonna
go on your record,

to be more careful.

um, sort of an unusual boy.

386

You know, he has a hard time
fitting in.

He's always very calm
when he's here working.

can be good that way.

I just don't want him getting
labeled as a freak or anything.

393
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:56,211
I don't think
that learning taxidermy

394
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,012
necessarily makes one a freak.

a lot of people do it.

right?

We should leave him behind.

all of them.

420

I think we should do that.
