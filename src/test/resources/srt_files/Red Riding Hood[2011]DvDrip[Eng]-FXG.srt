...for being the daughter of the wolf.

991
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:26,688
Peter.

992
01:32:29,903 --> 01:32:31,634
PETER: I have to leave.

993
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:33,799
You won't be safe with me...

994
01:32:33,973 --> 01:32:36,635
...until I learn how to protect you from....

995
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:22,911
I'll wait for you.

996
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:25,421
I thought you'd say that.

997
01:33:51,451 --> 01:33:54,818
VALERIE: It was the most brutal winter
I could remember.

998
01:33:56,790 --> 01:34:02,228
With time, my mother finally realized
that Father would never return.

999
01:34:05,965 --> 01:34:07,626
Henry found his courage.

1000
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:13,629
He chose a life of honor,
protecting us from darkness.

1001
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:20,135
Daggerhorn fell back
into its old rhythms.

1002
01:34:20,313 --> 01:34:22,213
The wolf didn't come back.

1003
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:24,549
But the village still lived in fear.

1004
01:34:25,919 --> 01:34:27,682
It was the only life they knew.

1005
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,526
I could no longer live there.

1006
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:40,666
I felt more freedom
in the shadows of the forest.

1007
01:34:42,035 --> 01:34:45,129
To live apart carries its own dangers.

1008
01:34:45,538 --> 01:34:47,233
But of those...

1009
01:34:47,674 --> 01:34:49,835
...I am less afraid.

1010
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:52,535
VOICE [WHISPERS]: Valerie.
