1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,175
WA YE news time, 8:05.

2
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,875
It's gonna be partly cloudy, breezy
and warm today with highs around 80.

3
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,076
Right now in Baltimore, sunny skies.

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,875
And here's one of my morning favorites.

5
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:35,475
Yo, Ott. Santo Rey's late?

6
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,376
Squall last night off of Hampton Roads.

7
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,471
76-72 KGA.

8
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,271
KGA, go ahead, 76-72.

9
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,670
Notify Homicide and the OCME.
We got a floater at Patapsco Terminal.

10
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,271
Copy that.

11
00:05:58,168 --> 00:05:59,969
Nothing at Vondopoulos's house?

12
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,769
He's not going back.

13
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:05,469
He's dumped his Benz and our GPS device
in the downtown garage.

14
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,269
He's off the cell phones.

15
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,468
And there's no text messaging
in Greek either.

16
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,468
The raids, the follow,
one or both sent him underground.

17
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:16,968
This guy, Stephen Rados? What's he?

18
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,767
He rented the hotel room
for the meet with Vondopoulos.

19
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,367
But checked out right after.

20
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,568
Fitzhugh's running him
through every database.

21
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,167
So far, nothing but a driver's license in D.C.

22
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,668
Lester. Homicide for you, line 2.

23
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:31,668
Maybe Sobotka knows him.

24
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:35,867
When Sobotka comes in today, maybe
he gives us a line on every last Greek.

25
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,367
Freamon here.

26
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,567
Thirteen or so coming across the fax
from VICAP.

27
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,967
All of them John Does.

28
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:49,166
And that's just headless and handless
in the mid-Atlantic region.

29
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,867
If you wanna go nationwide,
you'll be up over four dozen.

30
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,366
-Fuck me.
-What can I tell you, kiddo?

31
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:58,367
We are policing a culture in moral decline.
So, you want to come get these?

32
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,867
Or should I have a uniform
run them over to Southeast?

33
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,367
-Run them over to Southeast.
-Okay.

34
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,266
-Have a seat.
-I can't.

35
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,467
Gotta get back out there,
take care of business.

36
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,966
Just wanted to make sure
they were treating you right.

37
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,866
Making the most of it.
I'm catching up on my reading at least.

38
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:40,565
I just want to let you know
that we got your back.

39
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:44,165
You know, whoever did this, we'll find them.

40
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,266
We got you, you understand?

41
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,265
I appreciate the offer,
but that won't be necessary.

42
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,867
Inform Mr. Barksdale that any obligation...

43
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,566
he feels he might have
with regards to this incident...

44
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,866
it's absolved, along with our agreement.

45
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,966
All I'm saying is--

46
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,066
I understand perfectly well
what you're saying.

47
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:07,865
What I am saying to you is:
I will take care of them myself.

48
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:11,966
Them?

49
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:16,565
Who came at you?

50
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,765
Thank you for your concern.

51
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:40,564
Easy, Nick. Easy.

52
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:45,764
I'm gonna kill them.
Fucking Greek bastards.

53
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:47,965
Get out of my fucking way!

54
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,165
Get off of me! Fuck all of you!

55
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:53,764
He was there for all of you,
and now you're nowhere for him.

56
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:55,964
What the fuck you gonna do?

57
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:59,064
Get a gun? Go play gangster?

58
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,964
Like your fucking cousin?

59
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:31,564
Let's go.

60
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:05,863
What was she firing, yo?

61
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:08,762
Dirty Bomb, with a red-top chaser.

62
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:14,263
Damn, yo. The bomb is the bomb.

63
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,162
Opportunity knocking. Keep a lookout.

64
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,462
He just boosted the whole fucking truck.

65
00:10:57,462 --> 00:10:59,362
Good looking out, Johnny.

66
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,261
At least I remembered to call.

67
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,361
Stabbed repeatedly.

68
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:26,460
Torso, abdomen,
and they cut his throat to be sure.

69
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:30,361
Single-edge blade. He fought, too.

70
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,761
Defense wounds on both hands.

71
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,661
Ligature on both legs.

72
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,461
Weighed him down with something,
but it slipped off in the drink.

73
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,561
One, two, three.

74
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,060
Fuck it.
This Sobotka kid knows there's a warrant.

75
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,061
He either turns himself in or not.
Who gives a fuck?

76
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:10,060
Either we get to him now and roll him,
or he comes into the district with a lawyer.

77
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
He comes in with a lawyer, he's less likely
to go for something in the box.

78
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,960
You sound like McNulty now.

79
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,559
We stay with these guys on their cases,
we ain't never gonna get no respect.

80
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,159
You know this.

81
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,259
I figure when the detail's over,
I go back to straight narcotics.

82
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
Try to get over to Dawson's shift,
find a new rabbi.

83
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
What about you?

84
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,360
Don't know.

85
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,060
I mean, you gotta admit,
Daniels has been okay for us.

86
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,559
I mean, he's there for his troops.

87
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,259
-You gotta be shitting me.
-I just came from the crime scene.

88
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,858
He was coming in as a cooperator.

89
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:58,159
Offering up the drug-and-prostitution ring
he'd been smuggling for.

90
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,759
The guy lays down with gangsters,
gets up with his throat cut.

91
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,259
Almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch.

92
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,759
You were right about Sobotka.

93
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:13,158
Case had enough legs on it
that I've got Burrell committed...

94
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,459
to keeping my crew together
as a major case squad working out of CID.

95
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,758
If you are gonna charge him....

96
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,958
I'm gonna charge his narrow ass.

97
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,759
You're gonna do your son-in-law?

98
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:31,258
You don't think I didn't tell her
not to marry that brain-dead son of a bitch?

99
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,359
I'll tell you the truth, Major.
Everyone who saw the punch wrote on it.

100
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,158
And they've all got Prez
throwing the punch, no question.

101
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:45,558
But they've also got you addressing
a subordinate officer as a....

102
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,857
What was it? A shitbird?

103
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:50,957
Fuck you.

104
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:55,258
This is the Baltimore Police Department,
not the Roland Park Ladies' Tea.

105
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:56,458
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

106
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,058
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

107
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:02,858
the FBI agents,
they gotta write it the way it happened.

108
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,058
I mean, I could probably get my own people
to cheat it for you, but the FBl....

109
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,557
You know how tight-assed they are.

110
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:16,757
Roland Pryzbylewski rides
the Southeastern desk...

111
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,056
on midnight shift for two months.

112
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:23,158
During which time he writes
a personal letter of apology...

113
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,658
to everyone seen that punch throwed.

114
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:30,658
In which he makes it absolutely clear
that it was a penny-cheap sucker punch...

115
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,657
that would've got his ass kicked in
by a real police...

116
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:37,556
except for the fact that I have
my daughter's feelings to consider.

117
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,856
And then he can come up here
and say the same to my face...

118
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:44,956
and after that, if he wants
to piss his career away in your unit...

119
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:47,257
I could give a hairy-ass fuck.

120
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,257
Lieutenant.

121
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,656
Rod, that shit goes into a supplemental.

122
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:00,656
-You don't put witnesses on a face sheet.
-Officer.

123
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:05,357
You got something for Freamon?
Homicide sent it over.

124
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,956
Officer, my son wants
to turn himself in on a warrant.

125
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,955
Everybody talks, nobody listens.

126
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,656
Mike, that asshole calls back,
I'm in the shitter.

127
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:23,256
-Now what can I do for you, gents?
-You got a warrant on me for drugs.

128
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,656
-I'm turning myself in.
-A Southeastern warrant?

129
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:30,955
He's surrendering.
He's gonna cooperate in any way he can.

130
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:35,555
-What name am I looking for?
-Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.

131
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,455
Morphine? From a city ambo?

132
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:47,155
You should be ashamed
to be calling me on this one.

133
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:05,554
-The body came up.
-I saw, on the television.

134
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,855
We weighted him down
pretty goddamn good...

135
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,454
but the water just coughed him back up.

136
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,354
Bad luck, that's all.

137
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,655
Sergei would've done better, I admit.

138
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:19,755
Niko, the nephew. By now he knows.

139
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,355
Our people wait for him,
but so do the police.

140
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,554
I am thinking...

141
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:29,454
there's nothing to be done at this point.

142
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,954
What he says, he says.

143
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:36,254
He knows my name.
But my name is not my name.

144
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:38,454
And you?

145
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,655
To them, you're only "The Greek."

146
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:45,155
And, of course, I'm not even Greek.

147
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:52,354
So we go.

148
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:57,253
But there's a little business to do first.

149
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:01,054
There's a shipment on the docks this week.

150
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,854
-One hundred and fifty kilograms.
-And no one to pick it up.

151
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,754
Not just Sergei, I miss Frank, too.

152
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:13,954
We can't disappear the can.
But maybe we send someone.

153
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:16,554
Bring it off the docks, legitimate.

154
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:21,354
Everywhere we go these days,
we seem to be walking into police.

155
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,453
This is telling us something.

156
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:30,252
You're going to leave 15 million tholaria
to rot on the pier?

157
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,453
Lambs go to slaughter.
A man, he learns when to walk away.

158
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:38,853
No, we go.

159
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:42,653
Call the others in.

160
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:46,553
Let them know there is no longer any point.

161
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,752
We don't wait?

162
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:03,552
Our friends are still there, no?

163
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:05,753
-Still here.
-Then go.

164
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,452
Sobotka was a cooperator?

165
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,151
We had preliminary discussions
with him yesterday.

166
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:31,951
He agreed to post today
with a lawyer, but instead....

167
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,752
So what's left of the case?

168
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:37,552
We've pulled in everyone caught up
in the wiretaps, save for a couple bodies.

169
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:40,552
We left the man we think is the number two
for the operation...

170
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,852
on the street,
hoping he'd lead us to number one.

171
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:44,851
We have people on him?

172
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,451
He's out of pocket at the moment.

173
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:51,551
Last seen leaving a downtown hotel,
but we expect he'll resurface.

174
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:54,351
And the union people?

175
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:58,050
With Sobotka dead, the case right now
is limited to a subordinate or two.

176
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,752
But the important thing for us is the union.

177
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:03,051
Either they jettison
their current leadership...

178
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,551
or we have enough
to get that local decertified.

179
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:08,551
Leaving only me and my 14 bodies.

180
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:11,450
When do we get to that bit of business?

181
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,750
Lt. Daniels? Line 2. Det. Freamon
insisted I put him through.

182
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,550
In all likelihood, Frank Sobotka
was going to speak to that.

183
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,251
Now, we're a step back, sorry to say.

184
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,251
-Sobotka came in.
-The nephew?

185
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,951
Yeah, he flipped.

186
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:35,150
Come on, Bubs. You gotta do better
if you wanna walk on this.

187
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,251
-How about some murders?
-How about them?

188
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:40,050
They're not killing people
in West Baltimore these days?

189
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,250
Been quiet.

190
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,850
Except for that mess
with that young boy who got hit...

191
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,450
with the stray through the window,
ain't been nothing.

192
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,050
-How about that?
-I ain't got nothing on that one.

193
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,150
It's just two crews beefing over a corner.

194
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,850
You know what, Bubs? You going to jail.

195
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,250
How you gonna talk about going to jail?

196
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,850
You hearing this, Johnny?

197
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,350
Like we ain't got history in this room.
Like we ain't friends or nothing.

198
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,449
When you was up in that hospital,
all I did was worry.

199
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:07,550
"What about Kima? What's up with my girl?"

200
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,449
I'm just happy to see you're up in the mix...

201
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,050
and you talking about jail and shit.

202
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,249
That's too cold, girl, damn.

203
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:23,549
Remember that Eastsider
got shot in the high-rises, right?

204
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,050
You remember that shit, right?

205
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,650
I mean, you were right there, Bubbles.

206
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:30,850
That wasn't shit.
Boy got hit with a rat shot, that all.

207
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,349
-Who you talking about?
-Boy named Cheese.

208
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:36,749
Him and the other Eastsiders
moved into the Terrace...

209
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:39,548
took over a couple towers
from the Stringer Bell's boys.

210
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:43,549
Then some crazy-ass bow-tie nigger
came in and chased his ass home.

211
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,048
And what happened?

212
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,449
Mr. Bow Tie, he ran them off.

213
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:51,148
He told them Eastsider fools,
"Them towers belong to Avon."

214
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,849
But then he ain't come back no more.

215
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,649
Now them Eastsiders
are back up in there steady slinging.

216
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,748
I mean, it ain't like a war or nothing.

217
00:20:57,848 --> 00:21:00,849
It's like Stringer Bell and them are sharing.

218
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:02,648
Sharing?

219
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,149
You guys are on all of it?

220
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:14,347
You have a public defender
sitting next to you, Mr. Sobotka.

221
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,048
If there's anything about this deal
you don't understand--

222
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,948
They killed my uncle.

223
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:21,448
I don't need to talk to no one
but you people.

224
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,648
How do you know they did it?

225
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:31,748
I told....

226
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:45,447
Spiros calls me
after everybody's getting arrested, right?

227
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:50,448
Tells me he wants us
to keep our mouths shut...

228
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:53,748
but Uncle Frank, he says he ain't gonna.

229
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,647
Says he's gonna go talk to the police.

230
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,447
Spiros says that if we keep quiet...

231
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:03,547
they can help my cousin, Zig, you know?

232
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,247
And now Spiros is saying that...

233
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:10,347
I don't know, the kid,
the one that didn't die...

234
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:12,346
the one that got shot...

235
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:16,247
he's gonna say that the gun, it wasn't Zig's.

236
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:20,847
That Glekas pulled the gun,
and it wasn't really Zig's fault.

237
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:25,547
So your uncle went to meet them
and talk about that?

238
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,446
Under the Key Bridge.

239
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:33,046
I seen his car was still there this morning.

240
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:36,346
I seen that, I fucking knew.

241
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,946
If they killed your uncle to shut him up,
they probably--

242
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,746
Wanna kill me, too?

243
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,546
Shit!

244
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:49,946
I was gonna go down with him
to the bridge.

245
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,346
I was gonna go down there with him.

246
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:55,646
He wouldn't....

247
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:03,246
You were involved in the smuggling?

248
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,646
We didn't know about the girls.

249
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,745
Them girls that got found?

250
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:14,046
-We didn't know there were girls in there.
-You thought it was drugs?

251
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:16,546
Drugs, stolen shit, whatever.

252
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:21,045
We got paid by the can
to creep shit off the docks. That's all.

253
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:25,246
That and selling the drugs
that you got from The Greek, too, right?

254
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:29,945
That's your cousin's signed statement.

255
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:33,045
He put himself in,
talked about buying the gun.

256
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,744
The bill of sale
from the pawn shop is in there, too.

257
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:39,946
It wouldn't have mattered if the
second victim had backed up on his story.

258
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:42,045
Your cousin was locked in.

259
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:49,245
Your uncle was sitting yesterday
right where you're sitting now...

260
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:53,345
ready to give us everything, if we made
the drug charges go away for you.

261
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:57,344
And maybe got your cousin
to a better lock-up than Eager Street.

262
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:00,644
As you can see,
we're willing to honor that deal...

263
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:03,444
even if it didn't happen for your uncle.

264
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:13,045
Spiros was the main guy.

265
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,545
He told me and Frank
which cans to disappear...

266
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:20,644
and then when it came to me and the drugs,
he was the one that hooked that up, too.

267
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:24,744
The lsraeli, he was their drug guy.
I went through him for all my re-ups...

268
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:28,743
until they passed me off
to White Mike McArdle. You know Mike?

269
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:31,544
Guess you do.

270
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,543
Double G was in charge of stolen shit.

271
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:36,745
Anything we could lift from the docks
went straight to his store...

272
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:39,944
but he's dead,
so why am I wasting your time, right?

273
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,144
Her, I don't know.

274
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:45,443
My uncle, you know about him.

275
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:50,743
I don't know
why you got Horse's picture up there.

276
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:53,743
Horse don't know shit. I'll testify to that.

277
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:55,643
What about the Russian?

278
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:57,343
He drove for them.

279
00:24:57,443 --> 00:25:01,043
Anything that had to come off the docks,
he was their guy.

280
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:04,844
But I also got the feeling
that if somebody had to get hurt...

281
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:07,843
he was probably going to be around
for that part of it, too.

282
00:25:07,944 --> 00:25:09,643
Why did you think that?

283
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:12,343
Sergei, he just carried it like that.

284
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:16,043
And also, after them girls died in the can...

285
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:20,042
they told me that whoever fucked that up...

286
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,843
they had already got to in Philly.

287
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:26,343
They said that
whoever did that to them girls was dead.

288
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:28,542
And how did they say it?

289
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:32,743
They just said, I don't know...

290
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:36,642
that the guy that you all was looking for...

291
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:38,442
he was a dead end.

292
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:41,742
-A dead end?
-Yeah.

293
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,642
In Philly, they said.

294
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:50,141
Who's the suit?

295
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,341
You sure?

296
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,942
We know that someone
is above your man Spiros.

297
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,642
Someone he was in communication with.

298
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:05,642
Yeah, The Greek.

299
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:09,742
Sure, I know who you mean.
I mean, I don't have a name or nothing.

300
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:11,541
The man in the suit...

301
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,741
the man with Vondopoulos
in the photograph.

302
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,641
That's not The Greek?

303
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,742
That's The Greek right there.

304
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,342
That the guy?

305
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,040
He picked out an Eastsider, all right.

306
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,441
Cheese runs with Proposition Joe's mob.

307
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:48,240
Had a few corners off of Ashland,
last I heard.

308
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,041
-What's the verdict?
-He did good for us.

309
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:54,040
-So I'm out the stat?
-I owe you one, Sanny.

310
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:07,040
-Both of them?
-Yeah, that one's his valet.

311
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:09,241
Can I use your bathroom?

312
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:11,340
Fuck, no. Get out of here.

313
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,340
Bubs, one last question.
How's product in the Towers?

314
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,239
It was shit, now it's right.

315
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,939
Found this guy.
Federal court computer down in D.C.

316
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,240
But not in a bad way.

317
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,039
He's a K Street lawyer down there.

318
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,239
So the suit was only a suit?

319
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,240
On the other hand, my friend,
this is from overseas.

320
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,039
A can on the Adriatica, which docks
the day after tomorrow at Patapsco.

321
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:51,339
Fake manifest out of Le Havre.

322
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,139
You people got reach.

323
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,339
That's about $300,000 in man-hours
we're holding here.

324
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,940
What's the plan for him?

325
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,239
You gotta call the US Attorney
about witness protection.

326
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:04,739
We're rounding up his girl and kid.

327
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,338
It's best we keep this as quiet as we can.
We already lost one cooperator.

328
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,139
It's for you.

329
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,837
Daniels.

330
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:47,139
Lieutenant, Fitzhugh's calling for WITSEC,
and we're pulling in the girlfriend and kid.

331
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,039
Okay, thanks.

332
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:32,837
FBl.

333
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,237
This is Special Agent Terrence Fitzhugh,
Baltimore field office.

334
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:38,737
-May I speak with Agent Koutris, please?
-Who?

335
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,337
Agent Koutris.

336
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:43,437
He's no longer
with the San Diego field office.

337
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:44,937
Where's he at?

338
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:48,737
You could try headquarters in Washington.
Counterterrorism.

339
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:54,937
Counterterrorism? For how long?

340
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:59,536
I'd have to check, but I'm sure
he's been gone from here more than a year.

341
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:17,037
Either he comes home
in the next five minutes, or I eat my gun.

342
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,336
I'm just saying, this is not the way...

343
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,736
me and you learned how to do it
in West Baltimore.

344
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:25,836
Not by a fucking long shot!

345
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:46,236
Either your son surrenders within the hour...

346
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:49,535
or all the police will come
crashing through this door twice a day...

347
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:52,735
for as long as it takes you people
to get the message. You hear me?

348
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:56,835
We will take this door once in the morning
and once at night, and toss your house...

349
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:00,135
until there isn't any furniture
with more than three legs left on it.

350
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:04,335
Officer, my son turned himself in
to the police last night.

351
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:08,536
At Southeastern.
A detective was there at the time.

352
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:19,635
-A detective?
-Motherfucker. Come on.

353
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:28,235
Don't use the phone.

354
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:32,534
There'll be an agent posted outside.
If you go anywhere, go with him.

355
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,134
What a dump.

356
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:47,134
You wanted us to get a place, right?

357
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:55,533
If they got to him in Philly...

358
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:58,234
then they probably dumped
the body in that area, right?

359
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:02,234
No use in dragging a headless torso around
further than you need.

360
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:03,534
Good God.

361
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:07,434
I bet you there's a police detective
somewhere else...

362
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,834
Iooking at a table full of heads right now.

363
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:13,933
In that stuff that we took off the ship,
did we keep any photos?

364
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,734
Couple of pictures of one guy
that left his gear, yeah.

365
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,334
They're at ECU.

366
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:26,433
You two should get on the road.
Get up there before the offices close.

367
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,133
Where y'all been at?

368
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:39,333
I'm saying, though, Butchie,
something just ain't feel right.

369
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:41,733
The man didn't even know
what I was saying.

370
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,533
So I just eased off.

371
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,333
-You think brother played me?
-No.

372
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,732
Y'all can't read lying eyes
after all these years...

373
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:53,332
then I'd be talking to a dead man.

374
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:57,032
You saying Stringer told you...

375
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,633
the brother had something to do
with your boy Brandon?

376
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:01,732
Yeah.

377
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:05,432
Near as I know, Brother Mouzone
spends most of his time up north.

378
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,332
New York and Philly.

379
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:11,932
If Avon contracted him to get at you...

380
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:17,232
the brother wouldn't have stop coming
until you two were bumped.

381
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,032
It's my fault.

382
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,931
I should've said no to Prop Joe
from the get-go.

383
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:25,332
Avon's father was plain evil,
and the son ain't no better.

384
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:27,532
Neither is Stringer,
now that we making a list.

385
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,832
I'm going hard after Stringer.

386
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:34,132
No point in trying
to talk you back down, I suppose.

387
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:38,531
You been my bank for how long
and gonna ask me something like that?

388
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:40,532
How you gonna get at him?

389
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:44,931
I don't even know, Butch.

390
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:48,231
Take some time and think on it.

391
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:53,231
One thing for sure, though,
the man got to be got, you feel me?

392
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:00,932
What you see, Butch?

393
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,731
Too much, boy.

394
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:08,931
Too damn much.

395
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,030
A lot happened overnight.

396
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:20,430
Not to us.

397
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,932
-Look, this isn't personal--
-Fucking-A, right.

398
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:26,031
We're not even people in this unit.
We're your goddamn pack mules.

399
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:29,331
"Sit on this house,
transport this mope, wait for that one."

400
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:30,631
That's part of the job.

401
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:34,231
The job had a little more rip-and-run to it,
the way I remember it.

402
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,730
These cases are more than that.

403
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,730
We're putting people in jail
with phone taps and typewriters.

404
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,330
So you're saying we ain't up to it.

405
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,830
I saw on the postings that Major Colvin
needs a sergeant in the Western.

406
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:52,331
Flex squad.
And the last time I checked, I had stripes.

407
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,929
Eastside, Westside.

408
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,529
Cats and dogs, sleeping together.

409
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:16,329
Shit. I'm late for something.

410
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:38,829
You say you want everybody
that came on the port that day?

411
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:42,629
No, we're looking for anything
out of the ordinary. Probably at night.

412
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:45,329
Oh, unusual. You should've said so.

413
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,729
-What you asked for before--
-That's what we....

414
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,129
You're right, sir, absolutely right.
Just see if there's anything like that.

415
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:03,128
Nope, all I got is usual.

416
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,228
All right.
Any way you could give us the name...

417
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:07,928
of the security officer
that was on this pier that night?

418
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:10,028
What was that date again?

419
00:36:10,528 --> 00:36:12,028
February 5.

420
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,529
You had the Atlantic Light on that pier
from 6:00 p.m.

421
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:22,728
That was Walt. Walt Stokes.

422
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:24,528
Is he working tonight?

423
00:36:24,628 --> 00:36:27,527
It's Tuesday. Walt's off on Tuesdays.

424
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:29,227
What do you want Walt for?

425
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,628
See if he can make any of these.

426
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,328
Wouldn't do much good.

427
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:38,728
Afraid Walt's not as up to speed
as the rest of us.

428
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:47,727
Seeing as you've come
all this way, though...

429
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:51,127
you might want to have a look-see
at the videotapes.

430
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,527
$300 for a stroller?

431
00:37:04,326 --> 00:37:07,726
I know, I know.
Cost more than your first car, right?

432
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,827
A hooptie, no doubt?

433
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:14,127
We're so gonna need one of these.

434
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,327
Look at this, Kima.

435
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,626
Blue's Clues juice box holder.

436
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:28,026
If the kid can't hold on to a little old box
without no help, we got problems.

437
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:39,026
Okay, listen.

438
00:37:41,227 --> 00:37:46,126
This baby is gonna come out of my belly
and need both of us, forever.

439
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:48,527
You understand?

440
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:51,626
I mean, it may not be real for you yet.

441
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:55,026
But, goddamn it, it's real for me.

442
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:25,925
Nick.

443
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:33,626
What's gonna happen, Nicky?

444
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:42,725
That can on the fifth wheel there.

445
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:46,225
By the plan, it's a hot box,
but there's no one on a pick-up.

446
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,425
-Where's it from?
-Le Havre, France.

447
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:52,324
Fuck it, then. Dump her.

448
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:07,324
Lester, the drug talk coming
from Proposition Joe's people...

449
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:09,224
before the warehouse phone came down.

450
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:11,225
Those were for steady re-ups, right?

451
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:14,824
We weren't up on that wire long,
but, yeah, three weeks in a row.

452
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:18,724
-How much?
-Five or six La-Z-Boys at a clip, to start.

453
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:22,624
Last call to Eton's cell phone,
the re-up went to 1 2.

454
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:25,723
He doubles his re-up to 1 2 kilos?

455
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:33,225
That's her right there.

456
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:36,924
They ain't doing the dirt, though.

457
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,824
Team leader,
keep an eye on that can till we post.

458
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:41,124
Copy.

459
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:50,923
Sorry to hear about my boy Sergei.

460
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,923
Eton, too.

461
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:56,023
You lost some good people.

462
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:00,924
There'll be some new faces soon.

463
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:04,524
A week or so. They'll find you.

464
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:08,423
Just as they'll find the others
that work with us.

465
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:09,623
A week?

466
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:14,823
I ain't got enough of your good shit
to last much past that.

467
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:18,023
You got anything to lay off
before you leave?

468
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:21,123
The last shipment is lost.

469
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:24,423
Lost? How you mean?

470
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,023
The police may be sitting on it.

471
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:30,623
You ain't sure?

472
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:33,422
There's more where that came from.

473
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:35,823
Always, there is more.

474
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,523
All right, then.

475
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,622
I'm gonna let your new people find me.

476
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,022
Have a safe trip.

477
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:48,922
Where you say you off to again?

478
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,921
There's 1 2 in this, 15 in that.

479
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,221
And if the rest of them
holds this same pattern....

480
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:11,022
Maybe 200 kilos of raw left on the pier.

481
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:14,021
The Greeks are definitely in the wind.

482
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:16,021
And we are in the dark.

483
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,821
You want us to take it down
to the customs shed, or what?

484
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,822
No, you're gonna seal it up and sit on it.

485
00:41:20,922 --> 00:41:23,421
If we're lucky, someone will come
calling in a day or so.

486
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,522
You that lucky?

487
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:29,122
If they didn't get onto us when they did,
this might've been a hell of a case.

488
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,521
It's on you.

489
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:39,221
Ambushed? ln his own goddamn room?

490
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,321
Yeah, he gonna be all right, but he--

491
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:45,420
I don't give a fuck
about how he gonna be, man.

492
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:48,121
You put on out-of-town talent
at a high price...

493
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:50,621
you expect them
to get the motherfucking job done.

494
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,121
He said that thing between us is....

495
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:55,621
How did he put it? Absolved.

496
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,021
Absolved? What the fuck do that mean?

497
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:02,921
Mouzone booked out,
we worse off than when he came.

498
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,520
If word gets out on the street
that we weak like this...

499
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,621
how the fuck we supposed
to maintain our shit?

500
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:10,320
I know, but we gotta hit right back,
make a statement.

501
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,320
But Mouzone not saying who did this.

502
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,520
-You asked him who it was?
-Yeah, I asked him.

503
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,220
-Why?
-Why what?

504
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,321
How you gonna ask a soldier like Mouzone
a question like that?

505
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:24,920
Either he gonna say,
or he gonna go and work it out.

506
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Either way,
you ain't got to be asking him shit.

507
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,619
Man, every market-based business
runs in cycles...

508
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,919
and we going
through a down-cycle right now.

509
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:46,119
String, this ain't about
your motherfucking business class either.

510
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,420
It ain't that part of it. It's that other thing.

511
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:54,719
The street is the street. Always.

512
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,519
Man, we gonna get through
this bullshit anyway.

513
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,419
No doubt.
You just need to hold tight till I get uptown.

514
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,418
And that day gonna come, but until then...

515
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:12,420
we gotta do what we can do,
when we can do it.

516
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,619
Yeah, you need to go to Prop Joe.

517
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,319
I ain't gonna argue with you.

518
00:43:19,419 --> 00:43:21,419
You run it as you see fit.

519
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:24,019
At least until I get home, you do.

520
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,419
No doubt.

521
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:30,919
Us, man.

522
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:36,518
Us.

523
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,819
-Tape is fucked up.
-It's multiplexed.

524
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:53,118
It's a way to save money.

525
00:43:53,218 --> 00:43:55,218
Instead of one camera, one VCR...

526
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:57,418
it's 10 cameras playing on one VCR tape.

527
00:43:57,517 --> 00:44:00,418
-Can you make sense of it?
-Not a problem, with this software.

528
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:03,017
-We just de-plex it.
-De-plex?

529
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,318
Let me show you the highlight reel.

530
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,918
-Is he flashing a badge?
-Looks like it.

531
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:17,018
That's something you don't see too often...

532
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:18,818
John Law in a Mercedes-Benz.

533
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:20,718
That could be our boy.

534
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,817
Head still on.

535
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:27,817
Tell me we got cameras inside.

536
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,117
Jesus, my pants are wet.

537
00:44:31,217 --> 00:44:33,417
Yeah. C'mon, baby.

538
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:35,218
Yeah.

539
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,816
Re-up gonna be about a week or so late.

540
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,517
My people are having to readjust
to some shit.

541
00:44:58,617 --> 00:44:59,616
A week?

542
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:01,816
No later than that, they say.

543
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,717
How it go with Avon today?

544
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:07,617
It's all good.

545
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:23,516
Our old friend.

546
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:28,915
What's the news?

547
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:32,117
Port cops are sitting on a can
that came off the Adriatica.

548
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:34,516
Word around the customs shed,
it's full of dope.

549
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:36,116
I mean, about Frank.

550
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:38,916
-What's the district council saying?
-Gentlemen.

551
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:44,115
Mr. Pakusa, in light
of your pending indictment...

552
00:45:44,215 --> 00:45:47,215
I'd think you'd stay as far away
from this hall as possible.

553
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:49,115
Ain't y'all got some place to go?

554
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:50,815
Just came to make it clear...

555
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,815
that if there's no cleaning up in here...

556
00:45:52,915 --> 00:45:54,515
this local will be decertified.

557
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:57,015
Instead of your union
running out of this office...

558
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:00,615
it'll be a federal magistrate
down the courthouse deciding things.

559
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:03,216
Take the opportunity to elect new officers...

560
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:05,615
or the US Attorney will padlock the door.

561
00:46:05,715 --> 00:46:08,115
And you'll be outside, looking in.

562
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:25,614
One man, one vote.

563
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:46,014
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

564
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:49,114
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

565
00:46:51,913 --> 00:46:54,715
You don't think that had anything to do...

566
00:46:55,714 --> 00:46:57,214
with this mope?

567
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:07,914
You gotta do better than that, Lester.

568
00:47:08,114 --> 00:47:10,313
This poor guy ain't got a face.

569
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:26,414
Did I mention the DNA matches?

570
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:31,014
This has nothing to do with me.

571
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:49,713
Is that the security guard?

572
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:54,413
Walt Stokes. A good man.

573
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:57,413
Keeps meticulous records.

574
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:02,613
Bunk, they tell me
you can enhance each frame...

575
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,413
to get a clear look.

576
00:48:04,813 --> 00:48:07,212
Yeah? Show it to me.

577
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:14,612
I'll be damned. Maryland tags.

578
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:17,412
Juliet-Lima-Yankee...

579
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:19,813
5-4-5.

580
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:22,913
That comes back to a BWI rental.

581
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,013
I wonder who rented it.

582
00:48:27,512 --> 00:48:30,512
This is aggravated murder and kidnapping.

583
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:34,312
In this state, it's a death penalty case.

584
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:39,312
I didn't kill him.

585
00:48:42,912 --> 00:48:45,711
I was there, but I didn't kill him.

586
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:52,312
Vondas did.

587
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:55,211
He cut his throat.

588
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,511
The shepherd was supposed
to watch over the women.

589
00:49:01,411 --> 00:49:04,311
Instead, he used them to make money.

590
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,811
One of the women, she fought.
She was killed.

591
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:13,911
And this idiot kills the rest
to make no witnesses.

592
00:49:14,011 --> 00:49:15,511
He had to die.

593
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:25,611
You want a coffee? Soda?

594
00:49:26,211 --> 00:49:27,511
Vodka.

595
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,311
Coffee.

596
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:46,011
They're down. All 14 of them.

597
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,710
Abated by the untimely death
of a known suspect.

598
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,610
Plus another clearance
on a John Doe case, just for laughs.

599
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,010
You wanna tell Rawls?

600
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,910
Let him stew a while longer.

601
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,710
One thing, though,
we should do right away.

602
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,810
Who's the man above Vondas?

603
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,410
The Greek.

604
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,610
What's his name?

605
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:27,909
You want a chance at anything
less than death row...

606
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:29,509
you're gonna tell me right now...

607
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,309
whatever it is you know
about where those bastards might be.

608
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:37,109
A hotel at the harbor.

609
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:38,810
This one?

610
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,909
Another.

611
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,409
I can show you.

612
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,808
Go.

613
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:08,409
Clear!

614
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,108
Business or pleasure for you?

615
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:29,108
Business. Always business.

616
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:46,608
-What did you forget?
-Nothing important.

617
00:52:03,108 --> 00:52:04,908
You come to the bar without me?

618
00:52:05,008 --> 00:52:07,407
Kiss my black cat's sister's ass.

619
00:52:09,507 --> 00:52:11,707
-What happened?
-Case hit the wall.

620
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:13,007
How so?

621
00:52:13,107 --> 00:52:15,707
The Sobotka nephew breaks for
the smuggling and the drugs.

622
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:19,006
The Russian breaks for the murder
that fucking killed my girls.

623
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,607
We were late on Vondopoulos
and The Greek.

624
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:23,807
-How late?
-They skipped.

625
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,606
We got interstate flight warrants out,
but from what the Sobotka kid says...

626
00:52:27,706 --> 00:52:29,006
these guys collect passports.

627
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:31,907
We ain't even got a name
for The Greek yet, right?

628
00:52:32,407 --> 00:52:34,507
What're we doing
with the drug end of the case?

629
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:37,606
I guess we could offer up Dixon
and Prop Joe to Narcotics.

630
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:40,107
See if they want
to follow through on their end.

631
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,407
I don't know.

632
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:44,606
I wouldn't be so quick
to throw Joe back into the pond.

633
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:49,406
A major case squad could have some fun
with that mess, don't you think?

634
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,106
Lieutenant.

635
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:11,406
I never told you this.

636
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:15,206
In fact, if you tell anyone
I ever told you this...

637
00:53:15,306 --> 00:53:18,606
I'll finish my career
in fucking Montana or some shit.

638
00:53:20,106 --> 00:53:21,505
Excuse me, sorry.

639
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,506
The leak wasn't your people.

640
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:31,406
When I called around
looking for info on your targets...

641
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:34,005
I used the FedCom software, you know?

642
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:37,605
I thought I was talking
to some fuck in San Diego.

643
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:39,905
The 9l1 1 boys in D.C.

644
00:53:40,905 --> 00:53:44,005
I'm guessing Vondopoulos
or The Greek was an asset to them.

645
00:53:44,105 --> 00:53:46,805
Hooked up like, I don't know,
who knows what?

646
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:55,605
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

647
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:08,005
World just keeps turning, right?

648
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:12,304
You guys move on to something new.
No one looks back.

649
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:20,303
It's on me this time.

650
00:54:23,105 --> 00:54:24,305
Anyone?

651
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:46,903
Where are you going?

652
00:54:47,803 --> 00:54:48,903
Work.

653
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,503
Frank, you cocksucker.

654
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:38,402
-I can take it from here.
-You sure?

655
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,102
No one fucks with us on our turf.

656
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:07,902
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?
How's it looking?

657
00:56:08,002 --> 00:56:11,501
One ROIRO at North Point.
Graybeards grabbed that.

658
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:14,102
Nothing else today, really.

659
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:16,002
Seniority sucks.

660
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:18,302
If you ain't senior.

661
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:22,102
All right, man.

662
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:20,599
This is a great day for Baltimore.
