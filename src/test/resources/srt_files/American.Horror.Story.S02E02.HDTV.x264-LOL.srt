1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,645
(screaming)

2
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:28,291
Leo, Leo, come on, get up.

3
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:39,914
(whimpering)

4
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,124
(screaming)

5
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:02,542
Help me!

6
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:06,676
(screaming)

7
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:17,541
(loud bang reverberates)

8
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,009
Don't answer it.

9
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,444
There's a killer of women
on the loose.

10
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:21,812
(pounding)

11
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:25,332
They caught that guy.

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,348
Threw him in the nuthouse.

13
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,159
In Briarcliff.

14
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,532
He's in there with Lana.

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,202
I have to recant.

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,739
I'm recanting tomorrow.

17
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:34,740
That might be tough.

18
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,343
You signed a document.

19
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:37,812
Not that anyone would blame you.

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,147
(sobbing): I'm gonna be sick.

21
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:40,748
(loud knocking)

22
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,096
Lois, don't.

23
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:47,432
You don't know who's out there.

24
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:50,169
(door opens)

25
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:52,837
CHILDREN: Trick or treat.

26
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,439
Check out the mass murderers, Barb.

27
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,606
WENDY: Is today Halloween?

28
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,174
LOIS:
Tomorrow. These little monsters

29
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,443
are just getting a jump
on the competition.

30
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,614
(crying):
I don't have any candy.

31
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:03,814
That's okay, Miss Peyser.

32
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:04,882
We'll come back tomorrow.

33
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:08,885
God, the job, the kids,

34
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:10,353
Halloween...

35
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,154
Nothing makes sense without her.

36
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:15,156
I just hate myself.

37
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:18,326
Hey, you want me to stay over tonight?

38
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:21,532
No, I-I'll be okay.

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,735
I just need a hot shower

40
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:25,572
and a good night's sleep.

41
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,410
And tomorrow I'm gonna get her
out of that place.

42
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:31,013
You can say that you made a mistake.

43
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,748
You got scared
and you hit the panic button.

44
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:35,015
I have to get her out.

00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,824
Come on, stand out in the hall.

68
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,928
(knocking)

69
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:09,032
Room search, Miss Winters.

70
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,034
We find it keeps our charges honest.

71
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,035
Food violation.

72
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,304
Oh, Pepper.

73
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,240
Now, tell me, why is it we don't allow

74
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,075
food in the rooms?

75
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,810
Rats! That's right, Pepper.

76
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,545
Why can't you get that through
your pointy little head?

77
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,246
Huh? SHELLEY: Hey, Sister.

78
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,115
I have a cucumber in my room.

79
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,751
But not because I was hungry.

80
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,953
Stifle yourself, Shelley.
I'll be with you in a minute.

81
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,622
Find anything, Frank?

82
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,323
No, looks clean to me.

83
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,291
Check the pillowcase.

84
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,663
FRANK: Uh-huh.

85
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,398
Here we are. (Chuckles)

86
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:45,869
What do we have here?

87
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,074
"October 28.

88
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,843
Strip-searched and deloused.
Denied phone call."

89
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,747
Who would you like to
call, Miss Winters?

90
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,850
The American Civil Lesbians Union?

91
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,120
My editor knows I came here
to write a story.

92
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:05,090
And, boy, do I have
a great scoop for him now.

93
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,925
Ah, yes. You know,
I've read your columns

94
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,393
about baked beans,

95
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,428
gallivanting geese who
lost their way home.

96
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,597
Riveting.

97
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,199
Too bad your ambition
outweighs your talent.

98
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,136
I don't need those, Sister.

99
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,171
I have an excellent memory.

100
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,506
Yeah?

101
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:24,508
We'll see about that.

102
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,144
(knock on door)

103
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,880
ARDEN: Ah. Sister Jude.

104
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:32,983
Always a pleasure to lay
one's eyes on your sunny visage.

105
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,018
We have a problem.

106
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,120
The little sapphic reporter?

107
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,822
Yes, I noticed

108
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,824
she'd been giving you fits.

109
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,492
I believe that

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,828
her memories are her worst enemy.

111
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,663
They're terrorizing her,

112
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,165
impeding repentance.

113
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,134
So you would like to help
erase some of them.

114
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,802
Bring her a little peace of mind.

115
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,071
Correct.

116
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,375
Is electroshock therapy
something you would suggest?

117
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,645
My...

118
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,014
that is quite a turnaround, Sister.

119
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:06,916
The last time I suggested

120
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:08,551
electroshock therapy, you accused me

121
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,753
of being a sadistic barbarian.

122
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:11,721
I prayed about it.

123
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,624
When I wasn't praying for you

124
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:16,292
to find a halfway decent haberdasher.

125
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:19,563
And I came to the understanding

126
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,431
that this therapy

127
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,367
is just another tool

128
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,236
in His bountiful tool chest.

129
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:28,205
LANA: <i>Get them off! Help me!</i>

130
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,175
Help me! Please let me go.

131
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,477
Stop! (Screams)

132
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,346
Get off! Get off of me!

133
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,381
(pants) This woman is a kidnapper.

134
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,750
She's a kidnapper.

135
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,151
She blackmailed my lover
into committing me.

136
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:41,252
Please help me!
I don't belong here!

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
Get me out of here!

138
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,988
You're right.

139
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,690
She is a noisy one. Help me!

140
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,293
(muffled yelling and whimpering)

141
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:56,199
Given your interest, Sister,
perhaps you'd like to assist.

142
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,268
Just hold these by her temples.

143
00:07:58,335 --> 00:07:59,869
You're not squeamish, are you?

144
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:10,780
Sister.

145
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:17,052
(electrical crackling)

146
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,229
(electrical crackling stops)

147
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,901
(muffled groaning)

148
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:38,473
(music playing quietly)

149
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:53,388
Gentlemen.

150
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,257
I can handle it from here.
Thank you.

151
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,661
Mr. Walker,
Dr. Oliver Thredson.

152
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,370
<i>Patient is 24 years old.</i>

153
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,006
All right if I call you Kit?
Sure.

154
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,776
<i>Completed grades K through 12,</i>
<i>no higher education.</i>

155
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,845
<i>Patient is believed responsible</i>

156
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:15,847
<i>for the murders of multiple women,</i>

157
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:17,482
<i>including his wife.</i>

158
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,551
Seems unreasonable to me that a man

159
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:22,020
should be denied the right to smoke.

160
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,725
<i>The murders may have started</i>
<i>as a purging of racial guilt</i>

161
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:29,527
<i>at what his conditioning</i>

162
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,162
<i>would have viewed</i>
<i>as an illicit coupling.</i>

163
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:32,663
<i>Do you know why I'm here, Kit?</i>

164
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:33,998
You're the headshrinker

165
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,566
the courts sent to see if I'm crazy.

166
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,434
If you say I am, they
leave me here to rot,

167
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:40,237
and if you say I'm not, they put
me on trial, and then fry me.

168
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:41,405
<i>Patient is manipulative.</i>

169
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,674
Trouble is...

170
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:46,077
I'm not crazy.

171
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,813
And I didn't kill those ladies.
What about your wife?

172
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,582
Alma's not dead.
That body didn't have a head.

173
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,050
None of the bodies had heads, Kit.

174
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:55,019
Initially, you told
police that you were...

175
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,454
I know what I said!

176
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,424
But it wasn't Alma.

177
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,194
See, I know that now.

178
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,628
'Cause I'm starting to remember.

179
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,130
And I saw her.

180
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:09,000
After they took us, she was alive.

181
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,735
They?

182
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,404
The men from outer space?

183
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,075
They have her.

184
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:18,743
(typewriter keys clacking)

185
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,347
<i>Diagnosis:</i>
<i>Acute clinical insanity.</i>

186
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,188
(rustling)

187
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,090
(gasping)

188
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:34,326
Dr. Arden,
you're like a shadow.

189
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,727
How is my favorite
little helper today?

190
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,296
They had quite the ferocious
appetite last night.

191
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,565
Did you hear them? No.

192
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,701
Expected to find the
basket torn to pieces.

193
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,970
Please, Doctor,
you must tell me...

194
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,905
what are these creatures?

195
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:48,640
All in good time.

196
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,509
You haven't said anything
to Sister Jude, now, have you?

197
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,645
No, of course not.
It's our secret.

198
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,314
Good.

199
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,784
A small token of my gratitude.

200
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,622
Oh! (Chuckles)

201
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:04,523
A candy apple.

202
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,592
Looks delicious, but...

203
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,294
mm-mm, I can't.

204
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:09,295
Go ahead.

205
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:10,329
Have a bite.

206
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,633
Oh, Sister, life is too short
for regrets.

207
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,069
Take a taste.

208
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:21,272
No, I really shouldn't.

209
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,973
Sister Jude says sweets lead to sin.

210
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,075
I said...

211
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,309
take a taste.

212
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:37,352
(chuckles)

213
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:05,045
(music playing quietly,
electrical crackling)

214
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,320
(electrical crackling)

215
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:17,090
(distorted music playing quietly)

216
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,192
GRACE (distorted): Did you do what I said?
Did you toss your shit

217
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,794
at him?

218
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,796
Did you at least spit at him?
I can't do it.

219
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,097
I can't fake crazy.

220
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,032
What I need to do is

221
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,233
escape this place now

222
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:28,401
before he files that report

223
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:30,037
and I'm screwed.

224
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:31,271
There is no escape.

225
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,473
I gave you your way out.

226
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,507
Think.

227
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,410
Think hard.

228
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:38,312
There's got to be
a way out of this place.

229
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,480
I need to find Alma.

230
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:40,648
Now, what about the bakery?

231
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:41,616
Aren't there delivery vans?

232
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,451
How does that work?

233
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:46,253
You disguise yourself as a
giant loaf of pumpernickel?

234
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,626
Sister Jude?

235
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:53,428
I'm Dr. Oliver Thredson.

236
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,429
Ah, the court-
appointed psychiatrist.

237
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:58,466
You've seen our killer
of women, I trust.

238
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:00,434
So what's it going to be?

239
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:03,003
We gonna spare the taxpayers
the expense of a trial

240
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,573
or will I have a bed opening up?

241
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,142
I haven't made a determination yet.

242
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,145
Might we speak privately
about the conditions here?

243
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:12,613
Conditions?

244
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:15,082
What conditions might those be?

245
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,684
In just the short time
that I've been here,

246
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,252
I have witnessed appalling things.

247
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,687
<i>Abuse.</i>

248
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,055
(electrical crackling)

249
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,390
<i>Malpractice.</i>

250
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,624
Candidly, I'm shocked.

251
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:24,826
It's a madhouse, Doctor.

252
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:26,294
What did you expect?

253
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,363
I expected some form of treatment.

254
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,864
Therapy.

255
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,500
Sister, your hospital
still administers

256
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,435
electroshock therapy
to treat homosexuality.

257
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:35,004
It's barbaric.

258
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:36,906
Behavior modification
is the current standard.

259
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:39,809
Tomato, "tomahto."

260
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,078
You know, Dr. Thredson,
let me remind you,

261
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,980
your job here is
to write a recommendation

262
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,917
to the court regarding
the sanity of one patient.

263
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:52,454
So I suggest you do your job
and let me do mine.

264
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,626
Now if you'll excuse me,

265
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:01,563
there's another unfortunate
family who requires our care.

266
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,004
WOMAN: <i>Jed's been a good boy.</i>

267
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:10,873
He's always listened.

268
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,508
He's never talked back.

269
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,210
Our problem started a month ago.

270
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,346
Mrs. Potter, you needn't worry.

271
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,881
Good boys gone bad
is my area of expertise.

272
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:21,450
I've had great success in curbing

273
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,819
the chronic masturbator.

274
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,421
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:27,556
I didn't mean to interrupt.

276
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:28,791
We weren't finished

277
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:30,059
our conversation, Sister Jude.

278
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:31,961
I didn't realize you had company.

279
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,429
I'm Dr. Thredson,
psychiatrist here.

280
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:37,099
I'm at your service.
You need to leave, Doctor.

281
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,734
MRS. POTTER:
Uh, Sister Jude, please.

282
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,903
Our boy is troubled;
We could use a doctor's opinion.

283
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:50,880
How can I help?

284
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,716
Jed just turned 17.

285
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:55,618
Over the last month, he's
grown listless, moody.

286
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,721
Sometimes he doesn't get
up from bed for days.

287
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,022
And then, the next moment,
it's like someone

288
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,557
tied a live wire to his body.

289
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:03,793
Adolescence can be a time
of conflict and rebellion.

290
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,861
No, Doctor.

291
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,062
Jed...

292
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,464
...sees things.

293
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,300
He hears voices that aren't there.

294
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,502
I'm afraid he'll bring us harm.

295
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,205
Yesterday, we heard terrible
cries coming from the barn.

296
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,507
<i>When I got there,</i>

297
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:21,342
<i>I found Jed covered in blood,</i>

298
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,978
<i>speaking a language</i>
<i>no one could understand.</i>

299
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:26,381
(speaking in tongues)

300
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:27,982
<i>Then I saw what he had done.</i>

301
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,818
He had ripped opened the belly

302
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,920
<i>of our best Guernsey.</i>

303
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,154
Jed?

304
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:34,155
(growling)

305
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:36,724
Ate her heart.

306
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,597
It was unholy.

307
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:46,200
It was... it was
like some... thing

308
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:49,370
had stepped inside my boy's body

309
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,838
and taken over his soul.

310
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,807
Nothing?

311
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:59,748
For a man whose profession
relies on talk, talk, talk,

312
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,017
you appear to be at a
loss for words, Doctor.

313
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,086
I-I would need to see him

314
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,288
in order to provide
an accurate diagnosis.

315
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,256
We brought him here.
Let's go see the boy now.

316
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,596
Dr. Thredson,

317
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:17,265
you are but a guest
in our institution.

318
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,436
<i>Don't</i> wear out your
welcome the first day.

319
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,610
(panting)

320
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,879
Mother, where am I?

321
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:32,846
I'm scared.

322
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:36,183
Jed, this is a hospital.

323
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,717
Doctors are here to help you.

324
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:38,985
(gagging)

325
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,521
Jed?

326
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,456
(roars)

327
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,191
(screams)

328
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:49,362
(speaking in tongues)

329
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:52,798
Jed needs to be immediately medicated.

330
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:59,640
No, Doctor. (Hissing)

331
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:01,709
That's not what this boy needs.

332
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,510
LANA: This hurts my burns.

333
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,630
GRACE: The harder you fight,
the hotter it feels.

334
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:20,032
LANA: What are you doing
under there?

335
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,972
Colonel Mustard
in the library with the wrench.

336
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:45,439
I like the view from this window.

337
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:49,143
All the bare trees.

338
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:50,544
Bleak and beautiful.

339
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,746
Do you ever dream of escaping?

340
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,282
All you new people.

341
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,084
There is no way out.

342
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,686
What if I said I know a way?

343
00:17:58,754 --> 00:17:59,954
You'd be full of shit.

344
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:04,326
There's a tunnel.

345
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:06,829
It's real.

346
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:10,733
I came in through it. Wow.

347
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,834
They really messed with your mind.

348
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:12,901
What meds are you on?

349
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:13,902
I need someone to help me

350
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,903
pull off an escape.

351
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:17,373
But nobody else can know.

352
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,808
We have to take Kit.

353
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:20,743
Absolutely not.

354
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:23,279
He's a vicious murderer.

355
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:25,347
They can make you believe anything.

356
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:28,683
There have been plenty
of killers here.

357
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,318
Kit's not one of them.

358
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:32,787
He can't come.

359
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:35,489
That's my line in the sand.

360
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,693
(sighs)

361
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,328
You have trouble trusting people, yes?

362
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:45,699
You would too if the person you loved

363
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,468
most in the world betrayed you.

364
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:51,806
Threw you away forever.

365
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,043
I know what that's like.

366
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,255
I saw you flirting with.

367
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:12,592
Our Lady of Perpetual Virginity.

368
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,895
You want to see my candy apple?

369
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,266
Get your filthy hands off me!

370
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,268
(gasps softly)

371
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:22,736
Come on, Doc.

372
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:24,271
Bend me over

373
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:25,939
a bread rack and pound me into shape.

374
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:30,978
You're a dirty little slut
with a poisonous tongue.

375
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,616
I just want to go outside

376
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,719
for 15 minutes in
the sun. Please.

377
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,256
I just want to feel
the sun on my skin.

378
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:43,924
I'll do anything.

379
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,559
No.

380
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:48,762
Whores get nothing.

381
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:52,266
Men like sex,

382
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,267
no one calls them whores.

383
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:55,335
I hate that word.

384
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,537
It's so ugly!

385
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,206
I'm into pleasure.

386
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,141
Ever since I was

387
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:04,778
five years old
and I slipped my fingers inside

388
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:06,580
for the very first time.

389
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:08,448
I could do it all day.

390
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:10,050
My mother made me

391
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,351
wear mittens to bed.

392
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,019
Because you're a little slut.

393
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,089
No. Because she
didn't understand me.

394
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:18,259
So I ran away from home,

395
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:21,595
met some jazz musicians,
real free thinkers.

396
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,664
I fell in love with the bass player.

397
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,599
Mistake.

398
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:30,571
As soon as he put a ring on
my finger, I was his property.

399
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,107
He could screw every Betty in town,

400
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:35,142
and I had to stay home and scrub

401
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,012
his dirty drawers.

402
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,915
So come fleet week,
he gets home and finds me

403
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,684
in bed with two Navy guys.

404
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:47,988
And I told him, "It's not
for self, but for country."

405
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,058
He decked me flat out,

406
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,527
threw me in the car
and locked me in the nuthouse.

407
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:55,996
And the sickest part is, they let him.

408
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,532
Because I like sex.

409
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,701
That's my crime.

410
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,571
Am I supposed to be moved
by that pathetic tale of woe?

411
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,940
Please.

412
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:10,377
I'm just asking for
five minutes in the sun.

413
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:11,778
A little fresh air.

414
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,483
You make me sick.

415
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,485
Whore.

416
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,634
In my estimation, the county hospital

417
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,469
might be better equipped
to treat your son.

418
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:36,537
They already called in the specialist.

419
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,610
Mr. and Mrs. Potter,
are you aware

420
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,679
what kind of specialist
is on his way here?

421
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:46,481
The monsignor explained
the situation to us.

422
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:48,583
SISTER JUDE: I've instructed.

423
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,118
Sister Mary Eunice to observe

424
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,320
lights out at 7:00.

425
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:52,388
Excuse me.

426
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:54,090
I will not tolerate tomfoolery

427
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:56,025
from the residents tonight.
A wise precaution, Sister.

428
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:57,060
Monsignor.

429
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,362
Ah, this must be...

430
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,697
SISTER JUDE:
The tiresome Dr. Thredson.

431
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:02,432
Dr. Thredson.

432
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,901
Sister Jude was just sharing
with me your concern.

433
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:07,237
It is 1964.
For God's sake, an exorcism?

434
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,506
You can't be serious.

435
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:10,740
The times may have changed, Doctor,

436
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:12,743
but the nature of evil has not.

437
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,945
You expect me to stand by
as some witch doctor

438
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,547
comes in here... Stand by?

439
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:17,948
On the contrary, Doctor.

440
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,317
What I expect is for you to assist.

441
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:21,719
I beg your pardon?

442
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,821
You may view us as...
backward and barbaric,

443
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,189
but the Church requires

444
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,591
a licensed physician

445
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:27,759
to be present at all exorcisms.

446
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:28,760
As a psychiatrist,

447
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,361
you're also a medical doctor.

448
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,030
You are mistaken if you think that

449
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:33,365
by making me an accomplice to this

450
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,733
I won't report what I've seen here.

451
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:37,203
MAN: An unbeliever.

452
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,537
Good.

453
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,440
I like having one in the room.

454
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:41,741
Ups me game.

455
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:47,414
(patients murmuring, sobbing,
music playing quietly)

456
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,893
(whispers):
You're asking for it.

457
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,361
I have to write it down
or I'll forget.

458
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:01,729
Then you better tell me now, Lana.

459
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,964
Before you forget, tell
me where the tunnel is.

460
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:04,932
(whispers): No.

461
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,636
We go together.
That's the only way.

462
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:11,207
And not a word to <i>him.</i>
That's my deal.

463
00:23:13,731 --> 00:23:15,209
There you go.

464
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,254
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,146
FRANK:
Okay, everybody, let's go.

466
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:21,315
Sister Jude wants everyone to
get an extra good night's sleep,

467
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,151
so the common room is closing early.

468
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:25,853
Thank you. But give
me back my notes.

469
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,188
What's the matter, don't you trust me?

470
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,023
Let's go!

471
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,591
No woman should trust you.

472
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,059
Come on, up and at 'em!
Move your feet!

473
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,361
They can't find these on you.

474
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:34,895
FRANK: Let's go!
(clapping hands)

475
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,232
(patients sobbing, moaning, murmuring)

476
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,471
(door slams)

477
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:11,769
(sobbing): Please...

478
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:14,272
Please, no, stop, please!

479
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,140
Make it tight now.

480
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,442
You're hurting me.
Why are you hurting me?

481
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,978
Don't listen to it.
The demon is a liar.

482
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:22,946
If it speaks to you, do not
answer, just do your job.

483
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:24,982
My God, this boy's pulse
is almost nonexistent.

484
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,284
(screaming, growling)

485
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,356
Prayer book, Sister!

486
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:34,859
Your work here is done, my daughter.

487
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:37,061
Go sit with the parents.
This is no place for a woman.

488
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:39,697
I'm stronger than you think.

489
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:42,834
The Potters will be
needing some of that strength.

490
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:44,836
MONSIGNOR: Godspeed...

491
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:46,238
Sister Jude.

492
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:49,140
(Jed laughs evilly)

493
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,775
Yes, Father.

494
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:54,056
(speaking in tongues)

495
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:57,615
All right, gentlemen,
it's time to do God's work.

496
00:24:57,683 --> 00:25:00,351
(speaking in tongues)

497
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,153
(door slams, evil laughter echoes)

498
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,864

00:25:14,736 --> 00:25:15,635
(doorbell chimes)

500
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:23,076
Stanley?

501
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,345
May I? Oh...

502
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:27,848
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

503
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:31,018
Are we having dinner?

504
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:34,522
You only booked me for
an hour and a half.

505
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:37,758
Actually, I find the anticipation

506
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:40,561
far more erotic than the act itself.

507
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:41,596
(laughs gently)

508
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,468
I find a big cock even more erotic.

509
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:49,737
If you're going to be vulgar,

510
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,405
I'd just as soon you not speak at all.

511
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:58,779
I'm sorry.

512
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,948
I can be classy, if you want.

513
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:03,785
It's just that most men
like to hear me talk dirty.

514
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:07,922
Of all the composers
from the Romantic Era...

515
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,490
I love Chopin the most.

516
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:10,759
Oh.

517
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:11,760
Are you familiar with this waltz?

518
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:13,528
No... "Les Adieux."

519
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:18,133
It was inspired by
his childhood sweetheart

520
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,934
who refused his hand in marriage.

522
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,970
Can you hear the longing?

523
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,374
Oh... yes.

524
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:28,509
To us.

525
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:31,279
To... an evening of romance.

526
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:33,380
To us.

527

This is a Chateau St. Estephe,

Yes, well,
you'll have to forgive me, Stan.

531
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,790
I have to keep my wits about me.

532
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:48,659
I don't drink alcohol on dates,
and I don't kiss...

533
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,928
not on the mouth. Hey...

534
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,799
...what do you say
I dance for you?

535
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,067
Come on, Stan...

536
00:26:58,135 --> 00:26:59,702
I can really shake it

537
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,571
if you've got something with a beat.

538
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:07,142
You... will sit down.

539
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,817
In your line of work,

540
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:19,585
it must have been frightening

541
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,754
meeting strange men...

542
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:23,155
what with a killer on the loose,

543
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:26,258
skinning and decapitating women.

544
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,593
A great weight must have been lifted

545
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:30,228
now that he's been captured

546
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:31,996
and you're perfectly safe.

00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:49,245
I see what you've become.

Sister Jude, will you join me?

We've taken Father Malechi
to the infirmary.

00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:08,971
SISTER EUNICE: Sister Jude!

667
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,206
Sister Jude, there's trouble
in the wards.

668
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:12,841
(choking)

669
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,343
THREDSON:
Something's gone wrong.

670
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,778
He's in cardiac arrest.

671
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:19,648
LANA: I think
it's just through that door.

672
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,817
KIT: Grace.

673
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:24,487
Come on. Lana knows a way out.

674
00:33:24,555 --> 00:33:26,155
No. He can't come with us.

675
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:28,324
Get away from us.
I read what you wrote about me.

676
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:30,159
I'm not a killer or a psychopath.

677
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:32,095
You're a liar.
Get away from us.

678
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:34,097
Stop. I'm not leaving
without him.

679
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:36,533
I'm not setting him loose
so he can kill again.

680
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,468
You're wrong. We'll go
find the way out ourselves.

681
00:33:38,535 --> 00:33:40,236
Come on.

682
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:41,838
(distant siren wailing)

683
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:46,343
Help!

684
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:49,112
He's escaping!

685
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,281
The killer is escaping!

686
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:52,416
Help me!

687
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,051
In the hallway!

688
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,054
He's trying to get out!

689
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,022
(distant siren wailing)

690
00:34:01,928 --> 00:34:04,096
(struggling, yelling)

691
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:15,489
GRACE: No! Stop it!

692
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,765
(gasps)

693
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:49,772
(panting)

694
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,174
Four, five, six,

695
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,408
seven.

696
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:01,319
He's dead.

697
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:03,886
(creaking)

698
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,561
(thud) Sister?

699
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,158
Almost ready.

700
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:30,998
Is that trashy makeup gone?

701
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:33,012
Clean as a virgin.

702
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,915
(chuckles)

703
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,388
What is taking you so long?

704
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:16,557
(whispering): Holy shit.

705
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,794
I'm just...

706
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,129
Oh!

707
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,402
I told you not to touch anything.

708
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,371
You don't have to pay me; I
just have to get the money...

709
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,140
(gasps)

710
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,741
You're not going anywhere, Sister.

711
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:36,777
Now, pick those up

712
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,813
and go lie on the bed.

713
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:42,717
(screams)

714
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:45,586
I told you

715
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:47,721
to lie on the bed.

716
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:57,597
Did you take off your panties
like I asked you?

717
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,499
Now...

718
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:04,605
...slowly...

719
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,206
...show me your mossy bank.

720
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,076
Slowly.

721
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:23,957
(screams)

722
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,197
(screaming)

723
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:32,100
(groaning)

724
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:48,917
(Sister Jude speaking quietly)

725
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,787
(Mrs. Potter screams)

726
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:55,924
(sobbing)

727
00:37:58,094 --> 00:37:59,227
Shh, shh.

728
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:00,562
(sobbing)

729
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,931
No!

730
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,860
(gasps) Oh.

731
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,462
I'm so sorry, Sister.

732
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,297
I didn't mean to frighten you.

733
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,166
I was only trying to
protect your modesty.

734
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,868
Oh, you could never
frighten me, Doctor.

735
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:43,604
You make me feel safe.

736
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:45,339
(exhales)

737
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,541
I heard about your fainting spell.

738
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:50,511
I wish I could have been there.

739
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,280
I did ask for you,
but I know how busy you are.

740
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:55,049
Saving lives.

741
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:56,283
Yes.

742
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,819
Well, I'm here now

743
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:00,654
with strict instructions.

744
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:04,023
Rest and relaxation.

745
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,861
But what about the creatures?

746
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:15,670
Forgive me.

747
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:16,771
It's a bit disconcerting

748
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:18,139
to see you out of costume.

749
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:19,574
Oh.

750
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:21,209
I'm sorry, Doctor.

751
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:24,547
I would hate to distract you

752
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:25,781
from the important work of the day.

753
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,683
Don't be silly.

754
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:31,921
To me, the human body is nothing
more than a complex machine.

755
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:34,156
Like a clock,

756
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:37,727
full of... cogs and sprockets.

757
00:39:39,596 --> 00:39:41,864
Now, uh, you try to get some rest.

758
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:43,332
I'll check back with the nurse

759
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,701
in a few hours.

760
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:56,879
(door closes)

761
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,730
Are you going to cane me?

762
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:16,733
If so, can we get on with it?

763
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,434
Now, why would I cane you?

764
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:19,969
I've learned to assume the worst.

765
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,409
It was a long night for all of us.

766
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:28,612
A lesson in the power of Satan.

767
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,315
One can never let one's guard down.

768
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,721
Until last night, I considered you

769
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:40,089
a corrupt little opportunist,

770
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:43,560
but God always surprises me.

771
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:46,129
I know what it took for
you to call the orderlies.

772
00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:47,797
It couldn't have been easy,

773
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,599
but you did it anyway, and for that,

774
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,134
you deserve something special.

775
00:40:53,204 --> 00:40:54,404
Open the door.

776
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,707
Go ahead.

777
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:58,575
Open the door and see your treat.

778
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,984
Bring them in.

779
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,496
These two didn't show
your courage and wisdom

780
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,198
and as such will be punished.

781
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,434
Your reward is

782
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:27,302
you will not.

783
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,071
You're so twisted.

784
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,339
Don't make me change my mind,

785
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:32,241
Miss Lana Banana.

786
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:34,276
Which of these

787
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,112
would you like to see on our Grace's

788
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,514
bare behind,

789
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,883
and which one on our doe-eyed

790
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,451
James Dean copycat?

791
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,487
Go ahead, pick one.

792
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:49,825
Oh, come on, Miss Winters, live large.

793
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:05,942
I'm so sorry, Grace.

794
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,544
Screw you, Judas bitch.

795
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:12,482
Stand up, Grace.

796
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,551
Stand up.

797
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,787
I'm the guilty one here,

798
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:19,256
Sister; she was a pawn.

799
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:20,690
She's not the one

800
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:22,959
who deserves
to be punished. I am.

801
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:25,462
She was just trying to help a friend.

802
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:28,364
He seems to think

803
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:31,467
you're just one big scoop

804
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:34,703
of melting strawberry ice cream.

805
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:37,105
(chuckles) Go stand over there.

806
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:40,975
So that was

807
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:43,511
20 lashes each.

808
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,913
So that makes 40 for you,

809
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,715
Sir Galahad.

810
00:43:02,464 --> 00:43:03,397
(whacking)
