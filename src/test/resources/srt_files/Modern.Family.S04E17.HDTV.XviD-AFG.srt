1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:03,981
Look, I know you're tired,

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:05,681
but just think how good
you're gonna feel tomorrow

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,081
when you wake up and
we have new shelf paper!

4
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:08,968
I wish I didn't get what
you are talking about,

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,126
but I do. 
I just do.

6
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:13,314
Hey, who could be 
calling at this hour?

7
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:14,672
- Oh. It's Sal.
- Mnh-mnh.

8
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:16,533
No. Not answering that.

9
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:19,985
Whatever earth-shattering drama 
she's going through can wait.

10
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:22,436
Until she gets here.

11
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,161
Oh, God. I hope we have vodka.

12
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:25,821
We don't, Mitchell.

13
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:29,147
Sal was our best girlfriend 
from back in our party days,

14
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:31,972
but over the years, we've kind 
of gone in different directions.

15
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:33,639
We chose forward.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,574
Why won't this open?

17
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:37,797
Uh, something's wrong 
with that door.

18
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:39,942
Okay, whatever.
I have the most amazing news,

19
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:40,633
and I'm super excited,

20
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:42,356
but I won't be if
you don't want me to be.

21
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:43,326
Ready?

22
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:44,213
I'm getting married!

23
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:45,922
- Oh, my gosh! Congratulations!
- Oh, wow!

24
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:47,907
- I know!
- Who's the guy?

25
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:49,535
Oh, the love of my life.

26
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:51,502
Oh, so you finally 
bagged your boss?

27
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:54,039
Oh! Yes, but it's not him. 
And I don't work there anymore.

28
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,389
- His name is Tony.
- Okay.

29
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,618
- I met him three months ago.
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,766
He's the greatest guy ever.

31
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,784
And seriously, 
are you guys okay with this?

32
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,152
Of course. 
Why wouldn't we be?

33
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:02,941
Well, you know, 
because I can get married,

34
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:04,647
and you guys... ugh! Cant.

35
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,620
So? That doesn't mean you shouldn't.

36
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,261
Really? 
Because I will not go through with it

37
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:09,658
if you don't want me to. 
Seriously.

38
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,902
Not necessary. I mean, 
what kind of people would we be

39
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,980
if we denied you
or anyone the right to marry?

40
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,401
♪politics.

41
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:16,915
This makes me so happy

42
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,280
because I want you two 
to be my best men.

43
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:22,351
- Yes! Yes! Of course!
- Of course! Shh.

44
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:25,309
Okay. The wedding
is gonna be super cute,

45
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,265
just us, a little dinner after.

46
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,483
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, and it's next Friday.

47
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:29,976
- Oh.
- What, it's next Friday?

48
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:32,129
- Yeah. - How will we have
time to do best man stuff?

49
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,783
You know, like help 
you pick out your dress,

50
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,694
get your flowers,
get our hair blown out?

51
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,140
He's never been 
a best man before.

52
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,628
Oh, my God, we're getting married!

53
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,429
We're getting married!
Let's have a drink.

54
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,929
- Yeah, we're out of vodka.
- I will see you on Friday.

55

And initial here and here and here.

58
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,887
Ay, my arm is starting to hurt.

59
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,994
Just a couple more.
What's going on?

60
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:06,245
Nothing. 
I have to get this package,

61
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:08,216
but there's so much signing.

62
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:10,242
Get out of here, you perv.

63
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,649
What's the matter with you?

64
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:15,499
You don't do that
in front of strangers.

65
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,789
At least throw a blanket over.

66
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,333
- I am not ashamed.
- Obviously.

67
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,141
They're out all the time--

68
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:20,422
in front of Manny, 
at the club,

69
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:21,701
at Claire's dinner the other day.

70
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:22,837
Phil almost ate a candle.

71
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:27,016
Fine. Next time, I will feed
your baby inside a dark closet.

72
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,672
I'm just saying 
pick your moments, huh?

73
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:31,431
Like let Daliya open the door. 
That's why we hired her.

74
00:02:31,432 --> 00:02:32,130
Daliya?

75
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,318
My mother raised six children

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,374
while working 
at a construction job.

77
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,107
She would be so ashamed
if I had a nanny.

78
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,486
I don't see a lot of shame
from your mom

79
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,642
when she's cashing
my checks every month.

80
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:45,039
- Hey, Daliya, we gotta go see 
Manny's teacher. - Mm-hmm.

81
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,688
Would you try to coax 
a burp out of this one?

82
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,049
Come here, little guy.

83
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:52,000
Can you hold him a little higher?

84
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,951
I will. I'm just
letting him get settled in.

85
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,717
Okay, we're going.
Bye-bye, Joe.

86
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,728
He likes to bounce a little.

87
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,595
Can you cup your hand

88
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,606
- so that he doesn't feel
like you're slapping? - Okay.

89
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,479
She knows it. 
Stop micromanaging.

90
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,421
Ow. Cup your hand.

91
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:10,531
- Hello.
- Hey.

92
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,538
Hey, can one of you guys drive me 
to my cello thing tonight?

93
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:13,609
Honey, I wish we'd known.

94
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,461
- Yeah. We got a dinner thing 
with the Flendersons. - Mm.

95
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,650
Okay, you don't have to stay,

96
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,732
and those aren't even real people.

97
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:20,983
Sorry. I panicked.

98
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,493
I got stuck between
the Flemings and the Hendersons.

99
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,989
Oh, my God. Are those new boots?

100
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:27,120
Yes.

101
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,169
I love them. 
They're so cute!

102
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,946
They are?

103
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:31,153
Oh, I forgot to tell you--

104
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,744
Danielle Gunston-- first one
in my class to get pregnant.

105
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:35,713
You totally called it.

106
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,636
Did you hear that?

107
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:39,111
My money was on Denise Modick.

108
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:41,560
No. First she complimented 
my fashion sense,

109
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,120
then she told me 
I did something right.

110
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,339
Phil, I think it's happening.

111
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,174
Raising a kid is like sending 
a rocket ship to the moon.

112
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:52,010
You spend the early years 
in constant contact,

113
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,876
and then one day, 
around the teenage years,

114
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:58,108
they go around the dark side 
and they're gone.

115
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,256
All you can do is wait 
for that faint signal

116
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,864
that says they're coming back.

117
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,601
I think Haley 
is sending me that signal.

118
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,924
And?

119
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,553
- And Phil gave me that analogy.
- Yeah.

120
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:16,409
You know what?

121
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:19,764
I think I'm gonna ask her out 
to dinner tonight.

122
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,223
Do you think she'll say yes?

123
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:23,969
If you want, I can pass her 
a note in study hall.

124
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Hey!

125
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,175
What did I do?

126
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:28,832
Oh, my God. Nothing.

127
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,775
I just wanted to know, 
if you weren't busy,

128
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,976
you know, if you wanted
to have dinner with me tonight?

129
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:35,508
Dinner? Just you and me?

130
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,273
I mean, you don't have to.
It's cool. Don't worry.

131
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:38,746
No, sounds fun. Let's do it.

132
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:41,846
Okay. Let's meet 
by the front door, then.

133
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:42,993
You know, 7:00?

134
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:44,637
- Okay.
- Yeah.

135
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,938
I totally think she likes you!

136
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,310
I think so, too.

137
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:53,070
First of all, I just want to say
what a pleasure it is

138
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,878
to have Manny in art class.

139
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,274
- He's talented-- 
- Can we just skip to what he did wrong?

140
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,934
Who said that he did 
something wrong?

141
00:04:58,935 --> 00:04:59,437
Hit it.

142
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,590
We do have an issue.

143
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,970
- Told you.
- Manny seems to have quite a fascination

144
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,583
with the female nude.

145
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,726
So? He's a romantic.

146
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:10,574
Well, this is all his art work
over the last few weeks.

147
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:11,852
Holy moly.

148
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,594
There were even more,

149
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,210
but I think the janitor
took some home.

150
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:15,639
- Look at this.
- Mm.

151
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,111
And this.

152
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,002
And these.

153
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:23,272
Look, I'm an artist.
I'm free.

154
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,576
I used to have an earring up here.

155
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:28,389
But some of the other parents
have complained.

156
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,312
Well, the moms.

157
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:30,917
He must have learned 
that at school.

158
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:32,759
Because we have filters
in the computer,

159
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,221
and I have thrown out 
all of Jay magazines.

160
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,485
Don't know what
she's talking about.

161
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,755
There is no way that Manny 
has seen this sort of thing

162
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,589
at our home.

163
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:45,118
We'll take it from here.

164
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:50,173
Hey, buddy.

165
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,355
It's just you and me tonight.

166
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:52,573
Sounds good. I'll be right down.

167
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:53,786
All right.

168
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:56,764
I knew it!
What are you hiding?

169
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,138
- Porn.
- Don't lie to me!

170
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,129
Fine. 
I'm trying to send a message

171
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,357
to a girl on Facebook, 
but she's so out of my league.

172
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:04,149
Look at her.

173
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,811
Oh, yeah. She's cute.

174
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:06,775
I've been sitting here forever

175
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,032
- and I can't think of anything to say.
- Well, you are in luck.

176
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,215
If anyone knows the art
of wooing the fairer sex,

177
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:12,758
it's this guy.

178
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:13,750
"Hey."

179
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,193
- Wait!
- Send.

180
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:16,356
Why did you type that?

181
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:18,630
Now she knows
I'm thinking about her.

182
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:19,830
Smiley face.

183
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,021
Oh, my God. 
Stop now.

184
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,487
We can only screw it up from here.

185
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,139
Please. You're in the hands 
of the master.

186
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,303
I think I know how 
to pick up a 14-year-old girl...

187
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,654
For you.

188
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,763
"What's the haps tonight?"

189
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:34,508
Boop.

190
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:38,106
"What's the haps tonight"?
Nobody says that.

191
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:41,289
"Going to the mall. Wanna meet?"

192
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:47,947
"Dinner at Rosa Grill in an hour?"

193
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:50,091
Question mark. Boom!

194
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:51,296
Kids don't eat dinner.

195
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:52,125
What do you mean, 
you don't eat dinner?

196
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:52,713
What do you do?

197
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:55,248
I don't know. You just 
walk around and jump off stuff.

198
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,920
You can't invite a girl 
to jump off stuff.

199
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:59,059
Well, it's way better than--

200
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,478
"See ya then. X.O."

201
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,994
You're in, buddy.

202
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,664
I gotta get ready.

203
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,296
All right, let's go 
before this wears off.

204
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,301
I think we have a few days.

205
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,222
Well, thank you, dimples.

206
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:21,651
Oh, you better get 
that out of your system,

207
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:22,882
'cause in two hours, 
you're gonna be...

208
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:25,709
Mrs. Anthony Lombardo.

209
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:27,924
So does this Italian of yours cook?

210
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,931
In every room of the house,

211
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:33,302
if you know what I mean! Ooh!

212
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,050
- We have a lot of sex.
- Yeah. Got it.

213
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,194
Okay, now let's have a proper toast.
All right.

214
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:40,286
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- To wild Sal.

215
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,723
You gave it a good run,

216
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,454
but like every legendary gunslinger,

217
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:47,226
there comes a time when 
you need to holster your weapons

218
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:48,826
and ride off into the sunset.

219
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,079
But you took on every man
who came to town.

220
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,175
- I really did!
- You sure did.

221
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,480
Also, you know, 
I'm just getting married.

222
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,594
I'm not dying.

223
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,769
No, no. 
We're just happy you're happy.

224
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,136
And we're excited that
we're gonna get to see

225
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:02,174
so much more of you now.

226
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,469
- Yes. We'll be couple friends.
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,545
- We'll go to movies...
- Take classes...

228
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:08,327
Oh, our game nights on Saturday...

229
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:11,042
- Huge. Mm-hmm.
-  They're epic, yeah. Do you play Cranium?

230
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,326
Well, if I'm playing board games 
on a Saturday night,

231
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,268
you can shoot me in my cranium.
But I love you!

232
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,700
I need to take a whiz.

233
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,481
I'm so happy for her.

234
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:23,566
I think we might have 
freaked her out, though.

235
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,596
Oh, no, Mitchell. Come on.
You're a smart man,

236
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,741
but you are awful
at reading people.

237
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,188
Sal's been different this week.

238
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,778
That is a woman in love.

239
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,068
Looks like a woman in love.
Wow.

240
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,034
Look, nobody's as happy
as I am about you loving the ladies.

241
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,058
All I'm saying is,
you gotta pull back a little.

242
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,389
- Okay.
- Ay, Manny,

243
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,953
this is all my fault.

244
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,552
I am too free with my body.

245
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:57,287
- It was okay when you were
a little boy, but-- - Was it?

246
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,864
But now that you're a young man,

247
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,352
- then...
- I didn't hear a word they said.

248
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:03,439
All I could think about was Daliya.

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,271
Every drawing, every poem,

250
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:08,090
every historical novel
I wrote was for her.

251
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,042
She was my muse.

252
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:12,005
Toss in a body that doesn't quit,

253
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,792
and I think we got a soul mate.

254
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,426
So there's a lot of other
things you can draw.

255
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:18,454
You've got your landscapes. 
You've got your bowls of fruit.

256
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:19,469
Trees.

257
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,465
A barn. The ladies 
with the fruit on the head.

258
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,304
I said fruit.

259
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,881
But you didn't say the ladies 
with the fruit on the head.

260
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,608
I'm trying to get him
away from the ladies.

261
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,668
Ah, good. Good. Good.

262
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,448
This is so stupid.

263
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:32,739
What if I spill on her,

264
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,551
or accidentally brush
my boob against her hand?

265
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:36,705
I mean her hand against my boob.

266
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,389
Dude, stay cool. You got this.

267
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,794
I'm gonna be at the bar
the whole time.

268
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,438
If you start to panic,
just come get me.

269
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,334
Shh. There she is.

270
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:45,545
What was that?

271
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:46,927
I don't know.
I've never heard it before.

272
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,923
Try not to let that happen again.

273
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,461
- Hi, Luke.
- Pretty good.

274
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:51,946
Uh, I mean, hi, Simone.

275
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,260
Uh, this is my dad.

276
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:55,129
Dad, this is Luke.

277
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:56,371
You're funny.

278
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,594
Looking.

279
00:09:58,353 --> 00:09:59,264
Clutch.

280
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,178
What are you still doing here?

281
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:03,535
What the hell got into me?

282
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,927
Besides the bartender's tongue?

283
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,393
Yes. Yes, well,
that was a little inappropriate.

284
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:08,527
But let's not overreact.

285
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:11,037
It's perfectly natural
to have a panic attack

286
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,992
before making a big life decision.

287
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:14,462
What if it's the wrong decision?

288
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,190
What if Tony's not the guy?

289
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,594
What if he's the guy?

290
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,849
Or him? He is cute.
When did he come in?

291
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,581
Okay, you need to focus, Sal.

292
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:24,140
You are about to make a sacred,
lifelong commitment.

293
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:27,596
Aah! You are not making this better!

294
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:29,917
Oh, God, it's Tony.

295
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,129
I'm supposed to pick him up
and drive him to the wedding?

296
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:36,058
Everybody shut up for a second!

297
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:39,377
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna marry him.

298
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:41,148
What's the worst that can happen?
I get a divorce.

299
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,865
People do it all the time.

300
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,589
Oh, you're suffocating me!

301
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,377
It is not too late.
You are not married yet.

302
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:49,727
You're right.

303
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,690
Okay. That's good.
Get it all out.

304
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,330
- Here. Stand up.
- Okay, mom?

305
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:59,004
Mom. Mom. Oh, my God,
mom, I think I got it.

306
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,886
I've been lugging this thing
around for ten years.

307
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,612
Okay. Well, you sure
you don't want us to stay

308
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:03,798
and-- and hear you play?

309
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,884
Mm, that's okay.

310
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:05,825
Yeah, I agreed to dinner,

311
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,859
not tickets to
the Electric Light Dorkestra.

312
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,893
Don't be so mean to your sister.

313
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:10,741
No, that's our band's name.

314
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,750
So you wanna go back
to that vegan place?

315
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:15,656
Ooh. Leather jacket.
Can't take the hate.

316
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:16,811
Haley!

317
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,722
Gabby! What are you doing here?

318
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,224
I just stopped in
for a bump of coffee

319
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:22,234
before I meet up with Zoe
and those guys at Noodlecat.

320
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:24,504
- Do you wanna go?
- So what's--what's Noodlecat?

321
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:26,088
Oh, it's this really
cool Asian place

322
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,066
that sells, like, a million
different kinds of noodles.

323
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,306
And hopefully, no cat.

324
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:32,103
- Well, that sounds cool.
- So you don't mind if I go?

325
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:34,575
Oh, I kind of thought we had plans.

326
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,114
Oh. Yeah. You're right.

327
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,226
So I can meet you guys there after.

328
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:39,078
- How long are you gonna be there?
- No.

329
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,946
It's fine. It's fine. Go.

330
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:42,331
I'll stay and watch Alex.

331
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,700
- Oh, now I feel bad.
- Mm.

332
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,245
Love you! Mwah.

333
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,380
Excuse me.

334
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,525
You're Luke's dad, aren't you?

335
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,483
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Valerie, Simone's mom.

336
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,545
- Oh. Phil.
- Hi.

337
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:00,484
I recognized you

338
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:01,984
from when you hosted
the school's talent night.

339
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,937
- Oh.
- You were incredibly limber.

340
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:05,840
Ah, when you wear the right pants.

341
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,170
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

342
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:08,278
Yeah.

343
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,698
So how is the big date going?

344
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:11,813
I don't know.

345
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,235
Simone was so nervous.

346
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,651
When they were chatting
on the computer,

347
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,129
I had to write everything for her.

348
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,944
That's so funny.
I did the same thing for Luke.

349
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,901
So the whole time we were
talking to each other?

350
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:22,141
Wait, does that make this our date?

351
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,037
Well, a good father,
funny, handsome.

352
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,172
A girl could do a lot worse.

353
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,524
You know what, Mitchell?

354
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,688
Forgive me
if my Missouri is showing,

355
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,244
but what she is doing
is not marriage.

356
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,047
It's a mockery of marriage.
It's mockerage.

357
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,077
- And I'm gonna stop it.
- No, no, you're not.

358
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,128
I can't help but think
you're infusing the situation

359
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,833
with just a touch
of your own frustration.

360
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,163
Why, because we've built a life
together for the last ten years?

361
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,736
Because we're raising a child?

362
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,472
Or because I was
the first person to think of doing

363
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,069
an elaborately choreographed
dance at our wedding,

364
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,317
and now it's been done to death?

365
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:54,300
Makes you feel any better,
I was never gonna do that.

366
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:56,090
But... I get it.

367
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:57,580
Well, you know what?
She can't get married

368
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,417
if the best man doesn't
hand over the wedding ring.

369
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:00,485
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

370
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:01,451
Where is it?
Give it to me.

371
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,086
- Give me the ring. Cam.
- Stop. Stop.

372
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:06,068
- You have to give me--
- Oh, well, this is a mystery solved.

373
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,622
Thank you!

374
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,140
- Okay. Let's go do this.
- Okay.

375
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,243
How hot does Tony look?

376
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,813
- On a scale of 1 to bartender, or--
- Reel it in, Cam.

377
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:18,121
I think this is broken.

378
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,696
We're gonna have
to find another spot.

379
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:20,904
No, we'll be late for the movie.

380
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:22,064
Are you sure you're doing it right?

381
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,723
We both know I know
how to use a credit card.

382
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:24,836
All right, I'll put
a note on the meter.

383
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,061
Let me get a piece of paper.

384
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,592
Maybe this is a bad sign.

385
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:29,765
Maybe I'm not supposed
to be in the movie theater.

386
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,730
I'm supposed to be
at home with my babies.

387
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:34,352
Honey, we know that Daliya
knows how to take care of Joe.

388
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:37,107
And what about Manny?
He's supposed to run his own bath?

389
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,882
You know, considering
what's been going on with him,

390
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,699
it might be good for you
to give him a little space.

391
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,681
I mean, this was his idea.

392
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,829
- What was?
- That we go out tonight,

393
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,163
so that we could get
some alone time.

394
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:48,658
Oh, that's sweet.

395
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,223
- Uh-oh.
- What?

396
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:51,957
We gotta get home.
Look--Manny's notebook.

397
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,787
More drawings and a poem--
"Ode to Daliya."

398
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:56,190
So those were not my boobs?
They were Daliya's boobs?

399
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:57,904
Yep. This is not a
"Nude descending a staircase,"

400
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,634
this is a "Nude
vacuuming a staircase."

401
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:04,655
Okay, Manny. Joe's asleep.
What do you want for dinner?

402
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:08,246
Actually, already taken care of.

403
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:24,418
- You shouldn't play with your food.
- What are you doing here?

404
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,958
I knew you were upset I left,
and I felt bad, so I came back,

405
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,356
You're here out of guilt?

406
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,892
- I know. I'm growing up.
- Oh.

407
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,854
Why are you rolling
your eyes at me?

408
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,046
I'm doing a nice thing.

409
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,433
Because I want you to be here
because you want to be here.

410
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,338
Okay, you're being
really needy right now.

411
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,021
Oh, my God. Are you
going through the change?

412
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:44,616
Stop asking me that every time
I express an emotion.

413
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:48,822
And no, I am not. 
It's just so damn hot in here.

414
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:51,162
I am disappointed, that's all.

415
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:54,274
When you were little,
we used to do everything together.

416
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,134
And I thought maybe
you were coming back around,

417
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,534
and we could be friends again.

418
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:01,796
I just... miss being part
of my daughter's life.

419
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:04,290
Hey, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

420
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,481
I thought this was supposed
to be some sort of classical thing.

421
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:20,943
Me, too.

422
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:28,824
She sings?

423
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:31,085
I don't even know who that is.

424
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:41,204
Oh, my God, Phil,
you are hilarious.

425
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:44,410
Yep. That's how I got
my wife of 20 years.

426
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,229
Could we get the check, please?

427
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,617
Oh, I got this.

428
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:50,077
Ooh, funny and generous.

429
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:51,576
If my husband
were more like you...

430
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,149
maybe I'd still be married.

431
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,370
Well, if my wife were here,

432
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,417
she'd want me to be clear
that I'm fully committed to her.

433
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,671
You know that, right?

434
00:15:58,672 --> 00:15:59,341
What?

435
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:00,527
No, I just wanna make sure,

436
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:01,862
because you unbuttoned a button,

437
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,516
and I... love my wife, so--

438
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:04,822
you were the one who was flirting

439
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,711
- and saying we're on a date.
- That was a joke,

440
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:08,582
but I'm-- I'm sorry
if I misled you at all.

441
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,053
Thank you.

442
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:11,700
But there was a lot of touching.

443
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:13,261
I touched your shoulder
for a second.

444
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,973
No, it was more of a stroke,
like this--

445
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:17,776
Okay. I'm so sorry

446
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,525
for touching your hand
with my boob.

447
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,604
I mean my boob
with your hand.

448
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,944
Is this your little game?

449
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:24,216
You cop a feel on a sad divorcee

450
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,983
and then pretend
I'm the one coming on to you?

451
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,712
- How does that feel?
- Oh. Weird.

452
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:30,013
- You like it? Yeah?
- Oh. Uh...

453
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:31,160
- Little bit of that?
- Whoa.

454
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:31,873
- Yeah.
- Little bit of--whoa. No.

455
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,583
You probably like this.
Don't you? Yeah.

456
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,598
Oh, stop it.
Your daughter's right over there.

457
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,318
My minivan is right outside.

458
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,389
That is not what I meant.

459
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:43,153
This pizza is delicious.

460
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,377
I like it, too.
We have so much in common.

461
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,599
Have you seen
the back of your menu?

462
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,005
"With silken hair
and supple olive skin

463
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:59,294
and hands that wash
the laundry of my kin..."

464
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:00,542
Oh, Manny...

465
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,235
You still have 12 lines to go.

466
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:05,123
Spoiler alert-- I love you.

467
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,396
Okay, back away from the nanny.

468
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:11,476
Oh, my God, it looks like
a Madonna video in here!

469
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,550
- Why aren't you at the movies?
- We need to talk right now.

470
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:14,709
- What have you done to my son?!
- I didn't--

471
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,998
She didn't do anything.

472
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,442
Why do you have to embarrass me?

473
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,975
Embarrass you?
Maybe if you didn't fall in love...

474
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,826
Stop this!

475
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,524
You're going to wake the baby.

476
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,553
Now Manny and I are
having a private discussion.

477
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,263
So please, give us a minute.

478
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:30,254
- I'll give you your minute right
this minute. - Mnh. Gloria. Gloria.

479
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,537
Go ahead, Manny.

480
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,985
I'm not saying we need
to do anything right away.

481
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:39,203
I'm just asking you
to wait a few years.

482
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:41,566
You are so sweet.

483
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,862
Whoever ends up with you

484
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,858
is the luckiest woman in the world.

485
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,630
That could be you.

486
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:47,828
No.

487
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,631
I am unlucky, because
I was born too soon.

488
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:52,256
And I can't have you wait around.

489
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,492
Poets have to live.

490
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:55,927
Besides, in a few years,
you'll feel differently.

491
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:58,792
You're wrong. I'll feel this way
for the rest of my life.

492
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:00,653
Well, Manny, wait.

493
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:03,215
- Ay, Manny, papito lindo--
- Leave me alone.

494
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,135
Sorry about that.

495
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,773
Don't be. It's the sweetest offer
I've ever gotten.

496
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:11,417
I am so sorry that
I screamed at you.

497
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:14,318
It was so nice what
you told him in there.

498
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,276
I take Manny,
you take the little one?

499
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:18,888
Okay.

500
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,895
- You probably just--
- She knows what to do, Jay.

501
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:25,880
Tiramisu.

502
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:28,384
I love his tiramisu.

503
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,314
Marriage is a promise.

504
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,353
It says to the world
that you share a love

505
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:34,746
and a commitment to each other

506
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,033
that will only grow deeper
as the years go by.

507
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,965
Now have you two written vows?

508
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,341
Yeah, I'll go.

509
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:43,345
Marriage terrifies me.

510
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,711
Take Mitch and Cam.

511
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:47,197
I used to think their life
looked so boring.

512
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:50,254
I could never do it.
Pay bills? Wash dishes?

513
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,623
Wake up to the same face every day?

514
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:53,692
I felt sorry for them.

515
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,539
Where is this headed?

516
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,831
But they're not bored.

517
00:18:56,832 --> 00:18:59,312
It turns out when
you're with the right person,

518
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:02,714
you can change shelf paper
at 10:00 at night in your pajamas

519
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:05,044
and not wanna be anywhere else.

520
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,081
That's how much
they love each other.

521
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:10,003
We sure do.
And when I just saw your face,

522
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,625
I remembered...

523
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:14,359
that's how much I love you.

524
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,852
Thanks for being here.

525
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:18,161
We wouldn't be anywhere else, Sal.

526
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:20,426
And do you have
anything prepared?

527
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,853
Hit me, baby.

528
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,625
I made out with
a stripper last night.

529
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,949
Sorry. I just
wanna start this clean.

530
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:30,439
I made out with a bartender...
an hour ago.

531
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,318
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better, are you?

532
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,350
Back me up. Didn't I?

533
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:34,760
- She totally did.
- I totally did!

534
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,654
- Yeah. He was hot, too.
- He was very good-looking.

535
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,790
- Nice.
- Well. That was different.

536
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,175
Who's got the ring?

537
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:42,595
Hand 'em over.

538
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:47,948
Thank you guys so much.

539
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:49,794
Alex, honey, amazing.

540
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:51,229
Why didn't you tell us?

541
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,364
- Oh, I-I don't know.
- That was so good.

542
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:54,362
- Uh-huh.
- If I didn't know you,

543
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,238
- I'd be all like, "that chick is cool."
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,948
Hey, guys, hi. I'm Alex's mom.

545
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,982
You were terrific.

546
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,144
Hey, and I'm her sister.

547
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,330
We're gonna go get some dinner.

548
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:06,455
Do you wanna come with us?

549
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,046
You can bring
your friends from the band.

550
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,622
Um, no, thanks.
We're actually going out,

551
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,892
and I have a ride home,
so see you guys later.

552
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,484
- Okay.
- Oh.

553
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,654
Oh, my God. Sorry about that.

554
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:17,974
Did she just apologize for us?

555
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:20,207
- Yep.
- But we were just being nice.

556
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,284
Sucks, doesn't it?

557
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,649
Luke, I'm sorry Simone's mom
dragged her away so fast.

558
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,903
It's okay. I was running
out of things to say.

559
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,527
Guess I kind of blew it
for you, didn't I?

560
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:33,810
No. Now that her mom
doesn't want her

561
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:35,067
going out with me anymore,

562
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,034
Simone wants me more than ever.

563
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,074
I guess she's heading
into a rebellious stage.

564
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:40,629
Best time to get 'em.

565
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,221
Never be afraid to go after
a girl who's out of your league.

566
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:44,912
I did.
That's how I got your mom.

567
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:47,496
Yeah, I always wondered
how you pulled that one off.

568
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,952
She was in a rebellious stage, too.

569
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,930
Yep, grandpa wasn't always
as crazy about me as he is now.

570
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:04,702
I'm gonna go pop the champagne
and get some glasses.

571
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:06,003
- Yay!
- I'll help.

572
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:07,829
I'm gonna get Cranium.

573
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

574
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,482
Sorry you couldn't come
to the wedding.

575
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,891
It was no kids.

576
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:20,069
It's okay.
I'll go to your next one.

577
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:22,256
Wow.

578
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,682
Yeah.
She-- she just means when

579
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,553
she's not a kid anymore,
you know?

580
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,583
She knows what I mean.

581
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,074
I don't like you.

582
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll get over it.

583
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:42,059
