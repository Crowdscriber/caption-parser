1
00:00:00,362 --> 00:00:02,227
Previously on Hannibal.

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,356
Abigail Hobbs killed Nick Boyle.
We can tell no one.

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,074
I'm worried about you, Will.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,977
You empathize so completely
with the killers Jack Crawford

5
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:15,114
has your mind wrapped around
that you lose yourself to them.

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,750
Maybe I should
get a brain scan.

7
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,171
- Do you feel unstable?
- Is there a problem, Will?

8
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:23,239
- You lost time.
- There's something wrong

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,275
with me.
I'm your friend, Will.

10
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,460
I don't care about the lives you
save; I care about your life,

11
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,496
and your life is separating
from reality.

12
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,986
(Car alarm chirps.)

13
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,776
(wood creaking)

14
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,578
(She whistles.)

15
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,080
(Bird whistles.)

16
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:22,748
(She whistles.)

17
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,267
(Bird whistles.)

18
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,509
(thud)

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,978
(water dripping)

20
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,737
(She sighs.)

21
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,772
(water dripping)

22
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,800
(draft howling)

23
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,790
(She sighs.)

24
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:37,150
(water dripping)

25
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,266
(She gasps and screams.)

26
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,920
(stabbing) (screaming)

27
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,439
<i>I can feel my nerves</i>

28
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:19,575
clicking like, uh,
roller coaster cogs,

29
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,413
pulling up to the inevitable
long plunge.

30
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,348
Quick sounds, quickly ended.

31
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:28,951
Abigail Hobbs ended
Nicholas Boyle.

32
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:30,636
(Nicholas grunts.)

33
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,588
Like a burst balloon.

34
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,373
(Abigail gasping)

35
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,246
She took a life.

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,415
You've taken a life.

37
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,468
Yeah. Yeah, so have you.

38
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,840
You're grieving, Will.
Not for the life you have taken,

39
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,859
but for the life that was taken
from you.

40
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,395
If Abigail could have
started over, left the horror

41
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,148
of her father behind,
so could have you.

42
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:02,351
You could untangle yourself
from the madness and the murder.

43
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,005
We lied for her.

44
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,992
We both know the unreality
of taking a life.

45
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,862
The people who die
when we have no other choice,

46
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,815
we know in those moments
they are not flesh,

47
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,000
but light,

48
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,570
and air, and color.

49
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:24,040
Isn't that what it is
to be alive?

50
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,159
Do you feel alive, Will?

51
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,760
I...

52
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,329
I feel like I'm fading.

53
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,665
Have you experienced
any further loss of time?

54
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,517
Or hallucinations?

55
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,391
I'd like you to draw
a clock face.

56
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,727
Numbered.

57
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,447
Large hand indicating the hour,
small hand the minute.

58
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,366
Why?

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,069
An exercise. I want you

60
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,706
to focus on the present moment.
The now. Often as you can,

61
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,024
think of where you are,
and when.

62
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,043
Think of who you are.

63
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,699
Seven sixteen PM.

64
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,552
I'm in Baltimore, Maryland.

65
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,225
And my name is Will Graham.

66
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,544
A simple reminder.

67
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:22,598
The handle to reality
for you to hold on to.

68
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,984
And know you're alive.

69

(Will panting)

73
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,325
What happened in there?

74
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,328
- I got confused.
- I've seen you confused

75
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:53,081
and I've seen you upset, but I've
never seen you afraid like this.

76
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,534
Well, I'm an old hand at fear.
I can manage this one.

77
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,703
I just got disoriented.
I can go back in.

78
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,055
I saw the look on your face
when you came out of that room.

79
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,259
Now, what did you experience
in there that's got you mute

80
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,261
all of a sudden?
I can see

81
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,264
and hear better afraid.
I-I just can't...

82
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,016
...speak as concisely.
Will, you

83
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,386
contaminated the crime scene.
You've never done that before.

84
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,974
I thought I was responsible
for it.

85
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,094
What are you saying? You thought
that you killed that woman in there?

86
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:26,364
- Sometimes with, uh, what I do...
- What you do

87
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:30,118
is you take all of the evidence
available at a crime scene.

88
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,987
You extrapolate.
You reconstruct

89
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:35,323
the thinking of a killer.

90
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,795
You don't think of yourself
as the killer.

91
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,916
I got lost
in the reconstruction.

92
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,001
Just for a second. Just a blink.

93
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:50,088
I know you don't like to be
the cause for concern, but I am

94
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,674
officially concerned about you.
Officially?

95
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,094
- Yes, that's right.
- Hm.

96
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,565
I thought the reason
you had me seeing.

97
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,568
Dr. Lecter and not an FBI
psychiatrist is

98
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,855
so my mental well-being stays...

99
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,857
unofficial.

100
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,692
I just want
to be careful with you.

101
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,944
We don't want
to break you here.

102
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:16,331
Is that what's happening?
Have I broken you?

103
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,033
Do you have anyone

104
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:23,254
that does this better unbroken
than I do broken?

105
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,426
Fear makes you rude, Will.

106
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:33,514
(camera click)

107
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:38,186
She drowned on her own blood.

108
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,439
And what she didn't drown on
is all over the floor

109
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:44,609
and under the bed.
She was trying to hide from him.

110
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,312
He dragged her there. He was
waiting under the bed for her.

111
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,114
Fought to claw her way out.

112
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,234
He knew her.
Someone who cared about her,

113
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,371
or thought he did.
(Bev): He cared too much.

114
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,573
So, we're looking
for boyfriends, ex-boyfriends,

115
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,208
coworkers,

116
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,360
the guy who bags her groceries.
I've got a clean

117
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,296
set of prints on the knife
handle. I assume they're yours.

118
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,633
- Sorry.
- Mm.

119
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,552
There's other dermal tissue,
presumably from the killer's,

120
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,806
but the skin is so diseased
or damaged it didn't leave

121
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,559
any useful prints. The victim scratched
her killer deep enough to pile

122
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,729
tissue under the fingernails,
but never drew blood.

123
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,048
Why didn't he bleed?

124
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,734
After he cut up
the victim's face,

125
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,605
it looks like he was trying
to pull her skin back.

126
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,824
Like he was removing a mask?

127
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,263
<i>I still have the...</i>

128
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,000
coppery smell of blood
on my hands.

129
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,952
I can't remember seeing

130
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,838
the crime scene before I saw
myself killing her.

131
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,490
Those memories sank
out of sight,

132
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,459
yet you're aware
of their absence.

133
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:55,797
There's a grandiosity
to the violence that I imagined

134
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,800
that feels more real
than what I know is true.

135
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,519
What do you know to be true?

136
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:04,555
I know I didn't kill her.
I couldn't have.

137
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:09,027
But I remember cutting into her.
I remember watching her die.

138
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,114
You must overcome these delusions
that are disguising your reality.

139
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,437
What kind of savage delusions
does this killer have?

140
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,606
It wasn't savage.
It was lonely.

141
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,942
It was desperate. Sad.

142
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,997
I caught a glimpse of myself
in the mirror,

143
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:32,583
and I looked right through me,

144
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:36,721
past me, as if I was a...
was just a stranger.

145
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,624
You have to honestly confront
your limitations

146
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,960
with what you do.
(Will sighs.)

147
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,179
And how it affects you.
If by limitations

148
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,517
you mean the difference between sanity
and insanity, I don't accept that.

149
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,070
- What do you accept?
- I know

150
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,323
what kind of crazy I am, and
this isn't that kind of crazy.

151
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,176
This could be... seizures.

152
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,162
This could be a tumor.

153
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:04,648
A... a blood clot.

154
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,285
I can recommend a neurologist.

155
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,790
But if it isn't physiological,
then you have to accept

156
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:15,960
what you're struggling with
is mental illness.

157
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,472
You're in very good hands.

158
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,438
Dr. Lecter here is

159
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:35,824
- one of the sanest men I know.
- I would agree.

160
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:39,394
Dr. Sutcliffe and I were
residents together at Hopkins.

161
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,829
Another life ago,

162
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,499
back when you weren't afraid to
get your hands a little dirty.

163
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,667
I was always drawn
to how the mind works.

164
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,370
I found it much more dynamic
than how the brain works.

165
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:52,491
The projected image is more
interesting than the projector,

166
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:56,628
until, of course,
the projector breaks down.

167
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:59,631
So, Will, these headaches.

168
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:03,018
When did they begin in earnest?

169
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,104
Two to three months ago.

170
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,272
About the time Will went back

171
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:09,424
into the field,
which is when I met him.

172
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:12,111
And the hallucinations?

173
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:15,597
I can't really say
when they started.

174
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,599
Um...

175
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:21,203
I just slowly became aware
that I might not be dreaming.

176
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,059
(Lecter): It's encephalitis.

177
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,295
- That's your pre-diagnosis?
- Yes.

178
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,847
Based on...?

179
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:51,817
I could smell it.

180
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:55,237
So your sense of smell has gone
from calling out a nurse's perfume

181
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,990
to diagnosing
autoimmune disease.

182
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:02,861
He started sleepwalking and
I noticed a very specific scent.

183
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:06,331
And what exactly does
encephalitis smell like?

184
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,617
It has heat.

185
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:10,652
A fevered sweetness.

186
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,708
If you suspected,
why didn't you

187
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,012
say something?
Had to be sure.

188
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:22,464
Symptoms began slowly

189
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,651
and gradually worsened.
And yesterday,

190
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:27,686
I asked him to draw a clock.

191
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,690
This is what he drew.

192
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,228
Oh. Spatial neglect.

193
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:38,730
Headaches, disorientation,

194
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,033
hallucinations,
altered consciousness.

195
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,902
It's all the telltale signs.
Hm.

196
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:47,406
It is so rare to be able to
study the psychological effect

197
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:50,692
of this type of malady
on a person's mind.

198
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,078
It's more rare still

199
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:56,932
to be able to study
the neurological effects.

200
00:15:56,966 --> 00:16:00,552
A doctor has to weigh the ultimate
benefit of scientific study.

201
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:04,590
Even in these times, we know
so little about the brain.

202
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,142
There are great discoveries
to be made.

203
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:23,625
(loud mechanical whirring)

204
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,606
(woman screaming)

205
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:12,440
The right side of his brain is
completely inflamed.

206
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,294
It's anti-NMDA receptor
encephalitis.

207
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,296
The symptoms are only going
to get worse.

208
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,814
I know.

209
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,799
It's unfortunate for Will.

210
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:24,803
What do you smell on me?

211
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,473
Opportunity.

212
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,701
We didn't find anything
abnormal.

213
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:41,553
No vascular malformations,

214
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,071
no tumors,

215
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,140
no swelling or bleeding,
no evidence of stroke.

216
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:46,858
Nothing.

217
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,411
There's nothing wrong with you
neurologically.

218
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:54,366
So what I'm experiencing is
psychological.

219
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:58,754
Well... brain scans can't

220
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,673
diagnose, uh, mental disorders.

221
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,426
They can only rule out
medical illnesses

222
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,295
like a tumor, which can have
similar symptoms.

223
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,600
Look, we'll run

224
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:13,101
some more tests.

225
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:16,188
We'll take some more
blood samples, but I imagine

226
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:19,725
they'll prove to be
just as inconclusive.

227
00:18:24,113 --> 00:18:26,347
You knew from the moment

228
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,367
you walked into his classroom
that you were putting him

229
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,685
in a potentially destructive
environment.

230
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:35,674
I had eight college girls dead in Minnesota.
Will caught their killer for me.

231
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,077
He also caught
their killer's disease.

232
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,963
He can't stop thinking
about what it is to take a life.

233
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:44,383
I'd rather he go a little mad
than other innocents lose

234
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,435
their lives, and I think
he would feel the same way.

235
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,254
Will is an innocent.

236
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:51,256
(Jack sighs.)

237
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:53,258
Yes. He is.

238
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:55,761
I mean, Will is genuine.

239
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,764
He'll survive anything
I could put him through.

240
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,549
He will always fight his way
back to himself.

241
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,836
Not always. So far.

242
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:09,390
He saw

243
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,427
a neurologist today. They found
nothing wrong with him.

244
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,429
He was very upset by that.

245
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:17,249
You're saying he wanted
something to be wrong?

246
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:20,669
I think he wanted an answer
that wasn't mental illness.

247
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,772
You think he's mentally ill.

248
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:28,126
The problem Will has is
too many mirror neurons.

249
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:31,179
Our heads are filled with them
when we are children...

250
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:34,099
supposed to help us socialize
and then melt away.

251
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,551
But Will held on to his,

252
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,004
which makes knowing who he is
a challenge.

253
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,823
When you take him
to a crime scene, Jack,

254
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:45,811
the very air has screams
smeared on it.

255
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:49,297
In those places,
he doesn't just reflect;

256
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:51,316
He absorbs.

257
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:25,193
It's 10:36.

258
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:29,047
I'm in Greenwood, Delaware.

259
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,833
My name is Will Graham.

260
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,819
(flesh tearing)
(woman crying out)

261
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,904
(Will panting)

262
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:09,170
It's 1:17 AM.

263
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,756
W-We're in Greenwood, Delaware.

264
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,259
And my name is Will Graham.

265
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,428
And you're alive.

266
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:18,847
If you can hear me,

267
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,466
you're alive!

268
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,043
Why did you call me?

269
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,261
Why not Jack?
Why not the police?

270
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,414
I called you because...

271
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:53,118
I'm not entirely sure
what I saw was real.

272
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,375
Then let's prove it.

273
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,127
I grabbed her arm...

274
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,678
(flesh tearing)

275
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,997
And an entire layer
of dead skin separated

276
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:08,667
from the underlying tissue,
like she was wearing a glove.

277
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:12,454
- That's why she doesn't bleed.
- Right. There's no circulation.

278
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:15,640
And there's nothing alive in the tissue to bind it.
What did you do with it?

279
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,314
I don't know.

280
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,304
Could be
a staphylococcal infection.

281
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:32,023
That, or leprosy.
Her eyes were discolored.

282
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:34,309
She was, uh, malnourished,
jaundiced.

283
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:37,696
Her liver was shutting down.
She was...

284
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,748
deranged.

285
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:45,504
So she mutilated a woman's face
because she thought it was a mask.

286
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:51,076
She can't see faces.

287
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,328
If she did kill

288
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,730
Beth LeBeau, she might
not even know she did it.

289
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:59,167
Then why did she come back?

290
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:04,139
- To convince herself she didn't.
- Is that why you came back?

291
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:10,562
If I wasn't clear
on that issue,

292
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:14,433
I know I didn't kill
Beth LeBeau.

293
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,501
I just want to know who did.

294
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:19,171
Me too.

295
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,072
Yeah.

296
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:25,794
You're the subject of a lot
of speculation at the bureau.

297
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:27,963
Oh, yeah?
What are they speculating?

298
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:29,798
That Jack pushed you

299
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:33,084
right up to the edge, and now
you're pushing yourself over.

300
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:41,226
This killer...

301
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,261
can't accept her reality.

302
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,435
I can occasionally identify
with that.

303
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:55,740
That said, I feel...

304
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:58,160
relatively sane.

305
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:11,239
It's 7:05 PM.

306
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:14,125
I'm in Baltimore, Maryland.

307
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:17,596
My name is Will Graham.

308
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,798
Thank you for humoring me.

309
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,255
I feel like I'm seeing a ghost.

310
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:30,592
- Regarding this killer, or yourself?
- Both.

311
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,862
Well, she's real. You know
she's real. There's evidence.

312
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:36,264
When you found her,

313
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:39,150
your sanity did not leave you.

314
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:43,455
- Time did.
- You lost time again?

315
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,913
I spoke to Dr. Sutcliffe.

316
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:54,132
We briefly discussed
the particulars of your visit.

317
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,134
Would you like to discuss them
with me?

318
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:59,221
There are no particulars.
He didn't find anything wrong.

319
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:01,789
Then we keep looking
for answers.

320
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:05,293
Perhaps you would permit me
to run some tests of my own.

321
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:09,731
You wouldn't publish anything
about me, would you,

322
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:11,733
Dr. Lecter?

323
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:15,604
If there were ever anything that might
be of therapeutic value to others,

324
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:19,157
I'd abstract it in a form that
would be totally unrecognizable.

325
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:23,662
Just do me a favor
and publish it posthumously.

326
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:26,197
After your death or mine?

327
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:28,950
Whichever comes first.

328
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,543
Have you considered
Cotard's Syndrome?

329
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:40,679
It's a rare delusional disorder

330
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:43,348
in which a person believes
he or she is dead.

331
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:45,667
Are you talking
about the killer or me?

332
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,603
- The killer, of course.
- Well, of course. Um,

333
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,389
she couldn't
see the victim's face.

334
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,392
Or she was trying
to uncover it.

335
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:58,897
The inability to identify others
is associated with Cotard.

336
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:01,066
It's a misfiring
in the areas of the brain

337
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,452
which recognize faces,
and also in the amygdala,

338
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,854
which adds emotion
to those recognitions.

339
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:11,359
Even those closest to her would
seem like imposters.

340
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:13,578
So she... she reached out
to someone she loved,

341
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,747
someone she trusted.

342
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:19,034
She felt betrayed,
became violent.

343
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:22,754
She can't trust anything or anyone
she once knew to be trustworthy.

344
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:25,991
Her mental illness won't
let her.

345
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:39,020
(breathing unsteadily)

346
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:50,749
(breathing unsteadily)

347
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,922
(breathing unsteadily)

348
00:28:06,265 --> 00:28:08,266
(breathing unsteadily)

349
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,616
We matched the tissue samples
from the crime scene

350
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,979
to your daughter's
***.

351
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,918
***

352
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,270
I thought that you had found her
and she was, um...

353
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,173
would be at peace.

354
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,692
You thought she might be dead?
(She giggles.)

355
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:34,445
Well, that makes me sound
like a horrible mother.

356
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,764
I tried to be a good mom.

357
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,783
I tried to do everything
that I could.

358
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,852
I just don't want her to be in pain.
No one's doubting

359
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,455
your dedication
to your daughter, Mrs. Madchen.

360
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,191
How well did she know
Beth LeBeau?

361
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:51,879
They were best friends.
They went to school together,

362
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:55,549
um, until it was unsafe
for Georgia to go to school.

363
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:59,536
When did you first recognize
that your daughter was

364
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:01,622
struggling with mental illness?

365
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,310
When she was nine
and she told me that she was

366
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,312
thinking about killing me

367
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,548
and said that she was
already dead.

368
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,652
What sort of symptoms
did she have?

369
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,905
She had seizures,
hallucinations,

370
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:21,058
psychotic depression.

371
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:23,277
I was grateful
when she was catatonic.

372
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,747
(awkward laugh)
(Jack): Was she ever violent?

373
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,382
Sometimes.

374
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:31,168
What did her doctor say?

375
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:34,004
Not much.

376
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,508
She spent months at a time
in the hospital.

377
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,094
Blood tests and brain scans,

378
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:43,413
and all of them inconclusive.
They could

379
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:46,250
never tell me what was wrong.

380
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:49,186
And you still don't know?

381
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,861
They would just say
it was this or it was that.

382
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,562
You know, they were just...

383
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,599
...they were just always
guessing.

384
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:05,769
And I did my own research.

385
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:08,973
I wrote down every word
that the doctors said,

386
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,509
the different terminology.
Learned a lot.

387
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:15,796
But mostly what I learned is,

388
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:21,936
um, how little is actually known
about mental illness.

389
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,173
All they know, it's rarely
about finding solutions.

390
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:31,178
It's just more
about managing expectations.

391
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,668
Managing your expectations?

392
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:57,254
Changing my expectations.

393
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:01,425
You know,
when Miriam Lass died,

394
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,678
I had to come back here
to this office to pack up,

395
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:06,380
but...

396
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,550
that got to be too overwhelming.
I thought I should just leave,

397
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,269
seeing as how I had gotten
a trainee killed.

398
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:16,673
That lack of leadership on my
part, that was my responsibility.

399
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,743
You didn't kill Miriam Lass;
The Chesapeake Ripper did.

400
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:23,397
It didn't feel that way to me.
I pulled her out of a classroom,

401
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,416
like I pulled you
out of a classroom.

402
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,119
She was a student;
I am a teacher.

403
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,688
I'm still just as responsible
for you as I was for her.

404
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,858
- I'll take my own responsibility.
- Well, not from me you won't.

405
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,745
We can do it together.
I broke the rules

406
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:40,414
with Miriam. I encouraged her
to break the rules.

407
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,417
I am breaking the rules with you now.
By letting

408
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,870
an unstable agent do field work?
Special agent. Oh.

409
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:49,290
That means you represent
the FBI. You still represent me.

410
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,392
Have I misrepresented you,
Jack?

411
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,394
No, no.
But you have me curious.

412
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:56,347
Why are you still here
when the both of us know

413
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,399
that this is bad for you?

414
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,901
- Do you want me to quit?
- No.

415
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:03,437
No, you had an opportunity
to quit.

416
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,940
You didn't take it.
Why not?

417
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:09,109
Let me tell you what I think.
I think that the work

418
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,763
you do here has created a sense
of stability for you.

419
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,999
Stability is good
for you, Will.

420
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,201
Stability requires
strong foundations, Jack.

421
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,837
My moorings are built on sand.
I'm not sand.

422
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,624
I am bedrock.

423
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,793
When you doubt yourself,

424
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,879
you don't have to doubt me too.

425
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:35,135
<i>(Goldberg Variations:</i>
<i>Variation 13, by JS Bach)</i>

426
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,304
<i>The Jamon Ibérico.</i>

427
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,690
Still love your little rare
treats, don't you, Hannibal?

428
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,643
The more expensive and difficult
they are to obtain, the better.

429
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,530
It's a distinction that adds
an expectation of quality.

430
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,782
- Not always.
- Well, for Ibérico,

431
00:32:48,817 --> 00:32:52,436
only a few thousand are selected
each year.

432
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:55,205
But is the pig,

433
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,826
once fattened and slaughtered
and air-cured,

434
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,611
really superior
to any other pig?

435
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,798
Or is it simply a matter of

436
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,667
reputation preceding product?

437
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,503
It's irrelevant.

438
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,222
If the meat-eater thinks
it's superior,

439
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,725
then belief determines value.

440
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,981
- A case of psychology overriding neurology.
- So, we know

441
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:23,467
how Ibérico gets his pigs.

442
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,652
How did you get yours?

443
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,640
Are you referring
to Will Graham?

444
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:34,311
We know you're fond
of the rarified.

445
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,747
What makes him so rare?

446
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:45,506
Will has a remarkably vivid
imagination.

447
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,157
Beautiful.

448
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,826
Pure empathy.

449
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:54,181
Nothing he can't understand,
and that terrifies him.

450
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,768
So you set his mind on fire.

451
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:02,356
Imagination is an interesting
accelerant for a fever.

452
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:11,014
So... how far does this go?

453
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:13,033
Do you put out the fire,

454
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:16,220
or do you let him burn?

455
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,124
Will is my friend.

456
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,393
We will put out the fire
when it's necessary.

457
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,330
He has asked for more tests.

458
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,585
Now that we have confirmed
what it is,

459
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,754
it'll be easier to hide
from him.

460
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:43,764
You put these in.

461
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,940
This'll be over
before you know it.

462
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,491
(mechanical knocking)

463
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,460
Dr. Sutcliffe?

464
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:57,472
You're clean.

465
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:59,694
You couldn't have done this
without getting something

466
00:36:59,728 --> 00:37:03,197
on you, and there's nothing
on you.

467
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:06,050
I don't feel clean.

468
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:10,454
The murder weapon has the same sort of
diseased or damaged tissues that we found

469
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:13,240
at Beth LeBeau's house.
What's this guy got to do

470
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:15,242
with the other victim?
(Will clears his throat.)

471
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,961
Just me.

472
00:37:17,012 --> 00:37:18,629
What do you remember?

473
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,799
I remember coming here,

474
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,151
going into the MRI,
getting out,

475
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:27,421
and, uh, finding
Dr. Sutcliffe's body.

476
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:31,859
- No confusion?
- Well, not that I'm aware of.

477
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:36,096
Was your Dr. Sutcliffe
in the habit

478
00:37:36,114 --> 00:37:40,484
of seeing patients after-hours when
he's the only one in the office?

479
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:42,954
He was very accommodating.

480
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:46,540
Georgia Madchen
followed you here,

481
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:49,710
and while you're ticking away
in the MRI,

482
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,996
she does this to your doctor.

483
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:55,466
Why him?
She can't see faces.

484
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,969
Maybe she thought he was me.

485
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:01,505
All right, while we're at it,
why you?

486
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,507
I don't know.

487
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:06,510
I have a habit
of collecting strays.

488
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:09,180
I-I-I told her, tried
to tell her the night I saw her,

489
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:12,433
I tried to tell her she was
alive. Maybe she heard me.

490
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:19,824
Maybe that hadn't occurred
to her in a while.

491
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,301
(dog growling)

492
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:32,703
(dog growling)

493
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:37,324
(growling)

494
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:39,093
(bark)

495
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:43,848
(dog growling)

496
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:04,368
I see you, Georgia.

497
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,807
Think of who you are.

498
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:16,864
It's midnight.

499
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:19,617
You're in Wolf Trap, Virginia.

500
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:22,286
Your name is Georgia Madchen.

501
00:39:25,273 --> 00:39:27,224
You're not alone.

502
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:29,760
We are here together.

503
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:35,132
Am I alive?

504
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:16,690
(Jack):<i>She'll recover?</i>

505
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:20,978
(Lecter):<i>Risk of infection is high.
She's lost most of her vital fluids.</i>

506
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:23,197
Even some bone mass. She's being

507
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:26,099
treated like a burn victim.

508
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:28,268
But she'll recover mentally?

509
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:31,255
She has Cotard's Syndrome.
Almost all sufferers

510
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,290
of this delusion recover
with treatment...

511
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:37,995
in extreme cases like this one,
electroconvulsive therapy.

512
00:40:38,046 --> 00:40:39,997
I'm more concerned about Will.

513
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:44,768
I thought you'd be more concerned
about your colleague, Dr. Sutcliffe.

514
00:40:44,803 --> 00:40:47,221
I am grieving Dr. Sutcliffe,

515
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:50,307
but Will is very much alive.

516
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:53,978
He's still desperate for an explanation
that can make everything right again.

517
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:58,098
I'm, uh, pretty desperate
for some explanations myself.

518
00:40:58,132 --> 00:41:01,301
I really want to talk to this
young woman when she comes to.

519
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,805
How much do you think
she'll remember?

520
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:08,526
Well, I sincerely hope, for her
sake, she doesn't remember much.
