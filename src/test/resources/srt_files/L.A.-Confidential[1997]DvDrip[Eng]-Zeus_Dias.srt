1
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:18,066



2
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:21,529
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! ;-)

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,477
Come to Los Angeles.

4
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,587
The sun shines bright.

5
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,822
The beaches are wide and inviting.

6
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:34,697
And the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see.

7
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:38,667
There are jobs aplenty. Land is cheap.

8
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,094
Every workingman can have his own house.

9
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:45,486
And inside every house,
a happy all-American family.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,009
You can have all this.
And who knows?

11
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,694
You could even be discovered...

12
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:54,022
...become a movie star,
or at least see one.

13
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:56,583
Life is good in Los Angeles.

14
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,470
lt�s paradise on earth.

15
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:03,210
That�s what they tell you, anyway.

16
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,224
Because they�re selling an image.

17
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,878
They�re selling it through movies,
radio and television.

18
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,839
ln the hit show, Badge of Honor,
the L.A. cops walk on water...

19
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,863
...as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

20
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,728
You�d think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,684
But there�s trouble in paradise...

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,576
...and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C, to his fans.

23
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,367
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.

24
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:30,697
And his number one bodyguard...

25
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:32,615
...Johnny Stompanato.

26
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:35,502
Mickey C�s the head
of organized crime in these parts.

27
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:38,888
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.

28
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:40,777
He kills a dozen people a year.

29
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:43,817
And the dapper little gent
does it in style.

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,021
And every time his picture�s
on the front page...

31
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,128
...it�s a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.

32
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:52,909
Because how can organized crime exist...

33
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,113
...in the city with the best
police force in the world?

34
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:57,839
Something has to be done.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,004
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

36
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:04,169
what worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

37
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,030
Mr. Cohen, you�re under arrest.

38
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,466
Nonpayment of federal income tax.

39
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,317
But all is not well.

40
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,522
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.

41
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,412
And it�s only a matter of time...

42
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:18,066
...before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it.

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,245
...you heard it here first...

44
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:25,873
...off the record...

45
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,203
...on the Q.T...

46
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,093
...and very...

47
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,145
...Hush-Hush."

48
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:51,691
You�re like Santa Claus with that list.

49
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:54,127
Except everyone on it�s been naughty.

50
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,839
Guy�s been out of Q two weeks.

51
00:02:58,961 --> 00:02:59,987
Leave it for later.

52
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,181
we�ve got to pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

53
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,219
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

54
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:11,247
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

55
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,191
Parole violation:
assault arising from a family dispute.

56
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:16,013
we won�t be here.
They�ll see him.

57
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:26,419
Quit whining!

58
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,750
Quit whining all the time!
lt makes me sick!

59
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,064
Shut up!

60
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,936
Who the hell are you?

61
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,209
The ghost of Christmas past.

62
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,511
Dance with a man for a change?

63
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:52,180
What are you, some kind of smart ass?

64
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,998
You'll be out in a year and a half.

65
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,395
l�ll get cozy with your parole officer.

66
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:13,491
You touch her again, l�ll have you
violated on a kiddie raper beef.

67
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,586
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.

68
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,174
You have someplace you can go?

69
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,253
Go get yourself fixed up.

70
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,170
Merry Christmas, huh.

71
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:40,143
-Merry Christmas, ma�am.
-Let�s go, Bud.

72
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:41,620
The guys�ll be waiting.

73
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,989
What do you do on Badge of Honor, Jack?

74
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,703
l�m the technical advisor.

75
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:54,136
l teach Brett Chase
how to walk and talk like a cop.

76
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:56,822
Brett Chase doesn�t
walk and talk like you.

77
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,191
That�s because he�s
the television version.

78
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,780
America isn�t ready for the real me.

79
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:04,629
ls it true you�re the one
who arrested Bob Mitchum?

80
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:07,122
These Badge of Honor guys like to pretend.

81
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:09,683
But being the real thing
must be a thrill.

82
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:13,941
Why don�t you and I go someplace quiet?
Because l�d love to give you the lowdown on Mitchum.

83
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,435
Big V. Jack Vincennes.

84
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,516
-May l have this dance?
-Of course.

85
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,885
This is Sid Hudgens
with Hush-Hush magazine.

86
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:23,446
-Hello, Karen.
-Hello yourself.

87
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,035
What�s that about?

88
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,651
We did a piece, "lngenue Dykes in
Hollywood." Her name got mentioned.

89
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,416
Hey Jackie-boy...

90
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:34,389
...a friend just sold some reefer
to Matt Reynolds.

91
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:37,554
He�s tripping the light fantastic
with Tammy Jordan.

92
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,853
Sorry, l lost you for a second, Sid.

93
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:45,303
Contract players, Metro. You pinch
them, l do a nice feature next issue.

94
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,825
-Plus the usual $50 cash.
-No, l need another $50.

95
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:51,316
Two $20�s for two patrolmen, a dime for
the  watch commander at the Hollywood Station.

96
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:52,726
Jackie, it�s Christmas.

97
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:55,220
No, it�s not.

98
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,493
lt�s felony possession of marijuana.

99
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:02,259
Actually, it�s circulation 36,000
and climbing.

100
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,271
There�s no telling where this is gonna go.
Radio, television.

101
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:09,241
Once you whet the public�s appetite
for the truth, the sky�s the limit.

102
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,010
Sergeant Ed Exley,
son of the legendary Preston Exley.

103
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:18,803
Must be a hard act to follow.

104
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:23,417
Why not make a mark somewhere else?
Why become a cop, ed?

105
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,555
l like to help people.

106
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,279
We heard 2 officers
were assaulted this evening.

107
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,128
-What do you think about that?
-Goes with the job.

108
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,180
But l took the report.
Luckily, they�re okay.

109
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:35,223
Aren�t you a little young
to be watch commander?

110
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:36,374
lt�s only for tonight.

111
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,222
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

112
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:41,236
That�s a good lead for the story.

113
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,934
Merry Christmas, Captain.

114
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:45,907
-Captain Smith.
-Drop the formalities, Bobby.

115
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,657
-lt�s Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
-l came up with a title for the story.

116
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,534
l�m calling it
"Silent Night with the LAPD".

117
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,165
Oh that�s grand.

118
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,956
Now remember, Bobby, that�s "Smith"

119
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:57,943
with an "S".

120
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,557
Thank you, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas.

121
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,053
Hold on there, lads.

122
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,474
Merry Christmas.

123
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,749
l saw the test results
on the lieutenant�s exam.

124
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,638
First out of 23.

125
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,077
What�ll it be, then?

126
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,542
Patrol Division?
lnternal Affairs? What?

127
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,335
l was thinking
Detective Bureau.

128
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:26,716
Edmund...

129
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,634
...you�re a political animal.

130
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:31,770
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.

131
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,069
You�re wrong, sir.

132
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,838
Would you be willing to plant corrobarative evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

133
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,766
...in order to insure an indictment?

134
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,001
-Dudley, we�ve been over this.
-Yes or no?

135
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:44,056
No.

136
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:48,151
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?

137
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,230
Would you be willing to shoot
a hardened criminal in the back...

138
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:54,462
...in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer..
- No.

139
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,668
Then for the love of God...

140
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,519
...don�t be a detective.

141
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,309
Stick to the assignments work where you don�t have
to make those kind of choices.

142
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:03,736
Dudley, l know you mean well...

143
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:07,582
...but l don�t need to do it
the way you did...or my father.

144
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,651
At least get rid of the glasses.

145
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,595
l can�t think of a single man
on the Bureau who wears them.

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,414
lf l ever get held up,
you guys better be here.

147
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,223
Hi, Nick.

148
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,825
l need a delivery.

149
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:35,548
A case each of gin, rum, scotch.

150
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,234
That sounds like a hell of a party.
I'll be right with you.

151
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,435
Merry Christmas.

152
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,050
Merry Christmas to you, officer.

153
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:04,666
That obvious, huh?

154
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,649
lt�s practically
stamped on your forehead.

155
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:09,692
There you go.

156
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:43,202
See what he wants, Buzz.

157
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:49,982
Hey.. Get lost, why don�t you?

158
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:59,074
Down!
Get your fucking head down.

159
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,993
l got a license for that.

160
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,430
Cut me some slack.

161
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,773
l used to be a cop.

162
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,950
"Leland Meeks"
Never heard of you.

163
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,648
They call me Buzz.

164
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:15,868
l don�t give a rat�s ass what
they call you. Now keep your head down.

165
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,796
And stay there.. Buzz.

166
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:21,920
You okay?

167
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,358
She�s fine.

168
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:25,056
l�m not asking you, sir.

169
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,067
Somebody hit you?

170
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,081
lt�s not what you think.

171
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:34,436
What is it, then?

172
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,996
You got the wrong idea, mister.
l�m fine.

173
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,516
But it�s nice to know you care.

174
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,155
Drive safely.

175
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,099
What�s going on?

176
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:57,991
You know him?

177
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,072
Yeah, l�ve seen him around.

178
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:03,400
He used to be a cop.

179
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:12,684
They�re sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.

180
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,765
Put your camera right there.

181
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:19,177
When l walk out, l�ll stop right here. You
get the movie premiere in the background.

182
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:22,121
l like it. l like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

183
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:25,257
When l walk out, l don�t want
those goddamn floodlights in my eyes.

184
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,885
Hey V, Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

185
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,199
Come on.

186
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,311
Get down.

187
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:34,992
Go! Pop them!

188
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:40,497
Freeze! Police!

189
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:42,511
Jesus Christ!

190
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,937
Come on.
Come on, let�s go.

191
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,280
My family�s coming in--

192
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:49,608
-lt�ll be a nice Christmas gift.
-Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

193
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,826
Right over here.

194
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:52,974
-Just turn.
-Hold it. Got it!

195
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:57,866
-The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
-Take care of 'em. Write down the Hollywood Station. l�ll get the evidence.

196
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:12,041
"lt�s Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels...

197
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:15,340
...and while decent citizens
sleep the sleep of the righteous...

198
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:17,872
...hopheads prowl for marijuana...

199
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:21,258
...not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

200
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,816
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.

201
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:29,199
Scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere."

202
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:30,829
You like it Jackie-boy?

203
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:34,637
Yeah, subtle.

204
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:36,977
What took you?

205
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,113
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.

206
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:42,252
This guy's priorities are all screwed up.

207
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:44,717
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?

208
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:49,934
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

209
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,727
-How are you?
-Why are you here?

210
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,837
You know me.
I'm keeping the streets safe, boys.

211
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,369
Alright take these two,
get them dressed and book them.

212
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:59,218
-The party�s upstairs.
-Okay, l�ll be right up.

213
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,094
What�s that for?

214
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,655
Well you are watch commander tonight,
aren�t you?

215
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:09,748
Yeah. So?

216
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,571
Well it's a gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.

217
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:13,393
You know.. buy yourself some new loafers.

218
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:15,982
No thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.

219
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:17,843
l�m not interested.

220
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,925
What the hell is this?

221
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,402
Six spics.

222
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:31,826
Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.

223
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:34,771
l heard Helenowski bled 6 pints
and Brown�s in a coma.

224
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,689
They're home with bruises
and muscle pulls.

225
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,003
lt�s not what l heard.

226
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:39,441
Let's get these men booked in the lockup.

227
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:44,275
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

228
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:49,809
Helenowski lost an eye, and they�re
reading Brown his last rites.

229
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:54,643
Well that oughta make for a very merry
Christmas for Helenowski and Brown.

230
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,669
Hey, guys.

231
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:56,820
Guys.

232
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:58,901
They brought the Mexicans in.

233
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,491
They�re downstairs.

234
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:06,420
-Let�s do it.
-Come on, guys. Let�s get them.

235
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:10,803
Hey Stensland, the party�s upstairs.

236
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,102
This doesn�t concern you.

237
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,116
Come on, guys.

238
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,488
Haven�t you got work to do?

239
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,802
Go back to the party.

240
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,089
-Come on, it�s Christmas, help me out.
-Move it!

241
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,458
l just got a few more questions.

242
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:27,223
You don�t have to be down here.

243
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,565
Go!

244
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:34,291
You better put a leash on your partner
before he kills somebody.

245
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,221
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!

246
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,328
This is for ours, Poncho.

247
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:45,973
Let me through!

248
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:49,109
No! He didn�t do nothing!

249
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,861
What are you looking at?

250
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:53,942
Tell that Mexican to shut up!

251
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:54,930
Move!

252
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,340
You�re sick!

253
00:14:58,546 --> 00:14:59,505
That�s it!

254
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:03,830
Don�t break it up.

255
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:05,720
Get back! Get back!

256
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:07,571
Yeah, and fuck your mother!

257
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:08,722
Fuck you!

258
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,556
Stop, officer!
That�s an order!

259
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:23,703
You�ll all gonna be in my report!

260
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:44,217
"Bloody Christmas."

261
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,490
The press love to label.

262
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,614
You should know this is bigger
than the police board.

263
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:54,805
The grand jury�s convening.
lndictments may be handed down.

264
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,407
Will you testify?

265
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:57,683
No, sir. l won�t.

266
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,653
District Attorney Loew?

267
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:06,103
You and officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.

268
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,146
Stensland was already drunk.

269
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:11,637
So you see how appearing as a
voluntary witness against him...

270
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:13,690
...could offset the damage
that you've done to yourself.

271
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:16,855
Sir l won�t testify against my partner,
or anyone else.

272
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,444
This man is a disgrace.

273
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,401
Your badge and gun, officer.

274
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:23,252
You�re suspended from duty.

275
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:25,659
Dismissed.

276
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:47,065
Ed, we need police witnesses to offset the
damage done to the Department. I'm asking you..

277
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,297
Justice has to be served.
Of course l�ll testify.

278
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:54,901
l�m glad you feel that way, Edmund.

279
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,186
Most of them don�t.

280
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:58,939
That's because they think silence
 and integrity are the same thing.

281
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,816
Not exactly the image of the...

282
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,185
...new LAPD we�re trying to create.

283
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,225
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

284
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,911
-May l make a suggestion, sir?
-By all means.

285
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:14,236
The public will expect the Department to protect
its own.. to sweep this under the carpet.

286
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,058
Don�t.

287
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:19,386
Shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured.

288
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,180
Force them to retire.

289
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,373
But somebody has to swing.

290
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:27,356
So indict, try and convict...

291
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:29,495
...Richard Stensland and Bud White.

292
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,605
Secure them jail time.

293
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,398
The message will be very clear.

294
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,163
This Department...

295
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,712
...the new LAPD will not tolerate officers
who think they�re above the law.

296
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:42,519
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.

297
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,231
He�s had rotten fitness reports
from every C.O. he�s ever served under.

298
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,763
But Bud White is a valuable officer.

299
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,518
White�s a mindless thug.

300
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,350
No, Edmund...

301
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,378
...He's just a man who  can answer "yes" to those
 questions l�ve asked you from time to time.

302
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,802
The Department and the public
need role models.

303
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:02,967
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

304
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,431
Sergeant...

305
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,513
...l�ll promote you...

306
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,181
...to lieutenant...

307
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:10,908
...effective immediately.

308
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,222
Detective Lieutenant.

309
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,991
Ed, you�re 30.

310
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,712
Your father didn�t make lieutenant
till he was 33.

311
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:23,740
l know that, sir. I also know that when he
made lieutenant, it was as a detective.

312
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,152
Before we start polishing our laurels...

313
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,904
...I think it�d look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

314
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:32,616
That won�t be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

315
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,342
Jack Vincennes.

316
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:36,836
He hit one of the Mexicans.
And he saw the whole thing.

317
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,065
A veteran like Vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability...

318
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,722
...but he�d never rat out
a fellow officer.

319
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:47,271
Jack�s the technical advisor
on Badge of Honor.

320
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:48,748
He lives for it.

321
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:50,666
That�s the way to get to him.

322
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,008
l�d like you to observe, Ed.

323
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:01,062
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

324
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:03,143
Bright kid.

325
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,292
You may well reap the benefit...

326
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,265
...but are truly prepared to be
despised in the Department?

327
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,250
Yes, sir, l am.

328
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,223
So be it.

329
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,385
Well, Sergeant, we�ll get right to it.

330
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:25,835
Nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

331
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:30,573
But we have a stellar witness who will name
names and also testify that you hit back...

332
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,491
...only after being hit.

333
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:35,013
- And?
- And.. You will testify against 3 officers...

334
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:39,790
...who have already earned their pensions and plead
ignorance about the questions directed at the other man.

335
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:42,053
No thanks.
l�m not a snitch.

336
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:45,573
l�ll guarantee you a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension...

337
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:48,968
...followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

338
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,941
You transfer out of Vice,
you�ll be back on the show.

339
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:57,772
The show?

340
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,853
Badge of Honor, Vincennes.

341
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:04,102
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

342
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,538
Jack, l doubt you�ve ever taken
a stupid breath. Don�t start now.

343
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,302
Okay, l�ll do it.

344
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,414
The grand jury will hear...

345
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:19,687
...your testimony tomorrow.
Dismissed, Vincennes.

346
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,424
And so it goes...

347
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,572
...Detective Lieutenant.

348
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,667
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow, son.

349
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,544
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace 'em.

350
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,501
And Ed...

351
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:45,294
...lose the glasses.

352
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,868
So you�re the stellar witness.

353
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,551
l should have known.
What�s the Chief throwing you?

354
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:02,894
Throwing me?

355
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,908
Yeah, Exley, what�s the payoff?

356
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,989
You�re the payoff expert.

357
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:08,399
l�m just doing my duty.

358
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,976
Come on, you�re playing an
angle here, college boy. Right?

359
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:15,275
You�re getting something outta this so
you don�t have to hobnob with the cops...

360
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,136
...who�re gonna hate your guts for snitching.

361
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:19,946
Well if they�re making you detective,
watch out.

362
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:24,463
Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're
gonna end up working with some friends of theirs.

363
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:25,547
What about you?

364
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:30,256
l�m snitching 3 old-timers who�ll be
fishing in Oregon this time next week.

365
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:32,433
Next to you, l�m clean...

366
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:33,872
...and smart.

367
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,490
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

368
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:39,760
And remember...

369
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:43,280
...Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life.

370
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,593
Captain, what do you want?

371
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,828
Call me Dudley.

372
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:52,909
Dudley...

373
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:54,348
...what do you want?

374
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:58,894
Look, lad, l admire
your refusal to testify...

375
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:01,234
...and your loyalty to your partner.

376
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:03,603
l admire you as a policeman...

377
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:08,178
...particularly your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

378
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:11,314
And l�m most impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

379
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,453
Do you hate them, Wendell?

380
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:17,068
What do you want?

381
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:22,737
They�re yours.

382
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:24,914
Go ahead. Take 'em.

383
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,843
There�s no goddamn bill on me?

384
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,462
- 4 of the witnesses recanted their testimony.
- Why?

385
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,996
They had a change of heart.

386
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:34,994
What about Stensland?

387
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:36,912
Your partner�s through.

388
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:39,185
Departmental scapegoat on the Chief�s orders.

389
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:41,228
A year from his pension.

390
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:47,308
-Exley!
-Exley made his play and got what he wanted.

391
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,732
As a politician he exceeds even myself.

392
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,252
The Department needs
smart men like Exley...

393
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,112
...and direct men...

394
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:57,877
...like you.

395
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,056
Look, l need you for an assignment
the Chief�s given me the go-ahead on.

396
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:05,617
A duty few men are fit for...

397
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,382
...but you were born for.

398
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:10,546
You�d be working
out of Homicide at City Hall.

399
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,860
Homicide?

400
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:14,287
Working cases?

401
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,874
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

402
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,984
lt�s a muscle job.

403
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:25,134
You�ll do as l say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

404
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:27,858
ln Technicolor, sir.

405
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:33,679
"Meet Tony Brancato
and Anthony Trombino...

406
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,046
...two rising lieutenants
in the Mickey Cohen rackets.

407
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:39,952
With the dapper little gent in prison...

408
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,376
...who knows how far they�ll go.
The sky�s the limit.

409
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:50,741
Oh, well."

410
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:07,602
"Meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen�s narcotics lieutenant.

411
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:09,232
Could he be behind the hits?

412
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,599
ls he consolidating
organized crime power?

413
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,022
l suppose not.

414
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,803
One thing�s for sure:

415
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:30,198
2-man triggers are punching the tickets
on the Mickster�s muscle."

416
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,800
"Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...

417
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:47,672
...has set up a not-so-welcome wagon to
dishearten the out-of-town criminal element...

418
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:51,029
...from filling the void left by
Mickey�s absence.

419
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:54,040
When l know more, dear readers,
so will you.

420
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,822
Off the record, on the Q.T...

421
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:58,711
...and very...

422
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:00,658
...Hush-Hush."

423
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,616
With Mickey Cohen in prison,
Los Angeles is organized crime-free.

424
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:07,640
And the Chief wants to keep it that way.

425
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,764
Now in Cleveland, you�re an
organized crime associate...

426
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:15,639
...in desperate needs of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

427
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,667
l hear things.

428
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:21,748
Like those 2-men shooter teams.

429
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,992
Bang Bang! They�re 86ing Cohen�s lieutenants.

430
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:25,719
Now tell me.
What do you want?

431
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,116
We want you to go home.

432
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:34,226
Picture-book smut, gentlemen.

433
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,947
There�s been a bunch of these found
at a bunch of collateral crime scenes lately.

434
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:40,987
Quality ranges from piss-poor to...

435
00:25:42,196 --> 00:25:43,059
...very well done.

436
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:45,946
Look who�s back from suspension!

437
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,631
We�re honored, Sergeant Jack.

438
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:52,122
Look at that.
The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.

439
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,548
ls there someplace you�d rather be,
Vincennes?

440
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:58,164
Yeah, working Narcotics, looking
for Mickey Cohen�s missing H.

441
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:02,327
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

442
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:05,463
You should�ve thought of that
before Bloody Christmas.

443
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:10,076
Make a major case, Sergeant. lt�s the
only way you�re geting out of here.

444
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,982
Dismissed, gentlemen.

445
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,716
Go get the facts, Jack.

446
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,663
Just the facts.

447
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,372
Whatever you desire.

448
00:26:33,564 --> 00:26:36,249
Hi. l�d like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.

449
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,467
l don�t think I know you.

450
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:42,301
Well, look.. A friend jof mine just gave me this number
and l just wanted to find out if there was..

451
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:47,125
Ginger, could you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

452
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:49,149
Crestview-2239.

453
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,365
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the Q.T.

454
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,408
Sid, it�s Vincennes.

455
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,832
Jackie, hey you back on narco?
l need some good copy.

456
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,009
No, but l do have something going with Vice.

457
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:07,774
Something juicy for the Sidster?

458
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,104
Tracking porn.
Arty, high-class stuff.

459
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,269
What do you know about Fleur-de-Lis?
Slogan�s "Whatever you desire."

460
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:15,034
No, l�ve heard bupkes.

461
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:18,717
Get me some narco skinny.
You know, l wanna do an all-hophead issue.

462
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,678
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
You like it?

463
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,318
Yeah l�ll talk to you later Sid.

464
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,907
- What do you got?
- The number�s not assigned sir.

465
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:28,183
Thanks, Ginger.

466
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,223
A bootleg.

467
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,111
Take it easy.

468
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:42,713
Tough break, Stens.

469
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:44,957
We�re gonna miss you.

470
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,751
Raw deal, Stensland.

471
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,709
Here comes the snitch.

472
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,024
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.

473
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,045
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

474
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:26,552
l got a couple of hours before I take a break.
Come on, l�ll buy you a drink.

475
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,825
Rain check.
l got a hot date.

476
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,825
Yeah? Who is she and
what did you arrest her for?

477
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:34,657
lt�s confidential.

478
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:39,548
Its like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.

479
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,425
l�ll see you later in the week.

480
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,890
We�ll do the town, on me.

481
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:47,968
Yeah. l�ll bring
my wallet just in case.

482
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,202
-See you tomorrow, Harold.
-Hang on a minute!

483
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:56,447
l�ll walk down with you.

484
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,227
Punk kid.
Who is he trying to impress?

485
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:09,375
Yeah, l wonder.

486
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,706
Got himself a real career going.

487
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,141
Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.

488
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:20,826
Sergeant Williams?

489
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:26,686
ls there anybody up there in Homicide?

490
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:29,151
Anybody there?

491
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:32,479
Lieutenant Exley.

492
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,560
You�ve got a homicide, Downtown Division.

493
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:37,572
-The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
-l got it.

494
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:38,847
lt�s mine.

495
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,639
Sir, at least one person�s dead.
l stopped for coffee.

496
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:55,555
- No one comes through the front door. Understand?
- Yes sir.

497
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:31,654
l want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure the traffic..

498
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,889
Sir, l took the call. lt�s my case.

499
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,584
You don�t want it Edmund,  and you can�t have it.

500
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:37,763
l took the call.

501
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:39,077
lt�s mine.

502
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:41,926
l�ll make you my second-in-command.

503
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,815
Captain Smith, over here, please.

504
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:52,130
Looks like the cook drew a hand-gun and set it off.
The rest were killed in the men�s room.

505
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,568
Sir...

506
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:01,385
...we got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

507
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:05,538
l�m betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

508
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,917
Excuse me sir, we got an l.D.
on one of the victims.

509
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:09,768
lt�s Dick Stensland.

510
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,765
You know when I first saw her, l thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

511
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,299
Yeah, me too.

512
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:27,693
Hell of a way to avoid prison sentence.

513
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,144
You tell me what happened.

514
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,156
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.

515
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:45,062
The guy at the register pulled a .38,
so they killed him.

516
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,210
Then they took everyone else 
back and killed them too.

517
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,974
Lieutenant, we�re ready
with that Nite Owl l.D.

518
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,110
Mrs. Lefferts, is this your daughter?

519
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,411
l don�t know.

520
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,711
We know this is difficult.
Just take your time.

521
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,576
lt seems like my Susan.

522
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:12,559
But my Susan was a blonde,
not a redhead.

523
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,573
When was the last time you saw her?

524
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:16,903
Just before Christmas.

525
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,269
We�d fought.
l didn�t like her boyfriend.

526
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:21,996
Mrs. Lefferts...

527
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:24,585
...does your daughter have
any distinguishing characteristics?

528
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:28,431
You got the wrong idea, mister.
l�m fine.

529
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:32,268
She has a birthmark on her hip.

530
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:39,374
lt�s her.

531
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,031
My baby!

532
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:46,893
l�m sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

533
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:50,289
Who�s in charge of this investigation?

534
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,140
Captain Smith and myself.
Why?

535
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,043
"The Nite Owl Massacre."

536
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,961
Hyperbole aside...

537
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:01,673
...this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.

538
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,629
Six victims.

539
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:06,382
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

540
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:10,736
As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

541
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:13,067
Robbery is the likely motive.

542
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:17,545
We have rubber glove smears on the
register and preliminary forensics strongly...

543
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:21,363
...tend toward a trio of shooters.
We do have one hot lead., so listen well.

544
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:23,626
Three Negro juveniles...

545
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:27,280
...were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

546
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:31,404
A park ranger l.D.�d them
as driving a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe...

547
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:32,881
...maroon in color.

548
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:36,880
An hour ago a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor...

549
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,621
...who saw a maroon Merc coupe
parked across from  the Nite Owl at 1 a.m.

550
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,716
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

551
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:50,221
48 two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

552
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:53,396
lnterrogations will be led by
Lt. Edmund Exley.

553
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:58,028
Enough on that!

554
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:04,655
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

555
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,859
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

556
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:09,710
Dismissed.

557
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:14,898
Why not just put a bounty on them?

558
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,911
-Ready to roll?
-You take them, l got something to do.

559
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:26,963
What if one of these names--?

560
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:28,661
Get somebody else.

561
00:35:29,457 --> 00:35:31,605
Well, I got our assignments, Big V.

562
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,703
We go by this list, we got
zero chance of making this collar.

563
00:35:34,895 --> 00:35:38,894
l got a guy who knows whats goin' on
south of Jefferson. He�ll put us at 50-50.

564
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:40,755
Jack, what are you doing?

565
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,661
lt�s the same sort of thing
that got you in trouble before.

566
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,234
l�ll take those odds.

567
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:50,576
We got it from here.

568
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,026
You two guys should
bring along a photographer.

569
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,188
l need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

570
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:05,135
-That�s all l got to go on?
-Yeah.

571
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:07,858
I think you already know who l mean,
so cough it up.

572
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:11,215
There�s a billing address
and a delivery address.

573
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:38,910
Are you Pierce Patchett?

574
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,221
l am.

575
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:47,072
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.

576
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,275
Go on down to the driveway.
We�ll talk there.

577
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,340
What can l do for you?

578
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:06,752
-Where were you last night?
-l was here hosting a party.

579
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:10,080
Tell me about Dick Stensland.

580
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,353
l don�t know him, Mr.--?

581
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,022
Officer White.

582
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:16,256
How about Sue Lefferts?

583
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:18,760
You know l do.
You saw me with her.

584
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:22,020
How did you find me?

585
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:26,595
Nick�s Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken�s booze bills go.

586
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:28,360
Of course.

587
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:33,222
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

588
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:35,400
l�m investigating.

589
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:38,977
Everything all right, Mr. Patchett?

590
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,221
Fine, Phillip, thank you.

591
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,618
What happened to the other guy, Buzz?

592
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:50,150
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

593
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,711
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn�t act it. How come?

594
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:57,027
l think she�d been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is...was...

595
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,504
...a big doubles fan.

596
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,177
You�re a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.

597
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:07,145
-Wanna go downtown to discuss this officially?
-ls that what this is? Official?

598
00:38:07,874 --> 00:38:12,266
Somehow l have the feeling this is
more personal with you, Mr. White.

599
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:16,841
All right, then...

600
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:21,896
...are you concerned about criminal matters
peripheral to the "Nite Own" murders?

601
00:38:22,116 --> 00:38:25,387
-Not at the moment.
-And you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?

602
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:29,702
Why were Lefferts� eyes black?

603
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,714
l needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.

604
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:33,989
What little studio?

605
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:37,672
Well, there�s Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner....

606
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:40,099
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

607
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,947
l use girls that look like movie stars.

608
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:45,642
Sometimes l employ a plastic surgeon.

609
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,519
When the work had been done,
that�s when you saw us.

610
00:38:49,315 --> 00:38:50,984
lt�s why her mom couldn�t l.D. her.

611
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,929
Jesus fucking Christ!

612
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,106
No, Mr.White.
Pierce Morehouse Patchett.

613
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,707
l sense you�re on your best behavior,
but that�s all l�m gonna tell.

614
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,104
lf you persist,
I�ll meet you with my attorney.

615
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,269
Now, would you like Lynn Bracken�s address?

616
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:09,063
l got her address.

617
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,266
Find Susan�s killer, Mr. White.

618
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:14,760
l�ll give you a handsome reward.

619
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:20,744
Whatever you desire!

620
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:30,604
l know you�re not asleep.

621
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:34,795
What do you want?

622
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:36,550
My 5 bucks.

623
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,082
lt was the only one l had.

624
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,425
Right now?

625
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:43,273
Hey, doll face,
tell him to leave us alone.

626
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,709
l understand.
Okay, fine.

627
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:48,270
Oh, baby...

628
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:50,792
...bad news.

629
00:39:50,984 --> 00:39:52,077
You have to go.

630
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,382
Go?

631
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:57,036
Something very important has come up
and you have to go.

632
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,050
l�ll make it up to you, okay?

633
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:01,707
l will, l promise.
Excuse me.

634
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:05,485
ls it the cops?

635
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,115
Miss Bracken...

636
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:12,237
...l�m Officer White.

637
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:14,923
l�ve been expecting you,
just not this soon.

638
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:17,675
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.

639
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:20,840
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

640
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:22,029
Hit the road, pal.

641
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:25,798
Maybe l will...

642
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:27,726
...maybe l won�t.

643
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,563
LAPD. Get the fuck out of here
or l�ll have your wife to come get you.

644
00:40:47,464 --> 00:40:48,970
-Officer.
-Councilman.

645
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:10,185
-Would you care for a drink?
-Yeah, Scotch. Straight.

646
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:19,248
l was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren�t friends.

647
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:20,849
Know what l mean?

648
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,825
You sorry she�s dead?

649
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,961
Of course l am.

650
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,110
What kind of question is that?

651
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:32,368
Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?

652
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:34,833
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

653
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:36,271
But, do you know?

654
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,643
Yeah, l know.

655
00:41:38,602 --> 00:41:40,367
Patchett�s running whores...

656
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,532
...cut to look like movie stars.

657
00:41:43,723 --> 00:41:47,051
And, judging by his address,
something bigger on the side.

658
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:49,065
He doesn�t want any attention.

659
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:52,720
That�s right. Our motives are selfish
so we�re cooperating.

660
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,731
So cooperate Ms. bracken. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

661
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,840
l don�t know. l never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

662
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:00,029
How�d she meet Patchett?

663
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:01,881
Pierce meets people.

664
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:05,755
Sue came in a bus with dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

665
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:09,918
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

666
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:12,699
Tell me about Pierce.

667
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:14,972
He�s waiting for you to mention money.

668
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,724
Want some advice, Miss Bracken?

669
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,201
lt�s Lynn.

670
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:20,793
Miss Bracken...

671
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:24,026
...don�t ever try to fucking bribe me,
or threaten me...

672
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:26,558
...or l�ll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

673
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,914
l remember you from Christmas Eve.

674
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:34,105
You have a thing for helping
women, don�t you, Mr. White?

675
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,637
Maybe l�m just fucking curious.

676
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:40,157
-You say "fuck" a lot.
-You fuck for money.

677
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:41,884
There�s blood on your shirt.

678
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:43,811
Is that an integral part of your job?

679
00:42:44,003 --> 00:42:45,662
-Yeah.
-Do you enjoy it?

680
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,842
When they deserve it.

681
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:48,482
Did they deserve it today?

682
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:51,100
l�m not sure.

683
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,702
-But you did it anyway.
-Yeah.

684
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,579
Just like the half dozen guys
you screwed today.

685
00:42:56,797 --> 00:42:58,754
Well actually, it was only two.

686
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,974
You�re different, Officer White.

687
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:07,520
You�re the first man in 5 years who didn�t
tell me l look like Veronica Lake.

688
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,438
You look better than Veronica Lake.

689
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,739
Pierce Patchett?

690
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,036
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

691
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:23,268
He doesn�t let us use narcotics
and he doesn�t abuse us.

692
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:27,267
Can your policeman�s mentality
grasp those contradictions?

693
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:31,554
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.

694
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:32,705
No.

695
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,062
l�m really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

696
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:40,320
And that�s all the news
that�s fit to print.

697
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:43,427
lt�s nice meeting you officer.

698
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:50,083
-l�d like to see you again.
-Are you asking me for a date...

699
00:43:50,237 --> 00:43:51,522
...or an appointment?

700
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,562
l don�t know.

701
00:43:54,783 --> 00:43:58,370
-If you're asking me for a date, l should know your first name.
-Forget l asked.

702
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:00,806
lt was a mistake.

703
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:21,925
Leonard Bidwell?

704
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:24,965
Come on down here and talk to us.

705
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,226
How�s the left these days?

706
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:29,732
What�s it to you?

707
00:44:29,923 --> 00:44:31,525
Oh, l saw you fight Kid Gavilan.

708
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:33,443
l like your style.

709
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,663
What, Mr. Policeman?

710
00:44:38,402 --> 00:44:40,838
You got a brother in Folsom.
I know because l put him there.

711
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,046
Until 19-fuckin'-70.

712
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:44,223
How�d you like to make it 1960?

713
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,755
l know the judge, and
Lieutenant Exley here ...

714
00:44:46,947 --> 00:44:49,028
...is very good friends with the D.A.

715
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,754
Yeah. We�re looking for 3 colored guys
who like to pop out shotguns.

716
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:57,027
One of them owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

717
00:44:57,343 --> 00:45:00,355
-Wanna get me a snitch-jacket?
-You wanna buy your brother 10 years?

718
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:02,369
-lt was 10 years, right?
-Yeah, 10 years.

719
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:05,668
You don�t have to say anything,
just look at this list...

720
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:07,395
...and point.

721
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:11,586
He�s bad, so l�ll just tell you.

722
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:13,312
Sugar Ray Collins.

723
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:15,681
Drives a maroon �49 coupe.

724
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,762
Beautiful ride.

725
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:22,471
Don�t know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.

726
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,006
He�s righteous trash.

727
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,430
Look at that. lt�s five minutes
from here. Thanks man.

728
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:30,949
So l�ll hear from you, right...

729
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:33,318
...about my brother?

730
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,687
Keep it up, Lenny. Up!

731
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:43,619
There it is.
lt�s in the back.

732
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,724
-One of ours.
-Shit, somebody beat us here!

733
00:46:08,555 --> 00:46:09,763
Damn it!

734
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,653
My glasses!

735
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:13,034
You�re kidding!

736
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,390
Well, just don�t shoot me.

737
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:26,566
What are you guys doin' here?

738
00:46:27,525 --> 00:46:29,194
Oh, we were just in the neighborhood.

739
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:32,810
-What do you got?
-I got three 12-gauge pumps, an empty box of double casings.

740
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:33,769
And cash.

741
00:46:35,908 --> 00:46:38,603
Oh! So long, Vice.
Badge of Honor, here l come.

742
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:40,521
Fuck you Vincennes!
This is our collar.

743
00:46:40,713 --> 00:46:41,796
Quiet!

744
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:45,479
l�m ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.

745
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:51,588
Yeah right.

746
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:53,957
How many ways in?

747
00:46:54,149 --> 00:46:56,326
Only one.
Up the stairs.

748
00:46:57,669 --> 00:46:59,597
He�s very serious.

749
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:14,376
Police!

750
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:15,594
Don�t shoot!

751
00:47:17,445 --> 00:47:18,596
-Don�t move.
-Ace him, Jack!

752
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:19,498
Shut up.

753
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:21,003
Anxious, aren�t you?

754
00:47:21,195 --> 00:47:22,250
Don�t kill them.

755
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:25,866
Back, back, back!

756
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:28,331
Get off me!

757
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:30,920
Against the wall!

758
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:32,877
-Put your hands up!
-Get over there.

759
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:35,687
Shut up!
Put your hands behind your back!

760
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:37,835
So...

761
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:41,000
...how�s it feel
getting out of the office?

762
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:48,395
This just came in from forensics.

763
00:47:48,586 --> 00:47:49,958
"Burning clothes.

764
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,161
Casitas Youth Camp...."

765
00:47:56,422 --> 00:47:58,187
lt�s crowded in here, White.

766
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:00,460
These guys killed Stensland.

767
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,085
The ejection marks on the shells
fired from the suspects' shotguns...

768
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:22,250
...are identical to those markings on
the shell casings found at the Nite Owl.

769
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:24,494
l want confessions, Edmund.

770
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:26,700
A night�s stewing ought
to have softened them up.

771
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:29,520
Oh l�ll break them, sir.

772
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:51,761
Are you sure golden boy
is up to the task, Cap?

773
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:55,280
Oh l think you�d be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

774
00:48:57,515 --> 00:48:59,309
You�re 22.
Aren�t you, Ray?

775
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:06,319
Did one of the officers work you over?

776
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,345
-So you�re 22, right?
-Man, why do you keep asking me that?

777
00:49:11,594 --> 00:49:13,906
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.

778
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,553
You should�ve pulled this
caper a couple of years ago.

779
00:49:16,783 --> 00:49:19,919
Get life,
do a little Youth Authority jolt...

780
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,837
...transfer to Folsom a big man...

781
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:23,986
...get yourself a sissy....

782
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:26,000
l don�t truck with no sissies.

783
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:29,999
Louis.

784
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:31,505
What?

785
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:35,562
You did the Casitas Youth Camp
with Louis.

786
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,354
Why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

787
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:42,903
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.

788
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:46,998
You couldn�t do the time, so you got
yourself a big White boy to look after you.

789
00:49:47,228 --> 00:49:48,916
Said they called you "Sugar"...

790
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:51,611
...because you gave it out so sweet.

791
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:56,378
Louis gave it up at Casitas, man.
And l was the fuckin' boss jock in my dorm!

792
00:49:56,637 --> 00:49:57,692
Louis was the sissy!

793
00:49:58,008 --> 00:50:01,950
Louis gave it up for fuckin' candy bars!
He ain�t got the sense of a goddamn dog!

794
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,405
We heard you like to shoot dogs.

795
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:06,812
Dogs got no reason to live.

796
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:10,198
You feel the same way about people too?

797
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,991
What�re you trying to say?

798
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:13,814
We got the shotguns.

799
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,415
l don�t own no shotguns.

800
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:17,919
Why were you throwing clothes
in your backyard incinerator?

801
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:19,194
Say what?

802
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:23,932
A neighbor said she saw you throwing
clothes in the backyard incinerator.

803
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:25,246
Doesn�t look good.

804
00:50:25,562 --> 00:50:27,548
l ain�t got shit to say till l see a judge.

805
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:31,135
Were you on hop? You guys were all
passed out when we arrested you.

806
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,791
Ty and Louis fuck with that shit man,
not me.

807
00:50:33,983 --> 00:50:35,642
Where do they get their stuff?

808
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,982
Man....

809
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:41,531
Come on, give me one to feed the D.A.
lt�ll make me look good...

810
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:45,271
...and l�ll say Sugar Ray�s not a punk
like his sissy partners.

811
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,817
Tell me one more thing
about Jones and Fontaine.

812
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,418
Where do they get their drugs?

813
00:50:58,363 --> 00:50:59,801
Roland Navarette.

814
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:03,868
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

815
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,016
And he sells red devils.

816
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:08,414
Exley�s good, l�ll give him that.

817
00:51:08,606 --> 00:51:09,536
l�m gonna  take a break.

818
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:16,288
You know, Ray,
l�m talking about the gas chamber...

819
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,577
...and you haven�t even asked
me what this is about.

820
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,781
You got a big "guilty" sign
around your neck.

821
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:29,024
That was masterful, Edmund.

822
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:30,367
He�s ready to go.

823
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,409
Give Jones the newspaper.
l want him primed.

824
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,845
Take the cuffs off, so he can read it.

825
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:46,911
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

826
00:51:47,228 --> 00:51:51,323
l think it was Ray�s idea.
You talk, l think l can save your life.

827
00:51:52,129 --> 00:51:54,881
Son, 6 people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.

828
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,883
Now, it can be you,
or it can be Ray.

829
00:51:59,964 --> 00:52:01,729
Louis, he called you queer.

830
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:05,728
-He says at Casitas, you took it up the ass.
-l didn�t kill nobody! !

831
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:09,085
Son...

832
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,343
...you know what�s gonna happen
to you if you don�t talk.

833
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:16,384
You�ll go to the gas chamber. So
for god�s sake, admit what you did.

834
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,136
l didn�t mean to hurt her.

835
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:22,042
-Maybe she�s okay.
-Okay?

836
00:52:23,164 --> 00:52:26,463
These people were all in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

837
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:31,009
l just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don�t die, so l don�t die.

838
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:33,791
She don�t die, so l don�t die.

839
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:36,543
Louis, who�s the girl?
What�s her name?

840
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,624
Who are you talking about?

841
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:40,859
Was she at the Nite Owl?

842
00:52:41,406 --> 00:52:43,650
Louis, listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?

843
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,087
-This newspaper's shit ain�t shit!
-Where�s the girl? Fontaine saw the girl.

844
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,046
Did you kill her?

845
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:59,388
You wanted Louis to lose his cherry, but that wasn't enough.
So things got out of hand and you you made her bleed.

846
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,796
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

847
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:02,784
Who told you that?!

848
00:53:04,126 --> 00:53:05,536
Now, listen to me.

849
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:08,193
lf that girl�s still alive,
she�s the only chance you�ve got.

850
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,564
-l think she�s alive.
-You think?

851
00:53:10,044 --> 00:53:11,454
Then where is she now?

852
00:53:11,645 --> 00:53:13,343
Did you leave her someplace?
Did you sell her out?

853
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:16,287
Tell me where is she!

854
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:19,165
What�re you doing?!

855
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:21,342
Don�t.

856
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:23,174
White!

857
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:25,341
1 in 6!

858
00:53:25,571 --> 00:53:26,434
Where�s the girl?!

859
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:28,094
White I had this under control.
Put the weapon down!

860
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:29,734
Where�s the girl?!!

861
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:40,926
-What?
-Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

862
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:44,129
...brown corner house, upstairs.

863
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,209
-Captain just give me one minute.
-You got it, Bud.

864
00:54:04,126 --> 00:54:05,574
Nobody moves.

865
00:54:05,891 --> 00:54:07,492
The rest of us, we�re going in the front.

866
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:09,670
Stay put until l give the word.

867
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,855
He went around back!

868
00:56:32,294 --> 00:56:33,224
Guys l�m Lieutenant Exley.

869
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:36,264
l�m sorry to have to ask you this.
l need to know what time they left you.

870
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:38,796
Get her to the hospital.
Excuse me.

871
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:40,618
Give your career a rest.

872
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,345
Leave her alone.

873
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:45,069
A naked guy with a gun?
You're expecting anyone to believe that?

874
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,015
Get the fuck away from me.

875
00:56:47,495 --> 00:56:48,684
How�s it gonna look in your report?

876
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:51,916
lt�ll look like justice.
That�s what the man got.

877
00:56:52,137 --> 00:56:53,317
Justice.

878
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:55,110
You don�t know the meaning of the word,
you ignorant bastard.

879
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,985
Yeah? You think it means
getting your picture in the paper.

880
00:56:59,177 --> 00:57:01,325
Why don't you go after criminals for a change.

881
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:03,588
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.

882
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:19,912
lt�s best to stay away from the
man when his blood is up.

883
00:57:20,142 --> 00:57:21,581
His blood�s always up.

884
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:25,033
Well then perhaps you should
stay away from him altogether.

885
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:29,061
- Hey Captain!
- ....Raymond Collins, Ty Jones
and Louis Fontaine.

886
00:57:29,253 --> 00:57:31,881
They are considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

887
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,634
Repeat.
The "Nite Owl" suspects have escaped.

888
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,839
How did they get out the
window in the first place?

889
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:38,825
All we know - they jumped
to the 2nd floor.

890
00:57:39,017 --> 00:57:43,016
This girl at the hospital made a statement. 3 chicks left
her at midnight. Plenty of time to be at the Nite Owl by 1.

891
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:47,015
The question was, where did they get
their drugs? What is the answer?

892
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:49,518
l haven�t gotten that far yet.

893
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:53,192
"Roland Navarette
lives on Bunker Hill, he runs a hole-up in South--"

894
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:56,712
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

895
00:57:58,697 --> 00:58:00,270
ls something up, Lieutenant?

896
00:58:00,462 --> 00:58:02,255
l need some backup, come on.

897
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,938
-What?
-Nothing. Let�s go.

898
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,481
This should be it.

899
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:35,755
404.

900
00:58:56,558 --> 00:58:57,517
Nobody moves!

901
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,202
You�re under arrest.

902
00:59:00,394 --> 00:59:01,679
Don�t shoot, man!

903
00:59:02,475 --> 00:59:04,077
Don�t move! Don�t move!

904
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:55,282
There he is.

905
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:57,709
You did good, kid.

906
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,037
You should�ve seen this place.
Blood everywhere.

907
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,981
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

908
01:00:04,786 --> 01:00:06,388
Somebody get him cleaned up.

909
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:07,597
Come on.

910
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:14,512
Edmund J. Exley
has amassed a brilliant record...

911
01:00:14,703 --> 01:00:17,072
...in his 7 years
with the Los Angeles Police Department.

912
01:00:17,264 --> 01:00:20,276
Recently, he evinced spectacular bravery
in the line of duty.

913
01:00:20,467 --> 01:00:23,182
lt is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:

914
01:00:23,508 --> 01:00:25,167
The Medal of Valor.

915
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,565
-What kind of car was it?
-lt was a Ford.
-You sure?

916
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:30,384
My husband always drove a Ford.
And l know what they look like.

917
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,645
Excuse me, ma�am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?

918
01:00:33,837 --> 01:00:37,520
Light. And that�s really
all l remember, Officer.

919
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:40,301
Thank you ma'am.
You�ve been a big help.

920
01:00:40,781 --> 01:00:42,449
Cut!
That�s a print.

921
01:00:42,641 --> 01:00:43,984
Hey.. Big Jack!

922
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,557
He�s back!

923
01:00:45,749 --> 01:00:47,667
Hey.. Jack�s back.

924
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:22,865
Tell Mr. Patchett that l have
no intention of changing my vote.

925
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,642
lt may surprise some that a man in public
office would admit to making a mistake...

926
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,749
...but after due consideration...

927
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,432
...l am changing my position
on the matter before the council.

928
01:01:47,187 --> 01:01:50,352
"Go west, America,"
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.

929
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:54,131
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs...

930
01:01:54,323 --> 01:01:56,528
...no traffic signals, from downtown...

931
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,705
...to the beach in 20 minutes.

932
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,230
What were you gonna start with?

933
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:33,846
Prostitution?

934
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:36,590
Gambling?

935
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:43,793
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...

936
01:02:43,946 --> 01:02:46,027
...and you haven�t got any wings.

937
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,187
Nice to see you again.
Take care.

938
01:03:45,903 --> 01:03:49,068
l wondered when you�d
knock on my door again, Officer White.

939
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:50,832
lt�s Bud.

940
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:53,489
Bud.

941
01:04:21,647 --> 01:04:22,674
Why me?

942
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:25,877
l don�t know.

943
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:02,197
This election...

944
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:05,525
...is about the future
of law enforcement in Los Angeles.

945
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:08,690
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

946
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:10,646
So let�s dig deep...

947
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:14,454
...and let�s get a moral man re-elected. Dirtrict
Attorney Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.

948
01:05:18,357 --> 01:05:21,331
Thank you, Brett Chase.
The very talented star of Badge of Honor.

949
01:05:23,575 --> 01:05:26,164
Let me tell you,
l am so thrilled to be here.

950
01:05:27,728 --> 01:05:28,850
Big V.

951
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,724
Good to see you back.

952
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:35,573
-How they hanging, Sid?
-Down around my ankles.

953
01:05:35,793 --> 01:05:37,616
You tight with the D.A., Jackie?

954
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:38,642
Oh, yeah.. yeah..

955
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,203
He tried to throw me off the force
last Christmas.

956
01:05:41,394 --> 01:05:42,967
How about some payback, big-time?

957
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:47,638
Plus the usual 50 dollar donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

958
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:51,158
-Did you know the D.A. was a swish?
-No kidding?

959
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:56,663
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?

960
01:05:56,855 --> 01:05:59,415
-He just got off the honor farm.
-What�s he doing here?

961
01:06:00,212 --> 01:06:02,648
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

962
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,141
l�m getting him
to fuck the D.A. for $100.

963
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:08,114
That�s twice the $50
you got for wrecking his career.

964
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,210
-Hey Matt! Come here, come here.
-Jesus, don�t bring him--

965
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:18,520
-That�s D.A. Loew right there.
-Yeah.

966
01:06:23,575 --> 01:06:24,850
You need a drink, kid?

967
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:26,682
Yeah.

968
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:28,888
Jack, look after him.

969
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,763
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.

970
01:06:37,817 --> 01:06:40,119
-Hey, how you doing?
-l�m okay. How�re you?

971
01:06:40,282 --> 01:06:41,490
l�m good. Yeah.

972
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:46,132
Have we met before?

973
01:06:48,376 --> 01:06:49,498
Yeah.

974
01:06:50,515 --> 01:06:51,800
Was it at a party?

975
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:53,881
Well, it was something like that.

976
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:56,950
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

977
01:06:58,197 --> 01:06:59,319
Right.

978
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:01,401
Fleur-de-Lis.

979
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,894
"Whatever you desire."

980
01:07:04,115 --> 01:07:06,675
Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars....

981
01:07:07,097 --> 01:07:08,920
Pierce Patchett has it all.

982
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:11,605
Oh-hoh! Boy, you can say that again.

983
01:07:11,797 --> 01:07:14,300
Pierce, he�s.. he�s not like regular guys.

984
01:07:15,892 --> 01:07:17,177
l dig him, but...

985
01:07:18,616 --> 01:07:19,575
...you know...

986
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:22,040
...he.. he scares me too.

987
01:07:22,778 --> 01:07:23,737
Really?

988
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,243
How?

989
01:07:26,298 --> 01:07:30,998
You know, when l came out to L.A. this isn�t
exactly where l saw myself ending up.

990
01:07:32,283 --> 01:07:33,462
Yeah, well...

991
01:07:33,654 --> 01:07:34,844
...get in line.

992
01:07:35,323 --> 01:07:37,337
That's your courage, kid. Drink up.

993
01:07:42,363 --> 01:07:44,022
You know, l don�t think l should do this.

994
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,458
lt�s not like you don�t know how.

995
01:07:46,774 --> 01:07:51,292
Jack here has connections with Badge of Honor.
You pull this off, there�ll be a part for ya.

996
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:54,236
l smell a comeback, don�t you, Jack?

997
01:07:56,758 --> 01:07:57,976
Come on, the D.A.�s free.

998
01:07:58,197 --> 01:08:00,700
Go introduce yourself. Go on.

999
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:03,577
Go up to him Jack. Tell him
about the opening on the show.

1000
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,934
l�m pretty sure l can get you
a part on this show.

1001
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:08,344
But...

1002
01:08:08,536 --> 01:08:09,850
...that�s later on.

1003
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:13,494
Tonight, just.. just go on over there
and pretend it�s an acting job.

1004
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,230
Like show biz.

1005
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:16,573
Acting, that�s it.

1006
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:17,657
Right.

1007
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:19,517
And no one�s going to know about this?

1008
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:20,505
No.

1009
01:08:22,615 --> 01:08:24,217
lt�ll be our secret.

1010
01:08:28,696 --> 01:08:31,103
-All right, show biz.
-That�s it. Go on.

1011
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,119
Show biz.

1012
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:40,214
lf Reynolds works his charms,
which l know he will...

1013
01:08:40,406 --> 01:08:43,130
...they�ll be at the
Hollywood Center Motel, room 203.

1014
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:45,336
Meet me there at midnight
for a little photo shoot.

1015
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:49,498
And maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.

1016
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:52,279
What do you know
about Pierce Patchett?

1017
01:08:53,977 --> 01:08:55,607
Patchett? l know what you know.

1018
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:59,961
He�s very rich. And he just invested in the freeway
construction, which is gonna make him richer. Why?

1019
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:03,289
Oh l just keep hearing rumors, you know.

1020
01:09:03,424 --> 01:09:06,617
High-class porn, drugs,
hookers that look like movie stars.

1021
01:09:07,672 --> 01:09:10,876
Patchett�s what l call twilight.
He ain�t queer and he ain�t Red.

1022
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:14,942
He cannot help me
in my quest for prime sinnuendo.

1023
01:09:20,313 --> 01:09:24,284
As though Badge of Honor would
touch that guy with a 10-foot pole...

1024
01:09:24,475 --> 01:09:27,487
...after he�s been Hush-Hush
cover boy twice in one year.

1025
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,858
I'll see you in a few hours, Sid.

1026
01:09:29,117 --> 01:09:32,954
Midnight. l guarantee all kinds
of illegal activity.

1027
01:10:04,795 --> 01:10:05,629
Another, Jack?

1028
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:06,713
Yeah.

1029
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,399
Kid?

1030
01:10:58,081 --> 01:11:00,546
Come on kid, you don�t have to do this--

1031
01:11:30,949 --> 01:11:33,020
Thank you for what you did for me...

1032
01:11:33,509 --> 01:11:36,003
...for killing those animals
who raped me.

1033
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,947
Will you thank Officer White
for me, please?

1034
01:11:39,197 --> 01:11:40,223
Sure.

1035
01:11:41,662 --> 01:11:45,469
Seeing him come through the door
is about the only thing l remember.

1036
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:46,783
Thank God.

1037
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:50,399
You remember what time
the Negroes left you, right?

1038
01:11:50,725 --> 01:11:53,794
ln your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

1039
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:55,041
They might have.

1040
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:01,630
What do you mean "they <i>might</i> have"?

1041
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:05,447
l don�t know what time they left me.
l wanted them dead.

1042
01:12:05,763 --> 01:12:09,062
Would anyone care that they raped
a Mexican girl from Border heights...

1043
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,227
...if they hadn�t killed
those White people at the Nite Owl?

1044
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:15,447
l did what l had to do for justice.

1045
01:12:16,339 --> 01:12:17,586
Exley, over here.

1046
01:12:17,778 --> 01:12:18,900
Smile, lnez.

1047
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,170
So, is he your hero?

1048
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:27,062
Hey fellas, how about this? "Rape Victim
wheeled out of hospital by Nite Owl Hero."

1049
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,648
All they get is Veronica Lake.

1050
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:38,964
l get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

1051
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:50,617
"Bisbee?"

1052
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:54,328
Uhm hmm. l grew up there.

1053
01:12:56,342 --> 01:13:00,668
l�m going back in a couple of years,
open up a dress shop.

1054
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:05,684
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

1055
01:13:10,968 --> 01:13:12,570
Where�d this come from?

1056
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:18,008
When l was 12, my dad went after my
mother with a bottle. l got in the way.

1057
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:21,461
So you saved her.

1058
01:13:22,813 --> 01:13:24,088
Not for long.

1059
01:13:27,062 --> 01:13:30,169
-l�m sorry. lt�s none of my business.
-He tied me to the radiator.

1060
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:34,005
l watched him beat my mother to death
with a tire iron...

1061
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,784
...and he left me there.

1062
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,126
Three days before
a truant officer found us.

1063
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:47,931
They never found the old man.

1064
01:13:56,889 --> 01:13:58,807
ls that why you became a cop?

1065
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:00,888
To get even?

1066
01:14:02,423 --> 01:14:03,545
Maybe.

1067
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:06,748
Do you like it?

1068
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:11,294
l used to.

1069
01:14:13,212 --> 01:14:15,926
Now it�s all strong-arm,
sitting duck stuff.

1070
01:14:16,895 --> 01:14:18,171
l mean, if l could...

1071
01:14:19,389 --> 01:14:21,786
...get a chance to work Homicide...

1072
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,225
...like a real detective....

1073
01:14:25,306 --> 01:14:27,771
That prick, Exley,
he shot the wrong guys.

1074
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:33,056
Whoever killed Stensland�s still around.
l know it in here. l know it.

1075
01:14:33,631 --> 01:14:35,386
There�s something wrong
with the Nite Owl.

1076
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:37,784
l just can�t prove it, that�s all.

1077
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:40,824
l�m not smart enough.

1078
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:45,792
l�m just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

1079
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:50,424
You�re wrong.

1080
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:53,695
You found Patchett. You found me.

1081
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,776
You�re smart enough.

1082
01:15:06,968 --> 01:15:09,855
Bud White! What brings you down
to the basement?

1083
01:15:13,528 --> 01:15:15,418
l got a couple of Nite Owl questions.

1084
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:18,592
Don�t know if you read the papers,
but that case is closed.

1085
01:15:20,511 --> 01:15:22,208
Anything bother you about it?

1086
01:15:22,975 --> 01:15:26,495
Yeah, the fact that the pack-up boys
haven�t hauled this shit out of here yet.

1087
01:15:30,974 --> 01:15:34,810
We got 3 shotguns taken from the suspects
which match the strike marks on the shell casings.

1088
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,630
What more do you want?

1089
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,654
There�s blood on the wall here.

1090
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,666
l thought everyone but the cook
got shot in the men�s room.

1091
01:15:53,858 --> 01:15:56,188
-That is Stensland�s blood.
-Stensland?

1092
01:15:58,173 --> 01:16:01,856
Took a blow to the head. Was probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.

1093
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,705
Did they hit anyone else?

1094
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:08,129
No, but he was a cop.
He probably tried to do something.

1095
01:16:11,773 --> 01:16:15,293
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone was sitting next to him.

1096
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:20,827
2 of the victims were women, right?

1097
01:16:21,057 --> 01:16:24,893
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

1098
01:16:29,372 --> 01:16:31,070
Susan Lefferts.

1099
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,110
Yeah, what about her?

1100
01:16:37,054 --> 01:16:38,435
You�re welcome!

1101
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:45,504
Mrs. Lefferts?

1102
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:47,556
l�m Officer White, LAPD.

1103
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:53,503
Tell me about the boyfriend
you mentioned at the coroner�s office.

1104
01:16:53,694 --> 01:16:55,939
l told you l didn�t
approve of that boyfriend.

1105
01:16:56,514 --> 01:17:00,734
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.

1106
01:17:02,432 --> 01:17:04,733
They came here one day
when l wasn�t home.

1107
01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:06,949
And old Mrs. Jensen next door said...

1108
01:17:07,141 --> 01:17:10,564
...she saw Susie�s boyfriend
and another man and...

1109
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,511
...she heard a ruckus.

1110
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:14,180
What was the boyfriend�s name?

1111
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:17,057
We weren�t properly introduced.

1112
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,839
Susie gave him a nickname,
Muns or Luns or something.

1113
01:17:20,031 --> 01:17:21,220
Stens?

1114
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:22,467
Was it Stens?

1115
01:17:22,658 --> 01:17:23,905
Maybe.

1116
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,027
l don�t know.

1117
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:26,015
Look at a picture for me.

1118
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:30,820
That�s him.

1119
01:17:31,137 --> 01:17:32,192
That�s him.
That�s him!

1120
01:17:37,217 --> 01:17:39,461
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.

1121
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:40,862
Was it outside?

1122
01:17:41,063 --> 01:17:42,176
lnside?

1123
01:17:43,298 --> 01:17:44,516
Outside.

1124
01:17:44,736 --> 01:17:48,582
And then Mrs. Jensen said
they kept going under the house.

1125
01:17:53,186 --> 01:17:54,759
You have to leave now, officer.

1126
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:59,238
-What�s through here?
-Just a room full of old things.

1127
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,319
Oh don�t move that!

1128
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:07,140
Don�t mind the smell.
l think a rat died behind the wall.

1129
01:18:08,358 --> 01:18:09,701
My Susie was a good girl.

1130
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,480
She was never
in any kind of trouble at all!

1131
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:24,164
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.

1132
01:19:24,356 --> 01:19:25,861
They call me Buzz.

1133
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:33,802
Was it a rat?

1134
01:19:34,598 --> 01:19:36,421
Yeah, a great big one.

1135
01:19:38,598 --> 01:19:39,557
Here.

1136
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:42,338
Compliments of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

1137
01:19:58,758 --> 01:20:01,769
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

1138
01:20:01,961 --> 01:20:05,193
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.

1139
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,591
Hell of a last supper, don�t you think Lieutenant?

1140
01:20:07,878 --> 01:20:10,698
Anything bothering you
about the Nite Owl case?

1141
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:13,163
Yeah. The fact that you guys
won�t let it get filed away.

1142
01:20:14,275 --> 01:20:17,805
-What do you mean?
-Bud White grilled me on it this morning.

1143
01:20:18,821 --> 01:20:20,039
Bud White?

1144
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,600
You know, he�s not as dumb as l thought.

1145
01:20:24,749 --> 01:20:27,405
Did he say where he was going
after he talked to you?

1146
01:20:39,307 --> 01:20:41,062
Let my daughter rest in peace!

1147
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:43,307
Mrs. Lefferts, l just wanna
ask a few questions.

1148
01:20:43,498 --> 01:20:45,829
Officer White already checked
under the house.

1149
01:20:46,376 --> 01:20:47,431
Under the house?

1150
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,375
-Where?
-Out back.

1151
01:20:51,756 --> 01:20:53,319
All he found was rodents.

1152
01:20:56,551 --> 01:21:00,301
l need an l.D. on this as soon as possible.
You talk only to me on this one.

1153
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:05,068
Vincennes, l need your help with something.

1154
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,550
l�m busy right now. Why don�t you just 
go ask some of your boys in Homicide?

1155
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,901
l can�t. l need someone
outside of Homicide.

1156
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:17,258
I want you to tail Bud White until
he goes on duty this evening.

1157
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:20,874
Why don�t you do me a real
favor and leave me alone?

1158
01:21:21,929 --> 01:21:24,135
D'you make the free Negroes
for the Nite Owl killings?

1159
01:21:27,338 --> 01:21:28,143
What?

1160
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,803
lt�s a simple question.

1161
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:34,608
Why in the world do you wanna
go digging any deeper...

1162
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:36,679
...into the Nite Owl killings...

1163
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:38,060
...Lieutenant?

1164
01:21:41,676 --> 01:21:43,115
Rollo Tomasi.

1165
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,018
ls there more to that or
am I supposed to guess?

1166
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:52,140
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1167
01:21:56,398 --> 01:21:58,383
My father ran into him off-duty.

1168
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:03,274
And he shot my father 6
times and got away clean.

1169
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:06,382
No one even knew who he was.

1170
01:22:07,178 --> 01:22:09,192
l just made the name up to
give him some personality.

1171
01:22:10,957 --> 01:22:11,983
What�s your point?

1172
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:15,272
Rollo Tomasi�s the reason
l became a cop.

1173
01:22:15,982 --> 01:22:19,377
l wanted to catch the guys
who thought they could get away with it.

1174
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:22,475
lt was supposed to be about justice.

1175
01:22:23,434 --> 01:22:26,321
Then somewhere along the way
l lost sight of that.

1176
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,471
Why�d you become a cop?

1177
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,269
l don�t remember.

1178
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:50,980
What do you want, Exley?

1179
01:22:51,584 --> 01:22:53,186
l just wanna to solve this thing.

1180
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:55,430
Nite Owl was solved.

1181
01:22:55,909 --> 01:22:56,964
No.

1182
01:22:58,144 --> 01:22:59,391
l wanna do it right.

1183
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:02,335
Even if it means
paying the consequences?

1184
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:07,457
All right, college boy, l�ll help.

1185
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,535
But there�s a case your boys
in Homicide don�t care about.

1186
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:14,496
They think it�s just another
Hollywood "homo"-cide. But l don�t.

1187
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:18,467
You help me with mine,
l�ll help you with yours.

1188
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:19,714
Deal?

1189
01:23:20,807 --> 01:23:21,574
Deal.

1190
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:54,758
Johnny Stompanato.

1191
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,633
Officer Wendell White.
How�s tricks, paesano?

1192
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,417
l ain�t your paesano.

1193
01:24:01,155 --> 01:24:03,169
And l ain�t in the snitch business anymore.

1194
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:05,538
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1195
01:24:06,593 --> 01:24:08,358
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1196
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:10,017
Should l?

1197
01:24:11,398 --> 01:24:14,151
You�re muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

1198
01:24:14,343 --> 01:24:15,618
You tell me.

1199
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:19,368
Oh yeah.. Yeah, l remember now.

1200
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,041
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
Same as you�re gonna be some day.

1201
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:24,643
And that�s all you�re gonna get.

1202
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,242
And you can keep your 20 bucks.

1203
01:24:32,517 --> 01:24:35,778
What do l get if l give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?

1204
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,242
Okay, okay. There was a
rumor going around...

1205
01:24:42,434 --> 01:24:45,417
...that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

1206
01:24:47,402 --> 01:24:48,198
And?

1207
01:24:48,936 --> 01:24:50,346
And nothing!

1208
01:24:50,538 --> 01:24:52,130
He skipped out.

1209
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:05,154
Bullshit.

1210
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:09,096
How would a two-bit hood like Meeks get
his hands on a large supply of heroin?

1211
01:25:09,892 --> 01:25:11,043
You�re right.

1212
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:13,096
lt�s probably bullshit.

1213
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:15,723
Even if he did,
he could never unload it.

1214
01:25:15,973 --> 01:25:18,380
Not without drawing
all kinds of attention.

1215
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:22,763
Maybe that�s why he�s under a house in
Elysian Park and he don�t smell too good...

1216
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,477
...paesano.

1217
01:26:15,752 --> 01:26:18,188
Maybe White�s
not so dumb after all.

1218
01:26:30,857 --> 01:26:34,694
We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,
and now Veronica Lake with White.

1219
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:39,403
l think your case and my case are
somehow connected. lt�s Fleur-de-Lis again.

1220
01:26:39,566 --> 01:26:40,678
Fleur-de-Lis?

1221
01:26:41,647 --> 01:26:43,210
"Whatever you desire."

1222
01:26:43,402 --> 01:26:44,457
Porno.

1223
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,536
High-class whores
cut to look like movie stars.

1224
01:26:47,728 --> 01:26:51,209
Who knows what else. Reynolds,
the kid that got killed, was involved.

1225
01:26:51,401 --> 01:26:52,974
So is Pierce Patchett.

1226
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,384
The millionaire?

1227
01:26:54,863 --> 01:26:56,781
l think we should go talk to him.

1228
01:26:57,577 --> 01:26:59,495
First l wanna brace Stompanato.

1229
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:17,488
Want an autograph?
Write to MGM.

1230
01:27:18,284 --> 01:27:21,420
Since when do two-bit hoods
and hookers give out autographs?

1231
01:27:21,804 --> 01:27:22,830
What did you say to me?

1232
01:27:23,022 --> 01:27:24,268
LAPD. Sit down.

1233
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:26,513
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1234
01:27:26,704 --> 01:27:28,201
Take a walk, honey, before
I haul your ass downtown.

1235
01:27:28,527 --> 01:27:31,624
-You are making a large mistake.
-Get away from our table.

1236
01:27:31,816 --> 01:27:32,785
Shut up.

1237
01:27:34,224 --> 01:27:36,362
A hooker cut to look like
Lana Turner is still a hooker.

1238
01:27:37,484 --> 01:27:39,882
-She just looks like Lana Turner.
-She is Lana Turner.

1239
01:27:41,321 --> 01:27:43,085
-What?
-She is Lana Turner.

1240
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,645
How was l supposed to know?

1241
01:28:09,163 --> 01:28:12,817
l believe the Nite Owl�s
your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.

1242
01:28:13,066 --> 01:28:15,569
l saw you on television
getting your medal.

1243
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:18,226
And you�re...

1244
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:22,283
...that other Hollywood
celebrity policeman, aren�t you?

1245
01:28:23,213 --> 01:28:27,021
The Veronica Lake look-alike works
for you. She�s one of your whores.

1246
01:28:28,306 --> 01:28:29,869
A vulgar term.

1247
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:31,346
Why�s she seeing Bud White?

1248
01:28:31,663 --> 01:28:35,182
Why do men and women usually
see each other, Mr. Exley?

1249
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:40,524
Let�s try this on for size:
Fleur-de-Lis.

1250
01:28:41,004 --> 01:28:42,702
"Whatever you desire."

1251
01:28:43,344 --> 01:28:44,850
An actor named...

1252
01:28:45,262 --> 01:28:46,125
...Matt Reynolds.

1253
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:48,782
No? Nothing?

1254
01:28:51,822 --> 01:28:53,587
-No?
-We want some answers.

1255
01:28:56,148 --> 01:28:57,970
We all want something.

1256
01:29:00,205 --> 01:29:02,065
The guy�s as cool as they come.

1257
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:07,244
Lieutenant Exley,
come in, please. Over.

1258
01:29:08,366 --> 01:29:09,134
This is Exley.

1259
01:29:09,326 --> 01:29:12,145
The coroner wants to talk to you Lieutenant.
He says he has your l.D.

1260
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:15,502
-Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.
-Roger.

1261
01:29:15,732 --> 01:29:17,871
-l�ll drop you at your car.
-Where the hell are you going?

1262
01:29:18,063 --> 01:29:19,405
Lynn Bracken�s.

1263
01:29:19,664 --> 01:29:24,143
I'm gonna find out why Patchett has her
seeing Bud White. See you at the Frolic Room.

1264
01:29:24,786 --> 01:29:28,018
Oh, great. You get the girl.
l get the coroner.

1265
01:29:37,647 --> 01:29:40,534
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the Q.T.

1266
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:46,509
Hey.. l was just coming up to see you.
You get that l.D. for me?

1267
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:50,997
Thank God for dental records.
Stiff used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

1268
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:52,110
Buzz Meeks?

1269
01:29:52,302 --> 01:29:53,616
-You knew him?
-Of him.

1270
01:29:53,807 --> 01:29:57,490
He was around when l first joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.

1271
01:29:57,903 --> 01:29:59,217
Hey, "Just the facts," Jack.

1272
01:29:59,408 --> 01:30:01,106
"Just the facts."

1273
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:05,393
Anything else, Sergeant?

1274
01:30:05,585 --> 01:30:09,431
Yeah, Leland Meeks worked Vice �39-�41.
l need to see his arrest records.

1275
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,238
Miss Bracken...

1276
01:30:17,429 --> 01:30:18,743
...l�m Lieutenant Exley.

1277
01:30:18,935 --> 01:30:19,990
l know who you are.

1278
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:22,455
Bud told me all about you.

1279
01:30:22,704 --> 01:30:23,894
ls that so?

1280
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:26,771
And what did White have to say?

1281
01:30:28,209 --> 01:30:30,070
He said you were smart.

1282
01:30:30,703 --> 01:30:34,386
He also said you were a coward, and that
you�d screw yourself to get ahead.

1283
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,167
Let�s concentrate on my smarts.

1284
01:30:37,493 --> 01:30:42,231
Pierce Patchett made you, didn�t he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.

1285
01:30:43,248 --> 01:30:45,108
And l am very impressed with the results.

1286
01:30:46,384 --> 01:30:47,698
But l need some answers.

1287
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:50,872
And if l don�t get them,
l�m gonna take you and Patchett down.

1288
01:30:51,505 --> 01:30:54,066
Pierce Patchett
can take care of himself.

1289
01:30:55,092 --> 01:30:56,953
And l�m not afraid of you.

1290
01:30:57,816 --> 01:31:00,377
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant...

1291
01:31:00,693 --> 01:31:03,187
...Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

1292
01:31:06,774 --> 01:31:08,471
And he tells you who to fuck.

1293
01:31:08,951 --> 01:31:10,898
Why does he have you fucking Bud White?

1294
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,130
What makes you think
l�m not seeing Bud because l want to?

1295
01:31:15,732 --> 01:31:18,935
lt would be easier for you
if there was an angle, wouldn�t it?

1296
01:31:19,673 --> 01:31:22,618
You�re afraid of Bud because you can�t
figure out how to play him.

1297
01:31:23,673 --> 01:31:26,771
He doesn�t follow
the same rules of politics as you do.

1298
01:31:27,509 --> 01:31:29,235
lt makes him dangerous.

1299
01:31:29,427 --> 01:31:30,617
l can handle Bud White.

1300
01:31:30,866 --> 01:31:31,988
Can you?

1301
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:37,973
l see Bud because l want to.

1302
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,533
l see Bud because
he can�t hide the good inside of him.

1303
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:48,916
l see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken...

1304
01:31:49,108 --> 01:31:52,378
...and not some Veronica Lake look-alike
who fucks for money.

1305
01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:58,554
l see Bud because he doesn�t
know how to disguise who he is.

1306
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:03,992
l see Bud for all the ways
he�s different from you.

1307
01:32:06,294 --> 01:32:08,308
Don�t underestimate me Miss Bracken.

1308
01:32:08,788 --> 01:32:11,675
The way you�ve underestimated Bud White?

1309
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,469
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren�t the same thing you know.

1310
01:32:20,949 --> 01:32:22,867
Stop talking about Bud White.

1311
01:32:46,777 --> 01:32:48,628
Come on.

1312
01:32:51,256 --> 01:32:52,474
Shit.

1313
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:06,937
Jack Vincennes.

1314
01:33:07,896 --> 01:33:09,497
lt�s going on midnight, Jack.

1315
01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:11,578
l need 2 minutes, Dudley.

1316
01:33:11,895 --> 01:33:13,017
lt�s important.

1317
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:17,755
I�s a good thing for you my wife and four
daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

1318
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:23,385
Do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

1319
01:33:23,576 --> 01:33:25,725
A disgrace as a police officer.

1320
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:29,916
Straight D fitness reports from every
C.O. he ever served under. Why?

1321
01:33:30,616 --> 01:33:33,397
12 years ago, he was on a Vice roust
with Dick Stensland.

1322
01:33:33,599 --> 01:33:36,764
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

1323
01:33:36,956 --> 01:33:40,955
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.

1324
01:33:41,655 --> 01:33:44,503
Anyway, charges were dropped.
lnsufficient evidence.

1325
01:33:44,695 --> 01:33:49,021
You were the supervising officer on that case.
I was wondering if you remember anything about it?

1326
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,677
What�s this about, boyo?

1327
01:33:52,473 --> 01:33:55,993
Part of it has to do with a murder
l�ve been working with Ed Exley on.

1328
01:33:56,377 --> 01:33:58,909
You�re Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

1329
01:33:59,101 --> 01:34:01,182
Since when do you work
with Edmund Exley?

1330
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:04,567
Well.. lt�s a private investigation.

1331
01:34:06,553 --> 01:34:08,922
l messed something up.
l�m trying to make amends.

1332
01:34:09,113 --> 01:34:11,415
Don�t start trying
to do the right thing, boyo.

1333
01:34:11,904 --> 01:34:13,017
You haven�t had the practice.

1334
01:34:20,056 --> 01:34:22,876
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.

1335
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:28,477
So, what does Exley make of all this?

1336
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:32,093
Oh l haven�t told him yet.
l just came straight from the records room.

1337
01:34:56,799 --> 01:34:58,937
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1338
01:35:05,018 --> 01:35:06,562
Rollo...

1339
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:09,180
...Tomasi.

1340
01:35:29,187 --> 01:35:32,611
Sergeant Vincennes was killed
by a .32 slug to the heart.

1341
01:35:32,802 --> 01:35:35,104
Time of death, approximately 1 A.M.

1342
01:35:35,612 --> 01:35:40,063
Although he was found in Echo Park, preliminary
forensics indicates the body was most likely moved.

1343
01:35:41,664 --> 01:35:44,867
l want 2-man teams
to scour that entire neighborhood.

1344
01:35:45,659 --> 01:35:48,028
Our justice must be swift...

1345
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,725
...and merciless.

1346
01:35:51,807 --> 01:35:52,766
That is all.

1347
01:36:02,203 --> 01:36:03,738
Edmund! Might l have a word with you?

1348
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:10,010
We�re trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

1349
01:36:10,202 --> 01:36:12,926
The records check has led to a dead end.

1350
01:36:13,175 --> 01:36:14,364
What�s the name?

1351
01:36:14,623 --> 01:36:16,119
Rollo Tomasi?

1352
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,898
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?

1353
01:36:22,622 --> 01:36:24,281
No. No, l haven�t.

1354
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,688
Well, it�s probably nothing. Still...

1355
01:36:31,743 --> 01:36:33,728
...keep your eyes open, eh boyo.

1356
01:36:43,482 --> 01:36:46,177
Yeah l know it�s unlikely, but suppose,
just for a moment...

1357
01:36:46,368 --> 01:36:49,562
...somebody did have that much of heroin,
who would they go to to move it?

1358
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,161
White, in my office.

1359
01:36:52,382 --> 01:36:54,847
Captain.
Look, just give me a name.

1360
01:36:55,585 --> 01:36:56,928
Mickey Cohen.

1361
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:03,546
Captain?

1362
01:37:03,737 --> 01:37:06,298
l could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

1363
01:37:07,583 --> 01:37:08,734
When?

1364
01:37:09,981 --> 01:37:10,978
Now, Wendell.

1365
01:37:13,242 --> 01:37:14,843
-Right.
-Close the door, lad.

1366
01:37:22,046 --> 01:37:24,770
You�re a bit of a puzzlement
to me these days, Wendell.

1367
01:37:25,182 --> 01:37:27,263
You don�t seem to be
your old cruel self anymore.

1368
01:37:27,906 --> 01:37:30,755
And l had such
grand plans for your future.

1369
01:37:30,946 --> 01:37:32,126
What plans?

1370
01:37:33,507 --> 01:37:37,343
You have your extracurricular activities
and l have mine.

1371
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:43,165
We must have a clarification session
one of these days.

1372
01:37:44,287 --> 01:37:45,179
However...

1373
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,260
...right now...

1374
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,847
...we�re gonna brace a man who
may know who killed Jack Vincennes.

1375
01:37:51,164 --> 01:37:52,861
So the question is...

1376
01:37:53,187 --> 01:37:54,626
...can l count on you, lad?

1377
01:37:54,846 --> 01:37:56,611
-Yes or no?
-Yes, sir.

1378
01:38:01,502 --> 01:38:05,089
l want to know everything you and
Jack Vincennes talked about last night.

1379
01:38:05,348 --> 01:38:07,295
Start with the l.D. on the corpse.

1380
01:38:07,487 --> 01:38:08,580
An ex-cop.

1381
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:10,652
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.

1382
01:38:10,844 --> 01:38:12,129
An ex-cop?

1383
01:38:12,609 --> 01:38:14,047
What did Jack say?
Did he know him?

1384
01:38:14,623 --> 01:38:16,579
Only by reputation.

1385
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:24,674
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

1386
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:27,388
l�m willing to cooperate.
There's no need to tie me down.

1387
01:38:27,589 --> 01:38:29,249
lt�s for your own safety.

1388
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,289
Nowm, what can you tell us
about Sergeant Jack Vincennes?

1389
01:38:33,564 --> 01:38:35,646
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1390
01:38:35,905 --> 01:38:38,686
l can tell you he�s on
the night train to the Big Adios.

1391
01:38:42,781 --> 01:38:46,205
l didn�t have anyhting to do with him
getting killed, if that�s what you mean.

1392
01:38:46,464 --> 01:38:50,214
-But you were business associates.
-What�s that got to do with anything?

1393
01:38:51,998 --> 01:38:54,146
Okay.. okay, so we worked together.

1394
01:38:54,597 --> 01:38:56,582
lt was an information exchange.

1395
01:38:56,774 --> 01:39:01,061
l got him first-class collars, he got me
good stories. We were friends, for Christ�s sake!

1396
01:39:01,215 --> 01:39:02,653
We�ll drop that for the moment.

1397
01:39:03,142 --> 01:39:04,897
Would you care to comment on Pierce Patchett?

1398
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:09,060
Patchett? You think he had something
to do with Vincennes getting iced?

1399
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,896
Wendell, l�d like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

1400
01:39:13,443 --> 01:39:15,879
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1401
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:20,127
Everybody knows that Patchett�s
worth a boatload of greenbacks.

1402
01:39:20,578 --> 01:39:22,372
But the man has hobbies too.

1403
01:39:22,564 --> 01:39:25,057
He bankrolls B-movies under the table.

1404
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:27,014
And try this one on.

1405
01:39:27,205 --> 01:39:29,344
He�s rumored to be a
periodic heroin sniffer.

1406
01:39:29,536 --> 01:39:32,327
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

1407
01:39:32,615 --> 01:39:33,219
And?

1408
01:39:33,411 --> 01:39:34,562
And what?

1409
01:39:38,503 --> 01:39:42,081
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key
to every relationship.

1410
01:39:45,121 --> 01:39:46,627
He runs call girls.

1411
01:39:48,487 --> 01:39:51,460
Primo tail fixed up
to look like movie stars.

1412
01:39:54,088 --> 01:39:54,952
And?

1413
01:39:55,527 --> 01:39:57,061
Blackmail shit.

1414
01:39:57,762 --> 01:40:00,006
ln my car, in the trunk,
under the rug....

1415
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:04,772
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.

1416
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:06,240
She looks like Veronica Lake.

1417
01:40:08,455 --> 01:40:09,251
Leave him!

1418
01:40:09,443 --> 01:40:11,112
l said leave him be!

1419
01:40:11,304 --> 01:40:12,608
Get him away from me!

1420
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,577
Back off!

1421
01:40:13,769 --> 01:40:14,728
Back off, Wendell! Back off!

1422
01:40:57,128 --> 01:41:01,866
l wouldn�t trade places with Exley right
now for all the whiskey in lreland.

1423
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:09,385
Dudley! Dudley, l thought you were going to
let the dumb bastard kill me!

1424
01:41:10,018 --> 01:41:12,291
And you.. learn to pull your
punches a little better.

1425
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:14,507
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1426
01:41:19,945 --> 01:41:21,220
Fellas...

1427
01:41:22,918 --> 01:41:23,819
...Dudley, we had a deal!

1428
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:25,603
You, me, Patchett, we�re a team. We're...

1429
01:41:30,504 --> 01:41:31,780
Hush-hush.

1430
01:41:32,902 --> 01:41:34,791
-Anything?
-Nothing.

1431
01:41:34,983 --> 01:41:37,669
So "Buzz" Meeks never made an arrest
the entire time he worked Vice?

1432
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:39,750
Someone must�ve pulled the files.

1433
01:41:42,243 --> 01:41:44,075
What about the daily report books?

1434
01:41:44,267 --> 01:41:45,993
They�d be buried down in the basement.

1435
01:41:46,185 --> 01:41:47,365
Find them.

1436
01:42:17,096 --> 01:42:18,602
Did you talk to Exley?

1437
01:42:19,081 --> 01:42:20,779
Come in out of the rain.

1438
01:42:22,697 --> 01:42:24,682
l wanna know what
happened with Exley.

1439
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,656
Just come in.

1440
01:42:28,941 --> 01:42:31,463
Are you gonna to tell me what
happened with you and Exley?

1441
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:33,285
We talked.

1442
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:34,983
So tell me about him.

1443
01:42:35,175 --> 01:42:36,364
Later.

1444
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,282
No!
Now!

1445
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:42,886
You fucked him.

1446
01:42:46,377 --> 01:42:47,719
You fucked him.

1447
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:50,376
l thought l was helping you.

1448
01:43:39,337 --> 01:43:41,485
But l�m glad you�re here.
l need you to see this.

1449
01:43:50,702 --> 01:43:51,661
Wait....

1450
01:44:17,422 --> 01:44:18,860
Dudley killed Jack.

1451
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:21,258
He wants you to kill me.

1452
01:44:24,202 --> 01:44:26,130
He showed you the photo, didn�t he?

1453
01:44:26,926 --> 01:44:27,885
Didn�t he?

1454
01:44:30,446 --> 01:44:32,335
Think! ! Goddamn you, think!!

1455
01:44:34,925 --> 01:44:36,018
Get out!

1456
01:44:51,824 --> 01:44:53,905
l checked the daily report books.

1457
01:44:55,027 --> 01:44:58,317
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

1458
01:45:01,741 --> 01:45:03,563
l knew Stensland lied to me.

1459
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:09,423
Lefferts� mother l.D.�d
Stensland as Lefferts� boyfriend.

1460
01:45:11,092 --> 01:45:15,503
Stensland pretended he didn�t know
Meeks or her the night that l met...

1461
01:45:16,789 --> 01:45:17,901
...Lynn.

1462
01:45:18,764 --> 01:45:20,308
Stensland and Meeks...

1463
01:45:20,788 --> 01:45:22,380
...what the hell were they up to?

1464
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:26,389
l don�t know. But l think
Stens killed Meeks over heroin.

1465
01:45:26,868 --> 01:45:27,885
What heroin?

1466
01:45:33,649 --> 01:45:37,102
Johnny Stompanato told me
that Meeks had heroin for sale.

1467
01:45:37,428 --> 01:45:39,020
Meeks ends up dead.

1468
01:45:39,509 --> 01:45:41,523
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1469
01:45:42,453 --> 01:45:44,141
lt wasn�t the Negroes.

1470
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:46,961
The rape victim lied
in her statement.

1471
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:50,989
The first guys to the Mercury coupe
were Breuning and Carlisle.

1472
01:45:51,181 --> 01:45:52,629
Dudley�s guys.

1473
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,739
They planted the shotguns.

1474
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:58,125
They�d have killed the Negroes too
if Jack and l hadn�t shown up.

1475
01:45:59,093 --> 01:46:02,134
Dudley framed them because
they were Negroes and had records.

1476
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:04,944
He knew there�d be no questions asked if they were...

1477
01:46:06,286 --> 01:46:08,559
...if they were killed resisting arrest.

1478
01:46:09,586 --> 01:46:11,830
Somehow this is all connected
to Jack�s angle.

1479
01:46:12,463 --> 01:46:13,806
Sid Hudgens...

1480
01:46:14,295 --> 01:46:16,462
...the pictures
to blackmail Ellis Loew....

1481
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,611
A kid got murdered.

1482
01:46:19,733 --> 01:46:21,871
If we�re gonna figure this out,
we need to work together.

1483
01:46:27,348 --> 01:46:28,949
Why are you doing this?

1484
01:46:30,868 --> 01:46:32,623
The Nite Owl made you.

1485
01:46:34,387 --> 01:46:35,951
You want to tear all that down?

1486
01:46:37,495 --> 01:46:39,183
With a wrecking ball.

1487
01:46:39,662 --> 01:46:41,427
Wanna help me swing it?

1488
01:46:53,204 --> 01:46:55,123
Let�s go see Ellis Loew.

1489
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:58,259
Find out what the
District Attorney knows.

1490
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,571
May I...
Hey.. You can�t go in there.

1491
01:47:09,748 --> 01:47:12,818
-D you want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
-Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.

1492
01:47:13,009 --> 01:47:16,663
Tell him we�re having a discussion about the death
 of an unemployed actor at a Sunset Strip motel.

1493
01:47:16,855 --> 01:47:17,910
These <i>are</i> the police.

1494
01:47:24,374 --> 01:47:25,554
What do you want?

1495
01:47:25,745 --> 01:47:29,841
l want D.A. Bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Pierce Patchett 24 hours a day.

1496
01:47:30,128 --> 01:47:33,399
l want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.

1497
01:47:33,591 --> 01:47:35,797
And l want authorization
to check their bank records.

1498
01:47:36,305 --> 01:47:37,657
On what evidence?

1499
01:47:38,233 --> 01:47:39,825
Call it a hunch.

1500
01:47:41,014 --> 01:47:42,673
Absolutely not.

1501
01:47:42,865 --> 01:47:45,713
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated
member of this police department.

1502
01:47:45,905 --> 01:47:47,862
l�m not gonna smear his and
Pierce Patchett�s name without..

1503
01:47:48,054 --> 01:47:49,396
Without what?

1504
01:47:49,751 --> 01:47:51,410
Them smearing your�s first?

1505
01:47:51,736 --> 01:47:55,314
What do they have in you, Loew? Pictures of
you and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?

1506
01:47:57,587 --> 01:47:58,613
You have any proof?

1507
01:47:59,256 --> 01:48:00,915
The proof had his throat slit.

1508
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:04,310
So far, you�re not denying it.

1509
01:48:05,585 --> 01:48:07,475
Well, l�m not gonna dignify this with answers.

1510
01:48:07,667 --> 01:48:10,036
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me...

1511
01:48:10,227 --> 01:48:13,910
...l have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that l have to prepare for.

1512
01:48:23,827 --> 01:48:27,577
Unless you came in to wipe my ass,
l believe we�re through.

1513
01:48:32,056 --> 01:48:36,218
Don�t pull that good cop-bad cop crap.
l practically invented it.

1514
01:48:36,947 --> 01:48:39,067
So what if some homo-actor is dead?

1515
01:48:39,259 --> 01:48:42,232
Boys, girls, ten of them
get off the bus to L.A. everyday.

1516
01:48:49,818 --> 01:48:51,065
Pull him off of me, I say!!

1517
01:48:51,257 --> 01:48:52,149
l don�t know how.

1518
01:48:55,899 --> 01:48:59,639
l know you think you�re the A-number-one
hotshot, but here�s the juice.

1519
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:02,200
But if l take you out, 10 more lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

1520
01:49:02,392 --> 01:49:04,156
They just won�t come on a bus, that's all!

1521
01:49:17,497 --> 01:49:18,552
Okay!

1522
01:49:19,837 --> 01:49:21,976
Dudley and Patchett, they....

1523
01:49:23,002 --> 01:49:24,124
Oh, my God!

1524
01:49:24,316 --> 01:49:26,263
l wouldn�t play ball so they set me up!

1525
01:49:26,455 --> 01:49:28,469
So l gave in!
But the kid heard everything...

1526
01:49:29,917 --> 01:49:30,838
...so they killed him.

1527
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:31,989
Why?

1528
01:49:32,343 --> 01:49:35,643
-What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
-They�re aking over Mickey Cohen�s rackets.

1529
01:49:35,834 --> 01:49:39,613
Because of those pictures
l couldn�t prosecute them!

1530
01:49:39,997 --> 01:49:41,301
Oh, Jesus!

1531
01:49:41,493 --> 01:49:42,395
Help me up!

1532
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:53,242
ls that how <i>you</i> used to
run the good cop-bad cop?

1533
01:49:55,678 --> 01:49:56,790
Patchett?

1534
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:33,341
Looks like his bodyguard
had a conflict of interest.

1535
01:50:39,517 --> 01:50:40,831
Suicide note.

1536
01:50:41,023 --> 01:50:45,272
Says he killed Jack because Jack had
figured out his pornography scam.

1537
01:50:45,502 --> 01:50:47,583
Slicing himself open wasn�t his idea.

1538
01:50:48,954 --> 01:50:50,364
2 of his fingers
are broken.

1539
01:50:50,556 --> 01:50:51,419
They must�ve held him there.

1540
01:50:53,568 --> 01:50:54,460
Or drugged him.

1541
01:50:57,759 --> 01:50:59,485
I say Dudley�s tying up his loose ends.

1542
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:01,566
Patchett�s dead.

1543
01:51:01,758 --> 01:51:03,360
He sent you after me.

1544
01:51:04,952 --> 01:51:06,074
Lynn.

1545
01:51:07,196 --> 01:51:08,347
West-Hollywood Sheriff.

1546
01:51:08,539 --> 01:51:11,263
-They�re closer than we are.
-l�ll get the car. Keys!

1547
01:51:18,465 --> 01:51:20,959
Hey, we took her to the station
for safekeeping.

1548
01:51:21,918 --> 01:51:25,342
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless l okay it.

1549
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,711
Somebody worked her over.

1550
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:29,504
She wouldn�t say who.

1551
01:51:34,463 --> 01:51:35,997
-See you, Exley.
-Sure.

1552
01:51:39,104 --> 01:51:40,543
We should talk to Lynn.

1553
01:51:41,502 --> 01:51:42,624
You do it.

1554
01:51:43,257 --> 01:51:44,379
What�re you gonna do?

1555
01:51:47,516 --> 01:51:49,338
l�m gonna talk to Sid Hudgens.

1556
01:51:50,019 --> 01:51:52,608
Compliment him on his
performance at the Victory Motel.

1557
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,939
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.

1558
01:51:56,061 --> 01:51:57,500
l�ll get the evidence.

1559
01:52:09,507 --> 01:52:10,466
Are you okay?

1560
01:52:13,123 --> 01:52:14,082
You okay?

1561
01:52:24,315 --> 01:52:26,243
Bud hates himself for what he did.

1562
01:52:27,423 --> 01:52:29,341
l know how he feels.

1563
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:34,299
Lynn, l need to know what you
can give me on Dudley Smith.

1564
01:52:36,323 --> 01:52:38,625
He�s a police captain.
He�s in business with Patchett.

1565
01:52:39,267 --> 01:52:40,706
l�ve never heard of him.

1566
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:46,307
Do you have some place you can stay?

1567
01:52:48,004 --> 01:52:49,443
l�ll be okay.

1568
01:52:55,744 --> 01:52:57,988
Nobody goes in without official l.D.!

1569
01:53:02,563 --> 01:53:04,165
He�s okay. Let him through.

1570
01:53:07,589 --> 01:53:08,864
What happened?

1571
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,355
Someone beat him to death,
and stole a bunch of files.

1572
01:53:12,547 --> 01:53:14,465
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

1573
01:53:14,878 --> 01:53:16,767
We got it narrowed down
to a thousand suspects.

1574
01:53:17,985 --> 01:53:19,203
Sergeant White...

1575
01:53:20,162 --> 01:53:21,726
...dispatch got a call for you.

1576
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:24,833
Lieutenant Exley wants you
to meet him at the Victory Motel.

1577
01:53:57,442 --> 01:53:58,947
You wanted to meet here?

1578
01:54:00,961 --> 01:54:03,839
-You called it. l thought Hudgens was..
-Hudgens is dead.

1579
01:54:14,791 --> 01:54:16,326
Let�s get out of here.

1580
01:54:23,433 --> 01:54:24,708
lt�s too late.

1581
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:14,273
You figured this was a set-up
but came anyway?

1582
01:55:14,465 --> 01:55:16,393
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

1583
01:55:16,872 --> 01:55:19,049
lt�s as good a place
as any for it to end.

1584
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:29,925
Here!
Clip.

1585
01:55:34,788 --> 01:55:37,444
All l ever wanted was to
measure up to my father.

1586
01:55:38,471 --> 01:55:39,363
Now�s your chance.

1587
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:43,755
He died in the line of duty, didn�t he?

1588
01:57:38,508 --> 01:57:39,439
Goddamn it!

1589
01:58:37,357 --> 01:58:38,058
You okay?

1590
01:58:38,892 --> 01:58:40,081
Yeah.

1591
01:58:57,834 --> 01:58:59,761
Come on. Easy.

1592
01:59:06,254 --> 01:59:07,117
Move!

1593
01:59:28,879 --> 01:59:30,318
Rollo Tomasi.

1594
01:59:33,617 --> 01:59:34,892
Who is he?

1595
01:59:35,698 --> 01:59:36,782
You are.

1596
01:59:38,959 --> 01:59:40,724
You�re the guy who gets away with it.

1597
01:59:44,656 --> 01:59:45,739
Jack knew it.

1598
01:59:45,931 --> 01:59:47,216
And so do l.

1599
02:00:11,855 --> 02:00:13,524
Are you gonna shoot me...

1600
02:00:14,732 --> 02:00:15,759
...or arrest me?

1601
02:00:21,839 --> 02:00:23,124
Good lad.

1602
02:00:23,853 --> 02:00:25,714
Always the politician.

1603
02:00:26,318 --> 02:00:28,083
Let me do the talking.

1604
02:00:28,658 --> 02:00:31,602
After l�m done,
they�ll make you Chief of Detectives.

1605
02:00:58,322 --> 02:00:59,924
Hold up your badge...

1606
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:02,101
...so they�ll know you�re a policeman.

1607
02:01:50,582 --> 02:01:53,297
You think you can talk your
way out of this, Lieutenant?

1608
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:56,912
No...

1609
02:01:57,171 --> 02:01:58,706
...but l think I can tell the truth.

1610
02:01:59,636 --> 02:02:01,458
During our investigation...

1611
02:02:02,513 --> 02:02:05,496
...of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

1612
02:02:06,513 --> 02:02:09,812
...Jack Vincennes, Bud White
and l learned the following:

1613
02:02:10,522 --> 02:02:12,881
Your golden boy�s
throwing his whole life away.

1614
02:02:13,073 --> 02:02:14,578
The 3 Nite Owl suspects...

1615
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:17,811
...while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

1616
02:02:18,616 --> 02:02:21,493
...were innocent of the
multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.

1617
02:02:22,769 --> 02:02:24,658
The actual gunmen were most likely...

1618
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:29,463
...Los Angeles police officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle...

1619
02:02:29,655 --> 02:02:31,094
...and a third man...

1620
02:02:31,736 --> 02:02:35,256
...who may or may not have been
Captain Dudley Smith.

1621
02:02:36,282 --> 02:02:37,654
The objective:

1622
02:02:38,613 --> 02:02:41,145
The elimination of
another police officer...

1623
02:02:41,337 --> 02:02:43,092
...Richard Stensland...

1624
02:02:43,955 --> 02:02:48,693
...who, along with former LAPD officer
Leland "Buzz" Meeks...

1625
02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:53,335
...also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

1626
02:02:53,977 --> 02:02:55,483
...and then betrayed him...

1627
02:02:55,732 --> 02:02:57,881
...over 25 pounds of heroin...

1628
02:02:58,936 --> 02:03:00,691
...the retrieval of which...

1629
02:03:01,017 --> 02:03:03,894
...was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

1630
02:03:07,001 --> 02:03:10,138
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

1631
02:03:10,521 --> 02:03:15,259
...Capt. Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in the city of Los Angeles.

1632
02:03:17,014 --> 02:03:20,601
This includes the assassinations of an unknown
number of Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

1633
02:03:21,177 --> 02:03:24,217
...the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

1634
02:03:25,723 --> 02:03:30,134
...and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

1635
02:03:31,477 --> 02:03:33,501
...and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1636
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:39,322
Captain Smith admitted as much to me...

1637
02:03:39,898 --> 02:03:41,720
...before l shot him...

1638
02:03:42,132 --> 02:03:43,801
...at the Victory Motel.

1639
02:03:45,978 --> 02:03:47,005
That�s it.

1640
02:03:49,239 --> 02:03:50,361
Well...

1641
02:03:51,733 --> 02:03:53,718
...the press is gonna
have a field day with this.

1642
02:03:55,253 --> 02:03:56,662
This.. Christ!

1643
02:03:56,854 --> 02:03:59,070
lt�ll stain the Department for years.

1644
02:03:59,262 --> 02:04:00,125
Decades.

1645
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:03,894
lf we can get the kid to play ball...

1646
02:04:04,853 --> 02:04:06,618
...who�s to say what happened?

1647
02:04:07,644 --> 02:04:10,042
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1648
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:12,765
-Good idea.
-lf we get the press to play.

1649
02:04:20,284 --> 02:04:22,845
You wanna tell me what
you�re smiling about?

1650
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:29,338
A hero.

1651
02:04:29,885 --> 02:04:31,544
How�d he know what we said?

1652
02:04:31,736 --> 02:04:33,337
He couldn�t have heard us.

1653
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:38,775
ln this situation...

1654
02:04:39,159 --> 02:04:41,020
...you�ll need more than one.

1655
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:52,375
lt is with great pleasure that I present this
 award to Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...

1656
02:04:52,922 --> 02:04:54,936
...two-time Medal of Valor recipient.

1657
02:05:04,699 --> 02:05:08,536
Next year the LAPD
will move into its new facility.

1658
02:05:08,862 --> 02:05:10,492
With leaders like Lieutenant Edmund Exley...

1659
02:05:10,684 --> 02:05:13,695
...the image of fat cops stealing apples
will be left behind forever...

1660
02:05:13,887 --> 02:05:17,656
...and Los Angeles will finally
have the police force it deserves.

1661
02:05:31,007 --> 02:05:33,050
You just couldn�t resist.

1662
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,745
They�re using me.
So for a while, l�m using them.

1663
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:38,689
Come on.

1664
02:06:12,218 --> 02:06:13,475
Thanks for the push.

1665
02:06:34,334 --> 02:06:36,291
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.

1666
02:06:39,485 --> 02:06:41,499
Some men get the world...

1667
02:06:41,988 --> 02:06:45,412
...others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.
