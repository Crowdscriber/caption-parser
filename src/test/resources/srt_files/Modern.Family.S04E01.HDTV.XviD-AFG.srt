1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:02,486
Good morning!

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,158
There's the birthday boy!

3
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:06,465
65 candles on one cake.

4
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:07,911
This is a big day for you...

5
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:10,348
and for the astronauts
who can see it from space.

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,955
Happy birthday to you.

7
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:15,627
Thank you. And just so everyone knows,
I want a quiet day.

8
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,171
No surprises.

9
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,253
No surprises.

10
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,042
Last night, I found out
that I am pregnant,

11
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:24,676
so Jay's gonna get one big surprise.

12
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,015
Okay, two if you count

13
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:29,592
the barbecue apron
with the bikini body on it.

14
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,880
I don't blame you, Jay.

15
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,061
You'd had enough excitement
in one lifetime...

16
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:36,146
The dawn of flight,
printed books, agriculture.

17
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:37,661
All right, what's with all the jokes?

18
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,936
It's insult comedy.

19
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,241
I've been watching old
Dean Martin roasts online.

20
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,772
Like this guy knows
from the Internet.

21
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:44,446
The other morning,

22
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,366
I saw him looking for the crank
on the front of his car.

23
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,607
- Okay, you're done.
- I make fun, and we laugh.

24
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,058
But in all seriousness,

25
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,521
if you see a light today,
don't walk towards it.

26
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,703
I'm sorry I was asleep
when you got home.

27
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,066
Cam and Mitch must be disappointed.

28
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:01,511
They were really geared up
to get that kid.

29
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:03,144
But there's a silver lining.

30
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:05,942
You might be right.
Babies are a lot of work.

31
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:07,262
No, that's not what I mean.

32
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:08,282
I'm...

33
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:10,000
Ah, you know, and these two
aren't getting any younger.

34
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,716
The last thing they need
is to start over.

35
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,202
Would that be so bad?

36
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:16,241
Hey, Jay.

37
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,133
- Hey!
- Hi.

38
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,912
What are you doing?

39
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,444
- What the heck is that?
- What?

40
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:21,302
Get him!

41
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,118
Jay has been very explicit

42
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,959
about what he wants
to do for his 65th birthday,

43
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:30,736
but Phil Dunphy
reads between the lines.

44
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:33,584
What the hell is going on?!
What are you doing?!

45
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,140
Making your birthday dreams
comes true.

46
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,603
It's your special day, buddy.

47
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:37,590
Should we put him in the trunk?

48
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,798
Why would we put him in the trunk?

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,089
You said there were no bad ideas.

50
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,643
Get this stupid thing off me!

51
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,192
I thought you said the hood
would calm him down.

52
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,502
It works with my falcon.

53
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,709
Don't worry, Gloria.
We'll have him back in time for dinner.

54
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,671
Which for him is
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

55
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,950
'Cause he's old! I love it!

58
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:06,619
This is really good coffee.

59
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,029
It really is.

60
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:09,961
- Ahh.
- Is it a medium roast or...

61
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,116
Uh, dark.

62
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,713
Oh. I was gonna say dark.
I don't know why I said medium.

63
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:14,888
Well, you would've been right.

64
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,947
Is it whole milk or...

65
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,356
- 2%.
- 2%.

66
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,639
Okay. This is ridiculous.

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,624
We need to talk about
the elephant in the room.

68
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,673
The giant stuffed elephant

69
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,723
was a gift from
our good friend Pepper.

70
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,532
Gay guys having kids is...
it's relatively new,

71
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,231
so our community has not yet learned

72
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:38,734
how to modulate baby gifts.

73
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,936
When Steven and Stefan
had little Rocco,

74
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,261
our friend Longinus sent over

75
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,904
the whole cast of "Yo gabba gabba".

76
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,956
Now Rocco cries whenever
he sees bright colors.

77
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,242
I'm not allowed over there.

78
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,060
I guess we should
donate it somewhere,

79
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,626
along with the 800-pound gorilla.

80
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,754
I mean, you know, now that
we're not getting a baby.

81
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:57,841
A decision, by the way,

82
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,836
which seems even better
in the light of day.

83
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:01,358
Mm. No, I totally agree.

84
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:03,213
- So we're good?
- No, we're great.

85
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,554
We couldn't have
handled this any better.

86
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:05,093
No.

87
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,288
Where's my new baby brother?

88
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,403
Okay. Uh, slight oversight.

89
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,580
Can I see him?
Can we name him Larry?

90
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,002
Okay, sweetie.
Here, have a seat with us.

91
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,035
Um, listen.

92
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,334
There's something
we need to tell you.

93
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,798
Is it about Larry?

94
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,018
Well, uh, yes.
Uh, sort of.

95
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,119
Um, it... it turns out that...
We're not getting a baby.

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
Yeah, and I know this...
this makes you very sad,

97
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,131
but I promise you
we're still a family...

98
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:31,501
Can I have a kitten?

99
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:32,694
A kitten?

100
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,205
If I can't have a brother,

101
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,904
then I want a kitten named Larry.

102
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,624
Okay, w-what's this about?
Is Larry on a show?

103
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:43,388
He's not, which is what's weird.

104
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:48,392
- Ooh! How was prom?
- So fun.

105
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,755
Michael and I danced all night...

106
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,151
And then we stayed after
and helped clean up,

107
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:51,859
which was awesome

108
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,147
because I got to meet
next year's trig teacher.

109
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:56,047
That is not the prom I remember.

110
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:57,968
I have such a bad headache!

111
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,513
That's the prom I remember.

112
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:00,720
Were you drinking?

113
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:03,063
Mom, do we really have to do this?

114
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,019
You ask if I was drinking,
I say "No,"

115
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,883
and we both know
that that's not true.

116
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:10,134
I mean, aren't we past
this point in our relationship?

117
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:11,575
No, young lady, we are not.

118
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:12,880
Then I wasn't drinking.

119
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,582
Me neither, Mrs. D.

120
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,331
Dear God. Tell me he
did not spend the night here.

121
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:20,612
Mom, do we really have to do this?

122
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,376
Mom, I have a big decision to make

123
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,900
about poetry camp this summer.

124
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,901
Is this about
the walking sticks again?

125
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,884
Pack them all and decide
when you're there.

126
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:32,405
I can either focus
on sonnets or free verse.

127
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:34,623
I've always fancied
myself a sonneteer,

128
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,363
But I'm thinking the free verse girls

129
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,892
will be freer with everything,

130
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,271
If you catch my meaning.

131
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,336
Hmm? Ay. I'm sorry, Manny.

132
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,416
I'm sure you will make
the right decision.

133
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,512
Are you okay?
You seem distracted.

134
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:49,373
Manny, sit down.
I have to tell you something.

135
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:50,840
What?

136
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,967
I am pregnant.

137
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,514
You're what?

138
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,099
I'm going to have a baby.

139
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:58,920
Wow.

140
00:04:58,921 --> 00:04:59,939
What?

141
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,167
You're not happy?

142
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,344
Yeah. Sure.

143
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,164
It's just a lot to take in.

144
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,870
And I'll be honest, this isn't coming
at a great time for me,

145
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,487
with everything I've got going on.

146
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:10,529
This is not your responsibility.

147
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,926
Neither is our wooden salad bowl,

148
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,362
but I'm the only one who oils it.

149
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,706
Without me, that thing would
soak up dressing like a sponge.

150
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,519
Manny, I can take care of a baby.

151
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,727
I took care of you.

152
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,432
Please. I was an anomaly.
I self-potty trained.

153
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,450
I just did not get the appeal

154
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,565
of intentionally soiling one's pants.

155
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:26,865
That said,

156
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,178
I will admit to missing
the kisses on my tummy.

157
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,026
How did Jay take it?

158
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,683
I haven't been able to tell him yet.

159
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,416
He might not be too thrilled.

160
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,675
Do you think? I was starting
to wonder the same thing.

161
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:40,235
He doesn't deal well with change.

162
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,160
I know.

163
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:44,032
He still checks the front step
for the evening paper.

164
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,418
Don't worry, mom.
I'm sure he'll adapt.

165
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:49,805
Although, he still does
call the remote the "Clicker."

166
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,602
Ay, yeah.

167
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,591
I'm bored, daddy.
Make the car dance.

168
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,522
All right.
But just for a second, all right?

169
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:05,909
Do it again.

170
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,461
No. Once was enough.

171
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:12,044
If I can't have a brother,
then I want the car to dance.

172
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:14,524
Wow, you are really comfortable
playing that card.

173
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:16,231
Hey!

174
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:19,541
They wouldn't take 'em.

175
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,702
They were afraid
they might have bedbugs.

176
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,495
Are you serious?
They rejected our donation?

177
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:27,539
I was so offended,

178
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,187
I almost didn't buy
this fiestaware creamer.

179
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,018
2 bucks.

180
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,233
Didn't know what they had.

181
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:32,901
Ah! Score.

182
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:35,140
So what are we gonna do now?

183
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:38,309
Get a kitten and then name it Larry.

184
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:40,831
Lily, honey, this is hardly
the day to get a kitten, okay?

185
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:41,875
Would you just tell her?

186
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,121
I don't know.

187
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,035
I kinda want one now.

188
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,028
You know, we have been through a lot,

189
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:50,584
and maybe the presence
of a cuddly little friend

190
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,274
will help us ease the pain.

191
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:53,993
Okay, so what you're saying is,

192
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:55,784
You have a child-shaped
hole in your heart,

193
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:58,554
And your plan is
to cram a cat into there?

194
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,133
He has a name.

195
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:04,979
I can't wait till your eyes
adjust to the light,

196
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,578
and we see the look on your face.

197
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,903
I hate you guys.

198
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:10,229
Hey, Phil, you ever think
about growing a beard?

199
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,698
I mean, you got the face for it.

200
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,589
- You think?
- Yeah.

201
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,663
That's funny. I always thought so,
but my wife doesn't.

202
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:15,437
Oh, what does she know?

203
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,928
Come on, you got a great nose,
those deep-set eyes.

204
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,313
I mean, you would look good.

205
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:20,636
Thanks, Shorty.

206
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:23,609
It's, uh, sort of a Jon Hamm
in between projects.

207
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,958
Okay, put me back in the trunk.

208
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,978
Relax, you're almost there.

209
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,100
Nope, I'm done now!

210
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:28,549
- Hey, Jay, no!
- No! No! No! Hey!

211
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,963
Jay! Jay!

212
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,748
- Jay!
- Son of a bitch!

213
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:33,957
Somebody help me!

214
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,306
I would, but... but
these pants are cashmere!

215
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,587
I got you, Jay!

216
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,176
You gotta calm him down!

217
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:42,648
- Punch him in the head!
- Don't punch him in the head!

218
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,051
Don't make me punch you!
I will punch you to save you!

219
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,138
I think I'm being waterboarded.

220
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,683
You're making me do this!

221
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,649
Get this thing off me!

222
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,212
Happy birthday.

223
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:55,843
We're taking you fishing.

224
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,487
For whatever it's worth,

225
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,552
Dylan was very
responsible last night.

226
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,426
He's a good guy to have
around the house.

227
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,238
Mm. Where we going with this?

228
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,382
Well, since I can't move in
with him anymore,

229
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:07,952
he can't afford his apartment.

230
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,933
So I was wondering
if it would be okay

231
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:13,417
if he could stay with us
for a couple weeks?

232
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:14,916
Sure. Oh, you know what?

233
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,438
Why don't you guys take our room?

234
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,594
She's being facetious.

235
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:22,801
Sarcastic.

236
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:24,916
Dylan no stay.

237
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:25,781
What?!

238
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:27,128
Oh, come on!
He helps out a lot.

239
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,728
He is very handy.

240
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:31,883
Really? The guy who
locked himself in his car?

241
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:34,769
You are in no position to be
asking for favors, young lady.

242
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,258
Here. Drink this.
It's for your hangover.

243
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:39,316
Ugh. It smells gross.

244
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,038
Well, then you better drink it fast.

245
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:46,939
Ew! I'm gonna throw up!
Ugh! Ugh!

246
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,593
That's a hangover cure?

247
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,077
No.

248
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,404
Well, this is probably shot.

249
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:00,086
Once again, I'd like to apologize
for punching you in the head.

250
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,030
It really was the only way
to save you

251
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:04,647
since you were bound and...
hooded,

252
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,357
which leads me to my second apology.

253
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,858
Gentlemen, come on.
As my uncle used to say,

254
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,543
let's not let a botched kidnapping
ruin our whole afternoon.

255
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:13,643
He's right.
The whole point of this

256
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:16,477
is for you to enjoy the lake
with your three best friends.

257
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:17,999
Stan coming?

258
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:19,659
Burn!

259
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:22,597
So... 65, huh?

260
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,476
You're heading into
the best years of your life.

261
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:26,102
That's right.

262
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,572
You put in the work.
You climbed the mountain.

263
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,776
Now it's time to reap the rewards.

264
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,554
I guess you're right.

265
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:31,633
Sounds pretty good to me.

266
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:33,085
You know, the more I look at you,

267
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,138
the angrier I get that
you don't got a beard.

268
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,327
I had a soul patch once.

269
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,920
A soul patch?
That's like a beard's crap.

270
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,585
I golfed six times last week.

271
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,804
Found 42 balls... a new record.

272
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:45,443
I don't think my falcon
could have found that many,

273
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,821
And he can spot a mouse at 600 yards.

274
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,494
Whats that have to do with beards?

275
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:51,323
I thought we were talking
about Jay turning 65

276
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,632
and how good that's gonna be.

277
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,989
That's right.
It's gonna be great, Jay.

278
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,350
I'm telling ya.
I got a vegetable garden.

279
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:59,000
Two years ago, it was a patch
of dirt in my backyard.

280
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,744
Now I got tomatoes,
I got five kinds of beans,

281
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:02,798
I got squash.

282
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,239
And between you and me,

283
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,486
I'm even thinking about
pickling my own cucumbers.

284
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,300
Why would that be between you and me?

285
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:11,013
Because there's a
finite number of pickles.

286
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,912
But don't worry.
All you guys are on the list.

287
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,425
Well, I'd like to make a toast.

288
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,624
To Jay, who's not
particularly buoyant.

289
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,188
And again, I'm very sorry about that.

290
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,718
But he's the best father-in-law
a guy could ask for.

291
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,065
All right.

292
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,810
And we're... we're all really
lucky to know him. Cheers.

293
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:25,962
- Here, here.
- Salud.

294
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:27,414
Thanks, guys.
You know what?

295
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:29,503
It is kinda nice
being out here with all of ya.

296
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,042
Hey, let's do some fishing.

297
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,479
I'm starting to feel better
now that I'm finally getting dry.

298
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:34,864
Let's do this!

299
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:36,036
- Let's go!
- All right!

300
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,484
Sure.

301
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:43,952
You know,

302
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:45,690
I had a little peppermints
schnapps at my prom,

303
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,106
but I hid it from my parents

304
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:49,419
and I kicked my boyfriend out
before they woke up.

305
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:50,866
It's called respect.

306
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:53,679
I'm pregnant.

307
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,032
You're gonna get fat.

308
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,233
You... oh!
I mean...

309
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,410
That's great. It's great!
You're pregnant!

310
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,950
It's great! Congratulations!

311
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,745
It was a surprise.

312
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,773
Yeah, I'll bet.
What did my dad say?

313
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:08,195
I haven't told him yet.

314
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:11,468
I worry that he's going to think
it's not such great news.

315
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,935
Ohh, no.
Don't be silly.

316
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,423
He's gonna be thrilled.

317
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,544
I knew he wasn't gonna be thrilled.

318
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,666
And if history was any indication,

319
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,624
he wasn't gonna be able to hide it.

320
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,034
It's a French Canadian
delicacy called poutine.

321
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:26,984
Mm. Well, it looks like vomit,

322
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,540
so I'm not pou-ting it in my mouth.

323
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:33,978
We're here!

324
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,216
What'd you do to your hair?

325
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:38,557
I thought I'd try
something different.

326
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,778
What, looking old?

327
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:43,665
I had to get to dad

328
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,146
before he said something
insensitive to Gloria.

329
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:49,827
But she is gonna get
really fat, though.

330
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:53,502
Dad, call me back.

331
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,052
I have something
very important to tell you

332
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,836
so when you get home
you don't say something stupid

333
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,028
like you usually do.

334
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,607
Oh, happy birthday.

335
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,574
Yeah. I've gotta say,

336
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:05,497
you're handling this baby thing
better than I would've expected.

337
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:06,319
What do you mean?

338
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,225
You're used to being
the only kid in the house.

339
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:11,327
Now there's gonna be a new kid.
Jay's kid.

340
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:12,132
So?

341
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,739
Well, the old Manny
would've been worried

342
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
That Jay would love the new kid more.

343
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:18,113
I think you're underestimating
how adorable I am.

344
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,642
You're right.
You're way cuter than a baby.

345
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,421
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

346
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:27,552
Sometimes I just like to toss
a grenade and run away.

347
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,343
All right, take a whiff.

348
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:31,152
Make sure you like it,

349
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,030
'cause that's what
our couch is gonna smell like.

350
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,440
Okay, hi.
Yes, we're gonna take this one.

351
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,431
Oh, I'm gonna need you
to slow down a bit.

352
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,218
There's a process
we need to go through

353
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,126
to see if you're a suitable
cat guardian.

354
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,596
Oh, really?
Because I thought the process was,

355
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:43,515
I say, "We'll take this one."

356
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,479
And then you say, "Thank God
because we have too many cats."

357
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,344
No. We need to ensure these cats
are going to good homes.

358
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:50,182
That's why we need you
to fill out this form,

359
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:51,782
And then there'll be a site visit.

360
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:54,205
Okay, um, we've just been
through a very frustrating year

361
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,063
trying to adopt a baby, so...

362
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,081
You'll forgive us
if we're not really in the mood

363
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:00,181
to jump through
too many hoops for a cat.

364
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,134
Oh. Why wouldn't they
give you a baby?

365
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,648
- It's complicated.
- So are cats.

366
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,527
Are they? 'cause that one
over there has been licking

367
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,762
itself ever since we got here.

368
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:09,331
Okay, you know what?
I'm... I can't do this.

369
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,437
What about Larry?

370
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,862
I'm sorry, Lily.
Not today.

371
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:17,578
Mitchell stormed off, but I couldn't.

372
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,154
I had to give her a piece of my mind.

373
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:20,041
And how'd that go?

374
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,127
I may have strayed
off topic just a bit.

375
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:23,251
No, sir!

376
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,682
No, she will always be
Norma Jeane Baker to me.

377
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:26,993
What is your point, exactly?

378
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,871
That like the
thrice-married starlet,

379
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:31,784
this cat is being deprived
a stable home.

380
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:33,153
I'm sorry if you're upset.

381
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:35,110
You're the one who
should be upset, ma'am.

382
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,431
We are animals lovers.

383
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,505
That cat would've been
on the receiving end of affection

384
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:42,282
24 hours a day.

385
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:46,322
Satisfying its every need
would've been our top priority.

386
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,126
Okay, in light of that tableau,

387
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:55,181
I would like to take back
the phrase "receiving end."

388
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,811
Mom, I've decided I'm not
going to poetry camp.

389
00:13:58,812 --> 00:13:59,977
What? Why not?

390
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:01,262
'Cause by the time I come back,

391
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,005
Jay will have turned
my room into a nursery.

392
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:03,947
No, he won't.

393
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,177
I'm not his real kid.

394
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,836
I'll be as insignificant
as a whisper in a windstorm.

395
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:10,623
Oh, listen to you.
You have a gift.

396
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,111
You have to go to the poetry camp.

397
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,180
I don't think I can risk it.

398
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,807
Manny, please. I have too much
to worry about right now.

399
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:16,943
- Okay?
- You?

400
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,453
I dug a pretty big hole for myself

401
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:20,130
with those insult jokes this morning.

402
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:21,960
Why didn't I learn from Rickles?

403
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,513
You gotta end with some ticker.

404
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:26,708
Okay, I give up.

405
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,725
I can't find a position
that's not sexual.

406
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:31,013
- Just calm down.
- I can't calm down.

407
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:33,910
You know, maybe we're not
as okay as we keep saying we are.

408
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,572
- I know.
- Maybe we should go away.

409
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,843
You know, go someplace to heal.

410
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,868
Where?

411
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,975
Well, someplace with
a vibrant theater scene...

412
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,459
Top-notch restaurants...

413
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:46,371
The jewel of Missouri's white river.

414
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,550
We're not going to Branson.

415
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,703
Okay, fine.
Where would you go?

416
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,583
I don't know.
Maybe Europe?

417
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:53,490
London?

418
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:55,391
Just somewhere far away.

419
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,246
- I'm just sad, Cam.
- I am, too.

420
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,815
You know, I had
our mornings all planned out.

421
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,502
The baby and I would
walk Lily to kindergarten

422
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:06,931
and then cut back home
through the park

423
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:08,568
and feed those ducks
that you're not supposed to feed

424
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:09,975
but everybody does.

425
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,364
I bought a picture frame for my desk,

426
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,381
and it's just sitting there,

427
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:16,492
waiting for his face.

428
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,806
Come here.

429
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,221
I already feel better.

430
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,230
Me, too.

431
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:25,015
See what the power of a hug can do?

432
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,103
Just saved us a long
plane ride with a toddler.

433
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:30,183
- And a cat that we didn't want.
- Oh, we're still getting that.

434
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,118
All right, how does this look?

435
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,987
Perfectly innocent.
They're not even touching.

436
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,258
Great. Okay. Let's go.

437
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:40,347
All right.

438
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:41,800
You ready, honey?

439
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:48,433
Go. Go.

440
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,803
Hey, Mrs. Dunphy?

441
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:53,458
I heard about what Haley asked you,
and just so you know,

442
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,903
I never wanted
to put you in that position.

443
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,031
- I'll be fine.
- That's good to know.

444
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,679
My cousin Dylan said
I could stay at his house.

445
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:04,054
Well, not really at his house.

446
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:06,581
More like behind it...
In the garage.

447
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:07,469
Okay.

448
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,050
Well, actually, there are no walls,

449
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,564
So it's more of a porte cochere.

450
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,538
Fancy.

451
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,116
Anyway, I'll be sleeping in it.

452
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,477
It's got a bathroom.

453
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,393
More of a half-bath.

454
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,874
It's a coffee can.

455
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,020
- Ohh.
- Anyway, I'll be fine

456
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,522
once I find a nice tent
to protect me from the coyotes.

457
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,707
Well, be sure to hang
your food up high.

458
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:26,531
We're back!

459
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:28,585
Birthday boy's here!

460
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,316
Hey, Jay, you're all wrinkled.

461
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:31,906
Yeah, yeah, I'm old. I get it.

462
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,004
No, I mean your clothes.

463
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,855
Yeah, when I was your age,
I was wearing animal skins.

464
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:35,794
Bam! You got me.

465
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,501
I think, bam!
You got yourself.

466
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:38,776
I'm just expressing concern.

467
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:40,615
Let me guess...
about my bone density.

468
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,975
You know,
you're a real smart-ass.

469
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,241
At this rate, I'll be living
in the basement.

470
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:45,413
Lucky.

471
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:48,286
Dad? Dad, okay, quick.
Just come here one second.

472
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,200
I gotta tell you something.

473
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:53,794
Somebody is about to tell you
some very important news.

474
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,421
And for the first time in your life,

475
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,912
I need you to react nicely.

476
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:59,513
- I always react nicely.
- You never do.

477
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:02,514
And this person in question
is very vulnerable right now.

478
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:05,636
So could you please just
be loving and supportive?

479
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,939
- Happy birthday, dad!
- Oh, thank you.

480
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,362
That's a boy.

481
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,658
Sorry we're late,
but it's for a good reason.

482
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,727
We're thinking about getting a cat.

483
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,977
Well, isn't that wonderful?

484
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:20,844
I'm thrilled for you both.
This is a heck of a decision.

485
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,405
You have my full support.

486
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:25,566
Okay.

487
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,488
I think it'll be a perfect
addition to the family.

488
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,688
I know I'll love the heck out
of the little bugger.

489
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:32,036
I'm just hoping that little one
over there doesn't get jealous.

490
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:33,588
Oh, this little one will be just fine

491
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,153
now that he knows where he stands...

492
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,684
In the shadow of your new baby!

493
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:37,833
What's he talking about?

494
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,390
He's talking about I am pregnant.

495
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,153
- Oh, come on!
- Pregnant?!

496
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,203
You gotta be kidding me!

497
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:45,430
Oh, gross. I didn't know
grandpa could still do it.

498
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,868
Don't be disrespectful, Luke.

499
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,637
Anyone could do it with Gloria.

500
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:52,249
And if you're too set in your
old ways to be happy about it,

501
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,623
I can raise it on my own.

502
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,768
I have done it before,
and I can do it now!

503
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,250
I come from a very long line
of strong Latin women

504
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,770
whose husbands
are nowhere to be found!

505
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:05,199
- Are you done?
- Yes!

506
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:07,039
- Can I say something?
- Go on!

507
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:10,497
That's the greatest news
I've ever heard.

508
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:11,976
It is?

509
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:15,311
I spent the day hearing what
my future had in store for me,

510
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:17,252
and I didn't like one bit of it.

511
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:19,177
It felt like my life was ending.

512
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:22,413
And now you're telling me
that I get to have a new start...

513
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:24,947
with the woman of my dreams.

514
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,387
I think I'm gonna cry.

515
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,881
I'm way ahead of you.

516
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:30,737
Can you believe this?

517
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:32,876
I know. They wouldn't
even let us get a cat.

518
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:34,620
It's gonna be great!

519
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,232
I'm gonna get so fat.

520
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:37,521
Mostly great.

521
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:46,202
Oh, gross.
They're at it again.

522
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:48,054
If you don't like it, don't look.

523
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:50,681
She looks great, doesn't she?

524
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:51,865
Yeah.

525
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,465
Not really gaining weight
the way I would've expected.

526
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:57,212
I finally understand why people
say pregnant women glow.

527
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:59,411
Phil, I have had three children.

528
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:02,059
Hey, dad, Gloria, open our present.

529
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,137
Ooh! I hope it's something fancy.

530
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:08,200
It's for the baby. I love it!

531
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:11,704
We got it in a shop
at Heathrow, duty free.

532
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,705
Not for long.

533
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,398
Isn't it absolutely brilliant?

534
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,013
Okay, we were in London two weeks.
Lose the accent, Madonna.

535
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:19,759
Why is your face all scratched up?

536
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,037
Stupid Larry.

537
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,537
This feels so weird.

538
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,665
It suits you.

539
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,766
Don't even joke about it.

540
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:28,836
That's it. He is moving out
of the house tomorrow.

541
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,999
Really?

542
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,513
Oh, and that beard is going.

543
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,441
Fine, but it's gonna kill Shorty.

544
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,317
Okay, everybody,
let's gather together.

545
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:39,724
Manny's gonna read us
a little something

546
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,937
that he prepare in his poetry camp.

547
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:43,066
Thank you, mom.

548
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,565
This is for my new
baby brother or sister.

549
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,165
"Welcome, little one.

550
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:50,554
Open your eyes and take your place.

551
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,268
This is where you're meant to be,

552
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:54,236
Nestled in the bosom
of your mother."

553
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:55,259
Lucky baby.

554
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,300
- What?
- Love you, baby.

555
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,564
"This is where you're meant to be,

556
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,149
in the arms of your father.

557
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,302
His long, long journey
has readied him for this day,

558
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,541
though his skin may be loose,

559
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:07,974
his hair but a wisp,

560
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,668
and his eyes milky with age,"

561
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:10,875
All right, we're done here.

562
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,086
Get a drink.

563
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:17,486
Don't feel bad about
making move out, Mrs. D.

564
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,806
I knew this day
would come eventually,

565
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:20,198
and I'm totally covered.

566
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,953
Great. So we'll see you around.

567
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,777
I got a place with
an old friend of mine.

568
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:27,026
Well, not so much
of a place as a storage pod.

569
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,211
And not so much of a...
friend as a raccoon.

570
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,746
Good to know you'll have company.

571
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,708
I call him bubbles because
his mouth is all foamy.

572
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,768
Dylan, I'm on to your little game.

573
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,907
I know non of this is true.

574
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:40,009
You just try to guilt me
into I letting you stay.

575
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,210
You're right, I'm sorry.

576
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,923
I'll just live in my car.

577
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:45,696
Think I can borrow a coat hanger

578
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:47,677
in case I get lock in there again.

579
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,285
- God.
- What's going on?

580
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:51,647
No, no no.
All of it.

581
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:55,055
Sure you don't wanna dance
with the devil before I get rid of it.

582
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:55,897
Go.

583
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:57,339
Fine.

584
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,039
