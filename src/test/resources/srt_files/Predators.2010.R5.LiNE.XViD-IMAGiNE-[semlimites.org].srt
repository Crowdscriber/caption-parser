1
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,379
Don't!

2
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,131
- Calm down.
- Hey, fuck you!

3
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,424
- Calm down.
- Fuck you!

4
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:16,417
It's like his chute
didn't open.

5
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,987
- Single shooter!
- How do you know?

6
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,008
Please, stop doing that!

7
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:13,304
You're shooting
at the wrong people.

8
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,992
How do I know?

9
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,555
Because otherwise, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

10
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,279
Alright.

11
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,016
You want to show me
the right ones?

12
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:42,307
Nikolai.
I mean... I'm Nikolai.

13
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:48,950
What's the last thing
you remember, Nikolai?

14
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,852
War.
Yeah.

15
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,115
I was at the Chechnya.

16
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,905
And then there was a light.

17
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,867
Then I...

18
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:00,772
Then I woke up
and I was...

19
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,521
Falling.

20
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,579
Yeah, same thing.
I was in Baja.

21
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,986
And then, there was a light.
And then, "chinga"!

22
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,942
Okay.

23
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,429
Where are we now?

24
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,413
Maybe she knows.

25
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,581
Shit.

26
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:34,873
You want to lower
the weapon?

27
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,511
I've never seen this jungle.
And I've seen most.

28
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:46,622
Alright. You think that's Asia?
Maybe Africa?

29
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:49,024
Too hot for this time of year.

30
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,778
And the topography
is all wrong.

31
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,214
Amazon, maybe.

32
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,436
I saw more parachutes.

33
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,216
- Which way?
- Why?

34
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:08,779
So I can figure out who
threw me out of a fucking airplane.

35
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,715
What the fuck?
Where she goes?

36
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:22,319
Bullshit,
If we listen to this...

37
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,843
Alright,
let's take a fucking look.

38
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,349
Fuck.

39
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,228
Do you remember a plane?

40
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,513
I woke up in free fall.
You?

41
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,192
The same.

42
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,366
You're IDF?

43
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,130
Yeah.
You've been in the service?

44
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:38,231
Not exactly.

45
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,425
Motherfucker!

46
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,527
Move you motherfucker!

47
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,102
- You with him?
- No.

48
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:11,090
Then why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

49
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:14,137
We have bigger problems
right now.

50
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:19,022
Okay, boss.
Whatever you say.

51
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,176
I will finish
what you started.

52
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,185
Strength in numbers, huh?

53
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,247
- Stuff like that.
- Yeah...

54
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:37,809
Maybe we should get that guy
hanging in the tree.

55
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:41,901
Help me! Fuck!

56
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:45,204
Help me!
Somebody!

57
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:49,166
Help!

58
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,001
Hello?

59
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:54,675
I'm strapped in a parachute
in a fucking tree!

60
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,418
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- Oh, thank God!

61
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,857
I think I can...

62
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,004
Stop moving,
you are breaking the branch.

63
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,449
Do you have anything
to cut yourself down with?

64
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,293
Why would it...?
No, I dont.

65
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,199
Look. If we can get him broke
from one of the chute.

66
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,796
Do something!

67
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,480
- Help!
- Taking too long.

68
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,774
Help!

69
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,793
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a doctor...

70
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,599
I was on my way to work.

71
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:36,203
Can someone please
just tell me...

72
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,800
what the fuck is going on here?

73
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:11,623
Your ass is awesome.

74
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,043
Look.

75
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:31,332
Hot Damn!
Who the hell is this guy?

76
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,902
What the hell is that?

77
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,853
Who would do this?

78
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:05,678
Whoever they are,
they take trophies.

79
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:10,484
In my culture,
the warrior with the greatest trophies...

80
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:14,073
- command the most respect.
- Whatever.

81
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,463
It's a test.

82
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:21,093
To see how we do
under pressure.

83
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:25,275
If this were a test,
you'd all be military.

84
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:28,278
Total strangers,
Live rounds.

85
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,119
This is something else.

86
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:35,498
Maybe it's ransom.
Back in Tijuana,

87
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,558
we kidnap you,
put you in an oil drum.

88
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:42,662
If the ransom not paid...

89
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:44,799
We light you on fire.

90
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,720
I hear these stories,

91
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,416
about these experiments
they roll on Cons.

92
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:52,721
They stick drugs in your food,
and sit back and watch what happens.

93
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:55,168
It's not drugs.

94
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:58,643
If there was a psychotropic compound,
we'd be feeling the residual side effects,

95
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:01,871
Loss of motor skills,
blurry vision...

96
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:06,937
and if it was a behavioral experiment,
I mean, there'd...

97
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,872
be a point.

98
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,280
What if we are dead.

99
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:22,582
- I was gonna be executed in two days.
- And I was in combat.

100
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,386
So was I.

101
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,624
This is Hell.

102
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,750
Last time I looked you didn't
need a parachute to get there.

103
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:36,280
But it doesn't matter
what happened, or why.

104
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,517
We're here...

105
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:40,642
the only question is...

106
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,769
How do we get out?

107
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,893
Where are you going?

108
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,460
- To high ground.
- We need to stick together.

109
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,539
Then you should follow me.

110
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:31,962
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

111
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,502
Yep.

112
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:47,196
Archaefructus liaoningensis.
That is really, really poisonous.

113
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:52,672
Wouldn't take more than one scratch,
cause total paralysis.

114
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:56,974
Thank you.

115
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:59,259
I will watch for you out here.

116
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:04,175
You made a buddy.

117
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,644
Hey.

118
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,633
We need to rest.

119
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,459
So rest.

120
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,551
You look like
you could use it too.

121
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,864
You got a name?

122
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,920
Look...

123
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:36,308
I'm sorry. You want to play
scout leader? Great.

124
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,501
Now you gonna follow me?
Fine.

125
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:40,982
But I'm not doing this...

126
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,759
I'm better on my own.

127
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,655
Want to see something
fucked up?

128
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,683
Well, between that
and the sun...

129
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:15,177
- I'd say we have a real problem.
- What about the sun?

130
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,274
It hasn't moved
since we got here.

131
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:27,072
What do you think
is really going on?

132
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:32,404
What do I think?

133
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,268
Spetznatz Alpha Group,

134
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,536
Los Zetas cartel enforcer,

135
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:46,785
R.U.F. that's a death squad
from Sierra Leone,

136
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,176
Yakuza in the Dawokei,

137
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,716
the F.B.I.'s Most Wanted,

138
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:54,563
and... him.

139
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,226
They're all heavy-hitters,
he doesn't belong.

140
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,333
Belong to what?

141
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:07,277
Well, I'd say
we were chosen.

142
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,712
What about you?

143
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,888
What about me?

144
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:23,791
You know the jungle,
all the players...

145
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:29,386
I'm guessing ex-military,
black-ops,

146
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:33,322
- probably a mercenary.
- You got a problem with that?

147
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:38,732
Not at the moment.

148
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,253
Good.

149
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,176
Something
was dropped here.

150
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:24,927
Same as us.

151
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,987
Not the same as us.

152
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,784
You said we were chosen.

153
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:41,576
Chosen for what?

154
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,575
Oh, shit.

155
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:19,005
Looking good there, boss.

156
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,218
Look out! Step!

157
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,598
Help!

158
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,398
- 12 o'clock. 110 meters.
- Take him! Take him!

159
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:39,072
We don't have to.

160
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:43,113
He left.

161
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,555
We triggered a dead man's trap.

162
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,165
It's two weeks.

163
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,898
Judging from
the rate of decomposition.

164
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:03,008
He took up a position here.

165
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:08,156
shooting in all directions.

166
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,914
This was a last stand.

167
00:21:18,282 --> 00:21:20,400
United States Special Forces.

168
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:24,383
This is strange.
He's supposed to be...

169
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,332
deployed in Afghanistan.

170
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:29,328
What's he doing here
setting traps for us?

171
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:31,651
They weren't meant for us.

172
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,358
He was hunting something else...

173
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:38,052
- Something a lot bigger.
- Bigger?

174
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:41,048
The trunk was a dead-fall.

175
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,289
The rule of thumb
with a dead-fall,

176
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:45,536
is that you set the weight five times
that of the target animal.

177
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,097
Whatever it was,
it got through the trip-wires.

178
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,745
And did this.

179
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,511
Let's move.

180
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:19,590
What is it?

181
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,660
<i>What is it?</i>

182
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,104
Nothing.

183
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:48,211
<i>What is it?
Nothing.</i>

184
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:57,662
We're gonna need
a new plan.

185
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,206
Hey, where are we going?

186
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:22,324
Someone put us on this rock,
there's gotta be a way off it.

187
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,311
Ah!
What the fuck?

188
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,512
Hey, you know what?
Fuck this!

189
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:36,154
This is bullshit, man.
I want a gun!

190
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:38,775
Come man. You got
two mother fucking guns, man!

191
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,570
Somebody give me a gun!

192
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:44,230
Come on Russian,
you got a big fucking gun!

193
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:52,454
Come on man,
give me a gun.

194
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,210
Give me a gun, right now!

195
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:58,663
Give me a gun.

196
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,991
I'm ready to die.

197
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,230
Are you?

198
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,348
Help!

199
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:03,978
Help!

200
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:09,004
Fuck you!

201
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,992
Looking good there, boss.

202
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:34,239
Run! Run!
Come on! Climb!

203
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,201
Oh, shit!

204
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,568
No!

205
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:32,000
As bad as you are...

206
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,076
those things are worse.

207
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,814
Since we still eight,
they just... What? Left?

208
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:57,032
No.

209
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:59,413
The whistle.

210
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:01,236
They were called.

211
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:02,958
Alright. Listen up!

212
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:05,046
Everybody do a shell count.

213
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:07,984
We've got to
conserve ammunition.

214
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:10,514
Reload. Do it now.

215
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,411
Excuse me, I'm...
just what the hell is going on here?

216
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:17,317
We're being hunted.

217
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:25,148
The cages, soldier,
all of us.

218
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:27,134
All brought here
for the same purpose.

219
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:31,632
This planet
is a game preserve.

220
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:34,872
And we're the game.

221
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,069
In case you didn't notice,

222
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,137
we just got flushed out.

223
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:46,221
They sent the dogs in.

224
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:48,911
Just like you would
if you were stalking boar.

225
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,841
Shooting quail.

226
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,669
They split us apart,
and they watched.

227
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:55,358
Testing us.

228
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,680
How do you know all this?

229
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,068
Because...

230
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:08,123
that's what I would do.

231
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:14,193
- Fantastic.
- Wait...

232
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:20,656
- There are only seven of us.
- Help me!

233
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:32,306
Help!

234
00:30:57,949 --> 00:30:59,678
Help.

235
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,840
- Wait...
- What?

236
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:07,001
It's a trap.

237
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:19,067
Help me.

238
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:34,492
Fuck me.

239
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:38,158
Help.

240
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,756
Wound one man.

241
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,763
Make him suffer.

242
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:49,166
Make him bleed.

243
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,402
Make him call out for help.

244
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:58,270
And set a trap,
and kill those who come.

245
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:04,404
I know,
because I have done this.

246
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,350
So we're gonna leave him here,
right?

247
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,752
Come on, look at him.
He's done.

248
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:16,631
There's nothing...
There's nothing else we can do, right?

249
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:18,567
Right?

250
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:27,557
We leave him.

251
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:30,977
I can't.

252
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,234
Then that's on you.

253
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:52,495
Help me.

254
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:17,835
Help me.

255
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:31,263
<i>Help me. Help me.
It's a trap. It's a trap.</i>

256
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,548
What are we gonna do?

257
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:56,743
We should go
to higher ground.

258
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,459
Really?

259
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:00,345
We're trapped
on an alien hunting planet,

260
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:02,297
you really think
the solution is to...

261
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,110
walk over?

262
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:09,754
It wants us to run.

263
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:14,173
That's how it hunts.

264
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:19,947
This is its jungle.

265
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:22,926
Its game.

266
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:25,092
Its rules.

267
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,759
We run...

268
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:32,048
we die.

269
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,685
What's the alternative?

270
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,885
We need to know
what we're dealing with.

271
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:42,456
The dog tracks go that way.

272
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:47,614
We go after it.

273
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,398
What?

274
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:08,628
No movement.

275
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:45,954
Looks like, we're not
the only things been hunted.

276
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,733
Oh, shit!

277
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,668
What the fuck is that thing?

278
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:15,669
This is a mistake.
We have to leave. Now!

279
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,223
Where's the tough guy?

280
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,019
He left us.

281
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,733
He's here.

282
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,101
Run!

283
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,000
Run! Run!

284
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:27,038
Run! Run! Run!

285
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:16,956
You set us up!

286
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,635
He led us into that
death camp.

287
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:23,914
Then hid and waited
for that thing to strike.

288
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:25,671
We were bait.

289
00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:29,326
I needed to know
who we're up against.

290
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:33,879
- Now I do.
- A man is dead because of that.

291
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,262
This morning you were ready
to kill him.

292
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:40,057
Well it ain't
this God damn morning, is it?

293
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:42,541
- Well at least he didn't die in vain.
- Why?

294
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:43,870
So we could find out
first-hand,

295
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:46,458
what it feels like
to have our asses kicked?

296
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:49,019
No, we found out that
there's more than one of them,

297
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:51,697
that they use projectile
and energy based weapons,

298
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:53,989
that they have some sort
of cloaking device,

299
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:55,801
that they're bigger than us,

300
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,519
stronger.

301
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:59,065
But also heavier.

302
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:02,983
You've put us at risk
for yourself.

303
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,897
Do you wanna be in your own?

304
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:08,090
You got it.

305
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,291
Why don't you tell them
the true?

306
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:12,215
- I don't know what you're talking...
- You know what I'm talking about.

307
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:14,076
The way you looked to that thing,
that was strung up.

308
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,730
The way you reacted.

309
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:19,229
She knows what it is.

310
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:21,815
Don't you.

311
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,093
We don't have a name
for them.

312
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,483
'87, Guatemala.

313
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,765
A Spec ops team
went into the jungle.

314
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:58,911
High end.
Six men plus a CIA liaison.

315
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,410
Only one made it out.

316
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:03,487
In his debrief...

317
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,444
He said they came in contact
with something.

318
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:08,760
He gave a detailed description.

319
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,171
The thing on the totem.

320
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,458
It wore some kind of camouflage
that adjusted to ambient light.

321
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,722
Made it nearly invisible
in our spectrum.

322
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:27,398
It could see in infra red.
Heat signatures.

323
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:32,770
He used mud to block his.
That's how he beat it.

324
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,054
It hunted,
and killed his team.

325
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,781
One by one.

326
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:47,333
Whatever it is.

327
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,459
Wherever they're from.

328
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,023
We gonna kill 'em all.

329
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,639
We set up
a defensive perimeter.

330
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:01,699
Make it look like we're holding up.
And that will bring 'em to us.

331
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:06,960
We force them into a choke point.
We get 'em in overlap in fields of fire.

332
00:44:07,952 --> 00:44:10,227
It can be done.

333
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,458
I can't do it alone.

334
00:44:47,474 --> 00:44:50,030
You know man,
if we ever make it home...

335
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:54,078
I'm going to do
so much fucking cocaine.

336
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:57,931
I'm gonna rape
so many fine bitches.

337
00:44:58,736 --> 00:45:03,485
About, what time is it?
5 o'clock? Damn.

338
00:45:03,294 --> 00:45:06,260
Time to go rape me
some fine bitches.

339
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:07,518
You know what I'm saying?

340
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:09,719
Oh yeah, totally.

341
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:13,520
It's like, 5 o'clock...

342
00:45:13,364 --> 00:45:18,464
- Bitch raping time.
- Hmm, yeah.

343
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:28,631
- You should stay away from him.
- Yeah.

344
00:45:40,106 --> 00:45:42,648
You still pissed?

345
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,672
Fuck you.

346
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:59,289
You know, what the difference
between you and me is.

347
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,419
We both did the same thing.

348
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,494
You just do it for your country
so you don't have to admit you like it.

349
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,063
What happened to you?

350
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:12,983
What made you so fucked up?

351
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:19,737
There is no hunting
like the hunting of a man.

352
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:23,511
And those who have hunted
armed men long enough,

353
00:46:23,377 --> 00:46:25,785
and liked it,

354
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:29,165
never really care
for anything else thereafter.

355
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:33,671
That's pretty poetic.

356
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:37,735
Did you come up with that
all by yourself?

357
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,045
No, actually.

358
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:43,066
That was Hemingway.

359
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:20,965
Where the fuck is it?

360
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:25,256
Why isn't it coming?

361
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:30,388
Let me see your traps.

362
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:49,747
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey.

363
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:55,554
I think I just figured out
a way you can be useful.

364
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:04,543
Shit!...

365
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,423
I'm in left side,
just I heard the sign!

366
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:16,409
Come on, come on,
come on!

367
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,238
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, come on.

368
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:22,069
Fucking shoot!

369
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,008
Shoot it already!

370
00:48:35,058 --> 00:48:37,697
Fuck...

371
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:39,987
all of you!

372
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:50,976
Is he dead?
Why ain't you smiling?

373
00:48:50,852 --> 00:48:54,270
- Oh, shit.
- The thing from the cages.

374
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,790
Maybe he thought
we were going to draw up till here.

375
00:49:01,612 --> 00:49:03,647
Good shot, though.

376
00:49:06,664 --> 00:49:10,069
I missed.

377
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,172
<i>Over here.</i>

378
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,255
<i>Over here.</i>

379
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,543
<i>Over here.</i>

380
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:54,510
What the fuck are you?

381
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,850
I'm alive.

382
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:15,658
You talk too loud.

383
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:23,856
I've smelled you
since you got here.

384
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:30,539
If I can smell you,
If I can hear you...

385
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,378
They can too.

386
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:41,666
Storm coming soon,
this way.

387
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:44,039
Wait.

388
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:47,440
Who are you?

389
00:50:49,044 --> 00:50:53,628
Noland run away.

390
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:57,870
Live to fight another day.

391
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:04,029
I'm the one that got away.

392
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:08,010
The one you don't fuck with.

393
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:36,258
Come on,
fear revive in this place.

394
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:51,339
Where are we?

395
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:54,443
There's a journal
somebody left behind.

396
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:59,147
The machine's dead.
The power source, ain't.

397
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:02,693
Wow, what a shit hole.
You live here?

398
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:07,624
Oh, no, no.
This is my summer home.

399
00:54:07,422 --> 00:54:09,597
I winter in the Riviera.

400
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,703
The schools
are so much nicer there.

401
00:54:12,575 --> 00:54:17,373
And the men?
Ooh la la...

402
00:54:17,181 --> 00:54:20,382
By the way,
you're welcome.

403
00:54:20,253 --> 00:54:22,308
How have you survived?

404
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:29,595
Salvaging what I can,

405
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:33,748
when I can,
from whatever I can.

406
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:38,542
Oh...

407
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:42,900
Noland, Ronald.
"Air Cav.".

408
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:45,226
They...

409
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:47,783
They drop you all in too?

410
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:49,273
Yeah.

411
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:52,586
Mmm...

412
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:54,802
What a rush?

413
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,430
Hey...
Yeah, I'll tell him.

414
00:55:05,294 --> 00:55:08,056
Hey "Agent Orange",
you wanna...

415
00:55:07,946 --> 00:55:09,985
put that down.

416
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:14,322
Several people around here particular
about other people messing with their shit.

417
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:19,984
Very important, though.
Disrupts the heat signature.

418
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,490
You motherfuckers!

419
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:26,120
So you killed one?

420
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:31,069
Aha, I killed one.
Two...

421
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:34,930
Maybe three.
No, I can't remember.

422
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:37,638
Anyway, there's...

423
00:55:37,524 --> 00:55:40,042
two different types of them
out there.

424
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:42,722
Now, they're similar,
but they're different.

425
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,503
It's kinda like, the difference
between dogs and wolves.

426
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:48,812
But the ones
it'll running things up there...

427
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:51,426
the larger ones
hunt the smaller ones.

428
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:53,296
It's some kind of...

429
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,957
blood-feud I guess, that's
been going on for a long time.

430
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:58,962
Oh, yeah.

431
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:01,184
- And they do this, just for sport?
- Oh, yeah...

432
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,396
And they bringing in fresh meat,
season after season...

433
00:56:04,264 --> 00:56:07,867
I mean,
shit you wouldn't believe.

434
00:56:07,723 --> 00:56:09,353
Bring it in...

435
00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:11,341
and...

436
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:14,426
hunt it, and kill it.
In that order.

437
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:17,785
How long
have you been here, man?

438
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:25,155
Seven seasons,
I think...

439
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:26,305
What?

440
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:29,040
Ten?
Damn...

441
00:56:28,929 --> 00:56:33,744
Anyway. Every once in a while,
one of us kills one of them...

442
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:37,233
and let me tell you,
that's when they get real interested.

443
00:56:37,085 --> 00:56:39,601
See, they learn...

444
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:41,851
quick, they adapt.

445
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,298
They develop
a whole new set of skills.

446
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:49,854
They come back the next season.
In threes, always in threes.

447
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:52,034
Their armor might have changed.

448
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:54,534
Or their weapons
have changed, or...

449
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,723
their tactics have changed.

450
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,203
It's amazing.

451
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:03,314
So, it's like
an evolution...

452
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:07,199
They train to make themselves
in to better killers.

453
00:57:09,264 --> 00:57:13,937
You said, they come back...

454
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,115
How?

455
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,436
- They got a ship.
- A ship?

456
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:22,284
Yeah. It's 30 yards
from their camp.

457
00:57:24,435 --> 00:57:28,165
I told you they wouldn't see it.
I told you they wouldn't.

458
00:57:28,016 --> 00:57:30,571
You were there.

459
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:35,452
You could've helped us.

460
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:39,841
How do we kill them?

461
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,205
However you can.

462
00:57:45,144 --> 00:57:47,709
They must have a weakness.

463
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:50,974
Not many.

464
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:52,716
You wanna survive?

465
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:56,020
You'd dig in deep,
you stay hid.

466
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:58,807
Yeah, well we're gonna go
with door number two.

467
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,588
How do we get out
of this valley?

468
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:05,245
Ten seasons...

469
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:07,438
The first two seasons.
No, three seasons I was here,

470
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:10,209
I was walking
in the same direction.

471
00:58:10,094 --> 00:58:13,630
Trying to reach
the edge of the preserve.

472
00:58:18,317 --> 00:58:21,676
Let me tell you something,
there ain't no "edge of the preserve".

473
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,902
Maybe you or your friend
wanna tell me about that ship.

474
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:32,015
I see...

475
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:34,949
That's...

476
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,407
a brilliant idea.
Brilliant.

477
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:42,047
The whole time I've been here,
it never occurred to me to...

478
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:45,339
commandeer the alien spacecraft.

479
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:48,488
But I wouldn't know
how to fly it.

480
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:51,227
He would.

481
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:53,619
Because you know
how to fly it?

482
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,944
I'll give it a shot.

483
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:00,202
Well...

484
00:59:01,296 --> 00:59:03,815
I'm gonna get some sleep.

485
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:08,254
No noise,
they're out there.

486
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:10,923
They're always out there.

487
00:59:12,532 --> 00:59:14,502
The water in there.

488
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:19,850
Help yourself,
all of you.

489
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,275
Who's that?

490
00:59:44,408 --> 00:59:46,435
My kids.

491
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:52,581
The big one is Rien,
and Sasha.

492
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:05,123
This is...
Candy Lee.

493
01:00:05,556 --> 01:00:07,818
Tits like Howitzers.

494
01:00:10,238 --> 01:00:12,425
Is that your girlfriend?

495
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,956
No, it's my sister.

496
01:00:33,227 --> 01:00:37,463
This is old.
Very old.

497
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,538
They've been doing this
for a long time.

498
01:00:41,006 --> 01:00:43,156
You speak English.

499
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,799
Yes.

500
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,808
Why don't you say more?

501
01:00:53,722 --> 01:00:56,737
Because I talk too much.

502
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:21,386
Thanks.

503
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:35,891
Do you know what I was doing
when I was taken?

504
01:01:38,049 --> 01:01:41,729
Isaac, my spotter.

505
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:44,283
He was caught.

506
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,187
I could've done something,

507
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:49,649
but then I would've been
slaughtered along with him.

508
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:51,320
So I hid.

509
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,796
I watched him die.

510
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,050
I wish I pulled that trigger.

511
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:04,860
You're doing what you have to do,
to survive.

512
01:02:05,577 --> 01:02:08,024
You said we were chosen.

513
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:11,710
I asked for what.

514
01:02:13,282 --> 01:02:15,762
I should've asked why.

515
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,912
It's because we...

516
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:20,742
are predators.

517
01:02:20,626 --> 01:02:22,865
Just like them.

518
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:26,918
We're the monsters,
of our own world.

519
01:02:27,704 --> 01:02:30,922
It's only better,
that we're never going back.

520
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:33,847
No, I'm going back.

521
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:40,867
I'm going after that ship.

522
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:44,462
You're gonna hope to fly it
in tha last hour, and now you tell me?

523
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:46,529
No.

524
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,060
That thing strung up in the camp
right now.

525
01:02:49,915 --> 01:02:53,649
In my guess, it'd do
just about anything to get free.

526
01:02:54,746 --> 01:02:57,747
Enemy of my enemy.

527
01:02:57,627 --> 01:02:58,456
It doesn't make it a friend.

528
01:03:05,094 --> 01:03:07,576
So, what do I call you?

529
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,742
Smoke!

530
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:17,846
Hey! Smoke!

531
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,004
Where's Noland?

532
01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:33,763
He's a scavenger.
He wants what we have.

533
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:45,232
Come on,
there must be away out.

534
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:49,142
- Damn it!
- Do it! -- Let's get out of here!

535
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:52,070
You see the shit
you got us into, man?

536
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:54,025
I told you that, you'd never
listening to me, you know.

537
01:03:53,942 --> 01:03:56,737
Six more,
six more fucking mouths to feed.

538
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,339
I can barely stand live
with you!

539
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,283
I wanna live with
their food!

540
01:04:02,045 --> 01:04:04,165
Damn it!

541
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:05,127
What?

542
01:04:05,085 --> 01:04:08,293
Say goodbye
to your little friend!

543
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,434
You're in my house
motherfucker!

544
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,845
Get down!

545
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:26,609
- Yeah, that didn't open up shit!
- It wasn't meant to, asshole.

546
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:29,415
I'm calling in the cavalry.

547
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,737
Let's fucking get out!

548
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:44,077
Open up!
Do it, fucker!

549
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,014
Come on!

550
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,984
You finally found me
ha, big dog?

551
01:05:14,922 --> 01:05:16,478
Well...

552
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,616
What took you so long?

553
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:25,012
It's not gonna open!
Come on!

554
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,077
God damn it!...

555
01:05:57,628 --> 01:06:00,087
It's toying with us.

556
01:07:36,413 --> 01:07:40,403
Guys!
Oh, shit!

557
01:07:52,052 --> 01:07:54,553
Hey!

558
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:41,229
Come on.
This way.

559
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:46,586
Hey!

560
01:08:47,621 --> 01:08:49,333
Hey!

561
01:08:50,268 --> 01:08:52,759
I, I...
I lost you guys.

562
01:08:53,638 --> 01:08:55,387
Come on.

563
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:59,168
You've got to get me
out of here, man. Come on.

564
01:09:01,423 --> 01:09:03,584
Let's move.

565
01:10:52,702 --> 01:10:55,641
"What a face you got on you!"

566
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,152
We killed it!

567
01:11:29,043 --> 01:11:31,951
We killed it!
We fuckin'...

568
01:11:32,852 --> 01:11:34,948
We fuckin' killed it!

569
01:11:34,864 --> 01:11:36,869
We killed it!

570
01:11:36,788 --> 01:11:38,159
We fuckin' killed it!

571
01:11:38,104 --> 01:11:41,166
Huh? Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?

572
01:11:41,044 --> 01:11:42,959
Huh? Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?

573
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,754
Suck my dick, bitch!

574
01:12:00,435 --> 01:12:02,222
Die you space faggot!

575
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,852
Who do you think
you're dealing with, huh?

576
01:12:03,784 --> 01:12:07,428
Is that all you got?
Go! Go! Go!

577
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:22,714
Come on...
Come on! Come on!

578
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,726
Come on! Come on!

579
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,846
Let's get to that ship.

580
01:16:16,749 --> 01:16:18,780
Oh, shit!

581
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,590
Ah, shit!

582
01:16:24,937 --> 01:16:28,358
Shit!
Fuck!

583
01:16:33,567 --> 01:16:36,510
A nother inch.
it would hit my tibial artery.

584
01:16:36,392 --> 01:16:39,633
- I guess it's my lucky day.
- It isn't.

585
01:16:39,503 --> 01:16:42,179
That trap wasn't meant to kill.

586
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:44,099
It was meant to maim.

587
01:16:44,519 --> 01:16:47,378
He's dead weight.
Come on.

588
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:51,337
No, I can...
I can still walk.

589
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,996
Oh, shit!
God!

590
01:16:53,884 --> 01:16:57,513
No, we can't let him through.
He's done.

591
01:16:57,368 --> 01:16:59,039
You gonna beg us
to slow down,

592
01:16:58,972 --> 01:17:01,482
- No, no, no....
- to carry you.

593
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,400
You can't leave me here.

594
01:17:06,314 --> 01:17:11,414
You can't. I have a family.
I've... I got kids.

595
01:17:12,903 --> 01:17:14,726
I'm sorry.

596
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:19,777
- We need to go.
- No, no!

597
01:17:19,647 --> 01:17:21,428
You're taking me with you!
You're taking me with you!

598
01:17:21,357 --> 01:17:23,264
Fuck you,
I can still make it.

599
01:17:23,188 --> 01:17:25,202
We use him.

600
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:28,217
We booby trap him.

601
01:17:28,093 --> 01:17:31,450
- No...
- They'll go to him to take trophies.

602
01:17:31,316 --> 01:17:33,334
This is our last chance.

603
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:35,097
This isn't right,
he's one of us.

604
01:17:35,023 --> 01:17:38,073
He is.
That's what they're counting on.

605
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:40,649
They want you
to feel something for this man,

606
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:42,558
to be human.

607
01:17:42,477 --> 01:17:45,662
And what are you?

608
01:17:45,534 --> 01:17:47,565
Alive.

609
01:17:49,299 --> 01:17:51,629
What's that worth?

610
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,074
Please. Please, I'm begging you.
Please.

611
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,250
You should go.

612
01:18:07,745 --> 01:18:11,164
- Come on.
- Okey.

613
01:18:12,212 --> 01:18:14,965
- You should've gone with him.
- I know.

614
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:42,220
Hey.

615
01:19:05,851 --> 01:19:08,482
I want off this planet.

616
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,288
You understand me?

617
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:17,128
I'll cut you down.

618
01:19:18,284 --> 01:19:20,805
You take me to the ship.

619
01:19:20,704 --> 01:19:22,749
The ship.

620
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:27,698
You understand me,
don't you?

621
01:19:30,523 --> 01:19:32,281
Huh?

622
01:19:43,129 --> 01:19:45,036
Shit!

623
01:20:03,918 --> 01:20:05,591
- God.
- I'm sorry.

624
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:07,375
Well, we're not dead yet.

625
01:20:09,937 --> 01:20:11,761
Shit!

626
01:23:46,759 --> 01:23:49,103
I guess he made it.

627
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:04,067
If we can do it over again,

628
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:07,843
would you make
the same choice?

629
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:13,528
Yes.

630
01:24:26,305 --> 01:24:28,423
Thank you.

631
01:24:29,992 --> 01:24:33,244
When the time comes,

632
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:35,277
I'll choose both.

633
01:24:36,163 --> 01:24:38,604
I promise you it will be quick.

634
01:24:39,518 --> 01:24:41,573
No...

635
01:24:42,647 --> 01:24:44,638
It won't.

636
01:25:03,505 --> 01:25:05,368
That's right.

637
01:25:06,116 --> 01:25:09,198
It's a neurotoxin.

638
01:25:09,075 --> 01:25:11,299
So many to choose
from around here.

639
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:14,093
But don't worry.
It's not fatal.

640
01:25:13,978 --> 01:25:16,300
You'll be able to experience...

641
01:25:16,207 --> 01:25:18,000
everything.

642
01:25:49,324 --> 01:25:52,303
I guess now you realize
why they chose me.

643
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,905
I was in front of you guys
the whole time.

644
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,468
Watching you.

645
01:25:59,845 --> 01:26:01,857
Earning your trust.

646
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,261
You couldn't see me
for what I really am.

647
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:11,689
You see, back home...

648
01:26:11,597 --> 01:26:13,938
I'm a murderer.

649
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:17,929
I'm a freak.

650
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,743
But here,

651
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:23,169
among the monsters...

652
01:26:26,273 --> 01:26:29,285
I'm normal.

653
01:26:29,164 --> 01:26:31,894
I like it here.

654
01:26:31,785 --> 01:26:34,167
I want to stay.

655
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:56,338
Oh, you came back.

656
01:26:56,992 --> 01:26:59,801
I missed my ride.

657
01:26:59,688 --> 01:27:03,773
Oh, thank God.
Help us get out of here.

658
01:27:22,598 --> 01:27:25,340
She's paralyzed.

659
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,769
Maybe they gave her something,
I don't know what.

660
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:30,208
But it paralyzed her.

661
01:27:33,564 --> 01:27:35,348
Come on.

662
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:55,774
You're so busy,
you didn't care about it.

663
01:27:55,649 --> 01:27:58,245
You've got
to look out for yourself.

664
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,517
We're getting out of here,
just stay in tight.

665
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:05,591
Now, I didn't think
you'd come back.

666
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:08,765
But she...

667
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,725
she never lost faith on you.

668
01:28:11,603 --> 01:28:14,456
I guess I owe you an apology.

669
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,757
You are a good man after all.

670
01:28:19,338 --> 01:28:21,489
No...

671
01:28:21,403 --> 01:28:23,320
I'm not.

672
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:29,381
But I'm fast.

673
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:44,929
Come here.

674
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:53,314
Please, don't kill me!
Please, don't kill me!

675
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:55,044
I won't!

676
01:30:06,455 --> 01:30:08,376
Help me.

677
01:30:09,957 --> 01:30:12,173
I'm one of you.

678
01:30:46,429 --> 01:30:49,550
<i>Come on, come on!
Do it!</i>

679
01:30:49,889 --> 01:30:53,049
Over here, kill me!
Come on!

680
01:30:53,613 --> 01:30:57,033
Come on!
Do it now! Kill me!

681
01:32:04,915 --> 01:32:06,464
Oh, shit!

682
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,516
Did you kill it?

683
01:34:54,793 --> 01:34:56,604
Yeah.

684
01:35:08,565 --> 01:35:10,713
I'm Royce.

685
01:35:13,043 --> 01:35:15,543
Nice to meet you, Royce.

686
01:35:17,499 --> 01:35:19,913
I'm Isabelle.

687
01:36:42,293 --> 01:36:44,529
Now...

688
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:48,010
Let's find a way
off this fucking planet.
