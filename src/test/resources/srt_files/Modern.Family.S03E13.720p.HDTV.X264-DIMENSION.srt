2
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:03,814
Does she know?

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,988
This is the last thing
she needs today.

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:08,490
No!

5
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:09,659
Busy day at the Dunphy compound.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,356
We have a wedding tonight,
and this afternoon,

7
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:14,008
Claire is debating Duane Bailey
in the race for town council.

8
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:17,016
And now the "weekly saver" says

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,262
that some voters
find Claire-- quote--

10
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:21,532
"angry and unlikable."

11
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:25,484
To those voters, I say,
"wait till she sees this."

12
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,903
No one can mention it to her.

13
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,151
We can't have
some unscientific poll

14
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:31,798
shaking Claire's confidence.

15
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,681
Phil...

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,295
- What poll?
-Too late. She knows.

17
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:36,661
Who told her?

18
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,971
What is this, a witch hunt?

19
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:39,280
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,346
I have to go.

21
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,185
Well, I just don't think
it's a big deal.

22
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,110
I mean, how many people
read the "weekly..."

23
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,143
- "Saver"?
- "Saver," anyway?

24
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:50,422
22,000... ish.

25
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,848
My company adver--

26
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:55,828
used to advertise
with that newspaper.

27
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,313
And how am I angry and unlikable?

28
00:00:58,314 --> 00:00:59,379
Can I take this one?

29
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,241
I wouldn't.

30
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:01,515
You seem angry now.

31
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,150
I am angry, at that poll.

32
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:05,550
I think it's the yelling.
I would tone down the yelling.

33
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,590
Honey, I don't yell
for no reason.

34
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,090
You yelled at my teacher
for calling me "special."

35
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,125
Honey, that was not a compliment.

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,229
- Sweetheart, you're not unlikable.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,791
- You just seem unlikable.
- Ohh.

38
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,809
But if we work on it,
it's totally fixable.

39
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,102
How? How, Phil?
How are we gonna "work on it"?

40
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,511
- First of all, lose the snippy attitude.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:25,292
And I don't know-- maybe
we could have a mock debate.

42
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,289
Oh. Good idea.

43
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,241
That way, mom can rehearse
her views on the issues.

44
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:29,404
Yeah, and we can point out
all the little things

45
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:31,069
she does that turn people off.

46
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,707
Like that look.
I would lose that look.

47
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:38,523
Spooky, but better.

48
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,689

49
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:53,131
All right. Thank you very much.

50
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,863
Hey, Lily!
Come here, honey!

51
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:58,614
Hi! Do you know what this is?

52
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,604
A box.

53
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,873
- Containing?
- She doesn't know "containing."

54
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:02,907
Well, that's how
 she learns new words,

55
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,075
by us using them.

56
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,679
Or, that's how we lower
her self-esteem,

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,047
by bombarding her
with confusing vocabulary.

58
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:10,116
What's the box containing?

59
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:11,026
Told you.

60
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:12,485
Okay. It's your dress.

61
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:13,853
It's finally here!

62
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,054
Aah!

63
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:16,624
It's every little girl's dream

64
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,386
to be a flower girl in a wedding.

65
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:19,962
It's Lily's chance to shine.

66
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:21,543
I was a 3-time ring bearer.

67
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,322
It's Lily's chance to shine.

68
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,906
Oh!

69
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,022
Pretty!

70
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,220
Oh, no, Cam--

71
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:32,381
Cam, she's gonna look like little bo peep.

72
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:34,038
Or little bo cheap.

73
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,120
Look at this fabric. It's already pilling.

74
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,508
You mean "turned on?"

75
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,555
You mean turned on?

76
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:42,491
No, it does not--Cam! Oh!

77
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:43,183
I love it!

78
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:44,450
No, you don't.

79
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,536
Oh, my gosh. Are we really
gonna let her wear this?

80
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,705
You know what? If the bride
wants to have a tacky wedding,

81
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:49,912
she can have a tacky wedding.

82
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,497
- Lily will be the bright spot. 
- Literally.

83
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:52,999
Heard it as soon as I said it.

84
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:55,915
Stella!

85
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:59,184
Where's my good girl?

86
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,654
Gloria, is Stella up there?

87
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,432
No. But I am.

88
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:08,135
Why don't you say "hello"
to your wife when you come home?

89
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,672
Well, why don't you greet me
at the door, wagging your tail?

90
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,018
Stella, honey!
Where are you?

91
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:14,943
Stella!

92
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,444
My baby!

93
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:21,042
Stella, I'm coming! I'm coming!

94
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:28,488
You okay? You okay?

95
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,020
Why are you swimming
in your clothes?

96
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,076
Because I'm self-conscious
about my body.

97
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,480
Stella fell in the pool.

98
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,149
It's my fault.
I let her out,

99
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,567
and then I got caught up
in my couponing.

100
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,353
Any coupons for swim lessons?

101
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,954
'Cause Stella needs some.

102
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,890
Seriously? Manny you teach to swim

103
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:44,990
by throwing him in the pool,

104
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,660
but the dog gets swimming lessons?

105
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,129
I gotta say, it was
unpleasant but effective.

106
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,631
We have to teach
Stella how to swim.

107
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,799
Otherwise, she could drown.

108
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,001
Why don't you teach her
not to jump in the pool?

109
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,929
She didn't jump in the pool.
She fell in the pool.

110
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,953
Why, suddenly,
would she jump in the pool

111
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,078
when she doesn't
know how to swim?

112
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,134
Why does she bark at the vacuum?

113
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:05,082
It's a thing. It is never
going to play with you.

114
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:07,226
Are you saying
that Stella is stupid?

115
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,908
Are you covering her ears?

116
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:10,409
Let's have a little compassion.

117
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:13,639
She's probably still traumatized
from her near-death experience.

118
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:15,748
Again? What's happening?!

119
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,217
Ay, no!

120
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,553
Welcome, candidates.
Mrs. Dunphy...

121
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:21,920
Thank you for having me.

122
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:22,889
And councilman Bailey.

123
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,156
Gosh, thank you so much, Alex.

124
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,601
I'm deeply honored to be here,

125
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:28,157
and I remain, as ever,
a humble servant

126
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,888
to the greatest little town

127
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,457
in the greatest darn--

128
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:32,965
eye-rolling.

129
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:34,390
Playful eye rolling.

130
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,703
How do we, as voters,
know it's playful?

131
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:37,746
I would avoid it.

132
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,425
Okay. No eye rolling.

133
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:41,624
And don't purse
your lips like that.

134
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:42,959
- It makes you look annoyed.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:45,627
And don't touch your face.

136
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,697
Yeah, no face touching.
Seems nervous.

137
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:49,677
Some of this is subjective.

138
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,168
- What? What now?
- Anger.

139
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,969
It looks like you're scolding us.

140
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:56,071
I will keep my hands at my sides.

141
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:57,440
Not on your hips.
You're not superman.

142
00:04:58,475 --> 00:04:59,375
Can we get started?

143
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,509
We haven't started?

144
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:01,877
I've prepared some questions.

145
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,246
Oh, goody! Actual questions.

146
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,246
Honk. Sarcasm.

147
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:05,915
Just go.

148
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:07,149
Okay, Mrs. Dunphy,

149
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:09,719
why are you running
for local office?

150
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:11,120
Okay, that's, um, that's good.

151
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:13,789
I... um, I--

152
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,091
Mom, you really
shouldn't stutter

153
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:16,492
over a basic question like that.

154
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,623
You should at least
know why you're running.

155
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,772
I thought the moderator
was supposed to be objective.

156
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:22,039
Not if she's
the only one in the room

157
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,955
who has actual debate experience.

158
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,438
Now why are you running?

159
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,726
I saw the need
for a stop sign in--

160
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,469
Liar!

161
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,249
Phil!

162
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:31,697
I-I just think you should be
ready for anything.

163
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,977
I saw the need for a s--

164
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:34,945
What?

165
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,914
Sorry. Accidental buzz.

166
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:38,648
I saw the need for a stop sign
in my neighborhood,

167
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,503
and although I collected
the necessary signatures

168
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,820
and did the paperwork,
I found local government

169
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:44,119
to be entirely unhelpful--

170
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,323
- when-- what?
- Too long. I'm bored.

171
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,814
Yeah, next question.
I feel like I'm in school.

172
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:52,207
Some say the political system
is bogged down

173
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,082
by ideological hard-liners

174
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,888
- unwilling to compromise.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

175
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,740
How would you respond to that,
councilman Bailey?

176
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,097
I would like to use my lifeline.

177
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,149
I'll take this.

178
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,956
If elected, I would
consider all perspectives,

179
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:10,347
and I would not ignore
opposing viewpoints.

180
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,518
Helicopter. Just keep going.

181
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,553
I would consider all perspectives,

182
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,357
- and I wouldn't ignore opposing--
- You suck!

183
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,109
Luke!

184
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,490
You have to be
ready for hecklers.

185
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,025
He's right.

186
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,243
Okay. I'm doing over.
No buzzing.

187
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:23,870
If elected, I--

188
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,589
- What?
- Too close to the mic.

189
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,190
Phil, it's a hairbrush.

190
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,359
Okay.

191
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:34,330
If elected, I would
consider all opinions

192
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:36,432
and not ignore those
of the opposition,

193
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,101
as councilman Bailey
has done for six terms.

194
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:41,871
What? That was a great answer.

195
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:43,072
Well, I couldn't hear it

196
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,911
because you were showing me
the bad side of your face.

197
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,221
I have a bad side?

198
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:48,924
- Yeah, the left.
- No. It's the right.

199
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:51,013
Uh, dad, it's totally the left.
I mean, look at it.

200
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:52,915
Sweetheart, why do you think
I chose my side of the bed?

201
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,186
Okay! Okay. Thank you.

202
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,590
Thank you, family.
This has been super-duper helpful.

203
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:59,349
Hands, lips, sarcasm, eye-rolling,

204
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,364
wrong side of the face.

205
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,064
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah. Now I see it.

206
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:03,741
Yep.

207
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:07,755
She's ready.

208
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,073
And it's this,

209
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,770
and it's this.

210
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:14,948
Not this,

211
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:16,715
but this.

212
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,117
- Okay. Okay, that's good, Cam.
- And this.

213
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:20,453
Save-- let's save some 
petals for Lily, all right?

214
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,854
Okay. Let's do it
over here, sweetheart.

215
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:22,521
- Right over here.
- Okay.

216
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,491
- There you go.
- Oh, like you're coming down the aisle!

217
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,926
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,027
Not too many at once.
That's good.

219
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:29,328
- Okay.
- You're doing great, Lil.

220
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,697
Oh, she is, isn't she?

221
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:32,331
Forget the bride.
All the eyes are gonna be on her.

222
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:34,567
Oh...

223
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,244
I cannot believe you laughed!

224
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,783
I am sorry. But you know
I have two weaknesses--

225
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,019
children cursing and
old people rapping.

226
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,787
Cam, we have to tell her
it's a bad word.

227
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:55,789
No. That just gives it more power.

228
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,792
The less we make of it,
the better.

229
00:07:57,826 --> 00:07:59,393
Let's just pretend
like it never happened.

230
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,928
Okay. Yeah, maybe it-- 
maybe it didn't.

231
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,863
Maybe we--
maybe we misheard.

232
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:05,199
Yeah. Maybe she said "truck."

233
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,567
Or-- or "duck."

234
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:09,369
Or "luck."
She could have said "yuck."

235
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,138
Daddy, can I have some ice cream?

236
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:13,641
No, honey, if you're hungry,
you can have some fruit.

237
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:16,176
Fruit?.

238
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,545
I have two children.

239
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:29,596
Phil? Phil, is this televised?

240
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,799
I didn't tell you because I didn't
want to make you nervous.

241
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,534
Great plan. Really good plan.

242
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:35,034
Throw me for a curveball
at the last minute.

243
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,770
Mom, chill.
It's just public access.

244
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:38,538
My debate team's
on public access,

245
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,707
and the only people who
watch me are you guys.

246
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:41,909
Yep. All the time.

247
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,508
So maybe nobody will see this?

248
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,303
No. We want people to see this.

249
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:48,086
- That's how you win elections.
That's the whole point. - Mm-hmm.

250
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,696
Then mom should do something
so crazy and stupid,

251
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,808
- it goes viral.
- Mom, please don't go viral.

252
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,167
Okay. I'll add that to my list
of things not to do--

253
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,703
don't touch my face,
don't roll my eyes,

254
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,070
don't point my fingers,

255
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,672
and definitely don't go viral.

256
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,454
Do any of you still believe in me?

257
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,449
Of course we do.
We're on your side.

258
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,949
- The right side.
- Mm.

259
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,017
Not the left.

260
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,218
Let's grab a seat.

261
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:11,789
Right. Left.

262
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:14,158
- Okay. Mom, just be confident.
- Mm-hmm?

263
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,393
Based on what? I just lost
a debate in my living room,

264
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,228
and people think I'm unlikable.

265
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:19,663
That's just the word men
use for powerful women

266
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,031
because they feel threatened.

267
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:24,935
So just forget everything else
and be proud and powerful.

268
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:26,735
How did you get so smart?

269
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,733
I've always assumed
adoption or baby switch.

270
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,160
- Mm.
- Hey. Hey. No kisses!

271
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:32,019
Proud and powerful.

272
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,708
- Sorry.
- And no apologizing.

273
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,883
Yes! Shut up and get in there!

274
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,485
- That's more like it!
- Uh-huh!

275
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,749
Yeah!

276
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,481
Oh, God.

277
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,124
There she is.

278
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,993
- Go get 'em, Claire.
- Thanks.

279
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,127
Don't worry.
We're going to cheer for you

280
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:48,362
no matter what you say.

281
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,931
Oh, good. More support
from my loving family.

282
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,733
Honk. Sarcasm.

283
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,672
Why'd you bring Stella?

284
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,791
She keeps getting out
and jumping in the pool.

285
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,307
We don't wanna take any chances
because she can't swim.

286
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,995
Then why does she
keep jumping in the pool?

287
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,429
I've been thinking about it.
I got a theory.

288
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:04,522
She might be suicidal.

289
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,463
What? That's crazy.

290
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,216
There's not such thing
as doggy suicide.

291
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,857
Hi. Duane Bailey.

292
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,870
Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.

293
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,504
In addition to being
a public servant,

294
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:18,273
I'm also an award-winning
breeder of puggles.

295
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,443
I've won the puggly. Twice.

296
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:22,011
And I'm afraid that doggy suicide

297
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,858
is all too real.

298
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,448
It's just the mainstream media
doesn't report on it,

299
00:10:26,482 --> 00:10:29,002
'cause it's not as sexy
as feline A.I.D.S.

300
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,345
Stella is not suicidal.
She's just... estupid.

301
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:34,285
Well, that might be
part of your problem.

302
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:35,486
She senses you don't like her.

303
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:36,753
You have no idea.

304
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,421
This one's been against
this little angel

305
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:39,756
from the very beginning.

306
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,891
Yeah, well, dogs pick up on that.

307
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,325
You know, they're very sensitive.

308
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,395
I like to call them, um...

309
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:46,697
Bottomless pits of need.

310
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:47,931
But not to their face, though.

311
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,066
That would just destroy them.

312
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,400
Not you.

313
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,005
So now this is my fault?

314
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:52,907
I think he knows
what he's talking about.

315
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,247
The man won a puggly.

316
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:56,014
- Two. I won two pugglies.
- We're done here.

317
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:57,845
- In 2000--
- Yeah.

318
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:01,778
Do you have any idea
what station this is on?

319
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:02,750
Here, I'll look online.

320
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,679
It's a Webcast? That would
have been helpful to know

321
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,690
900 channels ago.

322
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:07,776
No, it's on public access
or something.

323
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,379
I wanna watch aunt Claire!

324
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,782
Okay. Well, first, honey,
we need to talk about something.

325
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:13,874
It's about that word
you said this morning.

326
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:15,085
What word?

327
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,109
You know, the one
that starts with "f"?

328
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,130
- "Flower"?
- No.

329
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,302
- "Fruit"?
- No.

330
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:23,487
If she doesn't remember it,
we shouldn't remind her.

331
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:25,076
Oh, well, she said it three times.

332
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:27,265
Oh, you mean.

333
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,454
Cam, leave the room!

334
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:33,430
No. I can do this.

335
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,200
Lily, that is a bad word,

336
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,563
and you are not allowed
to say it ever.

337
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,011
But it makes you laugh.

338
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:41,412
Okay, well, daddy
shouldn't be laughing,

339
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:44,058
and you should never
say that word.

340
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,201
Do you understand?

341
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,582
Maybe.

342
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,658
Okay.
This is not a game, all right?

343
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:50,929
If you say that word
one more time,

344
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,230
I'm gonna take away
all your toys!

345
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:54,299
I'm serious!
She knows I'm not serious.

346
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,135
What about the wedding?

347
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:58,837
What if she says it there?
She's like a ticking time bomb!

348
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,706
- Well, what are we gonna do, cancel?
- Yes.

349
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,774
Maybe we just call and say,

350
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,408
"we're not going
to any more weddings

351
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,410
- until the gays can get married."
- Oh, so now we're political?

352
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,945
We leave town
on gay pride weekend

353
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,781
because we don't like the traffic.

354
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,225
But there's no substitute
for experience.

355
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,336
For example, I doubt
my opponent is familiar

356
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,080
with town ordinance 26-12B...

357
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:23,725
26-12B has to do
with noise pollution--

358
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:26,154
something, sir, that you
are guilty of right now.

359
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,343
Oh, no she di'int!

360
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:30,168
Go, mom!

361
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,101
Ladies and gentlemen...

362
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:31,925
Look at her eyes.

363
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:33,899
I know. They're a little
too close together.

364
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,501
It's been bugging me for years.

365
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:38,205
No, she's in the zone.
She's ready for anything.

366
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,038
I do like to talk...
about the issues.

367
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,348
Speaking of issues,

368
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:45,384
your husband seems to have some.

369
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:46,713
I'm sorry?

370
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,249
I'm not sorry. What?

371
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:51,318
Oh, well, I wouldn't
want to bring it up,

372
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:53,034
but since you asked, um...

373
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:55,190
In February of last year,
your husband,

374
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,718
one, uh, Phillip Dunphy,
was questioned at a local hotel

375
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:02,899
for lewd and lascivious conduct.

376
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:03,821
Oh, jeez.

377
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:05,708
That's not true.

378
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,454
Ma'am, according
to this police report,

379
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,050
he, uh, broke
into a stranger's room,

380
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:11,472
stripped naked...

381
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,493
and then posed
provocatively on the bed.

382
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:19,265
That is technically true,

383
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,654
but in all fairness,
it was Valentine's day.

384
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:25,623
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.
It was Valentine's day.

385
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,658
I'm not sure, uh,

386
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,292
if your husband
was born in this country.

387
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,994
Ah. Perhaps he snuck in illegally,

388
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,497
but here in America,
we celebrate Valentine's day

389
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,065
with chocolates,

390
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,366
not our private parts.

391
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,201
Mm.

392
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,337
- This is my new favorite show.
- Shh!

393
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,506
No, sir,

394
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,884
he was looking for me, his wife,

395
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,987
and he walked into
the wrong room.

396
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:47,755
If you believe that,
I have some talking puggles

397
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,180
I'd like to sell you.

398
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,619
Do you believe this?

399
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,989
Talking dogs? I'm skeptical.

400
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,806
- I won the puggly. Twice.
- Be strong.

401
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:58,975
I am glad that my opponent
brought this up,

402
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:03,674
as I feel that it speaks
to his character more than mine.

403
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:07,010
I think that we should
raise the level of discourse

404
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,437
and get back to the issues

405
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,960
that the voters
really care about.

406
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:12,054
When he was naked,
what were you wearing?

407
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,383
I... don't think that's relevant.

408
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:15,879
Are you sex freaks?

409
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,623
My personal life has
nothing to do with this.

410
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:23,493
Uh--the--my opponent
has brought this up

411
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,730
to distract from his own record,

412
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,332
which shows that in--
in six years,

413
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,268
he has achieved nothing more
than writing one ordinance

414
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,438
that allows private parties
to have more than eight dogs.

415
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,640
Hmm. Hmm.

416
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,674
It's like watching the "hindenburg."

417
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,843
This is the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.

418
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,979
- Excuse me!
- Stand by.

419
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,815
I am Phil Dunphy,
and I am not a pervert.

420
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,552
I, like a lot of men in this town,

421
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:51,588
enjoy making love to my wife.

422
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,648
I mean, um...
I mean with their wives.

423
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:56,942
Not me, them.

424
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:01,309
Look, I should probably just
sit down and say nothing.

425
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,148
But it's too late.

426
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,482
I am standing,
and I'm obviously talking,

427
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,251
and now you're looking at me,

428
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:07,924
and I feel the need to keep going.

429
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,189
First of all...

430
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:13,034
No charges were filed.

431
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:15,365
Everyone had a good laugh--

432
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,703
about the situation,
not-- not about me.

433
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:19,370
Everything's fine down there.

434
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,250
Anywho...

435
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:23,885
Where were we?

436
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:25,710
All over YouTube.

437
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,047
We went viral.

438
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:29,289
Some sick bastard auto-tuned me.

Jay! Manny!

447
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,628
We should have
been there already!

448
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:51,322
Gloria, I'm tying my tie!

449
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:52,761
I'm accessorizing!

450
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,171
And I thought I was the woman.

451
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:01,798
The door.

452
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:04,202
Ay! Estella, no! No!

453
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,012
Ay! No! No!

454
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,258
Estella, don't do it!
Don't kill yourself!

455
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:09,879
You are a perfectly fine dog!

456
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:11,615
I don't hate you!

457
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,883
Estella, okay, I was
a little mean to you,

458
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,586
but that's no reason
to kill yourself!

459
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,687
You are young!

460
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,887
You still have so much left to smell!

461
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:20,729
Ay!

462
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,464
I am-- I go!

463
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:24,266
I'm coming!

464
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,634
I'm--Manny!

465
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:28,137
Ay! Come on, estella!

466
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:31,308
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

467
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:33,100
She did it again.

468
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:35,148
- And you jumped in to save her?
- No, Jay!

469
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,031
I wanted to take a little swim
before going to the wedding!

470
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,739
Get her a towel
she's shaking like a leaf.

471
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:47,760
Oh, no, no, I meant--

472
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:49,395
- I meant-- 
- Thank you, Jay.

473
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,964
The dog towel for me.

474
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,844
For the wife.

475
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,883
Hi!

476
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,688
Hey, guys, hi.

477
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,684
- Hi.
- Hey, what's shakin'? What's cooking?

478
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:04,230
You saw the debate, didn't you?

479
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,730
- The de-what?
- No, that wasn't--

480
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,065
- that was today?
- No, no. Was that on today?

481
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,099
Oh, I didn't remember.

482
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,967
You are the worst liars.

483
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,934
It was phenomenal television.

484
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,413
Oh, Lily.

485
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,190
What a...

486
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:16,015
dress.

487
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:18,680
Oh, well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

488
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:21,949
How about there... we go.

489
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,063
Wow. Ohh.

490
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:25,216
- Yikes.
- She looks like a lite brite.

491
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,250
Luke, honey.

492
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,702
Lily, sweetie, are you excited
to be a flower girl?

493
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:30,437
Yeah?

494
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,639
Little bit nervous?

495
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:33,273
Yeah?

496
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:36,034
Why isn't she talking to me?
Did she see the debate, too?

497
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:37,669
Nope, she's on verbal lockdown.

498
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:40,649
- Oh? - She's been dropping
a certain curse word all day.

499
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,006
- Mm.
- Yeah. Yeah, so we're just hoping

500
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,510
the next one doesn't happen
during the wedding.

501
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:45,914
If it does, it'll be the second
most embarrassing thing

502
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,397
to happen to our family today.

503
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,225
Phil, you said it wasn't that bad.

504
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,026
That was in the car.
We're in a church now.

505
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:51,821
Honey...

506
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,022
Somebody turn her off.
I think I'm having a seizure.

507
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:57,583
- Oh, buddy.
- Oh. Yeah.

508
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:01,660
Oh, good. I thought that
we were going to miss Lily.

509
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:02,996
Ships at sea wouldn't miss Lily.

510
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,164
Where have you guys been?

511
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:07,633
I had to jump in the pool
to save the stupid dog...

512
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,101
Who she loves.

513
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,870
That I didn't let her down
doesn't mean that I love her.

514
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,906
I barely got Manny
back in the pool

515
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,808
after that possum incident.

516
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,142
I thought it drowned,

517
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:19,545
but turns out it was
just playing possum.

518
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:21,547
Yes, papi.

519
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:33,559
Good job!

520
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,162
Oh!

521
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,357
You know what the worst
part of today was?

522
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,812
I imagine it's hard to choose.

523
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:48,297
When everything was melting down,

524
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,584
I realized I had
an answer to your question,

525
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:51,786
why I was running.

526
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,000
I wanted to make my family proud,

527
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,069
and I did the exact opposite.

528
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:57,181
No.

529
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:59,338
No, I did.
I totally embarrassed you.

530
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,240
No. No, dad embarrassed me.

531
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,418
I was proud of you.

532
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,971
I think it's cool you're
running for local office.

533
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:09,000
I mean, it's totally nerdy,
and that's kind of my thing.

534
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:12,343
Hmm. Maybe it's kind of our thing.

535
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:23,813
Ah. Some day,
I'll walk you down the aisle.

536
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:26,163
If you're not in perv jail.

537
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:29,452
Please be seated.

538
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,683
Friends, family,
thank you for making...

539
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,294
Really?

540
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:39,187
Well, you know I cry at weddings.

541
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:40,753
Oh, no.

542
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,843
- What?
- Stop-- stop crying.

543
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:44,682
Well, just because you have
ice water in your veins,

544
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,380
- doesn't mean that-- 
- No. No, Lily...

545
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,015
No. Lily...

546
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,349
He's fine. Daddy's fine.

547
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,171
- Daddy's not sad.
- Daddy, daddy!

548
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:06,981
You see? I told you it was funny.

549
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:14,242
Excuse us.

550
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:15,943
Congratulations.

551
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,946
Bye, Lily.

552
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,840
***
Go on, you little motorboat!

553
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:27,458
Look at her go!

554
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,227
Where's she going?

555
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:31,784
Oh, jeez, I think she's trying to get herself

556
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:32,890
sucked into the filter.

557
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:34,216
What'd you say to her?

558
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,017
I didn't say anything!

559
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,198
Wait a second.

560
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,351
Jay, look.

561
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,372
See? She was not
trying to kill herself.

562
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:46,409
She was just trying to get
to the squeaky wiener!

563
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,657
That must be why
she's been jumping in.

564
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:50,058
It must have been there
all the time. That's hilarious!

565
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,177
Ay, si!

566
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,782
No, it's not!

567
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:53,892
Not now.

568
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:56,495
I'm saying it will be.

569
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:57,957
Later.

570
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:07,058
