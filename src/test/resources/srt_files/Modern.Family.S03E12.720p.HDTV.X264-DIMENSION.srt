1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:02,218
So the five keys

2
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:06,198
to investing wisely in a down
real estate market are...

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,754
Keyp your cool...

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,006
Keyp informed...

5
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,325
Legwork.

6
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:18,349
I recently became a partner
in a new agency,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,170
so I put together a seminar

8
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:22,570
to recruit first-time
home buyers.

9
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,732
I want to give 'em
a step-by-step description

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,090
of exactly what
I can do for them.

11
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:28,832
Am I worried that
they might write it all down

12
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,354
and just do it themselves?

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,950
Quite frankly, I hadn't thought
about it until just now.

14
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:35,706
Do I really have
to go to this thing?

15
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:37,131
Yes. You're a big part of today.

16
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:38,379
You're my support staff.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,227
Then why am I not getting paid?

18
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:41,840
That is a good question.

19
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,842
And I think I'm gonna
text you the answer

20
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,136
on that cell phone we pay for.

21
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:46,923
Honey, do you wanna
practice your part again?

22
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:49,322
Uh, no. It's just one question.
I think I got it.

23
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:50,996
Yeah, but it's the most
important question

24
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:52,804
because it launches me
into my big finish.

25
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:54,854
- Yes.
- That way, people leave excited.

26
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,824
Oh, I think people
will be excited to leave.

27
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:02,995
Luke...

28
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:04,360
Why?

29
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,332
I'm sorry. It's for school.

30
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,749
I have to design a container
that'll protect an egg

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,729
in a 1-story drop.

32
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,760
Yeah, so, um,

33
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,207
you thought you would go
with an egg carton?

34
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,542
What if the best idea was
under my nose the whole time?

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,273
You're gonna need to come down
and clean this up now.

36
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:20,193
Ugh! I wouldn't have
to do any of this

37
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:21,879
if Alex would just
let me use hers

38
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,941
- from when she took the class.
- Never.

39
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:26,531
That design is
my intellectual property.

40
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,871
I think it has applications
for unmanned space flight.

41
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:29,767
Keep talking like that

42
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,618
and you'll go
through life unmanned.

43
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,068
- Funny.
- Girls.

44
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,361
Luke, honey, listen to me.

45
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,485
You're gonna need to do
this project on your own.

46
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:39,129
And you can do it.
Just... really think.

47
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,231
I've got it!

48
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,105
What if I'm the container?

49
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,726
There's a thought.
You could be...

50
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:45,904
No, Luke! Luke!

51
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,715

[Spanish?]

53
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,006
Okay, si, te quiero.
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

54
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,750
I understood "crazy old witch,"

55
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,699
"go kill yourself,"
then "I love you."

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,369
I'll never get this,
how you all yell at each other.

57
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,097
That's how you know
that your family loves you--

58
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,129
when they feel free
to scream at you.

59
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,993
Oh, I guess I owe
my ex-wife an apology.

60
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,943
Apparently, she was nuts ab.

61
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,432
Darn it!

62
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:30,973
Try the next one
over a frying pan.

63
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,554
I could use some breakfast.

64
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:33,948
This is so frustrating.

65
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,816
At least you're getting
your hands dirty for a change.

66
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:36,744
It is a nice break

67
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:39,815
- from the life of the mind I usually live.
- That's the spirit.

68
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,877
Plus it's a metaphor
for the human condition.

69
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,266
Aren't we al just fragile eggs

70
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:44,829
hiding behind
bubble wrap and bravado?

71
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,944
And we're back.

72
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,878
Well, I'm sure that
your egg-droppy thing

73
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,693
is going to be
the best in the class.

74
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:50,926
Hmm. Except for Luke's.

75
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:53,721
Really? Our Luke?

76
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,029
But isn't he, like, a little, like...

77
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,193
I bet Claire's gonna help him,

78
00:02:57,194 --> 00:03:00,299
just like she did with
his self-portrait for art class.

79
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,090
There was life in those eyes.

80
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:02,845
It was haunting.

81
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:05,087
Tell you what.
I'm gonna nip this in the bud.

82
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,900
You deserve a fighting chance.

83
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,437
Hey, I'm calling about that, uh,
egg project the boys are doing.

84
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,046
Parents aren't supposed
to help out on that, right?

85
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,828
Why would the parents be helping?

86
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,550
Why do they cut grapes
for 8-year-olds?

87
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:19,050
I figure if you can
eat a chicken finger,

88
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:20,458
you can tear your way
through a grape.

89
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,344
Again, dad?

90
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:22,829
Oh, I'm sorry, it just...

91
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,337
bugs me, is all.

92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,054
The point is, I'm not helping,

93
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,578
and I hope no one else
is helping, either.

94
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,699
Okay, dad.
Thanks for the heads-up.

95
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,762
Love you. Bye-bye.

96
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:36,502
Well, my dad is doing
Manny's project for him.

97
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:37,888
He called to tell you that?

98
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,235
Oh, no. He called
to tell me that he wasn't,

99
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,500
which is exactly what
you say when you are,

100
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,382
but you don't want
anybody to suspect it.

101
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,826
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,298
What would you say if you had
issues with your father?

103
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,211
Claire and Jay
are incredibly competitive.

104
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,819
Tennis games, card games,
everything.

105
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,243
Who knows why?

106
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,777
Claire is the son
that my dad never had.

107
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:00,602
I mean, he just wanted someone
to throw a ball in the backyard.

108
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:02,878
I did once, but...

109
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,015
he did not attend.

110
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:07,994
Looks like fun.

111
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,497
It was, but now it's hard.

112
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,860
Oh, I'm sure you're
gonna do great, buddy...

113
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,365
- Eee...
- Claire?

114
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,982
Uh, I am just showing interest

115
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,505
in our son's project,
which any parent would--

116
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:25,007
Think! Think... to do.
Thinking... I am,

117
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:26,563
that maybe I should stay here

118
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,033
in case Luke has any questions.

119
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,614
Do you think you can
find somebody else

120
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:31,607
to help you with your seminar?

121
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,471
I don't know.
That's a little last-minute.

122
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,337
You're kind of irreplaceable.

123
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:37,341
Well, I mean,
it's just one question,

124
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,297
and the seminar
isn't for a few hours...

125
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:40,183
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

126
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:42,674
Hey, Gloria? Quick favor.

127
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,138
Okay. See you there. Bye-bye.

128
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,210
What was that?

129
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:47,729
Phil.

130
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,760
He needs help with
a seminar that he's giving.

131
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,241
Why can't Claire help him?

132
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,074
- He didn't say.
- I'll tell you why--

133
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:56,791
because she's knee-deep
in Luke's egg drop project.

134
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,272
She said that she
was not going to help.

135
00:04:58,273 --> 00:04:59,944
That's exactly what
I would say to me

136
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:02,263
if I was helping my kid
and didn't want me to know.

137
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:04,261
Why would you be talking to you?

138
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,157
I'm just saying
it's unfair to Manny.

139
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:08,415
The kid doesn't
stand a chance on his own.

140
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm tagging in here.

141
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,275
Jay, he doesn't
need you to baby him.

142
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:12,744
I'm just gonna give him a few tips.

143
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,238
Kid, get yourself a snack.

144
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,512
Okay, I'll cut him some grapes.

145
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:17,210
Damn it!

146
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:18,415
Not like that, Jay.

147
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,177
Like this. Look.

148
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,555
It just irritates me,
you know what I mean?

149
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,735
We're meeting with
prospective birth mothers.

150
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,067
We've had a few
of these meetings,

151
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:30,385
and they're very nerve-racking.

152
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:31,481
You want to look good,

153
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,426
you want to make
a good first impression--

154
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,598
kind of like a first date.

155
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,813
Actually, it's--it's
the opposite of a first date.

156
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:39,837
You don't wanna have sex,
but you do want a baby.

157
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,559
I have to say,
Lily is adorable,

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,950
and such a good eater.

159
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:45,352
Oh, not all the time.

160
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:48,496
She just happens
to love my tuna salad.

161
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,753
Dolphin safe, of course.

162
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,479
Oh, who cares about that?

163
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,549
Well, I bet the dolphins do.

164
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,532
It's okay to eat tuna,
but not dolphin?

165
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,669
My theory is, a fish is a fish.

166
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,823
- Mm.
- Well...

167
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,119
A dolphin's actually
a mammal, so...

168
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,321
Eh, to-may-to, to-mah-to.

169
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,946
More like tomato, cow.

170
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:08,122
Mitchell, can you help me
with the scones in the kitchen?

171
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,162
Okay.

172
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:10,668
Excuse us.

173
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:13,888
Okay, this is not really
about the scones.

174
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,869
Oh, really? You didn't need
help carrying six scones?

175
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,839
No, this is about
your need to correct

176
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,353
everyone's every little mistake.

177
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:20,409
I am sorry.

178
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,723
I thought that she could
use a basic biology lesson.

179
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,958
Well, let me give you
a basic biology lesson--

180
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,717
you and I can't make a baby.

181
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,244
So if she points to a lamp
and calls it "Uncle George,"

182
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,633
what are you gonna say?

183
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,221
"Pleased to meet you,
Uncle George."

184
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:35,151
Very good.
Now let's get out there,

185
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,185
smile, nod, and
get ourselves a baby.

186
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,015
Okay.

187
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:41,774
And those are your five keys.

188
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:45,322
Now if there are
no more questions...

189
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,629
Ah, yes, the lovely
home buyer right here

190
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,040
on the edge of her seat.

191
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:51,597
I was wondering...

192
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,443
I was wondering,

193
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,387
is there a sixth key?

194
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,331
As a matter of fact,

195
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,900
there is.

196
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,008
We'll work on that.

197
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,690
It's the key to the new home
you've purchased below market

198
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,560
thanks to Woosnum,
Keneally, and Dunphy.

199
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,408
Bravo!

200
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,897
Fire the confetti cannon,
drop the banner,

201
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,335
autographs, autographs, autographs,

202
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:15,347
and we're done.

203
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,710
We still have, like, an hour left.

204
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:17,756
Can I go shopping?

205
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,842
No. I-I have vocal exercises to do,

206
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:21,310
and I need you to do
a sound check for me.

207
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:23,803
Ay, I was hoping we could
go to my hair salon.

208
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:27,056
It's nearby. I didn't have time
to finish my hair this morning.

209
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:28,105
Really? That just happens?

210
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:30,165
Ooh, and I can get my nails done.

211
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,070
Is it okay?

212
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,397
Okay. Sure.

213
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:33,551
Oh, oh! Could one of you guys

214
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:34,841
stick this under a chair
on your way out?

215
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,357
One of the lucky attendees
is going home

216
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:37,992
with a brand-new mouse pad.

217
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:39,134
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

218
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:40,249
I don't wanna see which chair.

219
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,264
I wanna be blown away
like everyone else.

220
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,036
Yes. Now that is feng shui.

221
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,223
Doesn't that feel better?

222
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:51,136
Oh, yes.
This is wonderful for conversation.

223
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,030
Yes, this is nice.

224
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,971
It gives the room a nice flow,

225
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:55,442
which I'm really liking.

226
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:59,453
Sometimes, your furniture
tells you where it wants to be.

227
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,356
Yeah.

228
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,954
Do you mind if
I use your restroom?

229
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:06,422
Not at all. It's--
it's just down the hall.

230
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,512
Just be warned--
there's some furniture in there

231
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,384
that kind of likes where it is!

232
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:13,007
Okay, I know it's killing you
to do this whole song and dance,

233
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,782
but I think it's going great.

234
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,035
Cam, there's a limit, okay?

235
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,976
We already promised her
that we would show her son

236
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,270
all 52 states.

237
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,948
Oh, wow, you have a keyboard.

238
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:21,967
Oh, yes. That's mine.

239
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,035
You're musical. I love that.

240
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,622
It's very important to me.

241
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,261
Oh, well, you're
preaching to the choir.

242
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,024
Literally. I've sung in several.

243
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,241
Yeah, we sing to Lily...

244
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,223
All of the time. Mm.

245
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:32,628
I wish I could hear you guys.

246
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,566
Oh, well, that's very sweet.

247
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,885
No, now.

248
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,852
The baby's father is a musician,

249
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,857
and I would love to know
that he's growing up

250
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:41,919
in a musical household.

251
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,168
- Okay.
- Great.

252
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,070
Okay. Now we are actually
doing a song and dance.

253
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:50,940
Okay, well, look at it this way--

254
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:52,161
we're not only adopting a baby,

255
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:53,366
we're saving it from a life spent

256
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,840
searching for east Dakota.

257
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,232
Oh, God.

258
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,164
This is actually nice.

259
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,164
This is actually
very nice to lean on.

260
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,046
Ugh!

261
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,094
It broke again.

262
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,059
Mm. Yes, I saw.

263
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,271
We'll just need
to double up on the cotton.

264
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,706
Here, let me save you a step.

265
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,416
Alex!

266
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:13,923
Knock, knock!

267
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,031
Dad! Hey!
What are you doing here?

268
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,564
Manny needs that
soldering iron I lent to Phil.

269
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,962
One of the screws on his project
keeps coming loose.

270
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:22,897
Other than that, it's flawless.

271
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:25,457
Huh. His latest test run,
he dropped it off the roof,

272
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,174
he walked downstairs,
it hadn't landed yet.

273
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,814
I had nothing.
I had to get in Claire's head.

274
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,849
Sometimes the best thing
to do in race to the top...

275
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:36,322
is grease the pole behind you.

276
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:37,991
Wow. So Manny's still working?

277
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:39,309
Luke finished a couple hours ago.

278
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,303
Is that why all these
eggs are on the floor?

279
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,342
Oh, well, you know,
after so many landed safely,

280
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:45,512
we thought we should test 'em,

281
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:48,688
make sure we weren't working
with a super strong batch.

282
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,888
Sounds like you knocked it
out of the park.

283
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,835
We did.

284
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:55,097
Um, so dad, if I find out what
Phil did with that soldering iron,

285
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,689
I'll run it over.

286
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,359
Great. 'Cause, uh,

287
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,197
we're gonna test it
later today at the school.

288
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,649
Fun. Maybe we'll meet you.

289
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,998
We can come anytime, right?

290
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,610
'Cause we don't have a--
a spring problem.

291
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:08,944
***?

292
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,048
Perfect.

293
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:14,795
Okay. Bear with us.
We're a little rusty.

294
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,190
Yes, and please put
all cell phones on vibrate.

311
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,492
- Thank you.
- It was wonderful.

312
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:06,818
Oh. I'm confused, though.

313
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,321
I thought Cameron was the singer.

314
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:09,840
Yeah. Oh...

315
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:11,456
Yes, yes, I am.

316
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:14,566
Really? Because Mitchell
has such a lovely voice.

317
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,508
Well, I think he was
following my lead.

318
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,346
You know, a good leader
can make all the difference.

319
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:20,264
Actually, you were a little pitchy.

320
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,501
But it was terrific, really.

321
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:24,026
Thank you.

322
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:26,350
Yes. Thank you for your opinion.

323
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:33,550
Faster! Faster! We're going
to be late to your father.

324
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,902
Why did you have
to do your toes, too?

325
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,960
Well, there's this really
cute boy at school

326
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,362
who's kinda into my feet.

327
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,915
Be careful. That can
get really creepy fast.

328
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,818
Ay. Where is the car?
I parked it here!

329
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:46,934
It's a tow zone.

330
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:47,710
Somebody just put that there,

331
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:49,296
because that wasn't here
when I parked!

332
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:50,683
It looks pretty old to me.

333
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,089
Haley, don't lie.
That was not here!

334
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,671
Ladies and gentlemen...

335
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,509
Get ready for one of the giants

336
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,252
of residential real estate...

337
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,983
A salesman's salesman...

338
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,196
Where are you guys?
I've been calling you!

339
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,677
A realtor's realtor...

340
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:22,157
You were supposed to do my intro.
Now I have to.

341
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,620
2-time nonconsecutive winner

342
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,501
of the realtor of the year award...

343
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:26,878
Just get back here by the end.

344
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,075
Future investors,

345
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:29,721
stop making excuses!

346
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:36,093
And start...
making your dreams come true!

347
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:41,543
Ladies and gentlemen, Phil Dunphy!

348
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,250
Hey!

349
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:44,667
How are you?

350
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:47,405
Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it.

351
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:49,271
Welcome.

352
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,117
Taxi!

353
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,694
You see?
They don't stop because I'm latina.

354
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:56,427
Or because that
was just a yellow car.

355
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:58,327
My dad is gonna freak out.

356
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,050
You have to take
the blame for this.

357
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,104
Why me?

358
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,313
Oh, because he'll never
get mad at you.

359
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,243
He totally puts
you on a pedestal.

360
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,089
That's not true.

361
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,621
Yeah, it is.

362
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,640
Let me just call the cab company.

363
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,873
Taxi!

364
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,871
It's not rocket science, people,
it's just a little red card.

365
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:20,813
Okay. I guess nobody
needs a mouse pad.

366
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,731
How's my favorite kid doing?

367
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:26,975
Favorite?

368
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,288
Yeah, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites.

369
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,688
But you know what? We do.

370
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,255
And the good news is, it's you.

371
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:36,198
I'm not giving you my design.

372
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,068
Who said anything about giving?

373
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,594
We can work out an arrangement.

374
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,892
It's cheating.

375
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:42,709
What do you want? Money?

376
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,537
I got a little something set aside.

377
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:47,737
Okay. I shouldn't even be
giving you this hint, but...

378
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:50,686
first get a mirror.

379
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,775
A mirror?

380
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:52,984
Then you're gonna look in it,

381
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,200
and you're gonna see
a crazy woman.

382
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,862
She needs your help.

383
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,627
You know, I made
the egg that made you,

384
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:01,106
that made that project,

385
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,749
so in a lot of ways,
that design is already mine!

386
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:07,834
Oh, you're fine.

387
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:14,201
Are you sure that
there are no more questions?

388
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:15,638
- No more questions?
- Yes!

389
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,460
If we could just get that over
to the mustachioed gentleman.

390
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:21,591
Yes, I was--

391
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,727
Oh, hey, I think we're
all tired of that sound.

392
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:24,827
Let me just come to you.

393
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,061
I bet I know what your question is.

394
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,389
You're probably wondering

395
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,646
if there's sixth key.

396
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:30,549
No, I was wondering about--

397
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,781
I was wondering
about accelerated escrow.

398
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,074
If it works for both parties,

399
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,901
it's a great way
to expedite the deal.

400
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:39,644
But back to your first question

401
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,414
about this mysterious sixth key.

402
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,528
- I didn't say anything--
- The sixth key is the key

403
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,605
to the new home that
you purchased below market

404
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:51,643
using the simple principles
that you learned here today...

405
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:53,325
But not so simple
that you don't still need

406
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:57,215
the professional services
of Woosnum, Keneally...

407
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:00,037
and Dunphy!

408
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:04,640
Thank you for coming.

409
00:15:07,143 --> 00:15:08,305
Son of a--

410
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,596
So, is there anything
you want to know about us?

411
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,018
I don't think so.

412
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,842
In fact I don't think I need
to interview any more people.

413
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,927
You guys are perfect.

414
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,437
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

415
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:29,431
Well, I'm not supposed to say
anything to you directly,

416
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:33,184
but I think you guys should be
expecting good news.

417
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,328
Aah! Oh, gosh!

418
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:37,015
Oh, I know, I know,
you're not saying anything!

419
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,952
But what you're not
saying is wonderful!

420
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:42,129
Um, all right. I'm gonna get
some sparkling cider?

421
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,369
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, okay.

422
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,236
It wouldn't be a celebration
without cider

423
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,284
or a celebratory song.

424
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,839
But this time, I want you
to sit right here.

425
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,747
So have a seat here.

426
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:54,406
Let's just get this mop
out of the way there.

427
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,390
♪ If you leave me now ♪

428
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:07,508
♪ You'll take away
the biggest part of me ♪

429
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,343
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, no,
baby, please don't go ♪

430
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:21,069
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh,
no, I just want you to stay ♪

431
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,994
Yes, she was upset,
but on a positive note,

432
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:31,399
what I take from
this experience is, I can sing.

433
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,654
Uh, what we didn't take away
from the experience is a baby,

434
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,808
because she decided to keep it.

435
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:42,469
Ay. No.
Did we missed everything?

436
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,967
Yeah. They cleared out
of here pretty fast.

437
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:45,855
Bummer.

438
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:46,998
More than a bummer, Haley.

439
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,035
This was really important to me,
and you blew it.

440
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:50,331
Ay, no, Phil, it was my fault.

441
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:51,982
It was not her fault.

442
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,824
Okay. What's done is done.

443
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,056
Can you take the brochures
out to the car?

444
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,882
Wow. It's still full.

445
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,226
Yeah, it is.

446
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,402
So it was not very good?

447
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:03,365
Um... no.

448
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,287
I kind of need to sweep here.

449
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:08,572
Okay.
But-- but I'm so sorry, Phil.

450
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:09,599
It's okay.

451
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,009
No, it's not okay.

452
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,129
We came late and we ruined
your whole presentation.

453
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,220
These things happen.

454
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:17,312
Yeah, it happens and
people get angry.

455
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,698
Gloria, it's fine.

456
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:19,585
No, it's not fine!

457
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:20,916
I'm trying to have
a real conversation,

458
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,476
and all you do is
put me on a pedestal!

459
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:27,958
Wait a minute.
You're mad at me?

460
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,855
Yes, because
that's not how family's

461
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:31,462
supposed to treat each other!

462
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,097
You know how family's
supposed to treat each other?

463
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:35,499
They're supposed to actually
think about each other!

464
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,688
I asked you to do one thing...

465
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,365
and you were too selfish
and irresponsible

466
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:40,406
to come through for me
on a day that, believe it or not,

467
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,254
was really important to me!

468
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:46,009
Oh, my God.
You're crying. I'm so sorry.

469
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,347
No! That's what I want!

470
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,532
You yell at me
because you love me!

471
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,326
Well, you made me mad.

472
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:54,549
And you should be.

473
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,365
Well, I'm not anymore.

474
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,680
- Don't treat me like that, Phil.
- Because now I'm furious!

475
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,564
Ay, mi familia! Si.

476
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:03,451
Oh, how do you do that?

477
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:04,769
It makes me so...

478
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:06,358
Mad.

479
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:09,731
That's a pretty nice
piece of handiwork

480
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,803
- for a 13-year-old.
- Yeah, Luke did pretty good, too,

481
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,980
for a kid who still needs help
getting out of his backpack.

482
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:16,156
- Still your grandson.
- Felt bad when I said it.

483
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:16,950
Okay, let's do this.

484
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,362
Watch out, kids!
They're coming down!

485
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,291
One, two, three.

486
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:23,903
How'd we do?

487
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,281
Both eggs are okay.

488
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,540
Great. So we both win.

489
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,514
Unacceptable.

490
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,397
We're going up another level.

491
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,868
Absolutely.
Come on. Third floor.

492
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,180
Meet us there, Alex.
Let's go.

493
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:32,903
Wait.

494
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,242
You don't have to do this.

495
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,098
The assignment was
for a 1-story drop.

496
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,139
We both get A's.

497
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,379
We're doing this.

498
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:41,833
I don't like this.

499
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,177
The two of them talking up there--

500
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:44,692
they're gonna figure out
what we did.

501
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,223
We did what we had to.

502
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,604
We're gonna get caught.

503
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,565
Look at them down there.

504
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,164
They're not even paying attention.

505
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,712
This is the best part.

506
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:55,079
Actually, Manny
looks kind of upset.

507
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,387
Why would he be?
He's about to kick Luke's butt.

508
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:58,258
Oh, knock it off.

509
00:18:58,259 --> 00:18:59,928
Luke and Manny had
as much to do with this project

510
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,043
as they did with
the Manhattan project.

511
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,242
You think that's what's going on?

512
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,170
They're upset because
we took over for them?

513
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,120
Maybe.

514
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:09,180
They were supposed to--
to learn from this,

515
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,534
and-- and we ruined it.

516
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:12,920
- We should go talk to them.
- Yeah.

517
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:18,871
Boys, we need to talk.

518
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh, God. Oh, God.

519
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:21,586
Just stay frosty.

520
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:24,544
So, uh, we realized
a couple things up there,

521
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,355
and I think apologies are in order.

522
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:27,959
OK, we admit it.

523
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,623
We tricked you into
doing our projects for us.

524
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:31,391
What?

525
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:33,763
This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

526
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,896
We knew you'd do all the work

527
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,001
if you thought you were
competing with each other.

528
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,994
So I told you I thought
Claire was helping Luke,

529
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,035
and then you called Claire...

530
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:41,284
Which got me involved, and...

531
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,834
All right.
Here's what's gonna happen--

532
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:45,271
you're gonna get in the car,
we're gonna drive home,

533
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:48,274
- and you're each gonna do
your own projects. - Mm-hmm.

534
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,356
Fine.

535
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:52,565
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

536
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,289
You know, this is your fault.

537
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,823
What?

538
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:58,355
The way we compete
with each other it's-- is sick.

539
00:19:58,356 --> 00:19:59,920
It's so sick, two 13-year-olds

540
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:00,950
know how to take advantage of us.

541
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,625
And you know what?
You made me this way.

542
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:04,871
How do you figure that?

543
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:07,275
Dad! You pushed me into sports.

544
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:08,932
You never let me win.
You know, that stuff--

545
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,490
it does something to a girl.

546
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,205
For your information,
you came out of the womb like that.

547
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,380
I'm not entirely sure
there wasn't a twin in there

548
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,659
you bumped off.

549
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:19,492
If you saw that in me,
why didn't you discourage it?

550
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,622
Why would I discourage
something that I love?

551
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,832
Really?

552
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:24,877
You kidding?

553
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:26,178
You're a fighter.

554
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:28,853
The thing I love about you
is you never give up.

555
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:33,599
Dad.

556
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,938
Even though I clearly designed
a superior egg container.

557
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:37,170
Out of your mind, old man.

558
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,516
Only one way to find out.

559
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:43,143
Give up.

560
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,911
You're all just
playing for second.

561
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:49,067
There's something wrong
with that one.

562
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:54,172
I'm not wrong.

563
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,149
Mum can be crazy, right?

564
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,632
Hello?

565
00:20:58,343 --> 00:20:59,720
Thank you.

566
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,568
At the same time, I feel guilty
when I get mad at her.

567
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,218
I don't think that's weird.

568
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:07,980
Just really proud of my project.
I don't wanna share it.

569
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,864
Everybody has their own thing.

570
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:11,969
Thanks, Haley.

571
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,341
I know I may sound dorky,

572
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:16,572
but this late-night conversations
really mean a lot to me.

573
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,059
They're the only time
that I feel like I...

574
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,365
OK, Corey, just one picture.

575
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,484
Hold on.

576
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,263
Ugh, my feet look fat
from this angle.

577
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:26,997
Hey, Alex, wake up.

578
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:29,248
I need you to take
a picture of my feet.

579
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:36,498
