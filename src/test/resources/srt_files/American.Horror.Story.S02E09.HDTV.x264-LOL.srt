1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:05,012
WOMAN:
Please, have a seat, Mr. Morgan.

2
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:07,007
Do you mind if I call you John?

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,633
Johnny.

4
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:11,612
And how did you come
to find me, Johnny?

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,052
I saw your ad in one
of those m-magazines

6
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:16,448
they have in the mail,
the <i>Penny Saver.</i>

7
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:19,349
You probably saw
my smoking cessation ad.

8
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,670
"Guaranteed results
or your money back"?

9
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:23,250
I don't smoke.

10
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:25,040
(chuckles):
Well, you certainly don't look

11
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:26,936
like you need
to lose any weight.

12
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,132
Your ad said something about...

13
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:31,124
curbing compulsions.

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,283
Absolutely.

15
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:34,650
I've found posthypnotic
suggestion to be

16
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:38,371
one of the most powerful weapons
in a therapist's arsenal.

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,231
I want to stop. I really do.

18
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,135
If I have to go on medication,
whatever, I'm willing to try.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,980
Tell me about the behavior
you want to curtail.

20
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,582
- Start from the beginning.
- I always, uh,

21
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:53,848
had these impulses,
you know, even as a kid.

22
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:55,417
The first time I tried it,

23
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:56,958
it was scary.

24
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,822
But it felt amazing.

25
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,669
My whole body came alive.

26
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,009
When my foster family
saw the evidence...

27
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:04,583
they kicked me out.

28
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:05,991
I bounced from house to house

29
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:08,294
until I learned how to hide it.

30
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:11,182
It's a shame so many people
have such a negative reaction

31
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:13,098
to something so natural.

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,625
Was that the first time
you touched yourself?

33
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:17,063
No.

34
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:19,344
I skinned a cat.

35
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:23,103
- It was already dead.
- So...

36
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,935
you went around
finding dead animals?

37
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,051
Yeah. First couple of times.

38
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:32,616
Then I learned that killing them
was just as good.

39
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,145
Even better.

40
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,327
And this compulsion followed you

41
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:38,915
into your adult life?

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,965
No. I don't harm
animals anymore.

43
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,596
I haven't since
I was a teenager.

44
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,890
Did you know that
killing animals

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,867
is a predictor for psychopaths?

46
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,235
I learned that in prison.

47
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:51,673
Armed robbery.

48
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,439
But it got me thinking.

49
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,869
What made me... the way I am?

50
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:59,106
Who were my <i>real</i> parents?

51
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,558
Well, they had a computer at the
joint, and I didn't have nothing

52
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:03,744
- but time, so...
- Mr. Morgan, you know,

53
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:06,032
I-I may not be qualified
to help you.

54
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,355
No, you <i>have</i> to help, Doctor.

55
00:02:08,474 --> 00:02:11,203
I don't know what to do,
because those thoughts...

56
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:12,711
haven't stopped.

57
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,514
If anything,

58
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,517
they've gotten harder to ignore

59
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,853
since I found out who I am.

60
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,887
And what do those thoughts
tell you to do?

61
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,985
They told me to
retrace my roots,

62
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:25,759
so I'm renting the house
where my father lived.

63
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:28,639
They also told me to hurt women.

64
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:31,361
But not just hurt them.

65
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,584
Skin them.

66
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:35,492
Like the cats.

67
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,952
(distorted screaming)

68
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:38,523
Stop moving!

69
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,290
(screaming continues)

70
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,385
Shut up!

71
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:44,065
This is delicate work.

72
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,246
I didn't have the same skills
as my father.

73
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,977
I didn't get the
medical training.

74
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:50,755
I made a mess.

75
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,177
You think it's too late?

76
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,402
It's never too late
to turn yourself in.

77
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,210
No, to go to medical school.

78
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:00,040
I'll never live up to him.

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,171
That's why I wanted to stop.

80
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,389
You see,

81
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:07,213
my name isn't Morgan.

82
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:09,251
It's Thredson.

83
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,618
I'm the son of Bloody Face.

84
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:25,079
You wanted a word
with Miss Winters?

85
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,447
What did I tell you
about knocking?

86
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,553
Oh, it won't happen
again, Sister.

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,105
Have a seat.

88
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,204
Your Jude imitation is spot-on.

89
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,582
For a moment there,

90
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,849
- I thought you might cane her.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,831
Awfully sassy for a
girl in your condition.

92
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:47,530
What condition is that?

93
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,819
Well... the good news is,

94
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:53,351
you seem to have conquered
your sexual perversion.

95
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,013
The bad news is...

96
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,737
the rabbit died.

97
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:58,756
If I were

98
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,818
my Aunt Celeste,
I would offer you

99
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,836
a Drano margarita.

100
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,336
- A what?
- You add half a cup of Drano

101
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,277
for every two weeks
you've been pregnant

102
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,567
to a margarita.

103
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:10,273
That's what she gave
my slutty cousin Molly

104
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:13,594
when she got preggers
by Billy Porter.

105
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,676
(quietly): - I'm pregnant?
- So are we still sticking

106
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,325
to the whole rapist story?

107
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:21,376
Interesting you haven't
mentioned Dr. Thredson once

108
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,995
since you came in here.
We starting to get

109
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,266
sweet on him now that
we're carrying his child?

110
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:28,309
(laughs softly)

111
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:29,888
Actually,

112
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:31,828
the whole... rape thing
must have been

113
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,720
some kind of hallucination
from the car crash

114
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,259
when I... I hit my head.

115
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,675
Well...

116
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,551
whoever the daddy is...

117
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:40,982
there's a little life growing

118
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,434
inside of you.

119
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:44,361
I can't keep this baby.

120
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,401
I can't have this baby
inside me.

121
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,131
You <i>can</i> have this baby,

122
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:50,222
and you <i>will</i> have this baby.

123
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:53,686
This is an insane asylum.

124
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:55,536
People hump like bunnies here.

125
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,973
You're hardly our first...

126
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:58,336
unwed mother.

127
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,392
Most of the babies, they
are born a little...

128
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,736
(singsongy): cuckoo.

129
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,050
So... our staff is
very experienced

130
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,818
at calming them and...

131
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,910
preparing them for
relocation to St. Ursula's.

132
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,910
Home for Lost Children.

133
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,705
You're worse than Jude.

134
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:12,768
You're a sadist.

135
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,125
Calm down, Mommy,

136
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,990
or it's going to be a
very long nine months.

137
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:20,230
We don't want to have
to restrain you... do we?

138
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:28,788
May I go?

139
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,217
Of course.

140
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,738
(distorted, echoing):
You're awake.

141
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,337
I'm so relieved.

142
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:49,519
(whispers): Oh, Monsignor.

143
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,203
(gasps)

144
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:54,777
MONSIGNOR:
No, no, no, you mustn't move.

145
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,669
You've been injured, I'm afraid.

146
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:57,709
(gasping breaths) Shh...

147
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,155
What happened?

148
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,864
(whispers): You don't remember?

149
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,756
MONSIGNOR: <i>You killed a man.</i>

150
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:07,053
- God rest his soul.
- I had no choice.

151
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,589
I was defending myself.

152
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:11,183
He tried to murder me,
and worse.

153
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,108
You've become unhinged;
That's clear.

154
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I blame myself.

155
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:16,329
I should have seen it sooner.

156
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:17,903
- What?
- The pressures of running

157
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,717
- this place were too much for you.
- No!

158
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:24,852
You've grown paranoid,
seeking conspiracy.

159
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:27,120
And now Frank McCann is dead.

160
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:28,946
(whispers): What did you say?

161
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,255
MAN: Kindly speak up.

162
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,380
LEIGH:
I saw the nun, Sister Jude,

163
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:35,408
<i>attack Frank McCann.</i>

164
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,296
It was horrible.

165
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,518
And then what happened?

166
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:41,243
I made sure the other
inmates were secure,

167
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:44,273
and then alerted Dr. Arden
to the situation.

168
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:47,152
- Why didn't you call the police?
- There wasn't time.

169
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:48,998
It was...

170
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,784
if you'll pardon
the expression, bedlam.

171
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,419
Sister Jude was on a rampage.

172
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,148
She'd already killed
Frank McCann,

173
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,181
taken Leigh Emerson hostage,

174
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,245
and locked herself
in her old office.

175
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,545
I can't say any of this
came as a surprise to me.

176
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:04,502
MONSIGNOR: She'd been showing
signs of instability

177
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,899
for some time.

178
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,700
She seemed to be
taking on the delusions

179
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,234
of some of the patients here.

180
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,090
She accused Dr. Arden
of being a Nazi.

181
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,679
She came to me... convinced
that her young protégé,

182
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,013
Sister Mary Eunice,
was possessed by the Devil.

183
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,061
When I informed her
I would be removing her

184
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,382
from her position here,

185
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:24,920
she became inconsolable.

186
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:26,504
SISTER EUNICE: She
threatened me with the same

187
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:29,109
straight-edge razor that
she used to murder Frank McCann.

188
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:31,947
She smelled of liquor
and... cigarettes.

189
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,359
We had her escorted
off the property.

190
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,754
I-I-I should have called
the police then... I just...

191
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,630
I never for a moment thought
something like this could happen.

192
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:39,991
LEIGH: I saw her do it.

193
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:42,171
I saw Sister Jude...

194
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:45,581
murder Frank McCann
in cold blood and then try

195
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,392
- to do the same to me.
- Isn't it true

196
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:48,983
that you yourself
are responsible

197
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,850
for the deaths of 18 people?

198
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:54,395
Well, sir, the state...
found me <i>not</i> responsible,

199
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,345
which is why they
put me in here, but...

200
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,787
yes...

201
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:03,017
oh, yes, I am responsible,
I know that now. I've...

202
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,577
I've had time to reflect
upon my crimes...

203
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:08,780
Your Honor.

204
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:12,093
Christmas '62 was
a very bad time for me,

205
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,264
and the only solace I have
is knowing that...

206
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:17,970
because of what I did...

207
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,857
there are 18 more people
in Heaven.

208
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,455
That's a unique perspective,

209
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,486
- Mr. Emerson.
- W-Well, I do know, sir,

210
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:28,377
that no matter what,
I-I can't... hate Sister Jude

211
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,863
for what she did to me...
but I <i>can...</i>

212
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,557
try to forgive her,

213
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,398
and I can carry on

214
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,135
on my own personal road
to true redemption,

215
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,639
so that one day,

216
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,626
when I enter
the gates of Heaven...

217
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,886
I can apologize,

218
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,577
personally, to each of those

219
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:48,663
18 people that
I sent there before me.

220
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,158
The court magistrate is
determined that you will live out

221
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:55,529
the remainder of your days

222
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,313
here at Briarcliff.

223
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,764
You will, of course, be stripped

224
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:00,516
of your clerical standing.

225
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,643
No longer will you be a sister
of the Holy Catholic Church.

226
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,848
You are once again
Miss Judy Martin.

227
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,039
Patient.

228
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,835
No, you can't do this to me!

229
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:12,643
- You did it to yourself.
- Come back here,

230
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,017
you son of a bitch!

231
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,225
Come back here! (Shouts)

232
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,692
It's a set-up!

233
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:20,486
God, help me! (Screams)

234
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,341
Apparently she had
quite the secret inner life.

235
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:13,982
Oh, (chuckles) Sister,
you... startled me.

236
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,852
I'm just packing up her things

237
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,220
so they can be donated
to the poor.

238
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,521
I was as shocked as you are

239
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:21,029
when I first saw this.

240
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:27,374
I wonder who she was
fancying when she wore it.

241
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:30,341
Of course, none of this
is of our concern.

242
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,653
(chuckles)

243
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,932
We had a dream together,
you know.

244
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:34,959
She told me.

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,081
She said you

246
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,973
wanted to be Pope.

247
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:39,976
Those

248
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:41,542
things were said in confidence.

249
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:43,686
You know what I said to her
when she told me your dream?

250
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:50,613
I said, "Rome is
where that man belongs."

251
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,899
She was so happy when you said

252
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,940
you wanted her on
that journey with you.

253
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,882
Like a girl who'd just received
a marriage proposal.

254
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,257
I can't help but wonder,

255
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,510
if I'd been paying closer
attention,

256
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,501
could this tragedy
have been averted?

257
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:04,934
Oh, Monsignor,

258
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,941
as she herself would say,

259
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,051
"No time"

260
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,829
for navel-gazing.

261
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,542
"Too much to be done."

262
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:15,584
But you've had to focus
on your own goals.

263
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,839
There is no other goal
than to save souls.

264
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,388
She also said that.

265
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:20,796
Of course.

266
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,389
I know I, uh...

267
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:25,408
I can't begin to fill
the shoes of the...

268
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,006
Sister Jude we all knew

269
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,285
and loved, but...

270
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:29,691
let me say...

271
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,588
I'm here to serve you.

272
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,990
I want to help you save souls,

273
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,066
all the way to Rome.

274
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:46,887
(lock clicks)

275
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:00,974
(thunder rumbles)

276
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,635
Get away from me!
Get away from me! No!

277
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:17,234
I demand to speak to someone!

278
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,232
Now, now, Sister Jude.
You mustn't behave so.

279
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:20,569
(groans)
She's no Sister no more.

280
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,532
She's no queen of
the castle neither.

281
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,270
She's just a naughty patient.

282
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,001
Now do as you're told
and take these pills.

283
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,047
- No!
- Or I'll

284
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,583
- happily force 'em down your gullet.
- No!

285
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:29,832
(groaning)

286
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,290
You clip me again

287
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,301
and I'll call Frank in here.

288
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:38,916
Oh, but I can't,

289
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,304
because you already
clipped Frank but good.

290
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:42,234
No!

291
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,473
That's a lie! Get off of me!
Get off of me!

292
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,198
(screams) MONSIGNOR:
What's all this fuss then?

293
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,099
Hmm? Hmm? That's quite enough.

294
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:51,478
(sobs) Timothy. Please.

295
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:53,357
Why don't you go and
find some other tasks

296
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:54,946
- for the moment?
- Yes, Monsignor.

297
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,131
NURSE: Of course, Father.

298
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:57,467
(whispers): Timothy.

299
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,797
Well, I was hoping you might be

300
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,156
up for a visitor, but I

301
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,771
see that our adjustment period
continues.

302
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,733
(sobbing): No. No.

303
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,723
Monsignor, please.

304
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,560
Don't go.

305
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,176
Are you sure?

306
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,290
(sniffles) I'm better now.

307
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:23,525
What's he doing here?

308
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,184
Leigh...

309
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,333
has something he would
like to say to you.

310
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,911
And...

311
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,375
I think you'll find
it more medicinal

312
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:34,813
than any pill.

313
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,590
Leigh?

314
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:55,149
I forgive you.

315
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,281
You forgive me?

316
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,508
I do.

317
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:00,991
SISTER JUDE:
Make it tight, Frank.

318
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,835
LEIGH:
Make it tight. I like it tight.

319
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:04,447
Just ask Sister Chastity.

320
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:05,785
I'll deal with Sister Chastity.

321
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,694
You might start by picking
a new name for her.

322
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:09,835
(chuckles)

323
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,231
You know,

324
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,156
I thought by allowing you time

325
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,949
in the general population

326
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,141
that it would have had
a civilizing effect on you,

327
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:20,169
but clearly

328
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,791
I was wrong, Mr. Emerson.

329
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:23,538
So you'll spend the next

330
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,133
couple days here,

331
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:26,809
reflecting on your behavior.

332
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:29,869
How can I reflect
when my hand's tied down?

333
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,009
You're disgusting.

334
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:33,017
We all got our crosses to bear.

335
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,187
Come on. Where's your spirit
of forgiveness?

336
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:37,322
I reserve it for those
who are truly repentant.

337
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,228
All God's chillun got to have
forgiveness...

338
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,847
isn't that what
your church teaches you?

339
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,836
I'm under no obligation
to forgive you.

340
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:44,935
I'm no priest,

341
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,718
and you are no penitent.

342
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:49,100
I don't need your forgiveness.

343
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,642
MONSIGNOR: And therein lies

344
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:55,547
the journey to true redemption.

345
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,452
I hope for both of you.

346
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:15,655
(door shuts)

347
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:20,663
(door opens)

348
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:22,792
(footsteps approaching)

349
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,647
- It's me.
- What are you doing here?

350
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,466
Shit. Did they find him?

351
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,401
Not yet.

352
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,596
Are you okay?
You look terrible.

353
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,969
Kit...

354
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,019
- we have to kill him.
- What?

355
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,049
We should've done it
when we had the chance.

356
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:43,407
They're gonna find him,

357
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,718
and then he'll be free again,

358
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,253
and we cannot wait
for that to happen.

359
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,512
We're not going to. Lana,

360
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:50,819
he's the only thing standing
between me and the death house.

361
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:52,877
We have to get him to confess.

362
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,387
You know what
sodium pentothal is?

363
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,681
It's truth serum.

364
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,398
Even if we could
get our hands on some,

365
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,111
those confessions are deemed
inadmissible in court.

366
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:03,468
It'll never fly.

367
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:04,653
I'm desperate.

368
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:06,255
Look, I don't know
why they haven't

369
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,665
turned me in to the
state police yet.

370
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:10,266
Maybe 'cause I've seen too
much here but either way,

371
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,409
I need Thredson to talk.

372
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,184
I think I might know how.

373
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:35,239
(wheels squeak)

374
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:02,203
(door creaks)

375
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:07,756
(grunting)

376
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,741
You know how this goes.

377
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:15,390
You make a sound,

378
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,409
I bash your face in.

379
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,254
(panting)

380
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:27,021
(panting)

381
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:36,613
You'd like to kill me right now,
Oliver, wouldn't you?

382
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:39,176
(panting)

383
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,667
(paper rustling)

384
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:45,079
This might change your mind.

385
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:46,864
What is this?

386
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:48,951
It's the ultimate cosmic joke.

387
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,108
You got me pregnant.

388
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:54,785
I'm gonna be a father?

389
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:57,173
No, Oliver, you're not
gonna be a father.

390
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,243
Not this time.

391
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,968
What do you mean? Oh, no.

392
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,860
No, no. Lana, please,

393
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,264
please, please don't
give him away.

394
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,752
I know what it's like to be
raised in the system...

395
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,238
- it ruins...
- Oliver, stop!

396
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,066
This monster
you planted inside me,

397
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:13,799
I'm getting rid of it.

398
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,850
And since I'm stuck here,

399
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:17,915
I'm gonna have to get creative.

400
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:19,726
No.

401
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:21,234
Lana, no, please.

402
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,904
This is a mercy killing, Oliver.

403
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,013
No baby

404
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,000
should have to grow up

405
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,501
knowing Daddy is Bloody Face.

406
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,083
No. He'll never have to know.

407
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:30,897
Kit Walker is gonna
take the fall for those crimes.

408
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,099
I promise you,
it'll all work out.

409
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,452
Is that how you see it?

410
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:39,071
Lana...

411
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:40,651
you know me, I can change.

412
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:41,922
I have great determination

413
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,143
- and now I have reason...
- Really?

414
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,314
You gonna be
a real stand-up guy now?

415
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,471
Yes. You owe me this.

416
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,483
It's my child, too. Please.

417
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,465
You're a sociopath.

418
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,751
You can't be honest
with anybody.

419
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,796
I can. I can be... honest.

420
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,583
I can. Please help me.

421
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,026
(grunts)

422
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:07,762
(gasps)

423
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,245
Okay.

424
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,106
(panting)

425
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:14,070
Donna Burton.

426
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,319
Why did you choose her?

427
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:23,986
I saw her...

428
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,436
at the library
a couple of nights.

429
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,360
What did you like about her?

430
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,497
(panting)

431
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,807
Her skin.

432
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,306
It was fuzzy like a peach.

433
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,858
And I wanted to feel it.

434
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,121
So you skinned her alive.

435
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,290
Yes.

436
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,770
And Alison Reidel?

437
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:49,747
(panting)

438
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:57,072
She was a secretary
at my dentist's office.

439
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,318
I always liked her.

440
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,476
I put her to sleep first,

441
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,288
but she kept talking to me.

442
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,228
I was so confused.

443
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:12,453
And what about Wendy?

444
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:19,509
She never loved you.

445
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:23,157
She locked you away.

446
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:30,737
DR. THREDSON: Her skin was fuzzy like
a peach, and I wanted to feel it.

447
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,314
LANA: - So you skinned her alive.
- What?

448
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,100
Hey.

449
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,576
LANA: And Alison Reidel?

450
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:39,768
- I think we got it.
LANA: - Hide that tape.

451
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:42,512
I'm not finished here.

452
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,525
Hey... bitch.

453
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,471
So it was all an act, huh?

454
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:47,896
- No.
- You were never pregnant?

455
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,251
No, that part was true.

456
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,187
Was. Sadly,

457
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:54,799
your beloved baby died
last night.

458
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,447
(crackling thunder)

459
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,936
(gasping, thunder rumbling)

460
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:00,399
<i>It started as a trickle.</i>

461
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:03,591
<i>Within an hour,</i>
<i>it was a bloody mess.</i>

462
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,320
(crashing thunder)

463
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,909
It really wasn't
that bad, actually.

464
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,143
God, you're a monster.

465
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,899
You are worse than I am.

466
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,508
You killed an innocent child.

467
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:14,906
(gasping)

468
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,454
I have bakery duty later.

469
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,074
And after knife count,
I'm gonna pocket one,

470
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,743
and I'm gonna come back and
slit your throat nice and easy.

471
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:26,265
I always wanted
to know what it was like

472
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:28,389
inside the mind of a killer.

473
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:31,426
Now I know. (Gasps)

474
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,746
(door closes)

475
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,452
Ah, Mr. Walker.

476
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,363
I thought it might
be you. You really

477
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,662
shouldn't be wandering around
these halls, you know.

478
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:01,125
You're not even officially
part of this institution.

479
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,699
However, I'm very glad
you're here. We have so much

480
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:05,278
to talk about.

481
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:08,226
<i>Après vous, monsieur.</i>

482
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,711
I always keep a bottle of
18-year-old single malt

483
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,397
in my desk...

484
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:39,480
for special
occasions like this.

485
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,294
I think you'll find this
exceptionally smooth.

486
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,200
What are you doing?

487
00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,857
I'm just trying
to being friendly.

488
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:01,354
Why?

489
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,481
(sighs)

490
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,548
Because I've seen
what you've seen.

491
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:11,891
They were here.

492
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,326
The creatures you
told me about.

493
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,882
The little green men,

494
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:16,888
except of course,
they're not green,

495
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,321
are they, Mr. Walker?

496
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:20,978
No. They're obviously
a great deal more powerful

497
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,482
and technologically advanced
than we are.

498
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,701
They're terrifying.

499
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:27,592
Mm-hmm. They took Grace.

500
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:30,540
They took her body while I
was trying to dispose of it.

501
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,407
What would they...
what would they want with her?

502
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,592
That's what
I've been asking myself.

503
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:36,607
Tell me, Mr. Walker.

504
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:40,170
Did you have sex with your wife
just before she was taken?

505
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:46,107
I've almost forgotten her.

506
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,502
I'll take that
as a yes. You also

507
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,462
had relations with our Grace,

508
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:54,657
which is why Sister Jude wanted
me to sterilize the two of you.

509
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:55,860
Oh, you're saying
it's 'cause of me

510
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,838
that those creatures took them?

511
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,831
They're experimenting,

512
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:03,932
probably refining
some form of eugenics.

513
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:07,942
I want you to help me
to bring them back.

514
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:09,585
They're studying
you, Mr. Walker.

515
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,783
You're obviously valuable
to them,

516
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,762
and a good scientist always
protects his subject.

517
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:15,922
For example,

518
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:17,691
if your life were threatened,

519
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,169
they would have to act
to preserve their specimen.

520
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,840
What are you saying?

521
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,110
If you were to be brought

522
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,097
to the brink of death,

523
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,957
they would return
to reverse the process.

524
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,493
You want to kill me?

525
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:32,932
No, Mr. Walker.

526
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:34,992
I want to <i>almost</i> kill you.

527
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:37,265
Of course, it would be ideal

528
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:39,411
if you were to cooperate,

529
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:42,913
but then, I'm not asking
for your permission.

530
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:45,262
You're a crazy bastard.

531
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,147
But you got my permission.

532
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:51,255
If there's a chance
I could see Alma again.

533
00:25:54,314 --> 00:25:56,585
I'll do what I have to do.

534
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:58,483
Well, then, Mr. Walker,

535
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,668
prepare to die.

536
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:44,493
You are nothin' but
trouble, lady. Give me that.

537
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:47,663
You ain't got the
guts to kill no one.

538
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,022
Give me the knife,

539
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:50,948
and we'll call it a night.

540
00:26:56,897 --> 00:26:59,591
(sighs)

541
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:06,351
(sighs)

542
00:27:06,462 --> 00:27:08,612
Haven't prayed in years, Father.

543
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,142
How does it feel?

544
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,687
Strange, but good.

545
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:17,614
Nobody ever gave me this shot...
to rehabilitate myself.

546
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,380
As the figurehead
of this institution,

547
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:23,020
I want all of our patients
to find forgiveness

548
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,383
and a new purpose.

549
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:27,039
Even you,

550
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,581
in spite of your crimes.

551
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:32,452
Oh, I want to be saved, Father.

552
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,563
I'm already living in hell.

553
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:36,973
I don't want to spend eternity

554
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:40,361
- there, too.
- You could be my miracle, Leigh.

555
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,546
Do you repent of your sins?

556
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:44,311
I do.

557
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:47,224
If I can turn a man
like you towards Christ,

558
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:48,902
imagine the reforms
I could make

559
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,183
on a national scale.

560
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,962
Not just mental health.

561
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,919
<i>Believe me, if</i>

562
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:58,414
I ascend to the highest ranks
of the church,

563
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,891
<i>I won't back down</i>
<i>from the fight.</i>

564
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,460
LEIGH: <i>You're quite an
ambitious man, Father.</i>

565
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,135
MONSIGNOR: <i>I just want to serve</i>

566
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,626
and make a real
difference in the world.

567
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:10,932
Do you renounce Satan
and all things evil?

568
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,894
I do.

569
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:15,244
Turns your eyes
to Christ, Leigh.

570
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:17,621
Whatever shackles you,

571
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,633
your freedom lives

572
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:22,015
- in him.
- Praise Jesus.

573
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,408
Do you intend to
lead a new life,

574
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:27,356
putting God first
in all things?

575
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:28,954
I do.

576
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,913
Then I baptize you in
the name of the Father,

577
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:38,032
Son and the Holy Spirit.

578
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,462
Oh, thank you, Father.

579
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:52,191
I feel like a new man.

580
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:07,593
Thank you, Sister. I just
needed to lie down for a bit.

Hello, Oliver,
I'm here to keep my word.

584
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,812
(gasps) Missing something,
Miss Winters?

585
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:00,360
It was you.

586
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:01,777
You let him out,

587
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,028
you let Bloody Face out,
I know you did.

588
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:05,598
What have you got here?

589
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,371
(gasps, clicks tongue)

590
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:13,855
Miss Winters, I thought
we talked about this.

591
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:16,348
It's too late,
it's already done.

592
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:17,876
Really?

593
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,265
(heart beating)

594
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:22,639

595
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,250
Praise God.

596
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,632
Your attempt to murder
this precious child

597
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,088
was unsuccessful.

598
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,468
You couldn't
possibly know that.

599
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:31,011
Oh, but I do,

600
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,082
and I know something else.

601
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,266
It's a boy.

603
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,638
I think I need
another posthypnotic suggestion,

604
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:45,594
Dr. Gardner.

605
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,984
I ate an entire bucket
of chicken by myself last night.

606
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,361
Dr. Gardner?

Potassium chloride.

642
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,279
I'll inject this directly
into your heart muscle,

643
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:48,648
which will cause the
heart to stop beating.

644
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,016
From my experience, it'll take

645
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:52,248
approximately two
to four minutes

646
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,421
for all the oxygen in
your brain to be depleted,

647
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,529
and then you'll die.

648
00:35:57,647 --> 00:35:58,712
But you can reverse it,

into your system.

654

These two drugs,

655
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,434
administered within two
minutes after your death,

656
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:18,337
along with a sharp blow to
your chest with my fist,

657
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:20,654
will restart the heart.

658
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,598
(sighs)

659
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:27,092
I don't mind telling you...
I'm scared.

660
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:29,035
(chuckles) I'll admit

661
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:31,823
I'm feeling slightly
apprehensive myself.

662
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:35,244
(sighing)

663
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,183
(whispering): Our Father,
who art in Heaven,

664
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:48,991
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

665
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:50,700
thy will be done on Earth,
as it is in Heaven.

666
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:53,445
What are you mumbling about?

667
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:56,189
It's the only prayer
I can remember.

668
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:59,238
Just in case.

669
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,225
(clears throat)

670
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:08,469
(exhales)

671
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,228
This is going to hurt.

672
00:37:11,493 --> 00:37:13,254
(grunting)

673
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:15,320
(heart beating)

674
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,973
(gasping)

675
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:22,579
(heartbeat stops)

676
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:18,869
The baby's full-term.

677
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:20,616
It won't be long.

678
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,556
Grace.

679
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,093
Who brought you here?

680
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,895
- I thought you were...
- She'll need a room.

681
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,280
I'll look after her.

682
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:06,821
Oh, God.

683
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:17,349
(footfalls approaching)

684
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,908
- Help me.
- I'm here.
