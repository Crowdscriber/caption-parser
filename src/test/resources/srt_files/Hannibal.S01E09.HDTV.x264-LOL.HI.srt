1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,156
<i>Previously on Hannibal... </i>

2
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:05,129
So is it me or is it becoming
easier for you to look?

3
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:08,100
I can make myself look, but
the thinking is shutting down.

4
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:11,881
The way that I am isn't
compatible with the way that... 

5
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:13,549
The way I am.

6
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:16,352
- Do you know where you are, Mr. Graham?
- No.

7
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:19,088
My sister was impaled
on a severed stag head,

8
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:20,689
cut down the middle.

9
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:22,691
I can help you. We can hide the body.

10
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,061
Abigail Hobbs may be the only
person who knows the truth.

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,797
You can't ask her right now, Jack.

12
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:30,633
I want to go home.

13
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,297
(camera click)

14
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,702
World's sickest jigsaw puzzle.

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,204
Yeah, but where are the corners?

16
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:10,706
What?

17
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:14,543
My mom always said, start
a jigsaw with the corners.

18
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:17,680
Uh, the heads are the corners, I guess?

19
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:19,682
We've got too many corners.

20
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:22,685
Seven graves. Way too many heads.

21
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,161
The headpiece appears to
be the only recent victim.

22
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:35,864
The others are years, even decades, old.

23
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,599
And we know that seven

24
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,302
of the bodies were buried out here.

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,206
Whoever dug them up knew
exactly where they were buried.

26
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:46,208
I guess it wasn't enough
for him to kill them once;

27
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,777
he had to come back and defile his victims.

28
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,913
These graves weren't desecrated, Jack;

29
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:52,815
they were exposed.

30
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,691
Ok, everybody, let's go,
let's clear the scene!

31
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:38,827
(soft ambient pulse)

32
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:59,948
I planned this moment,

33
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:03,018
this monument, with precision.

34
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:09,258
Collected all my raw materials in advance.

35
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,534
I position the bodies carefully,

36
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:22,204
according each its rightful place.

37
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:29,812
Peace in the pieces disassembled.

38
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,785
My latest victim

39
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:40,389
I save for last.

40
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:42,724
I want him to watch me work.

41
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,895
I want him to know my design.

42
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:11,013
This is my résumé.

43
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,348
This is my body of work.

44
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,149
This is my legacy.

45
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,838
Will. I wasn't expecting you.

46
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,375
I don't know how I got here.

47
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,711
Your car is outside, so we know you drove.

48
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,214
Well, I was on a beach
in Grafton, West Virginia.

49
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,216
I blinked, and then I... I was

50
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,418
waking up in your waiting
room, except I wasn't asleep!

51
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:53,055
Grafton, West Virginia, is three-and-a-half
hours from here. You lost time.

52
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,738
- Th... there is something wrong with me.
- You're disassociating, Will.

53
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,875
It's a desperate survival mechanism for
a psyche that endures repeated abuse.

54
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,611
- No, no, I'm not abused!
- You have an empathy disorder.

55
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,147
- What you feel is overwhelming you.
- I know, I know, I know.

56
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,149
Yet you choose to ignore
it. That's the abuse

57
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,518
- I'm referring to.
- What, do you want me to quit?

58
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,721
Well, Jack Crawford gave you a chance
to quit, and you didn't take it. Why?

59
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,990
Um... 

60
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,992
I save lives.

61
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,661
- And that feels good.
- Generally speaking, yeah.

62
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,898
What about your life?

63
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,874
I'm your friend, Will. 

64
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,169
I don't care about the lives
you save; I care about your life,

65
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,538
and your life is separating from reality.

66
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,517
I've been sleepwalking.

67
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:47,522
I'm experiencing hallucinations.

68
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,129
- Maybe I should get a brain scan.
- Will.

69
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:57,666
Stop looking in the wrong
corner for an answer to this.

70
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,170
You were at the crime scene

71
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:05,507
when you disassociated. Tell me about it.

72
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,410
It was a totem pole of bodies.

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,048
In some cultures, crimes
and guilt are made manifest

74
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,083
so that everyone can see
them and see their shame.

75
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:16,585
No, this isn't shame;

76
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:20,188
this is celebration. He's
marking his achievements.

77
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,691
And faced with this killer's achievements,

78
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,494
your mind needed to
escape, and you lost time.

79
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,829
Yes.

80
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,336
I'm worried about you, Will.

81
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:37,339
You empathize so completely
with the killers Jack Crawford

82
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:41,043
has your mind wrapped around
that you lose yourself to them.

83
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,645
What if you lose time and hurt yourself?

84
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,647
Or someone else?

85
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,954
I don't want you to wake up and
see a totem of your own making.

Every day, I wake up, and... 

88
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,321
I hear my dad's voice.

89
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,668
Like he was kneeling next to my bed.

90
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,208
He whispers what he told me.

91
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,216
He told me he killed girls.

92
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:53,255
Again and again.

93
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:57,025
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

94
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:05,634
I wish he was still alive
so I could ask him...

95
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,636
what did I make him feel?

96
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:10,639
What was so wrong with me

97
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,141
- that he wanted to kill...
- He should have.

98
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,544
He should have killed you.

99
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:21,650
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

100
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,920
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

101
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:27,622
(girls): So he wouldn't have killed me.

102
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,326
(girls' voices echoing)

103
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,229
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

104
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:36,231
(girls' voices echoing)

105
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,135
- (Abigail breathing rapidly)
- He should have killed you.

106
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,806
So that you wouldn't have killed me.

107
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:47,309
(gasping and panting)

108
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,526
Hey.

109
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,134
I'm sorry about yesterday.

110
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:15,203
Sorry about what?

111
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:20,942
I... I wasn't feeling like myself.

112
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,211
Well, not feeling like yourself,

113
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,447
that's kind of what you do, isn't it?

114
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,649
- I suppose so.
- (both chuckling)

115
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,218
Yeah. Ok.

116
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,119
So, I seemed fine to you?

117
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:36,690
Is there something you want to tell me?

118
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:39,192
Uh, no. No, no.

119
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,130
Well, clearly there's something
that you don't want to tell me.

120
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:48,468
I... I guess I just got a
little lost yesterday, is all.

121
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:55,375
And where are you today?

122
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:59,913
It got to me. (chuckling)

123
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,249
All those bodies got to me, and, uh,

124
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:07,087
I thought it was a little more
obvious than... than it was.

125
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:12,258
(deep sigh)

126
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:15,495
If there's a problem, you need to tell me.

127
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,635
Is there a problem, Will?

128
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:26,072
Everything's fine.

129
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,949
All right.

130
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:31,451
All right.

131
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:50,296
They sold my parents' house.

132
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:54,067
Murder houses don't fetch big
money in today's real estate market.

133
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:56,436
Not that you'll get any of it.

134
00:11:56,504 --> 00:12:00,774
The families of your father's
victims filed wrongful death suits.

135
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:03,843
- Wrongful death?
- That means that they get

136
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,246
everything, Abigail. Every penny.

137
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:13,787
What you have here is all you have.

138
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,925
Let them take all his money.

139
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:21,327
I don't want any of it.

140
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,329
You can make your own money.

141
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,198
How much would I get

142
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:28,835
if you wrote a book about me?

143
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,970
About my dad?

144
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,206
Plenty.

145
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,576
Do you still want to tell my story?

146
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,779
I think you need to tell your own story,

147
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:42,448
but I am the one to help you tell it.

148
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,819
No one knows more about what
your father did than I do.

149
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:49,322
- Not even Will Graham?
- Will Graham is

150
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,593
part of the story you tell, Abigail,
not the person to help you tell it.

151
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:58,264
He avoids me because I make
him feel like my father.

152
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:01,434
Feeling like your father
makes him feel like a killer.

153
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:05,205
People think I helped
my dad kill those girls.

154
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:08,541
Well, you can change what people think.

155
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,910
We can change that together.

156
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:13,513
Everyone will know the truth.

157
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:19,919
Ok.

158
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,921
Let's tell my story.

159
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:44,338
How many bodies?

160
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,963
(Brian): We got 17 in total.

161
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:49,733
Meet our freshest one,

162
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,568
Joel Summers.

163
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:53,069
Forty years old,

164
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,205
runs a cell phone store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

165
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:57,707
Or did. Been missing for three days.

166
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,709
Single stab wound to the heart.

167
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:03,680
Other injuries were post mortem...
broken bones, dislocated hips, shoulders.

168
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:07,083
He was special to him somehow.

169
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:08,575
He held a place of honor. 

170
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:12,322
Seven bodies from unmarked
graves found at the crime scene.

171
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,492
Earth from the body parts
matches the gravesites.

172
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,661
Blunt force trauma, stabbings,
strangulations. Wrongful deaths.

173
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,663
There are at least eight other bodies

174
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:23,333
that are recent grave robbings
from all across West Virginia.

175
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,903
No crimes attributed to any
of them. Accidental deaths.

176
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,672
They're all murders.

177
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,650
Anthony Lamb, 28,

178
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:43,453
fatal car wreck, 1986.

179
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:45,455
Francesca Bourdain, 42,

180
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:47,791
suicide, pills, 1994.

181
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,793
Adrian Packham, 60,

182
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,295
massive coronary, 2001.

183
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,297
Peter McGee, 25,

184
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:57,500
carbon monoxide poisoning
in his home, 2006.

185
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:03,439
And seven as-yet unidentified
bodies buried on a beach.

186
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,441
Every death is different,

187
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,645
made to look like something else.

188
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:11,648
No sadism, no torture.

189
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:15,819
The method of these murders
was less important to the killer

190
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:18,488
than the simple fact... 

191
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,490
that these people die.

192
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:25,962
Joel Summers,

193
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,400
killed with a single stab to the heart.

194
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:34,504
Presented with great ostentation

195
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:38,241
atop a display of all the previous victims.

196
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:43,479
This killer's design was to
remain unnoticed, a ghost.

197
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,481
That is what excited him.

198
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:49,752
Until now.

199
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,754
Why... 

200
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:54,524
is he coming out into the light?

201
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:56,826
Will?

202
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:59,796
I don't want to interrupt
if you're rehearsing, or... 

203
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:08,371
Uh... n... no, no, no. It's ok, it's ok.

204
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:14,677
Very moody in here.

205
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:19,816
Uh... well, that's me all over.

206
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:21,985
(He chuckles.) Come on in.

207
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,856
I promise I won't try to kiss you again.

208
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,195
Unless you've stopped
taking your own advice.

209
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:37,667
A doctor who treats herself
has a fool for a patient.

210
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,306
I regretted leaving your
house the other night.

211
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:46,109
Regretted?

212
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:48,778
(slide clicker dropped on table)

213
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:51,981
Implying that you're no longer regretting,

214
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:54,984
or are you still in a state of regret?

215
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:58,421
I'm crisscrossing the state line.

216
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:00,323
What side of the line you on now?

217
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:05,628
I've got one foot firmly
planted on both sides.

218
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:13,803
Are you telling me that to confuse me?

219
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:17,674
No, I'm telling you that to
be honest about how I feel.

220
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:21,611
I don't want to mislead you, but
I don't want to lie to you either.

221
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,614
I won't lie if you don't.

222
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:31,020
I have feelings for you, Will.

223
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:38,161
But I can't just have an affair with you.

224
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,263
It would be... 

225
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,899
reckless.

226
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,434
Why?

227
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:46,436
(chuckling): Why?

228
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:49,272
And it is not because you
have a professional curiosity

229
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,075
- about me.
- No.

230
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:55,311
It's because I think you're unstable.

231
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:02,819
And until that changes,
I can only be your friend.

232
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,957
Thank you for not lying.

233
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:12,962
Do you feel unstable?

234
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,135
Mm.

235
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:44,060
I'm trying to be understated

236
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:47,430
when I say that this is a bad idea.

237
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:49,098
Freddie Lounds is dangerous.

238
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,434
She said she wanted me
to write about you guys

239
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:53,603
in the book.

240
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,339
You would be forfeiting
your privacy and ours.

241
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:02,612
This... this... well,
all of this will change.

242
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,215
Whatever you're feeling
now, that won't last.

243
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,684
Things change.

244
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,287
Things are changing for me too.

245
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,124
I'm doing some accounting

246
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:17,527
of what's important in
my life and what isn't.

247
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:21,330
You are important, Abigail.

248
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:26,335
Just because you killed my dad
doesn't mean you get to be him.

249
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:29,138
Abigail, we've been through

250
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:32,141
a traumatic event, and
no one more traumatized

251
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:35,044
than you, Abigail, but we
went through it together.

252
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:37,046
What you write, you write about all of us.

253
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:39,315
I don't need your permission.

254
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:43,553
And you don't need our approval,
but I hope it would mean something.

255
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,491
I know what people think I did.

256
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:52,161
They're wrong.

257
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:55,498
Why can't I tell everybody
that they're wrong?

258
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:58,835
You have nothing to apologize for.

259
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:00,503
Yet.

260
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,339
But if you open this door, Abigail,

261
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,842
you won't control what comes through.

262
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:08,244
Are you ready for that?

263
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,270
The display was built
in Grafton for a reason.

264
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:42,078
Totem poles commemorate special events.

265
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:44,281
They tell the story of a life.

266
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:48,452
If Joel Summers is his
finale, then this lowest body

267
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,554
on the pole will be our killer's beginning.

268
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,589
His first.

269
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:54,391
Fletcher Marshall.

270
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:57,327
Murdered in 1973. Beaten
to death right in Grafton.

271
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,329
His grave was robbed five days ago.

272
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:04,134
- No one convicted of killing him?
- Not yet.

273
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:07,137
So our guy got away with it 40 years ago.

274
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:10,140
So he kept on going.

275
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,476
There will be a connection between

276
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:13,977
Joel Summers

277
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,512
and Fletcher Marshall.

278
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,247
Will.

279
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,516
I need you in my office.

280
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:30,026
Nicholas Boyle turned
up in Minnesota... dead.

281
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:32,662
His body was found in
the woods. He was frozen.

282
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,198
They thawed him out fairly
quickly, but they said

283
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,200
they can't tell if he died a week ago,

284
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,202
six weeks ago, or the
night that he disappeared.

285
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,704
(Alana): How did he die?

286
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,870
Knife wound. He was gutted. 

287
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,351
I've had the body flown down here.

288
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:51,047
I want Abigail Hobbs to identify it for us.

289
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:53,216
You already have a positive ID.

290
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,552
- Not from Abigail Hobbs.
- You can't put her in a room

291
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,054
with Nick Boyle's body.
She already has nightmares

292
00:21:58,122 --> 00:22:00,690
about him, Jack. I'm curious about why.

293
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:03,628
You can't think that she has
something to do with this?

294
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,720
I think Abigail Hobbs
is the common denominator

295
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,474
between her father, Marissa Schuur,

296
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:10,534
and Nicholas Boyle. They
all go back to Abigail.

297
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,003
My instincts tell me
that Abigail has answers

298
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,672
that we have not heard.
What are the questions, Jack?

299
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,674
Let's start with where she goes

300
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:20,143
when she climbs the walls
of the psychiatric facility.

301
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,874
Maybe she's meeting Nicholas Boyle.

302
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,482
None of us know what was
really going on between them.

303
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,484
I want to go on record
as saying that this is

304
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:29,058
a very bad idea. Hannibal?

305
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,105
Jack has the look of a man

306
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:33,256
with no interest in
any opinion but his own.

307
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:36,693
I want you to observe on this, Alana.

308
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:40,063
If you're putting Abigail in a room
with the body, I want to be there.

309
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:43,066
I'm sorry, Will. I am not very
confident with your ability

310
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,329
to be objective about
Abigail Hobbs right now.

311
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,330
Alana.

312
00:22:55,846 --> 00:23:00,483
He could do Abigail irreparable
damage exposing her to this.

313
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,819
Perhaps she's stronger than we think.

314
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:21,972
Miss Hobbs, I want you to look at this man.

315
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,010
Is this the same person that attacked you,

316
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,646
Dr. Bloom, and Dr. Lecter at your home?

317
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:32,816
That's him.

318
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:34,951
Good.

319
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:38,054
I just have a few other
questions I'd like you to answer.

320
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:43,960
Have you seen this man since
the night he attacked you?

321
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:46,796
Could you cover him up?

322
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:48,999
I just need you to
answer the question first.

323
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,134
Please.

324
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,440
No.

325
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:59,476
I haven't seen him

326
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:02,312
since h... he attacked me.

327
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,814
This man, Nicholas Boyle,

328
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:07,651
was gutted with a hunting knife.

329
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,786
You knew how to do that.

330
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,256
- Your father taught you.
- Jack, I won't be party to this.

331
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:15,258
Then you can leave.

332
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:17,327
You're here by invitation,
by courtesy, Dr. Bloom.

333
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,629
Please don't interrupt me again.

334
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,434
You think I did this?

335
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:26,336
Where do you go

336
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:29,305
when you escape from the hospital, Abigail?

337
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:36,346
Sometimes... into the city,
sometimes into the woods,

338
00:24:36,414 --> 00:24:39,349
sometimes just out.

339
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:45,288
I go get away from... this,

340
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:48,391
to be alone where I can... 

341
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,895
think... breathe.

342
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:53,897
Did you ever meet with Nicholas Boyle

343
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:56,466
on one of your little
getaways from the hospital?

344
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:02,138
Did the two of you know each other
before the night he attacked you?

345
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:04,641
Did he know your father... 

346
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:06,309
No.

347
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:11,381
And you know nothing about his death?

348
00:25:14,418 --> 00:25:17,153
I know he tried to kill me.

349
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:22,492
And when he was trying to
kill me, all I could think was

350
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,161
that I was gonna die
in that house after all.

351
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,834
But I didn't.

352
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:34,571
I survived.

353
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:38,775
Dr. Bloom and... 

354
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:41,444
Dr. Lecter saved my life.

355
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,446
They saved me from him.

356
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,455
And you haven't seen him since?

357
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:54,624
Only in my nightmares.

358
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:26,656
- You believe her?
- I think

359
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:28,825
Abigail Hobbs is damaged.
There is something

360
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:31,761
she's using every ounce of
that strength to keep buried,

361
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,797
but it's not the murder
of Nicholas Boyle, Jack!

362
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,065
- What makes you so sure?
- Because any reservations

363
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:38,601
I have about Abigail
don't extend to Hannibal!

364
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:44,274
He has no reason to lie about any of this!

365
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:04,661
It can be a comfort to see the
broken, bloated corpse of a monster

366
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:07,497
and know it can never come back.

367
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:13,436
Nick Boyle wasn't a monster.

368
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:17,373
Were you?

369
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:21,845
I sometimes feel like one.

370
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:26,816
Is that why you uncovered his body?

371
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,355
Would this be a chapter
in your book, Abigail?

372
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:36,459
No. Neither would killing Nick
or you helping me hide the body.

373
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:38,962
There's always an addendum.

374
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,398
The FBI already asked their
questions. I answered them. I passed.

375
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,601
With Jack Crawford's attention.

376
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:46,603
You're right. I opened the door.

377
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,372
I can't control what comes
through it, but this time

378
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,709
I could control when.

379
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:55,278
I'm not afraid of them
finding Nicholas Boyle anymore.

380
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:58,047
He's been found.

381
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:00,283
You betrayed my trust.

382
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:03,286
You jeopardized my life
as well as your own.

383
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:05,755
I deserve more than that.

384
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,928
I need to trust you, Abigail.

385
00:28:11,996 --> 00:28:13,930
What if I can't?

386
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:20,351
Joel Summers, the
headpiece of our totem pole,

387
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,436
was adopted after his parents died.

388
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:23,769
Guess who dad was?

389
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:25,398
Fletcher Marshall.

390
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:28,234
Joel Summers is Joel Marshall.

391
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:32,305
Uh, we did a DNA comparison between
Fletcher Marshall and Joel Summers.

392
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,407
No match.

393
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:37,544
So Marshall's son wasn't his son?

394
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:40,513
The mom, Eleanor, was killed
in a car accident four years

395
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:43,016
after Fletcher was killed.
Genuine car accident?

396
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:44,984
If she was murdered, she would
have been on the totem pole.

397
00:28:45,052 --> 00:28:48,054
Well, unless he loved her too
much to disgrace her that way.

398
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:50,490
Was anyone ever convicted
for Marshall's murder?

399
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:52,492
There was a man named Laurence Wells

400
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,596
who was questioned twice in 1973.
Never charged. Still lives in Grafton.

401
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,101
Fletcher Marshall was a crime of passion.

402
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:03,937
It had something that none
of the other murders had.

403
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:06,906
Motive.

404
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:14,414
(man): It's open. Come in.

405
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:20,253
I'm unarmed.

406
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:26,759
So you were expecting us.

407
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:30,096
I had faith you'd find me.

408
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:31,731
And why is that, Mr. Wells?

409
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,867
Because I let you.

410
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,936
That last one was... 

411
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:40,773
let's just say it's a good
thing it was the last one.

412
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,610
I don't have the fight in me anymore.

413
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:46,479
Are you confessing to the
murder of Joel Summers?

414
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:48,948
(He chuckles.)

415
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:52,152
And Fletcher Marshall.

416
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:55,221
And 15 others.

417
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:57,697
I assume you've counted 'em up by now.

418
00:29:57,702 --> 00:30:00,627
So you killed Joel Summers
just so you'd be caught.

419
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:03,296
Not just.

420
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:05,298
I killed Joel Summers

421
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:08,735
because he was never meant to be.

422
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:11,371
What reason did you
have to kill the others?

423
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:14,174
I had every reason to kill the others.

424
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,109
They just had no reason to die.

425
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,182
They never saw me coming unless
I wanted them to see me coming.

426
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:29,189
I could wave at a lady and smile,

427
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:32,258
chew the fat with her in church,

428
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:34,327
knowing I killed her husband.

429
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:38,464
There is something beautiful

430
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:41,134
about that ball of silence at a funeral,

431
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:43,269
all those people around you,

432
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:45,605
knowing that you made it happen.

433
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:50,443
Now there's something
beautiful about knowing

434
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:53,313
that you'll spend the rest
of your life in prison.

435
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,183
Do I look wealthy to you?

436
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:59,719
Prison is gonna be a luxury

437
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:02,889
next to the kind of
retirement home I can afford.

438
00:31:02,957 --> 00:31:07,694
And I certainly won't be forgotten there.

439
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:11,965
I'm securing my... 

440
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm securing my legacy.

441
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:17,170
That's one way to be remembered.

442
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,772
No children to tell your story.

443
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,708
Did Joel Summers remember his father?

444
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:23,743
Not anymore.

445
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:25,745
Did you have an affair

446
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:28,047
with Eleanor Marshall
before you murdered her?

447
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:33,253
From your silence, I'm
gonna take that as a yes.

448
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,824
- He was your son. Joel Summers.
- What?

449
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,826
You thought the woman you loved was having

450
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:41,894
Fletcher Marshall's baby when
she should've been having yours,

451
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,896
but you got it the wrong way around.

452
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:45,832
Eleanor chose to raise him

453
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,835
as Fletcher Marshall's
child rather than yours,

454
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:51,271
so maybe... 

455
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:53,606
she saw what's in your heart.

456
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:58,945
You didn't secure your legacy,
Mr. Wells; you murdered it.

457
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:01,281
In fact, your one act as a father was

458
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:03,283
to destroy your son.

459
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:20,700
Killing somebody,

460
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:22,735
<i>it feels that bad?</i>

461
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:27,874
I'm worried about nightmares.

462
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:31,144
<i>(Hannibal) We'll help
you with the nightmares.</i>

463
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:48,928
(soft ambient pulse)

464
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,930
(heartbeat)

465
00:33:05,312 --> 00:33:07,447
(Nick groaning)

466
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,426
(She gasps.)

467
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,716
(Cello Suite No.2:
"Sarabande" by Bach playing)

468
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:01,367
Abigail Hobbs killed Nick Boyle.

469
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:05,538
Yes, I know.

470
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:11,844
Tell me why you know.

471
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:15,515
I helped her dispose of the body.

472
00:34:19,686 --> 00:34:21,888
Evidently... 

473
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:25,825
not well enough.

474
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:28,027
Have you told Jack Crawford?

475
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:30,596
No.

476
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:32,231
Why not?

477
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:35,001
Because I was hoping it wasn't true.

478
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:46,579
Well... now you know the truth.

479
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,247
Do I?

480
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:52,418
Everything you know about that
night is true, except the end.

481
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,687
Nicholas Boyle attacked us.

482
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,889
Abigail's only crime was to defend herself,

483
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:58,891
- and I lied about it.
- Why?

484
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,627
You know why.

485
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:03,930
Because Jack Crawford would hang her

486
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:06,599
for what her father's done,
and the world would burn Abigail

487
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,935
in his place. That would be the story.

488
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:11,437
That would be what Freddie Lounds writes.

489
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,610
Abigail is no more a killer than you are

490
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:20,279
for shooting her father, or I
am for the death of Tobias Budge.

491
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:24,283
- It isn't our place to decide.
- If not ours, then whose?

492
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:27,153
Who knows Abigail better than you and I?

493
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:29,655
Or the burden she bears?

494
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,227
We are her fathers now.

495
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:37,230
We have to serve her better
than Garret Jacob Hobbs.

496
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:50,576
If you go to Jack, then
you murder Abigail's future.

497
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:03,089
Do I need to call my lawyer, Will?

498
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:25,211
We can tell no one.

499
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:38,891
What we are doing here is the right thing.

500
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,566
In time, this will be the only
story any of us cares to tell.

501
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,504
I feel terrible Ms. Lounds.

502
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:10,652
Never entered my head
you might be a vegetarian.

503
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,888
A lapse on my behalf.

504
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:16,191
Research always delivers benefits.

505
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:19,494
If it contradicts a good
story, hell, publish it anyway.

506
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,498
Are you still angry I called you insane?

507
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:26,234
The libel laws are clear, Mr. Graham.

508
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:28,503
(Will): Insinuation is such a grey area.

509
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:31,106
Insane isn't really black or white, is it?

510
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:33,708
We're all pathological in our own ways.

511
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:37,212
You choose the version of
the truth that suits you best

512
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,347
and pursue it pathologically.

513
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:42,050
Everybody decides their
own versions of the truth.

514
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:46,021
I'm here because I want to tell
Abigail's version of the truth.

515
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,392
See that you do.

516
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:53,061
I don't have anything to hide.

517
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:55,063
Everyone has something to hide,

518
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:57,966
but I won't tell anything
you don't want me to.

519
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:00,435
You must understand our concerns.

520
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:02,938
We care about Abigail.

521
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:05,273
Our only thought is to protect her.

522
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:08,576
Hm. She's already exposed.

523
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:10,545
Her silence until now has

524
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:11,905
been taken as guilt. 

525
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,317
This book is about her innocence.

526
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:17,652
I want Abigail to have a future.

527
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,888
That's what we all want.

528
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:23,158
Well, we all want what's best for Abigail.

529
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:28,997
This is possibly the finest
salad I've ever eaten in my life.

530
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:31,399
Shame to ruin it with all that meat.

531
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,705
Will knows, doesn't he?

532
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,710
He knows you killed Nicholas Boyle, yes.

533
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,880
(She sniffles.)

534
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,216
What am I gonna do?

535
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,218
He will keep our secret.

536
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,390
- You don't know that.
- He will keep it

537
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,893
because otherwise the one good
thing in his life is tainted.

538
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,896
And he will lie to Jack Crawford about you

539
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,399
just as he has lied to himself.

540
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,403
You're free, Abigail.

541
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,739
No one will know what you did.

542
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,250
And no one will know the
truth you're trying to avoid.

543
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:33,094
The one you cannot admit even to yourself.

544
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,769
(softly): I helped him.

545
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,439
- I can't hear you.
- I helped him.

546
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,942
I knew what my father was. I
knew what he did. I... I knew.

547
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,950
I was the one who... 

548
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,787
met the girls,

549
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,789
talked to them.

550
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,460
Laughed and joked.

551
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,899
Found out where they lived,

552
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,901
where they were going,

553
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:15,003
when they'd be alone.

554
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:20,075
Girls that looked just like me.

555
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,580
They could have been my friends.

556
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:31,586
I couldn't say no to him. I knew... 

557
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:36,591
I knew it was them or me.

558
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,599
(Abigail crying)

559
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,310
I wondered when you would tell me.

560
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,314
I'm a monster.

561
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:01,316
No.

562
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:03,852
I know what monsters are.

563
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,788
You're a victim.

564
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:08,790
And Will and I... 

565
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:13,228
we're going to protect you.

566
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:15,230
(She sniffles.)

567
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:26,141
(train horn)

568
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,944
Mind if I sit?

569
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:04,445
Oh, yeah, sure.

570
00:42:04,513 --> 00:42:07,282
Thanks. (Abigail clears her throat.)

571
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:09,384
I hate traveling by myself.

572
00:42:09,451 --> 00:42:10,985
I love it.

573
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:13,210
- Where are you going?
- Home for the weekend. 

574
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:15,557
How about you?

575
