1
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,002
<i>Somebody asked me:</i>

2
00:00:57,252 --> 00:01:00,506
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you be?"</i>

3
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:03,300
I said to him,
"Probably right here...

4
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,637
...Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,556
In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,434
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:15,521
In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...

8
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:17,439
...very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,234
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,903
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:26,115
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:28,492
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,538
What will that mean to us?
One of these big blue things!

14
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:36,667
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

15
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:40,879
It'll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.

16
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,507
They'll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.

17
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:49,221
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It'll push off and hit Altoona.

18
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,514
Close call!

19
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,432
Let's look at the five-day.

20
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,061
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

21
00:01:56,562 --> 00:02:00,023
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

22
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,985
I won't be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.

23
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:07,739
I'll be in Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest Groundhog Festival.

24
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,201
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

25
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,204
...if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

26
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:16,540
...we've got six more weeks
of winter.

27
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:17,875
Sounds like fun.

28
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,670
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,172
Four, Nan.

30
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:24,381
Four.

31
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,799
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:30,721
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

33
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:32,055
Stay with us.

34
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:36,184
We're clear.

35
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:38,312
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

36
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:44,318
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

37
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:47,195
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

38
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,241
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

39
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,328
That was nice, Phil.
"Big trees"!

40
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:55,454
Stop, Kenny.

41
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,332
Look, can you handle
the 10:00 or not?

42
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:02,711
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

43
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,923
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

44
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:08,383
Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...

45
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:12,012
...to stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.

46
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:14,598
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

47
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,018
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

48
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:21,396
I think she'll be
a really good producer.

49
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:24,066
You guys are going to have fun.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,530
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'll be here for the 5:00.

51
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:34,636
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

52
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,347
I'm probably leaving PBH.

53
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,434
So this will be the last time...

54
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,269
...we do the Groundhog together.

55
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:45,772
What's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

56
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:47,107
In San Diego...

57
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:51,027
...I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

58
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:55,866
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog and think I have no future.

59
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,160
I think it's a nice story.

60
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,204
He comes out.
He looks around.

61
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,165
He wrinkles up his nose.

62
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:07,210
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!

63
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,838
You are new, aren't you?

64
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:12,716
People like blood sausage too.

65
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,467
People are morons!

66
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:16,720
Nice attitude.

67
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,308
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

68
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:22,726
For me? Once?

69
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:26,730
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

70
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:30,025
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...

71
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,152
I like blood sausage.

72
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,963
Rita, I can't stay here.

73
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,757
Prima donna.

74
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:38,218
- What's the matter?
- I hate this place.

75
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:41,096
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

76
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,932
- I won't stay here.
- You're not staying here.

77
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,308
I'm not?

78
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,560
Larry's dropping me off.

79
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,355
I booked you in
a nice bed and breakfast.

80
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,565
Great.

81
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:56,986
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

82
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:58,947
Keep the talent happy.

83
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:00,657
Anything I can do.

84
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:03,451
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

85
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,998
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

86
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,419
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

87
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:17,549
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

88
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,801
Don't be late.

89
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:24,597
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?

90
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:56,337
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.</i>

91
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:59,382
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!</i>

92
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:01,885
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

93
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:04,929
<i>Expect hazardous travel
later today with...</i>

94
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,598
<i>...that blizzard thing.</i>

95
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,976
<i>That blizzard thing.
Here's the report.</i>

96
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:14,564
<i>The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

97
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:17,567
<i>There's another reason
today's especially ex citing...</i>

98
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,527
<i>Especially cold.</i>

99
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:22,197
<i>The big question
on everybody's lips...</i>

100
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,116
<i>- Their chapped lips.
- On their chapped lips.</i>

101
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,952
<i>Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?</i>

102
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:31,497
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

103
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,166
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

104
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,461
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

105
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:41,674
- Morning!
- Morning.

106
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,010
- Off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

107
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,304
Think it'll be an early spring?

108
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:48,598
I'm predicting March 21st.

109
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,059
Good guess!

110
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:54,938
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

111
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:06,199
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

112
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,701
Like some coffee?

113
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:13,414
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

114
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:15,625
I really don't know...

115
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:19,462
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

116
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:21,881
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

117
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:25,385
- I'm sure I will.
- There's talk of a blizzard.

118
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:29,138
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

119
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,557
The moisture coming
out of the south...

120
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,018
...by midday will
push on to the east.

121
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:39,232
At high altitudes it'll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

122
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,236
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

123
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:47,198
Chance of precipitation,
about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.

124
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,451
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

125
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:52,412
Chitchat.

126
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,205
See you later.

127
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,669
Will you be checking out today?

128
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,213
Chance of departure today, 100%.

129
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:27,405
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

130
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:29,907
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

131
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:34,662
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

132
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:36,831
Not a chance.

133
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,458
Ned!

134
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,252
Ryerson!

135
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:43,838
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

136
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:46,466
Come on, buddy,
Case Western High!

137
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:50,595
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

138
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:55,725
Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn't graduate.

139
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:57,894
Bing again!

140
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:02,190
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

141
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:03,691
Well?

142
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,401
Ned Ryerson?

143
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:06,611
Bing!

144
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:08,154
Bing.

145
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:11,908
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

146
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:13,493
I sell insurance.

147
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:15,995
- What a shock.
- Do you have insurance?

148
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:18,164
If you do, you could
always use more.

149
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:21,000
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

150
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:25,796
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

151
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:27,298
But I'm not going to.

152
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:28,508
See you.

153
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,593
That's all right!
I'll walk with you.

154
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,721
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

155
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:35,806
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

156
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:39,602
I got friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

157
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,897
I say it's all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.

158
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:48,027
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

159
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:49,695
Oh, God!

160
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:53,866
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

161
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:55,409
Something else.

162
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:59,121
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

163
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:06,921
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

164
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:36,909
Phil!

165
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,744
Phil, over here!

166
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:40,454
Where have you been?

167
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:42,248
It was horrible.

168
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,417
A giant leech got me.

169
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,253
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!

170
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:51,132
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

171
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,968
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

172
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:56,595
Then they come back
and sing some more!

173
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,223
They're hicks, Rita.

174
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,393
So did you sleep okay without me?

175
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,395
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

176
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:05,813
You're incredible.

177
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:07,273
Who told you?

178
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:10,568
It's groundhog time.

179
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:16,198
Okay.
On me in three...

180
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,117
...two, one.

181
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:23,831
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

182
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:25,708
...to watch a master at work.

183
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:26,876
The master?

184
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,461
Punxsutawney Phil...

185
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:32,006
...the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

186
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:36,385
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

187
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,305
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

188
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,557
"Does Phil feel lucky?"

189
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:47,813
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

190
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:50,775
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

191
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:54,320
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it'll end.

192
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:02,536
Isn't he cute?

193
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,000
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

194
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:22,431
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

195
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,099
...Punxsutawney Phil...

196
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,893
...the seer of seers...

197
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:29,104
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

198
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:31,315
...emerged reluctantly...

199
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,608
...but alertly...

200
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,860
...in Punxsutawney, PA...

201
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,780
...and stated in groundhog-ese...

202
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,199
..."I definitely see a shadow."

203
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,036
Sorry, folks.

204
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,872
Six more weeks of winter.

205
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,254
On me in three...

206
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,130
...two, one.

207
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,801
This is one time where
television fails...

208
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:01,887
...to capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

209
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,347
...predicting the weather.

210
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,892
I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...

211
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:09,812
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.

212
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,189
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

213
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,984
We got it.
I'm out of here.

214
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,528
Prima donnas.

215
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,835
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

216
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,629
What is going on?

217
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:39,800
I don't know. Perhaps that
blizzard we're not supposed to get.

218
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,927
This is impossible.

219
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:46,932
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

220
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:09,830
Take it out of here.

221
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,666
Commander, what's going on?

222
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,044
Nothing.
We're closing the road.

223
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,881
- Big blizzard moving in.
- It's a couple of flakes.

224
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:21,800
Don't you listen to the weather?

225
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:24,011
I make the weather.

226
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:29,224
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

227
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,935
You got that moisture on your head.

228
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,146
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

229
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,691
...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.

230
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:40,069
So, what's it going to be?

231
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,198
I'm thinking.

232
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:48,410
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

233
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,704
What about the satellite?

234
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:52,873
Is it snowing in space?

235
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,378
Don't you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?

236
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:02,883
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

237
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:05,886
Can you patch me through
on that line?

238
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:16,355
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

239
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,066
I like it here.

240
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:22,528
Going to the groundhog dinner?

241
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:24,488
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

242
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,990
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.

243
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,116
You two run along.

244
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,496
Looking foxy tonight, man.

245
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,208
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

246
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,751
That's so funny.

247
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,461
So, what are you doing?

248
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:42,214
I think I'll go back to my room...

249
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:46,009
<i>...take a hot shower
and maybe read Hustler.</i>

250
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,636
Suit yourself.

251
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,364
Yo, mom.

252
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:09,324
Isn't there any hot water?

253
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:11,451
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.

254
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,162
Of course not.
Silly me.

255
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,831
Sweet dreams.

256
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:42,649
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.</i>

257
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:46,069
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!</i>

258
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,155
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

259
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:51,700
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

260
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,410
<i>- with that blizzard thing.</i>

261
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,330
<i>That blizzard thing?
Here's the report.</i>

262
00:18:56,538 --> 00:19:01,043
<i>The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

263
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:04,254
<i>There's another reason
today's especially ex citing...</i>

264
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,506
<i>Especially cold.</i>

265
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:08,925
<i>The big question
on everybody's lips...</i>

266
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:11,720
<i>- Chapped lips.
- Their chapped lips.</i>

267
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,848
<i>Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?</i>

268
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,393
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

269
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:19,978
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

270
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:21,897
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

271
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,653
What the hell?

272
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:39,623
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

273
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,001
Think it'll be an early spring?

274
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:45,754
Didn't we do this yesterday?

275
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:47,839
I don't know what you mean.

276
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:50,759
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!

277
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:54,221
- What day is this?
- It's February 2nd.

278
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,014
Groundhog Day.

279
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:01,853
I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.

280
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:26,378
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

281
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,672
Did I sleep well?

282
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:30,632
Like some coffee?

283
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,552
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.

284
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:36,221
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

285
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,890
There's talk of a blizzard.

286
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,728
Ever have d�j� vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

287
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,606
I'll check with the kitchen.

288
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:48,775
That's okay.
Thank you.

289
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,904
Will you be checking out today?

290
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:59,494
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

291
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,414
75-80.

292
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,087
Excuse me!

293
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:12,132
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?

294
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,175
To Gobbler's Knob.

295
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:15,635
It's Groundhog Day.

296
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:18,888
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

297
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,528
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

298
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:36,031
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

299
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:40,201
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

300
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,912
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?

301
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:46,499
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

302
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,336
So how's it going, old buddy?

303
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:52,464
I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

304
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:57,510
It's funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.

305
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,763
Do you sell insurance?

306
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,891
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

307
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:04,976
Do you have life insurance?

308
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:07,520
If you do, you could
always use more.

309
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:09,689
Right! I mean, who couldn't?

310
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,274
But you want to know something?

311
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:13,526
I gots a feeling...

312
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,445
...you ain't got any.

313
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:18,531
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

314
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,116
I got to go.

315
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,541
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

316
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:55,568
Phil! Over here!

317
00:22:57,737 --> 00:23:00,406
- Where have you been?
- Rita. Do me a favor.

318
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:03,743
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

319
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:06,830
How's that?

320
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:07,872
Good!

321
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:11,835
If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.

322
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:14,963
Something's going on.

323
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:17,924
- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk's more fun.

324
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:20,176
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

325
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:21,511
Can you?

326
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,555
I'm being serious!

327
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:27,809
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

328
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:30,270
It's groundhog time.

329
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,730
See? I knew you'd say that!

330
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,691
I really feel...

331
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:36,359
...weird.

332
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:38,903
Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.

333
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:42,699
All right, on me in three...

334
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:44,742
...two, one.

335
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:47,078
Well, it's Groundhog Day...

336
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:48,663
...again...

337
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:51,791
...and that must mean we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob...

338
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,795
...waiting for the world's most famous
groundhog/weatherman...

339
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:57,338
...Punxsutawney Phil...

340
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:01,551
...who's about to tell us how much more
winter to expect.

341
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:08,641
This is a riot!

342
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,354
Isn't he cute?

343
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,359
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

344
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:22,280
...Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

345
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:25,366
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

346
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,577
...emerged reluctantly...

347
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,079
...but alertly in Punxsu...

348
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:34,626
Oh, my gosh!

349
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,213
I know there's a blizzard.

350
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:42,550
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

351
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:48,598
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

352
00:25:45,696 --> 00:25:46,697
Morning!

353
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,491
Off to see the groundhog?

354
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:57,166
Did you sleep well, Mr...

355
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,683
Phil Connors! I thought...

356
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:18,479
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!

357
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:20,773
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!

358
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:23,484
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

359
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:30,408
Phil! Over here!

360
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:34,745
Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.

361
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:37,874
- You never talk about work.
- We have to talk.

362
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:41,210
- It's a creative meeting.
- We've got work to do!

363
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,838
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

364
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:47,049
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

365
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,597
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

366
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:54,432
Prima donnas.

367
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,020
More coffee?

368
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:03,065
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

369
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,775
Aren't they?

370
00:27:06,152 --> 00:27:08,613
Just put that anywhere, pal!

371
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:10,406
Good save!

372
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:15,369
Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.

373
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,459
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

374
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,170
Groundhog Day. Today.

375
00:27:24,754 --> 00:27:27,924
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.

376
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:31,093
Really! This is the third time!

377
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:33,304
It's like yesterday never happened!

378
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:37,516
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.

379
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:41,103
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!

380
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:43,648
What do you want me to do?

381
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:47,193
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.

382
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:50,029
You should get
your head examined...

383
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,574
...if you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

384
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:55,576
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

385
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,496
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

386
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,332
Look out for your shadow, pal!

387
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,126
Morons, your bus is leaving!

388
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,839
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

389
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,636
- Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
- I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

390
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:16,138
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!

391
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,849
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

392
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:21,727
I know that's what I said.

393
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:24,438
I think you need help.

394
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:28,317
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

395
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:30,945
No spots.

396
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:33,656
No clots, no tumors.

397
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:35,282
No lesions.

398
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:37,076
No aneurisms.

399
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:38,869
At least none that I can see.

400
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,998
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.

401
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,418
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

402
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:49,255
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there's a blizzard.

403
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:50,714
Right. The blizzard!

404
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:53,634
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

405
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:55,761
A biopsy.

406
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,013
A psychiatrist.

407
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:02,226
That's an unusual problem...

408
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:03,561
...Mr. Connors.

409
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:10,067
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

410
00:29:12,403 --> 00:29:14,155
You went to college, right?

411
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:16,699
It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?

412
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:19,910
Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?

413
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,621
Sort of, I guess.

414
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,041
Abnormal psychology.

415
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,419
So...

416
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:30,838
...what do I do?

417
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,007
We should meet again.

418
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:35,968
How's tomorrow for you?

419
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:40,097
Is that not good?

420
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:53,736
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

421
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:55,988
I met a girl.

422
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:57,489
We ate lobster.

423
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,742
Drank pi�a coladas.

424
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:02,536
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

425
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,709
That was a pretty good day.

426
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,794
Why couldn't I get that day...

427
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:12,129
...over...

428
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,548
...and over and over?

429
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,719
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

430
00:30:18,928 --> 00:30:20,387
"That glass is half empty."

431
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:24,433
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

432
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:28,020
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Right?

433
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:33,359
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place...

434
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:37,529
...and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

435
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:42,868
That about sums it up for me.

436
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:51,460
Good luck.

437
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,128
I'll drop you off.

438
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:57,508
This thing sticks a little bit.

439
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,259
You got to jiggle it...

440
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,679
Come on up here, pal.

441
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:04,348
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

442
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:07,309
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.

443
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:10,479
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

444
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:12,106
You're all right.

445
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:21,281
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

446
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:24,201
I think, both.

447
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:37,339
I don't think I should drive.

448
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:39,466
I don't either.

449
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:41,093
Watch your head.

450
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:44,471
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

451
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,849
Let's not forget seat belts.

452
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:51,937
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

453
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:58,902
Let me ask you a question.

454
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:00,028
Shoot.

455
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,532
What if there were no tomorrow?

456
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:07,369
No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...

457
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,163
...no hangovers.

458
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,874
We could do whatever we wanted!

459
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:14,668
That's true.

460
00:32:14,877 --> 00:32:18,005
We could do whatever we want.

461
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:27,139
If we wanted to hit mailboxes
we could let Ralph drive!

462
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:35,522
They want you to stop.

463
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:36,648
Hang on!

464
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:44,406
It's the same thing
your whole life.

465
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,784
"Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!

466
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:49,786
Take it like a man!

467
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:51,663
Be nice to your sister!

468
00:32:52,497 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!

469
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:59,004
Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"

470
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:01,882
That's one I agree with.

471
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:13,602
I don't know, Gus.

472
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:16,605
Sometimes I think you just have to...

473
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:19,233
...take the big chances.

474
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,818
<i>This is the police! Pull over now!</i>

475
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:25,405
We're talking in here!

476
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:32,496
I bet he swerves first.

477
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:50,013
I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!

478
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:51,848
I noticed that.

479
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:54,601
You make choices
and you live with them.

480
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:10,325
My knee!

481
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:14,997
Let me handle this.

482
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:20,335
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

483
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,587
...two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

484
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,798
And some flapjacks!

485
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:26,883
Too early for flapjacks?

486
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,732
Yes!

487
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:44,609
Rise and shine, campers!

488
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,863
Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!

489
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:49,489
It's cold every day.

490
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,826
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

491
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:58,832
Slept like a baby.

492
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,084
I'd love some of your coffee.

493
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:03,128
- I hope...
- Flurries moving in later...

494
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:05,505
...but the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.

495
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:06,757
Mrs. Lancaster?

496
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,301
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

497
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:12,971
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

498
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,099
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

499
00:35:16,308 --> 00:35:17,976
Apparently not.

500
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:23,482
Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.

501
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:31,323
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

502
00:35:36,828 --> 00:35:39,039
- Phil Connors!
- Ned?

503
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,740
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

504
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:16,243
It's inspiring, in a way.

505
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:19,496
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

506
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:20,997
More coffee?

507
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:22,832
Keep it coming.

508
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,292
Sure thing.

509
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:28,505
Just put that anywhere, pal!

510
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,131
Good save!

511
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:35,971
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

512
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:40,016
I don't worry anymore.

513
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:42,769
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

514
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:45,855
That's exactly what makes me
so special.

515
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:47,857
I don't even have to floss.

516
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:58,535
What?

517
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:04,124
"The wretch, concentered all in self

518
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,876
"Living, shall forfeit fair renown

519
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:10,213
"And doubly dying, shall go down

520
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:13,425
"To the vile dust from whence he sprung

521
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:15,051
"Unwept...

522
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,721
"...unhonored and unsung"

523
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:20,390
Sir Walter Scott.

524
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:24,936
You don't like poetry?

525
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:27,063
I love poetry!

526
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:30,400
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

527
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,361
You think I act like this
because I'm egocentric?

528
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:36,781
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

529
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:42,704
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

530
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:43,788
Thanks, Larry.

531
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:46,249
Would you like a doggie bag?

532
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,126
I'll stay and finish.

533
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:50,628
I thought you hated this town.

534
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,714
It's beginning to grow on me.

535
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:55,341
Larry, quit staring.

536
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:58,553
<i>- These are excellent.
- Bon app�tit.</i>

537
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,274
You see the groundhog
this morning?

538
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,611
I never miss it.

539
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:16,488
What's your name?

540
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:20,450
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

541
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:23,203
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

542
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:24,454
High school.

543
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,416
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

544
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:31,836
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

545
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,463
Are you kidding?

546
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,924
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was...

547
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:38,051
Mrs. Walsh.

548
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:41,304
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

549
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:44,015
Thanks very much.

550
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:00,698
Nancy?

551
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:04,035
Nancy Taylor!

552
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:06,746
Lincoln High School!

553
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:10,500
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!

554
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:14,254
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Connors!

555
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:18,007
- That's amazing!
- You don't remember me?

556
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,345
I asked you to the prom.

557
00:39:23,596 --> 00:39:25,348
Phil Connors?

558
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,101
I was short and I've sprouted.

559
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,232
How are you?

560
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:35,984
Great.

561
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,944
You look terrific!

562
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:41,406
You look very, very terrific!

563
00:39:42,907 --> 00:39:45,326
Listen, I got to go do this report.

564
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:46,786
Are you a reporter?

565
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,497
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

566
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:51,666
I should have known! That's great!

567
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,626
But maybe later we could...

568
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:55,086
Yeah, whatever!

569
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,088
Stay right here.

570
00:39:57,505 --> 00:40:00,675
Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!

571
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:02,635
Good luck!

572
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:21,821
Oh, Phil.

573
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:24,240
Oh, Rita.

574
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,328
Who's Rita?

575
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:31,414
How should I know?

576
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:34,250
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

577
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,461
On the contrary, Nancy...

578
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:39,964
...I love you.
I've always loved you.

579
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:43,259
This is going to seem sudden but...

580
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:46,637
...Nancy, will you be my wife?

581
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,979
Rita.

582
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:58,316
- Nancy.
- Whatever.

583
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:04,989
A gust of wind.

584
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:08,534
A dog barks.

585
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,329
Cue the truck.

586
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,254
Exit Herman.

587
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:22,840
Walk on to the bank.

588
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:27,136
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

589
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:31,057
All right, Doris. Come on.

590
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:34,644
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

591
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:37,063
Felix!

592
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:38,731
How you doing, Doris?

593
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,526
Can I have a roll of quarters?

594
00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:47,365
Ten... nine... eight...

595
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:49,408
...car...

596
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:52,703
...six... five...

597
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:55,081
...quarters...

598
00:41:55,456 --> 00:41:59,043
...three... two...

599
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:08,010
Felix?

600
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:11,806
- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don't know.

601
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,627
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

602
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:44,755
It's like I said, I love this film.

603
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:47,216
I've seen it over 100 times.

604
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:48,467
Phil!

605
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:49,969
Told you...

606
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,471
...call me "Bronco."

607
00:42:52,722 --> 00:42:54,515
Sorry, Bronco.

608
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,435
Hi, Nancy.

609
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:03,607
My own fianc�e...

610
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:05,985
...doesn't remember me.

611
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:11,657
That'll be one adult and...

612
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:15,161
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.

613
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:23,085
<i>- groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.</i>

614
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:26,047
<i>The question we have
to ask ourselves today is:</i>

615
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:28,257
<i>"Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

616
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:31,260
Rita, if you only
had one day to live...

617
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,137
...what would you do?

618
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:35,931
I don't know.
What are you dying of?

619
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:40,644
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

620
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:41,854
What do you do?

621
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:44,398
I want to know
where to put the camera.

622
00:43:44,607 --> 00:43:47,109
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

623
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,196
No, I'm just interested in you.

624
00:43:50,446 --> 00:43:52,698
What do you want?
What do you like?

625
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:54,784
What do you think about?

626
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:57,328
What kind of men
are you interested in?

627
00:43:57,536 --> 00:43:59,371
What do you do for fun?

628
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,292
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

629
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:07,713
I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn't this how they talk?

630
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:10,257
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.

631
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,718
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

632
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:15,888
And a doughnut.

633
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:17,723
All right.

634
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:22,103
<i>So what do you want out of life?</i>

635
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:26,273
I guess I want what everybody wants.

636
00:44:26,482 --> 00:44:30,027
Career, love, marriage, children.

637
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:31,904
Are you seeing anyone?

638
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:37,076
This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.

639
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:40,496
How about you?
What do you want?

640
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:44,959
What I really want
is someone like you.

641
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:46,502
Oh, please!

642
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,921
Why not? What are you looking for?

643
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:50,506
Who's your perfect guy?

644
00:44:51,882 --> 00:44:55,886
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

645
00:44:57,221 --> 00:44:58,597
That's me!

646
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:02,184
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny...

647
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,645
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

648
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,232
Me, me, me.

649
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:11,277
He's romantic and courageous.

650
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:12,778
Me also.

651
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:16,949
He's got a good body but doesn't
have to look in the mirror often.

652
00:45:17,616 --> 00:45:22,454
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

653
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:28,460
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

654
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:30,838
He's not afraid to cry.

655
00:45:31,088 --> 00:45:33,674
This is a man
we're talking about, right?

656
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:38,887
He likes animals, children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

657
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:41,515
Does he have to use the word "poopy"?

658
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:46,520
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

659
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:50,524
I am really close on this one.

660
00:45:51,317 --> 00:45:54,069
Really, really close.

661
00:45:58,532 --> 00:46:00,117
It's Phil Connors!

662
00:46:00,326 --> 00:46:01,619
Hello.

663
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,662
Thanks for watching.

664
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:19,762
What are the chances
of getting out today?

665
00:46:20,012 --> 00:46:22,264
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

666
00:46:22,514 --> 00:46:23,932
Wouldn't you know it?

667
00:46:24,183 --> 00:46:25,976
Can I buy you a drink?

668
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:31,273
Jim Beam, ice, water.

669
00:46:32,107 --> 00:46:33,233
For you, miss?

670
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:37,029
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

671
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:44,578
What are the chances
of getting out today?

672
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:47,247
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

673
00:46:47,498 --> 00:46:49,124
Wouldn't you know it?

674
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,210
Can I buy you a drink?

675
00:46:54,088 --> 00:46:56,799
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

676
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:57,883
For you, miss?

677
00:46:58,258 --> 00:46:59,760
The same.

678
00:47:00,594 --> 00:47:02,262
That's my favorite drink.

679
00:47:02,513 --> 00:47:04,264
Mine too!

680
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:06,058
It makes me think of Rome.

681
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:09,561
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

682
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:13,315
What should we drink to?

683
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:16,485
To the groundhog!

684
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,363
I always drink to world peace.

685
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:30,207
Can I buy you a drink?

686
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:36,171
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

687
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,549
For you, miss?

688
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:40,467
The same.

689
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:42,553
That's my favorite drink.

690
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:44,388
Mine too!

691
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,850
It makes me think of Rome.

692
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,895
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

693
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,815
What should we drink to?

694
00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:00,028
I'd like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

695
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:03,782
To world peace.

696
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:17,170
- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn't I tell you?

697
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,423
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

698
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,050
I spent a lot of time here.

699
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:24,344
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

700
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:26,972
- That's how I feel!
- Really?

701
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,309
- Some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don't make me sick.

702
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,727
No white chocolate.

703
00:48:31,935 --> 00:48:34,855
There is something
so familiar about this.

704
00:48:35,105 --> 00:48:37,190
Do you ever have d�j� vu?

705
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,651
Didn't you just ask me that?

706
00:48:43,614 --> 00:48:47,200
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

707
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:50,579
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

708
00:48:50,787 --> 00:48:53,332
That's where I see myself
in five years.

709
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:54,499
How about you?

710
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,586
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

711
00:48:57,794 --> 00:48:59,880
See where it leads me.

712
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,965
Well, it's led you here.

713
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:07,387
It's about a million miles
from where I started in college.

714
00:49:07,638 --> 00:49:11,141
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

715
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:16,355
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

716
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:18,231
What a waste of time!

717
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,401
I mean, for someone else
that'd be a total waste.

718
00:49:21,652 --> 00:49:23,695
So bold of you to choose that.

719
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:27,616
It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.

720
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:32,871
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

721
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:37,668
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

722
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:40,170
That's where I see myself
in five years.

723
00:49:40,379 --> 00:49:41,380
How about you?

724
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,550
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

725
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:48,095
Well, it's gotten you here.

726
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:51,848
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

727
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:55,560
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

728
00:49:56,686 --> 00:50:00,774
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

729
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:19,000
You speak French!

730
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,509
I haven't done this since I was a kid.

731
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,553
Me neither. It's fun!

732
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:30,887
Clean fun.

733
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:37,269
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

734
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:42,941
Where'd you get that?

735
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:45,819
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

736
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:49,197
Hey, an assassin!

737
00:50:49,656 --> 00:50:51,241
I'll protect you!

738
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:54,494
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

739
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:55,996
Find cover!

740
00:50:58,331 --> 00:51:00,667
I'm getting some good ones.

741
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:03,753
That's a boy! Good try.

742
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:05,630
Help me!

743
00:52:01,603 --> 00:52:02,771
What?

744
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:07,067
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.

745
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:08,735
About what?

746
00:52:08,985 --> 00:52:11,738
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

747
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:14,032
...and end up
so completely different.

748
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,620
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

749
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,247
I like it very much.

750
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:25,001
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

751
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:26,503
Well, you can.

752
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,714
It just takes an awful lot of work.

753
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:32,175
Come in.
I want to show you something.

754
00:52:32,384 --> 00:52:34,678
- I don't think I should.
- I agree.

755
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:39,265
That's why I want to show you one thing,
then kick you right out.

756
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,693
It's just lovely.

757
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:02,831
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

758
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:09,712
It's a really wonderful room.

759
00:53:09,963 --> 00:53:11,798
It is now.

760
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:21,182
I don't think we should do this.

761
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:23,059
I don't either.

762
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,481
On second thought,
I think we should.

763
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:32,485
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

764
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:35,989
Well, it's a little fast for me.

765
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:37,657
Me too.

766
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:40,368
Maybe I should go.

767
00:53:40,577 --> 00:53:42,495
Where would you go?

768
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:44,122
Why?

769
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,624
We've got a perfect fire.

770
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:49,961
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire...

771
00:53:51,504 --> 00:53:53,006
I will read to you.

772
00:53:53,756 --> 00:53:57,886
I've got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.

773
00:54:03,516 --> 00:54:04,559
Rocky road.

774
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,352
I love rocky road.

775
00:54:06,603 --> 00:54:08,521
Yeah, I thought so.

776
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,523
You have to stay.

777
00:54:10,773 --> 00:54:14,569
No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

778
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:18,573
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.

779
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:21,659
No, Phil, really.

780
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:25,830
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

781
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,166
And if you like that, stay longer.

782
00:54:28,374 --> 00:54:30,251
Let's not spoil it, okay?

783
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,921
I don't want to spoil it either.

784
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:36,049
You know I can't stay with you.

785
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:39,385
Why not? I love you.

786
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:43,556
You love me?

787
00:54:43,806 --> 00:54:47,936
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

788
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:52,440
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!

789
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,068
This whole day has been
one long setup.

790
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:56,277
No, it hasn't.

791
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:59,280
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

792
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:01,616
No white chocolate, no fudge.

793
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,620
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

794
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:09,040
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

795
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,794
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

796
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:14,462
Stop saying that!

797
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:16,631
You must be crazy.

798
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:20,593
I could never love you because
you'll never love anyone but yourself.

799
00:55:21,135 --> 00:55:24,722
I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.

800
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,018
That's for making me
care about you.

801
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:38,444
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.

802
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:39,696
It's fun!

803
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:44,242
And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.

804
00:55:44,492 --> 00:55:47,203
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

805
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:48,955
I want lots of kids!

806
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:53,042
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

807
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:55,545
I got this at Snowman City.

808
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:58,631
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

809
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:01,718
Come here! Let's have some fun!

810
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:06,723
I wish these were my own kids.

811
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:11,978
Are any of you up for adoption?

812
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:15,106
Here's a humdinger over here!

813
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:17,400
Wasn't that great?

814
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:27,452
Stop it!

815
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:14,248
Phil! Over here!

816
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:19,253
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.

817
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:21,380
Phil, you look terrible.

818
00:57:22,048 --> 00:57:24,550
What happened? Rough night?

819
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:44,445
Okay, campers.

820
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,697
Rise and shine.

821
00:57:48,616 --> 00:57:52,286
Don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there.

822
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:55,623
It's cold out there every day.

823
00:57:56,332 --> 00:58:00,169
<i>This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.</i>

824
00:58:01,337 --> 00:58:02,421
What is Mexico?

825
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,673
<i>What is Mexico?</i>

826
00:58:04,006 --> 00:58:05,841
<i>- Correct.
- Lakes and Rivers, 400.</i>

827
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:08,761
<i>Seneca is the largest
of these lakes.</i>

828
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:10,930
What are the Finger Lakes?

829
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:14,100
<i>- What are the Finger Lakes?
- Correct.</i>

830
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:18,479
<i>- This lake in Bolivia...
- What is Titicaca?</i>

831
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,481
<i>- What is Titicaca?
- Correct.</i>

832
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:21,649
For 1,000.

833
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:23,776
<i>- Milky-colored...
- The Rhone.</i>

834
00:58:24,026 --> 00:58:25,653
<i>...when entering Lake Geneva...</i>

835
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:28,447
<i>...this river is
clear blue upon exiting.</i>

836
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:29,615
<i>- Jim?
- The Rhone.</i>

837
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:31,200
<i>Good for $1, 000.</i>

838
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,869
<i>You're $500 off the lead right now.</i>

839
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:38,332
This is pitiful.

840
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,084
A thousand people...

841
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:43,337
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

842
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:45,131
What a hype.

843
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:49,844
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

844
00:58:50,052 --> 00:58:53,180
You're hypocrites! All of you!

845
00:58:55,474 --> 00:58:57,018
You got a problem, Larry?

846
00:58:58,477 --> 00:58:59,311
Untie your tongue.

847
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,897
Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you...

848
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:03,315
...princess?

849
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:05,317
You want a prediction
about the weather?

850
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:08,237
You're asking the wrong Phil.

851
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:11,157
I'll give you a winter prediction.

852
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:13,451
It's going to be cold.

853
00:59:13,701 --> 00:59:15,911
It's going to be gray.

854
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,916
And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.

855
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:59,497
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...

856
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:03,250
...to this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

857
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:06,378
There is no way that this winter...

858
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:09,507
...is ever going to end...

859
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:13,677
...as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

860
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:15,804
I don't see any other way out.

861
01:00:16,597 --> 01:00:18,474
He's got to be stopped.

862
01:00:19,975 --> 01:00:21,352
And I have to stop it.

863
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:24,730
Real good, Phil.

864
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,232
Real good.

865
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:29,401
He's out of his gourd.

866
01:00:34,073 --> 01:00:37,451
I'm worried. There's something
really wrong with Phil.

867
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,371
There's a lot of things
wrong with Phil.

868
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,791
Hi, Phil.

869
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,335
I've come to the end of me.

870
01:00:46,585 --> 01:00:48,712
There's no way out now.

871
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:53,509
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

872
01:00:56,929 --> 01:00:58,347
All right, little fellow.

873
01:00:58,597 --> 01:01:01,976
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

874
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:03,727
I believe he did.

875
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:07,481
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

876
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:11,860
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

877
01:01:14,446 --> 01:01:16,365
Hey! What are you doing?

878
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,163
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

879
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:24,873
We are going after him!

880
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:33,966
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

881
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:36,260
I could think of reasons.

882
01:01:36,468 --> 01:01:37,428
Pervert.

883
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:05,247
He must have just snapped!

884
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:06,790
This ought to be good.

885
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:10,419
What is he doing?

886
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,171
What can he be thinking?

887
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:14,423
Not bad for a quadruped.

888
01:02:14,673 --> 01:02:18,594
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

889
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,143
That's it.

890
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:29,438
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

891
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:38,822
Don't drive angry.

892
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:40,240
Don't drive angry.

893
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:03,138
There's no way out
except the way we came in!

894
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:04,848
We got him now!

895
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,369
What is he doing?

896
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:26,620
I don't know.

897
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:33,752
If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.

898
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:40,300
Mustn't keep them waiting.

899
01:03:43,637 --> 01:03:44,972
It's showtime.

900
01:03:51,353 --> 01:03:52,646
On me in three...

901
01:03:54,773 --> 01:03:55,607
...two...

902
01:03:57,526 --> 01:03:58,485
...one.

903
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,333
Phil!

904
01:04:15,669 --> 01:04:17,045
He might be okay.

905
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:24,219
Well, no. Probably not now.

906
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,111
Nuts.

907
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:51,955
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

908
01:04:52,998 --> 01:04:54,666
Would you like...

909
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,710
...some toast?

910
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:17,147
Oh, my God!

911
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:51,097
That's him.

912
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:57,687
He was a really, really great guy.

913
01:05:57,938 --> 01:05:59,648
I really, really liked him...

914
01:06:00,065 --> 01:06:01,107
...a lot.

915
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:10,450
I'm sorry?
What was that again?

916
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:13,620
- I'm a god.
- You're God?

917
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:17,082
I'm a god. I'm not the god,
I don't think.

918
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,793
Because you survived a car wreck?

919
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,169
You folks ready to order?

920
01:06:21,419 --> 01:06:24,631
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.

921
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:27,634
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

922
01:06:27,843 --> 01:06:31,179
...frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

923
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:32,722
Oh, really.

924
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:37,185
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

925
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:38,979
I am an immortal.

926
01:06:39,187 --> 01:06:41,815
Special today is blueberry waffles.

927
01:06:42,023 --> 01:06:43,858
Why are you telling me this?

928
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,278
Because I want you to believe in me.

929
01:06:46,486 --> 01:06:47,821
You are not a god.

930
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:51,449
Take my word. It's 12 years
of Catholic school talking.

931
01:06:51,992 --> 01:06:53,952
I can come back if you're not ready.

932
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,162
How do you know I'm not a god?

933
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:57,622
Please.

934
01:06:57,872 --> 01:07:00,208
- How do you know?
- It's not possible.

935
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,168
I'll come back.

936
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:03,753
Doris.

937
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:09,759
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

938
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:13,680
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...

939
01:07:13,888 --> 01:07:15,098
...before she dies.

940
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:16,266
Boy, would I!

941
01:07:16,474 --> 01:07:19,144
- What are you doing?
- Debbie and her fianc�.

942
01:07:19,394 --> 01:07:20,645
Do I know you?

943
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:23,732
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.

944
01:07:23,982 --> 01:07:25,150
What?

945
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,526
Lovely ring.

946
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:31,614
Bill's been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.

947
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:34,951
He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers, and he's gay.

948
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,202
I am.

949
01:07:36,828 --> 01:07:39,581
Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

950
01:07:39,831 --> 01:07:42,375
I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.

951
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,461
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

952
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:48,548
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...

953
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,717
...he just knows everything.

954
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:52,302
- Who's that?
- Tom.

955
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:54,554
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

956
01:07:54,763 --> 01:07:55,930
- And her?
- Alice.

957
01:07:56,181 --> 01:07:58,725
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

958
01:07:58,975 --> 01:07:59,809
He's right.

959
01:08:00,018 --> 01:08:01,436
- And her?
- Nancy.

960
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:05,648
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

961
01:08:05,899 --> 01:08:07,609
- It's true.
- How do you know this?

962
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:09,569
I told you, I know everything.

963
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,697
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

964
01:08:12,906 --> 01:08:15,658
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

965
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:20,413
- Okay?
- Okay, that's enough.

966
01:08:21,456 --> 01:08:23,666
What about me?
Do you know me too?

967
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:28,129
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

968
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,757
Well, everyone knows that.

969
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:33,718
You like boats but not the ocean.

970
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:37,514
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

971
01:08:37,764 --> 01:08:41,684
There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...

972
01:08:42,393 --> 01:08:45,313
...and a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

973
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:49,192
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.

974
01:08:49,901 --> 01:08:51,319
You're very generous.

975
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:54,072
You're kind to strangers
and children.

976
01:08:54,614 --> 01:08:57,450
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

977
01:08:57,909 --> 01:08:59,452
How are you doing this?

978
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:03,498
I told you. I wake up every day.

979
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:05,416
Right here.

980
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:09,045
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.

981
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:12,549
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

982
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:16,344
If you still can't believe me, listen:

983
01:09:16,594 --> 01:09:18,596
In 10 seconds...

984
01:09:19,097 --> 01:09:22,559
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

985
01:09:22,809 --> 01:09:24,644
But you can't let him.

986
01:09:25,645 --> 01:09:28,690
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

987
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:37,782
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

988
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:39,659
What's that?

989
01:09:40,577 --> 01:09:42,996
"...to stay ahead of the weather."

990
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:52,589
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

991
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:55,300
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

992
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:58,678
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

993
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:02,390
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

994
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,101
This sounds like a science project.

995
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:07,437
Concentrate.

996
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:09,480
You got to want it.

997
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:12,025
You got to want it, Rita.

998
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:16,362
Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.

999
01:10:24,662 --> 01:10:26,497
Be the hat. Come on, go.

1000
01:10:26,748 --> 01:10:29,709
- It'd take me a year to get good.
- Six months.

1001
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:33,212
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

1002
01:10:33,713 --> 01:10:37,342
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.

1003
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,803
That's not the worst part.

1004
01:10:41,054 --> 01:10:42,472
What's the worst part?

1005
01:10:42,722 --> 01:10:44,724
The worst part is that...

1006
01:10:44,932 --> 01:10:47,477
...tomorrow you'll have
forgotten all about this...

1007
01:10:47,727 --> 01:10:49,937
...and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

1008
01:10:51,064 --> 01:10:52,523
I am a jerk.

1009
01:10:52,732 --> 01:10:54,567
No, you're not.

1010
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:59,447
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...

1011
01:10:59,697 --> 01:11:01,407
...I don't even exist anymore.

1012
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,744
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1013
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:08,331
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.

1014
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:11,209
It just depends
on how you look at it.

1015
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:14,962
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

1016
01:11:18,257 --> 01:11:21,427
I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.

1017
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:22,553
Me too.

1018
01:11:22,762 --> 01:11:23,971
And maybe...

1019
01:11:24,222 --> 01:11:27,892
...if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

1020
01:11:28,142 --> 01:11:29,560
I hope so.

1021
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:43,533
You're still here?

1022
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,746
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

1023
01:11:48,996 --> 01:11:50,665
Not until 6.

1024
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:52,959
You rat!

1025
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:55,044
I never said midnight.

1026
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:57,839
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1027
01:11:58,631 --> 01:12:00,049
Are you going to leave?

1028
01:12:03,845 --> 01:12:04,971
Good.

1029
01:12:15,648 --> 01:12:17,316
I'm sorry.

1030
01:12:18,818 --> 01:12:21,070
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

1031
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,407
I promise I won't touch you.

1032
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:26,367
Much.

1033
01:12:27,702 --> 01:12:30,454
It's all right. I'm not tired.

1034
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:32,957
What were you saying?

1035
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:37,670
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

1036
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,590
...only God could make a tree.

1037
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,924
Really?

1038
01:13:20,087 --> 01:13:22,381
What I wanted to say was...

1039
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,260
...I think you are the kindest...

1040
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:29,055
...sweetest, prettiest person...

1041
01:13:29,555 --> 01:13:31,557
...I've ever met in my life.

1042
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,311
I've never seen anyone...

1043
01:13:35,936 --> 01:13:38,439
...that's nicer to people
than you are.

1044
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,454
And the first time I saw you...

1045
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:56,791
...something happened to me.

1046
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:00,169
I never told you...

1047
01:14:03,547 --> 01:14:05,966
...but I knew I wanted
to hold you...

1048
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,052
...as hard as I could.

1049
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,484
I don't deserve someone like you.

1050
01:14:27,321 --> 01:14:29,115
But if I ever could...

1051
01:14:30,574 --> 01:14:32,660
...I swear I would love you...

1052
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,162
...for the rest of my life.

1053
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,627
Did you say something?

1054
01:14:47,341 --> 01:14:48,926
Good night, Rita.

1055
01:14:50,136 --> 01:14:51,720
Good night, Phil.

1056
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:19,999
<i>Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.</i>

1057
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:23,252
<i>- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day.</i>

1058
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,754
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

1059
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:03,626
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

1060
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:05,669
Thanks, Phil.

1061
01:16:05,878 --> 01:16:06,712
Larry?

1062
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,048
Skim milk, two sugar.

1063
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:10,633
Thanks, Phil.

1064
01:16:10,841 --> 01:16:12,009
Pastry?

1065
01:16:12,259 --> 01:16:13,427
We're setting up.

1066
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:15,429
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

1067
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,724
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

1068
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:22,394
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

1069
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,439
He said if we set up here
we'll get a better shot.

1070
01:16:25,898 --> 01:16:28,150
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

1071
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:29,693
Larry?

1072
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,905
Yeah. Let's go for it.

1073
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,198
Good work, Phil.

1074
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:38,202
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.

1075
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,581
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

1076
01:16:43,874 --> 01:16:45,751
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

1077
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:22,371
I'd like a piano lesson.

1078
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:26,667
I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow...

1079
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:30,129
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1,000.

1080
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:33,799
Come on in.

1081
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,404
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1082
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:57,656
<i>Buon giorno, signore!</i>

1083
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:01,118
Think it'll be an early spring?

1084
01:18:01,368 --> 01:18:03,745
"Winter, slumbering in the open air

1085
01:18:03,996 --> 01:18:05,622
Wears on his smiling face...

1086
01:18:05,873 --> 01:18:08,083
...a dream of spring"

1087
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,376
Ciao!

1088
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:11,879
Ciao!

1089
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,251
How does she look?

1090
01:18:51,543 --> 01:18:52,628
Great.

1091
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,046
Thank you.

1092
01:18:54,254 --> 01:18:57,716
Did you know he could ice sculpt?

1093
01:19:11,772 --> 01:19:14,983
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

1094
01:19:15,943 --> 01:19:19,196
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so...

1095
01:19:25,118 --> 01:19:29,623
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.

1096
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,877
I have missed you so much.

1097
01:19:38,256 --> 01:19:41,802
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

1098
01:19:45,222 --> 01:19:47,140
I got to get going.

1099
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:50,060
It's good to see you, Phil.

1100
01:20:08,161 --> 01:20:09,621
Hello, father.

1101
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,082
Let's get you someplace warm.

1102
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:15,293
Remember me?

1103
01:20:22,134 --> 01:20:23,844
You brought the old man in?

1104
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,095
How is he?

1105
01:20:25,804 --> 01:20:27,806
He just passed away.

1106
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,602
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.

1107
01:20:32,853 --> 01:20:34,688
It was just his time.

1108
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:40,444
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

1109
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:42,446
You can't come in here.

1110
01:20:42,696 --> 01:20:45,323
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1111
01:20:54,499 --> 01:20:56,168
Where's the chart?

1112
01:20:56,668 --> 01:20:59,004
Sometimes people just die.

1113
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,381
Not today.

1114
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,979
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1115
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:20,108
Here you go.

1116
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:21,568
Thank you.

1117
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:27,073
Come on, dad.

1118
01:21:27,324 --> 01:21:28,700
Come on, pop.

1119
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,454
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1120
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:35,373
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1121
01:22:01,107 --> 01:22:03,777
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

1122
01:22:04,236 --> 01:22:07,614
...he saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

1123
01:22:07,864 --> 01:22:12,535
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

1124
01:22:12,786 --> 01:22:16,456
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

1125
01:22:16,706 --> 01:22:19,501
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

1126
01:22:20,585 --> 01:22:22,879
...I couldn't imagine a better fate...

1127
01:22:23,088 --> 01:22:26,049
...than a long and lustrous winter.

1128
01:22:26,299 --> 01:22:29,094
From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.

1129
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,637
So long.

1130
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,224
Nice speech. Very nice.

1131
01:22:34,474 --> 01:22:35,642
Thank you.

1132
01:22:36,977 --> 01:22:40,230
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.

1133
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,148
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

1134
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:44,442
I got to go.

1135
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:50,073
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

1136
01:22:50,323 --> 01:22:51,992
I surprise myself sometimes.

1137
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,202
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1138
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:58,373
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.

1139
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:04,045
Errands? What errands?

1140
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:06,506
I thought we were going back.

1141
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:26,985
What do you say?
What do you say?

1142
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:30,071
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1143
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,407
I'll see you tomorrow...

1144
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:33,742
...maybe.

1145
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:43,793
You totaled it.

1146
01:23:44,002 --> 01:23:48,131
- It's only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?

1147
01:23:49,507 --> 01:23:52,927
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake.

1148
01:23:53,136 --> 01:23:54,137
What is it?

1149
01:23:57,724 --> 01:23:59,809
Thank you, young man.

1150
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:03,313
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

1151
01:24:03,563 --> 01:24:06,191
Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.

1152
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:07,650
Who is that?

1153
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:10,653
He must be from the motor club.

1154
01:24:11,905 --> 01:24:14,574
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!

1155
01:24:14,824 --> 01:24:18,912
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1156
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:27,712
I think that did it.

1157
01:24:31,591 --> 01:24:34,469
If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.

1158
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:37,055
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1159
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:38,973
Who was that?

1160
01:24:39,182 --> 01:24:41,893
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1161
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:43,019
Eat, eat!

1162
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,983
<i>People don't understand...</i>

1163
01:24:49,192 --> 01:24:51,986
...what's involved.
This is an art form.

1164
01:24:52,237 --> 01:24:54,697
I think most people just think...

1165
01:24:54,948 --> 01:24:58,117
...that I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

1166
01:24:58,368 --> 01:25:00,662
There's a lot more to it than that.

1167
01:25:02,705 --> 01:25:06,209
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

1168
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:09,712
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

1169
01:25:09,963 --> 01:25:11,673
Great idea.
I'll go with you.

1170
01:25:11,923 --> 01:25:14,175
Let me just drop a tip here.

1171
01:25:20,223 --> 01:25:21,724
Hi! How are you?

1172
01:25:21,975 --> 01:25:23,768
Rita, this is Nancy.

1173
01:25:24,894 --> 01:25:27,146
We were going to the party.
You going?

1174
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,983
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1175
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:33,152
I think he's already in there.

1176
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:31,103
Isn't he good?

1177
01:27:31,354 --> 01:27:32,480
He's great!

1178
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,357
He's my student.

1179
01:27:36,984 --> 01:27:38,861
I'm so proud.

1180
01:27:40,029 --> 01:27:41,239
Thank you.

1181
01:27:42,406 --> 01:27:44,450
Hello, welcome to our party.

1182
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,953
I didn't know you could
play like that.

1183
01:27:47,203 --> 01:27:48,913
I'm versatile.

1184
01:27:56,295 --> 01:27:59,340
It's that nice young man
from the motor club.

1185
01:27:59,549 --> 01:28:01,050
Thank you again.

1186
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,718
It's nothing, ladies.

1187
01:28:02,969 --> 01:28:06,222
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1188
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,309
What was that all about?

1189
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,646
Don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.

1190
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:15,898
There you are!

1191
01:28:17,858 --> 01:28:21,070
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

1192
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,364
He would've choked for sure.

1193
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:27,326
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1194
01:28:27,577 --> 01:28:28,786
I owe you one, buddy.

1195
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:32,164
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.

1196
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:36,294
What did you do today?

1197
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,129
Same old, same old.

1198
01:28:43,884 --> 01:28:45,428
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1199
01:28:45,636 --> 01:28:47,221
Fred, how was the wedding?

1200
01:28:47,471 --> 01:28:50,474
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

1201
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,769
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

1202
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,229
You are the best.

1203
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:56,522
No, you are.

1204
01:28:56,772 --> 01:28:59,942
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1205
01:29:00,192 --> 01:29:04,030
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1206
01:29:04,488 --> 01:29:06,324
No way!

1207
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:09,702
Wrestle Mania!
No way!

1208
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:13,622
How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1209
01:29:13,873 --> 01:29:15,708
Thank you. You're a real pal.

1210
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,835
Oh, this is the best.

1211
01:29:22,631 --> 01:29:24,050
I don't understand.

1212
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,010
I guess not.

1213
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:29,263
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

1214
01:29:29,513 --> 01:29:31,348
You're the most popular
person in town.

1215
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:33,809
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

1216
01:29:34,018 --> 01:29:36,937
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1217
01:29:37,146 --> 01:29:39,231
He can help around the house again.

1218
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,942
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Felix.

1219
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,946
Dr. Connors?

1220
01:29:46,322 --> 01:29:48,657
It's kind of an honorary title.

1221
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:50,493
What is going on?

1222
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:51,744
I really don't know.

1223
01:29:51,994 --> 01:29:54,455
There is something
going on with you.

1224
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:56,999
You want the long or short version?

1225
01:29:57,249 --> 01:30:00,086
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1226
01:30:05,883 --> 01:30:07,885
Okay, folks, attention.

1227
01:30:08,677 --> 01:30:11,806
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.

1228
01:30:12,056 --> 01:30:14,517
All the eligible bachelors
come in front.

1229
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,268
And you ladies...

1230
01:30:16,519 --> 01:30:17,853
...you bid on them!

1231
01:30:18,103 --> 01:30:20,147
Do whatever you want with them...

1232
01:30:20,397 --> 01:30:21,982
...no questions asked!

1233
01:30:22,233 --> 01:30:25,319
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.

1234
01:30:25,528 --> 01:30:29,907
Get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's all for charity.

1235
01:30:32,076 --> 01:30:33,661
What are you doing down here?

1236
01:30:33,911 --> 01:30:35,412
Go on, get up there.

1237
01:30:35,621 --> 01:30:38,707
I got 10 bucks
that says you're mine.

1238
01:30:39,124 --> 01:30:41,043
Buster, I got your first victim.

1239
01:30:41,252 --> 01:30:43,921
Phil Connors, come on up here!

1240
01:30:48,968 --> 01:30:52,304
All right! Now, what am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1241
01:30:52,596 --> 01:30:54,014
Five dollars!

1242
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:56,183
The bidding has begun
at five dollars.

1243
01:30:56,475 --> 01:30:57,726
Ten dollars!

1244
01:30:57,935 --> 01:30:59,144
Fifteen!

1245
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,355
- Twenty!
- Twenty-five!

1246
01:31:01,564 --> 01:31:02,523
Thirty!

1247
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:04,525
- Thirty-five!
- Forty!

1248
01:31:04,733 --> 01:31:05,734
Forty-five!

1249
01:31:06,402 --> 01:31:07,444
Fifty!

1250
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:08,654
Fifty-five!

1251
01:31:08,862 --> 01:31:09,863
Sixty!

1252
01:31:10,072 --> 01:31:11,740
I'm bid $60.
Do I hear more?

1253
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:18,706
$339.88.

1254
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:26,463
We won't accept any more bids.
I think that's sold...

1255
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:30,384
...to the little lady for $339.88!

1256
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:32,886
Congratulations!

1257
01:31:40,978 --> 01:31:42,896
Okay, bachelors, who's next?

1258
01:31:53,324 --> 01:31:56,619
All right! Now, what am I
bid for this guy?

1259
01:31:56,827 --> 01:31:58,662
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1260
01:31:58,954 --> 01:32:00,205
Anybody?

1261
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:02,124
75 cents?

1262
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:04,126
I bid a two pence!

1263
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:07,129
Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

1264
01:32:07,338 --> 01:32:08,881
I got him!

1265
01:32:17,139 --> 01:32:19,850
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1266
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:22,561
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1267
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:24,063
I'll say.

1268
01:32:25,272 --> 01:32:27,232
I haven't seen him for 20 years.

1269
01:32:27,483 --> 01:32:32,529
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

1270
01:32:32,738 --> 01:32:35,657
...with the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

1271
01:32:35,908 --> 01:32:38,077
This is the best day of my life.

1272
01:32:38,327 --> 01:32:40,454
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

1273
01:32:40,662 --> 01:32:41,914
Where are we going?

1274
01:32:42,164 --> 01:32:43,874
Let's not spoil it.

1275
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:48,045
Let's not...
I got that.

1276
01:32:50,964 --> 01:32:52,382
Why can't I look?

1277
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:54,676
Because you bother me a lot.

1278
01:32:54,968 --> 01:32:56,345
I'm getting cold.

1279
01:32:56,553 --> 01:32:58,180
How long do I have to sit here?

1280
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:01,934
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1281
01:33:02,518 --> 01:33:04,853
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1282
01:33:05,687 --> 01:33:07,815
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.

1283
01:33:10,567 --> 01:33:11,985
Is it finished yet?

1284
01:33:12,861 --> 01:33:15,739
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

1285
01:33:15,948 --> 01:33:16,990
...then we can eat it.

1286
01:33:17,241 --> 01:33:19,910
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!

1287
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:21,787
One second, one second.

1288
01:33:22,037 --> 01:33:23,831
Let me turn it in the light.

1289
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:30,838
It's amazing.

1290
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:32,840
It's beautiful.

1291
01:33:37,136 --> 01:33:38,512
How did you do that?

1292
01:33:39,346 --> 01:33:43,141
I know your face so well,
I could've done it with my eyes closed.

1293
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:49,106
It's lovely.

1294
01:33:49,857 --> 01:33:51,692
I don't know what to say.

1295
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:54,111
I do.

1296
01:33:56,196 --> 01:33:58,490
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1297
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,617
...or for the rest of my life...

1298
01:34:00,826 --> 01:34:02,536
...I'm happy now...

1299
01:34:03,745 --> 01:34:05,330
...because I love you.

1300
01:34:06,248 --> 01:34:08,041
I think I'm happy too.

1301
01:35:06,725 --> 01:35:07,893
<i>Please. Not again.</i>

1302
01:35:08,101 --> 01:35:09,978
<i>- That's a great song.
- It's not.</i>

1303
01:35:10,228 --> 01:35:12,272
<i>Don't listen to this man...</i>

1304
01:35:12,856 --> 01:35:15,275
It's too early.

1305
01:35:25,994 --> 01:35:27,788
Something is different.

1306
01:35:28,413 --> 01:35:29,664
Good or bad?

1307
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,334
Anything different is good.

1308
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:37,089
But this could be real good.

1309
01:35:41,968 --> 01:35:43,387
Why are you here?

1310
01:35:43,845 --> 01:35:45,931
I bought you.
I own you.

1311
01:35:48,433 --> 01:35:50,018
But why are you still here?

1312
01:35:50,268 --> 01:35:53,355
You said, "Stay,"
so I stayed.

1313
01:35:56,024 --> 01:35:58,068
I said, "Stay,"
so you stayed.

1314
01:35:58,318 --> 01:36:00,862
I can't even make a collie stay.

1315
01:36:03,031 --> 01:36:05,033
I got to check something.

1316
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:07,202
Stay.

1317
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:08,745
Stay.

1318
01:36:14,376 --> 01:36:15,669
They're gone!

1319
01:36:16,586 --> 01:36:18,171
They're all gone.

1320
01:36:20,257 --> 01:36:22,968
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?

1321
01:36:24,302 --> 01:36:26,304
Today is tomorrow.

1322
01:36:26,888 --> 01:36:28,223
It happened.

1323
01:36:30,475 --> 01:36:32,727
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1324
01:36:36,898 --> 01:36:41,528
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.

1325
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:46,158
It was the end of a very long day.

1326
01:36:49,244 --> 01:36:53,039
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1327
01:36:53,915 --> 01:36:56,543
I'm sure I can think of something.

1328
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:31,661
It's so beautiful!

1329
01:37:42,297 --> 01:37:43,924
Let's live here.

1330
01:37:54,392 --> 01:37:56,436
We'll rent to start.

1331
01:41:01,037 --> 01:41:02,080
