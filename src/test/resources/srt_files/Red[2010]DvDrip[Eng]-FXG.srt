CYNTHlA: That's a file number.

331
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,067
You need to visit the back room.

332
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,598
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.

333
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:02,243
l didn't even know this place existed.

334
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,172
lt doesn't.

335
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:15,654
Ah.

336
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:20,492
Frank Moses' file.

337
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:34,536
You gotta be kidding me.

338
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:39,176
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black op agents we've ever had.

339
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:42,376
He retired drug-lords, terrorists.

340
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:44,612
Hell, he toppled governments.

341
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:49,986
Yeah. He was truly gifted.

342
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:52,327
Why was he retired?

343
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:53,725
He got old.

344
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:57,932
Then some thumb-sucker came along
and tagged him ''RED.' '

345
00:30:58,003 --> 00:30:58,992
Red?

346
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,029
Yeah. RED. R-E-D.
''Retired: Extremely Dangerous.' '

347
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:04,734
Yeah.

348
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:08,705
Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.

349
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:12,714
Thanks.

350
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,377
l'm gonna need a data haunt.

351
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:17,944
Every flak he was ever involved in.
Every agent he's ever run.

352
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:20,890
l want NSA telephone surveillance,
voice recognition.. .

353
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:28,088
FRANK: We have to find Marvin Boggs.

354
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,493
Marvin died two years ago in a fire.

355
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:33,503
Yeah. Marvin has died many times.

356
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:38,274
Oh, can we have that one?

357
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:05,536
Wow. All we need is a banjo.

358
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:07,970
(SHUSHlNG) Keep your voice down.

359
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,231
Don't make any sudden moves.

360
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,307
Just stay close to me.

361
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,641
-Don't use your cell phone.
-You took my cell phone.

362
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,739
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

363
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:18,840
Seriously?

364
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,147
Why are you trying to kill me?

365
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:25,048
l'm not trying to kill you!

366
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,215
Oh, yeah. You are.

367
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:27,719
Why would l be trying to kill you?

368
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:30,360
Because the last time we met,
l tried to kill you.

369
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:31,656
That was a long time ago.

370
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,164
Some people hold on to things like that.

371
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,928
l'm not trying to kill you.

372
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,427
Okay?

373
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:42,633
So that makes us friends.

374
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:43,965
Right?

375
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,799
Right.

376
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,136
Good.

377
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,743
You wanna take that knife
out of my balls now?

378
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,080
Who is she?

379
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:00,757
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

380
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,156
Yeah. Hi.

381
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:04,753
l don't stay in the open.

382
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,792
Come on, l'll show you the house.

383
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,163
What's that?

384
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:14,329
Decoy.

385
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:20,503
He lives in a car?

386
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,376
Come on in.

387
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,889
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

388
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,829
Let's put it this way.

389
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:46,231
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

390
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,568
and l could feel their eyes on me.

391
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:53,340
Wet like peaches.

392
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,211
l have a list here.

393
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,350
lt was written by a reporter who's now dead.

394
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,046
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

395
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:04,778
Well, almost everyone.

396
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,686
Frank, how many times have l told you?

397
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,921
You cannot trust the system!

398
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:16,256
l told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

399
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:20,033
Man, satellites, cell phones,

400
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:24,498
chips, net, the web, the dentist.. .

401
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:25,736
Marvin!

402
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:31,040
That list is the one we need help with.

403
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:33,613
Yeah, l gotta check the files.

404
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:36,081
FRANK: Of course you do. Thanks, man.

405
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:41,716
Wow.

406
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,762
This guy's insane.

407
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:51,024
Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

408
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:52,296
This'll take a minute.

409
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:53,731
Sure.

410
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:55,864
As it turns out,

411
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:01,274
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 1 1 years.

412
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,607
-ln that case, he looks great. Yeah.
-Fantastic.

413
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,677
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981 .

414
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:14,183
Five of the guys on this list were there,
not including us.

415
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,921
San Benito. Just outside.

416
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:18,420
lnjun territory.

417
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:22,555
Yeah. Was a little village.
Everybody was killed. Civilians.

418
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:24,431
They told us, ''Go in there. Clean it up.

419
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:26,265
''Make it look like it never happened.' '

420
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:29,029
You think everyone on this list was there?

421
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:31,767
Damn it.

422
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,335
Damn it!

423
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:36,075
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

424
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:39,276
They're all trying to kill us?

425
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:40,849
Exactly!

426
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:43,820
ls there anybody still alive on that list?

427
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:46,924
Gabriel Singer.

428
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,285
Frank!

429
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,122
l never thought l'd say this again.

430
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,126
l am getting the pig!

431
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,631
Who's she talking to?

432
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:05,370
Just take it easy.

433
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,504
Frank, we gotta get rid of this broad.

434
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,308
l know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

435
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:13,380
We're not getting rid of the broad.

436
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:15,313
l like her. Okay?

437
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,947
What's the angle?

438
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,252
No angle. l like her.

439
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:25,720
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

440
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,363
probably right now,

441
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,659
install the recognition software
and back-trace it to Singer.

442
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:33,761
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

443
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:35,829
and we're fried with Y-rays.

444
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:39,569
How you doing?

445
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:41,539
Good, fine.

446
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,647
November niner 7 45.

447
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:56,285
Wow.
Singer is going to be in Mobile tomorrow.

448
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,055
We can catch him at the airfreight terminal.

449
00:36:58,463 --> 00:36:59,452
How about that?

450
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:11,403
MAN ON PA: <i>The Sunset Limited</i>

00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,058
Marvin! Whoa!

461
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:42,163
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

No camera in the bag.

00:37:57,555 --> 00:37:59,819
Go, ma'am, now. Now.

Try not to kill anyone.

470
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,731
She was following us, Frank.

471
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:27,079
Sorry.

472
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,981
''She has a camera in her purse,
we have to kill her?''

473
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,091
Seriously?

474
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:41,889
See you in a minute.

475
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:47,995
Gabriel?

476
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:50,765
Right? Gabriel Singer?

477
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:53,467
What's this about?

478
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:57,342
Guatemala. 1981 . San Benito.

479
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:58,473
l can't talk to you.

480
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:05,778
Pair beats ace.

481
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:09,557
<i>l got one for you.</i>

482
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:13,157
What did this twice-decorated,
west Texas Jew-boy Marine pilot

483
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,426
say to the Chinese
<i>New York Times</i> reporter?

484
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,558
l give up.

485
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:19,603
Nothing. l didn't tell her a damn thing.

486
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,135
The reporter's dead now.

487
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,768
And everyone she spoke to is either dead
or a target.

488
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:26,136
That includes you.

489
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,036
Oh, Christ.

490
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,678
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

491
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:37,647
Hairy little airstrip in the middle of nowhere.

492
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:41,282
He was ClA,

This gonna be a problem?

1312
01:42:55,115 --> 01:42:56,275
No.

1314

Grandpa.

(GUNSHOT)

1316
01:43:12,633 --> 01:43:13,691
Feel better now?

1317
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:15,059
Yeah.

1318
01:43:15,736 --> 01:43:17,499
Wanna get pancakes?

1319
01:43:20,608 --> 01:43:23,270
Can you believe it? lt all worked out.

1320
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:26,947
Something bad is gonna happen very soon.

1321
01:43:27,615 --> 01:43:29,776
Maybe not. Wait a second.

1322
01:43:30,818 --> 01:43:32,183
Nobody's chasing us.

1323
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:35,614
No one's trying to kill us.

1324
01:43:36,557 --> 01:43:39,117
l think we just got our lives back.

1325
01:43:40,094 --> 01:43:41,356
Almost.

1326
01:43:42,796 --> 01:43:45,060
You still owe me a small favor.

1327
01:43:45,132 --> 01:43:46,224
Oh, lvan!

1328
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:48,925
His timing is terrible.

1329
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:51,497
You gave a favor to him?

1330
01:43:52,473 --> 01:43:55,533
Just a tiny little nuclear problem
in Moldova.

1331
01:43:57,511 --> 01:43:58,603
Can we go?

1332
01:44:02,349 --> 01:44:03,873
Yes. We can go.

1333
01:44:34,682 --> 01:44:36,980
l told you
something bad was gonna happen.

1334
01:44:37,184 --> 01:44:38,515
Keep your dress on.

1335
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:42,182
Moldova sucks.

1336
01:44:42,389 --> 01:44:43,879
Moldova sucks!

1337
01:44:45,492 --> 01:44:47,790
Next time,
your girlfriend can wear the dress.
