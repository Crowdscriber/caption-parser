PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces</i> <i>of the United States</i>

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,698
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:13,697
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the the town of Lockerbie.</i>

5
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,161
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned</i>
<i>acts of terror</i>

6
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,829
<i>in Africa, Europe,</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

7
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:20,465
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand,</i>
<i>this</i> <i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,201
<i>REAGAN:</i> <i>This relentless
pursuit</i> <i>of terror.</i>

9
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:23,837
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

10
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:25,343
REPORTER:
<i>The</i> USS Cole <i>was attacked</i>

11
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:26,542
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

12
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,509
This was an act of terrorism.

13
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:31,008
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

14
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,343
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

15
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:34,511
is one of the good old
favorites.

16
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,917
Until something stops him.

17
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:39,986
WOMAN: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,554
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

19
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:47,188
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

20
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:50,893
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

21

22

SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,007
God!

24
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,010
CARRIE: <i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

25
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:06,812
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,214
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

27
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:11,915
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

28

CARRIE:
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland:

BRODY: <i>I appreciate you</i>
<i>looking out for Jessica.</i>

31
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,865
Like you did while I was gone.

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,802
You were my friend! You...

33
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:35,870
Carrie here.

34
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:37,038
It's me.

35
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:38,073
Where are you?

36
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:39,541
I'm taking some time,

37
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,576
from home.

38
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,215
CARRIE:
<i>I know I have oatmeal,</i>

39
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:49,385
but no Yorkshire Gold out here
in the sticks. Sorry.

40
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,053
How do you know
the tea I drink?

41
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,654
<i>Did you spy on me?</i>

42
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,756
You are a spy, right?

43
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,226
You're telling me the fucking CIA
thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda?

44
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,395
I think you're working
for al-Qaeda.

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,331
We have a deal with Aileen.
What did she tell you?

46
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:07,766
They were just told to buy the
house, go about their business

47
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,934
till a visitor arrived.

48
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,435
Which he did on Monday.

49
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,237
She's sitting with a sketch
artist right now.

50
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,439
Ask me anything.

51
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:16,741
Why did they kill
Walker and not you?

52
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:19,310
I killed him.

53
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:23,281
SAUL: Galvez, you up there?
Affirmative.

54
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,150
Face the airport, Galvez.

55
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:26,985
We're looking for

56
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,453
direct targets.

57
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,457
GALVEZ:
Reserve M-1.

58
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,494
SAUL: <i>That's a landing pad</i>
<i>for Marine 1.</i>

59
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:37,262
Oh, shit.

60
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,598
A mile is well within
a sniper's range.

61
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:41,132
An expert sniper.

62
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,368
Saul.

63
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,369
We were wrong about Brody.

64
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:47,037
A P.O.W. was turned,

65
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:50,206
<i>but it wasn't him.</i>

66
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:53,209
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.

67
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:55,445
He's alive.

68
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,147
He's the terrorist.

69
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:09,125
Yo.

70
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,895
Homeless vet here.

71
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:16,499
Hey, I fought your war.

72
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:18,401
Iraq-- ring a bell?

73
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:22,038
Hey, come on, man.

74
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm hungry.

75
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,941
Ma'am, ma'am?

76
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,012
Ma'am?

77
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:33,114
Nah.

78
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:37,519
Thank you. God bless you.

79
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,390
God bless the little children.

80
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:44,059
Thank you, little man.

81
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:49,230
All right, all right.

82
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,514
Yo.

83
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:07,616
Hungry here.

84
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:51,260
ESTES:
Is this the man you saw?

85
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,794
Your father?

86
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:56,999
Is this your office?

87
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,268
Yeah, yeah, this is my office.

88
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:02,771
I thought you were a spy.

89
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:06,174
I guess, in a--
in a way.

90
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,945
How can you spy on anyone
sitting in here?

91
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,846
Lucas, Lucas, come on.

92
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:13,849
Just... What did we agree?

93
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:15,684
That everything
had to be secret.

94
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,319
Right, and what else?

95
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:18,921
You get to ask
your questions first.

96
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:21,157
(clicking tongue)

97
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,960
Why'd you do that?
Touch your nose?

98
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:28,598
HELEN: He told me he'd seen
his father at school.

99
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,934
Watching him through
the chain link.

100
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,703
It never occurred to me
it could actually be true.

101
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:36,339
Tom was dead.

102
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,507
That's what they told me.

103
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:38,875
I know it's a lot to deal with.

104
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,344
You think?

105
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,979
For years I pray Tom's alive.

106
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:46,316
Now you tell me he is, but he's
turned into some kind of monster?

107
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,051
I didn't say that.
Yes, you did.

108
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:50,653
"Brainwashed." That was
the word you used.

109
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,855
Planning an attack
on his own country.

110
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,692
That's what we believe.

111
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:59,363
So I don't know whether
I should be celebrating

112
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:02,199
or putting my son and
I into witness protection.

113
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:06,204
What we need to do is find him
before anything happens.

114
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:07,672
You can help with that.

115
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:12,577
How could he be alive
all these years and not call?

116
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,648
When you say he's changed,

117
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:20,986
that's the only reason
I believe you.

118
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,755
ESTES:
Carrie?

119
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,426
Will you send in
Mrs. Walker, please?

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,095
He needs your help in there.

121
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,363
Do you think you can do that?

122
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,685
In Germany you said Walker
died in the middle of the night.

123
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,821
He was killed, yes.

124
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:00,761
Beaten to death?

125
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,430
I didn't see it.
I heard it.

126
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,798
But it was pretty clear.

127
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,299
Then they made you bury him?

128
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,235
Yeah, outside the compound.

129
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,704
Just like I said in my original
debrief and a hundred times since.

130
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,107
So you want to tell me
what this is all about?

131
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,876
I'm just reconfirming.

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,880
Oh, that's why they told me to
drop everything and rush in here.

133
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,281
Well, his wife--

134
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:26,486
widow-- she's trying
to close the file.

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,421
Just trying to oblige.

136
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:31,157
Like I said,

137
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:33,026
mostly we were kept apart.

138
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:38,131
All I know for sure
is he's dead.

139
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,505
Thanks.
I got what I need.

140
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,140
Thanks very much.

141
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,451
I didn't say anything.

142
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,920
Oh, so it's just a coincidence
that I've been dragged in here

143
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:02,190
to go over Tom Walker's death just two
days after I told you I killed him?

144
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,592
I didn't tell them what you
said. I would never do that.

145
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,994
Then why am I here?

146
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,763
I can't say.

147
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:11,032
Oh, sure, of course not.
I can't.

148
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,100
You know, for somebody
who lies all the time,

149
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,802
I'd think you'd be better at it.

150
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:16,004
Brody...

151
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,539
Oh, please, just stop.

152
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,641
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:22,611
Fucking me to get information,

154
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:25,148
is that part
of the job description?

155
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,350
Or do you get a promotion
for showing initiative?

156
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,059
What was that about?

157
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:40,630
Nothing.

158
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:44,700
He's mad about having to answer
the same questions over and over.

159
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,203
Okay.

160
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,706
He is. What?

161
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,177
I think I got a lead
on Tom Walker. Interested?

162
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,646
Come on.

163
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,543
They called me back to Langley.

164
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:31,215
To answer more questions
about Tom again.

165
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,718
You don't have to explain
where you were.

166
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,193
Jess,

167
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,597
you have every right
to be mad at me.

168
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,433
I know I've been impossible.

169
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:51,703
And I know I can't just vanish for
two days without hurting you all.

170
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:53,438
After eight years,
what's two more days?

171
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,740
What's that supposed to mean?

172
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,542
You don't even care?
Because I do.

173
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,277
(sighs)

174
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:10,557
Brody, I hung on for six years.

175
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,863
Six years after they told
me you were dead.

176
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,268
Six years after a Marine
came to the door

177
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,570
and said they were going
to start paying death benefits.

178
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:27,674
I waited for you

179
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,578
because I wanted so much
for you to be alive.

180
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:34,948
Then I screwed up.

181
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:38,785
I didn't wait long enough.
I screwed up.

182
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,621
But I can't keep
paying for that.

183
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,957
You don't have to.
(sobbing) I can't.

184
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:47,995
Damn it.

185
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,464
(sniffles)
Chris will be home soon.

186
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,299
It's not your fault.

187
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,301
None of it is.

188
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,307
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

189
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,946
And I don't want
everything to fall apart.

190
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:19,692
Remember what you
said about Walker

191
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:23,997
when we found out he was
watching his son?

192
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,968
You said his family
was his Achilles heel.

193
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:31,672
That's what got me thinking about this.
About what, exactly?

194
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,474
His son spots him at school.

195
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:37,043
I thought maybe he'd try some
other form of contact.

196
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:38,244
Well, I think he did.

197
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,713
Okay, press "Enter."
It's right there.

198
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:42,548
Okay...

199
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,017
Phone records?
Helen Walker's phone records.

200
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,518
Galvez got 'em for me.

201
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,320
Turns out there's something
very interesting about them.

202
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,655
Look at the time stamps.

203
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,725
8:10, 8:08, 8:14, 8:11.

204
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,194
All on weekdays.

205
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:58,230
Made from various
disposable cell phones.

206
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,402
S-So wait, Walker's been
talking to his wife?

207
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:05,072
No. That's the point.

208
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:07,374
At 8:00 a.m. she takes
the kid to school.

209
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,043
The calls come in
when she's not there.

210
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,445
Listen.
What is it?

211
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,884
(phone ringing on speaker)
Just listen.

212
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,956
RECORDING: Hey, this is Lucas.
And Helen.

213
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,624
LUCAS: Please leave a message
after the tone,

214
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:27,193
with your name and address,
and the time you called,

215
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,061
and the date,
and why you called,

216
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,729
and for who, and when...

217
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,030
HELEN:
And we'll call you back.

218
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,066
LUCAS:
Depending on your answers.

219
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,804
His Achilles heel.

220
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,142
He calls just to
hear their voices.

221
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,577
(door opens)

222
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,446
Who does?

223
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,948
You can say;
he's cleared.

224
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,883
This is Special Agent Hall,

225
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:52,053
our FBI liaison on
the Walker task force.

226
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,889
That phone message.

227
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,458
It's Walker's wife Helen
and his son Lucas.

228
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:59,394
He calls when he knows
they won't be there. Why?

229
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,329
Well, like Saul said,
just to hear their voices

230
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,597
on the answering machine.
To feel like he still belongs.

231
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,333
This is how we find Walker.

232
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,069
We get Helen to
pick up one morning.

233
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,404
She draws him out
while we track the GPS.

234
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:13,173
Well, how is her state of mind?
Think she can handle it?

235
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,576
I can get her there.
HALL: That's your plan?

236
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,945
You wait for him to call
and then cross your fingers

237
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:19,613
that the wife doesn't
sink this whole mess

238
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,015
by saying something
she shouldn't?

239
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:24,151
I mean, we have
a critical situation here.

240
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:27,121
A Marine sniper
turned by Abu Nazir,

241
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:29,690
on U.S. soil, targeting his own country.
CARRIE: Yeah.

242
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,359
That's what <i>we</i> told <i>you.</i>

243
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,028
Agent Hall has
a suggestion how to proceed.

244
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,696
I was just telling
the Assistant Director

245
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,300
exactly how we tracked
down Whitey Bulger.

246
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,702
Right. You put ads on TV.
We took the lead.

247
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,505
We enlisted the public.

248
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,140
What I'm saying is
there's things to do

249
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:46,009
besides sitting here,
waiting for him to call us.

250
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:47,644
Like you did with Whitey Bulger?

251
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,014
Exactly.
Who it took you 20 years to find?

252
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:52,951
Okay. So, uh,
we all know each other.

253
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,885
Walker's out there,
we need to find him fast.

254
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,520
Assess what our
approach should be,

255
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:59,323
I'd like a recommendation
on my desk in two hours.

256
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:01,759
Now, Agent Hall...

257
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,634
(phone ringing)

258
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:13,336
Somebody gonna get that?

259
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,737
How about you?
I'm not getting it,

260
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,006
I'm winning. DANA: Not anymore.

261
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,541
Watch this.

262
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,644
DANA: Whoa! Well, I'm out.
I'll get it.

263
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:23,846
Where are all these aces coming from?
I don't know.

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,148
DANA:
I'm good at this game.

265
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,716
Hello?

266
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,017
Mrs. Gaines.

267
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,187
All right... Elizabeth.

268
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,722
Uh-huh.
Yes, of course.

269
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,091
Who's Mrs. Gaines?

270
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,527
You know. That lady at church
with the chauffeur.

271
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:42,064
What's a chauffeur again?
Like, one of those little dogs?

272
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:46,001
I swear to God, you're like
a half idiot, half moron.

273
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:47,403
Dana.

274
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:48,671
Well, seriously.

275
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,773
I'll ask.

276
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,445
She says she invited us
to a party tomorrow night.

277
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,215
Oh, she did. I forgot
to get back to her.

278
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,384
I'm supposed to tell you
we're gonna look back on it

279
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,618
as the party of the year.

280
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:03,420
What does that mean?

281
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,659
I don't know.
Do you want to go?

282
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:11,729
We don't have to.

283
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:13,030
DANA:
Are you guys joking?

284
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:16,734
Elizabeth Gaines promises
the party of the year,

285
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:18,403
and you're actually thinking
about not going?

286
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,875
Well, I'm going if you're not.

287
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,310
Okay.

288
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,212
Uh, we'd love to.

289
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:30,447
Thank you.

290
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,217
Wow.

291
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:35,619
Thank you very much.

292
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,054
She's sending a car.

293
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,257
Around 7:00.
A car?

294
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,061
Dad, when something
good happens,

295
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:45,163
you just gotta
learn to say yes.

296
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:50,235
I've never heard
you say anything

297
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,937
remotely nice about Elizabeth.

298
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:54,439
How come we suddenly have to
go to one of her parties?

299
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,441
'Cause the alternative is
sitting here watching you pack.

300
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:57,842
I have to.

301
00:15:57,877 --> 00:15:59,111
No, you don't.

302
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,413
I leave the day after tomorrow.

303
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,081
You don't have to leave,
that's my point.

304
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,083
All your friends will be there.

305
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,252
I know.

306
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:09,653
You can explain to them.

307
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,189
The necessity of this
precipitous departure.

308
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:14,091
Saul... 'Cause I can't,
for the life of me,

309
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,593
after 25 years together?
I don't understand.

310
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:17,028
Is this how you're going to be?

311
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,830
Because I can't take
a whole evening of it.

312
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:20,765
I'm going to be this way
whether we go out or not.

313
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,334
The difference is at Elizabeth's
they'll be serving champagne.

314
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,004
(doorbell rings) Okay. We go.
For old times' sake.

315
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,672
But my flight does
leave the next morning.

316
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:29,042
Right.
And I'm going to be on it.

317
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,044
Right, right, right, right.
I heard you.

318
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:35,315
What?

319
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:37,117
Are you okay?

320
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,552
I'm a little busy, actually.

321
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:41,354
Can I come in?

322
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:53,301
Estes put me in charge
of the task force.

323
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:55,303
Congratulations.
Yeah, to you.

324
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,305
It was on your recommendation.

325
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,507
And because of the phone idea,
which was also yours

326
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,910
but somehow became mine when
you handed it to me today.

327
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:04,146
(sighs)

328
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,481
This can't wait?

329
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:07,884
No.

330
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,554
Saul, you look out for me.

331
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,523
You always have...

332
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:15,724
and...

333
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,727
You saw me arguing with
Brody earlier today.

334
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:23,764
I wasn't honest
with you about that.

335
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,733
Yeah.

336
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,901
I kind of got that.

337
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:33,173
When the surveillance on
Brody was shut down...

338
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,542
I contacted him.

339
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:39,612
Personally.

340
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:42,749
(whispering):
How personally?

341
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:47,187
At a support group first.

342
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:51,190
And then we saw each other.

343
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:52,992
A few times.

344
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,297
Look, I was chasing
the wrong guy.

345
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,733
"Chasing," good word for it.

346
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,203
Well, it's...

347
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:07,639
it's moot, now.
It's over.

348
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,810
It should never have happened.

349
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:15,780
Do you get that?

350
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:18,583
Yeah, I do.

351
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:21,020
Why else would I be here?

352
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:26,759
And like I said, it's over.

353
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,167
You okay?

354
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:36,569
Yeah, I'll survive.

355
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:41,741
Well, with any luck Tom Walker
calls his wife tomorrow morning,

356
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,810
we track him down and
we're all heroes by noon.

357
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,478
(scoffs)

358
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,149
Come on.

359
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:51,450
Get some sleep.

360
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:53,485
See you tomorrow.

361
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,628
(cell phone ringing)

362
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:04,631
Saul. We're good here.

363
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,766
The son's just
leaving for school.

364
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:07,868
Helen Walker?

365
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:09,369
She seems okay.

366
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:11,671
I was about to give her
a last-minute pep talk.

367
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:13,340
Great. We're good to go then.

368
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,276
You sound jazzed.

369
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,444
Better than last night, anyway.

370
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,446
I was weaned on
inter-agency noncooperation.

371
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,049
Nothing makes me happier than
seeing the FBI stand around

372
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,318
with their dicks in their hands,
watching us work.

373
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:27,389
Lovely.

374
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,662
They're ready to
trace the call.

375
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,297
If it's even him.

376
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,866
It will be.

377
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,633
When he calls,
you need to engage him.

378
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:39,868
Keep him talking.

379
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,470
So you can find him.

380
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,205
So we can help him.

381
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,808
Is that what everyone on
this task force is saying,

382
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,377
"let's help Tom Walker"?

383
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:49,479
Helen, it's important
you understand.

384
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,882
He hasn't done anything
wrong, not yet.

385
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,850
We're all working
to keep it that way.

386
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,655
(phone rings)

387
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,692
Okay, we're a little early here.
Are you set?

388
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:06,729
Talk to me. What the hell
sort of trace is that?

389
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:08,898
Wild routing through
a series of numbers.

390
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:12,068
Two continents so far.
Okay, just hit Mumbai.

391
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,170
She needs to pick up
before it goes to voicemail.

392
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:15,738
Helen.

393
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,074
(phone rings)
Helen, you need to get that.

394
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,346
(phone rings)

395
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:30,052
Hello?

396
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:32,121
WOMAN:
Hi. This is Diane.

397
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,725
Do you need your carpets professionally steam-cleaned?
Okay, cut this, please.

398
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,259
DIANE: Well, we have a special
offer just for you.

399
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:40,195
Right now you can get
up to five rooms

400
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,363
professi...
Cut it.

401
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,732
Thank you.
Reset, please.

402
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,376
(sobbing)

403
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,945
There, see?
You can do it.

404
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,381
I can't. I don't even
know what to say.

405
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:01,149
He misses you.
And Lucas.

406
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:02,717
That's why he calls.

407
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:05,119
You need to show him you
feel the same way. How?

408
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:08,156
By saying I gave up,
got remarried? No.

409
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,058
By saying you've
told Lucas about him,

410
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,960
you've shown him pictures,

411
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:14,563
enough that he actually
recognized him.

412
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:17,133
You've kept him alive
in your son's thoughts.

413
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:20,603
When Tom calls...

414
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:23,006
tell him that.

415
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:29,179
(phone ringing)

416
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,456
Hello?

417
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:45,594
(click)

418
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,995
(dial tone buzzes)

419
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,300
Fuck. He hung up.

420
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,669
I don't see any GPS data.
Tell me we have something.

421
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:57,639
Signal originated at cell towers
in northeast D.C.

422
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,608
Call was most likely made
within a mile of there.

423
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:01,944
So what do we have on
street cams in the area?

424
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:04,012
Ivy City, coverage is sketchy.

425
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:05,380
Well, let's see it, come on.

426
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,617
Where's facial recognition?

427
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:11,086
There you go.
Again.

428
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:44,854
Chris. What are you doing?

429
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,857
I don't want to miss the car.

430
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:50,060
It's a hired driver,
he'll come to the door.

431
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:52,229
It's not like he's trying
to avoid detection.

432
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:56,066
Have you noticed?

433
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,502
What?

434
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:01,637
They're not fighting.

435
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,876
CHRIS:
He's here.

436
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,678
Mom! Dad!

437
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:11,446
The driver's here!

438
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:14,750
Sweet! Come on,
check it out!

439
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:25,393
So. How do we look?

440
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:28,864
Swear to God,
I must be adopted.

441
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:31,300
(laughs)

442
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:42,342
You look beautiful.

443
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:48,548
You can stop staring now.

444
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:50,116
I'm not.
Yes, you are.

445
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,584
I can feel it.

446
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:55,755
So do you, by the way.
You look handsome.

447
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:59,159
Who's gonna tell me that when
you're halfway around the world?

448
00:24:01,363 --> 00:24:04,766
We're chasing this guy at work.

449
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,170
20 of us from Langley
plus the FBI.

450
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,605
He's got this fatal flaw,

451
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,007
this weakness
we're trying to exploit.

452
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,609
Carrie calls it
his "Achilles heel."

453
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:14,777
What is it?

454
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:19,848
He loves his wife.

455
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:33,961
♪ Let someone start
believing in you ♪

456
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:36,931
♪ Let him hold out his hand ♪

457
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:39,367
♪ Let him touch you... ♪

458
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:40,769
Hi, there.

459
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,838
♪ And watch what happens ♪

460
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,272
There she is.

461
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:46,774
(indistinct conversations)

462
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:47,975
Oh, will you excuse me?

463
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,479
Sure. Okay.

464
00:24:50,513 --> 00:24:52,814
Saul, Mira.

465
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:57,051
Good to see you two
together, finally.

466
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,719
It must be great to have
her back.

467
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,054
I hope she never leaves.

468
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:03,724
He's even crankier than usual
when you're gone.

469
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,727
Do us a favor,
stay put this year.

470
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:10,030
Is that Vivian?

471
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:11,998
Excuse me.

472
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:14,333
Well...

473
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:16,670
did I accidentally hit a nerve?

474
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:18,672
Accidentally?

475
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:21,542
I doubt it.

476
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:25,179
Well, I may have heard rumors.

477
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,248
Oh, my God! Look at them.

478
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:30,518
Excuse me.

479
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,255
Don't you look lovely.

480
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:34,723
Thank you.

481
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,925
Thank you for sending the car.
You didn't have to.

482
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,094
Oh, well, I wanted to be sure

483
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:40,362
you actually made
an appearance.

484
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:41,897
Saul?

485
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:44,100
Do you know Saul?

486
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:47,237
Yes. Yes, we've met.

487
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,705
A couple times.

488
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:49,773
This is my wife Jessica.

489
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,675
Saul Berenson.
Hi.

490
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:53,109
The bar's through there.

491
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:54,777
Grab a drink and
I'll introduce you around.

492
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:56,846
Thank you.
Thanks.

493
00:25:58,582 --> 00:26:01,117
♪ ♪

494
00:26:03,954 --> 00:26:05,888
Elizabeth...

495
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:09,091
you have that look.

496
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:12,896
Well, they are perfect,
aren't they?

497
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,066
SAUL:
For what? What are you up to?

498
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,801
You've been poking around
about Brody

499
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:21,572
ever since he became the
poster child for D.O.D.

500
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:23,907
You have some plan
in the works for him.

501
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,910
Oh, I have a plan for
everyone, you know that.

502
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:28,479
You're grooming him.

503
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:30,714
For what exactly?

504
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:33,283
By the end of the evening
you just might find out.

505
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:46,763
(sighs)

506
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,332
All tucked in...
finally.

507
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:52,501
I've never heard so many
reasons not to go to bed.

508
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:53,969
Oh, he's not even asleep yet.

509
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,738
Matt's up there reading
to him right now.

510
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:58,342
He seems very devoted
to your son, Matt does.

511
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,744
You were lucky to find him.

512
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,280
Yeah, I was, very.

513
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:09,421
And despite everything,

514
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:13,291
being married to Tom,
that was lucky, too.

515
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:18,764
I mean having him in my life,

516
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:21,033
those years before he left.

517
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:27,839
What about you?

518
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,941
Me?

519
00:27:29,975 --> 00:27:31,309
Who's in your life?

520
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:38,684
Oh, I met somebody.

521
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:42,222
But I don't think
it's gonna work out.

522
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:49,330
BRODY: <i>So that's what</i>
<i>we're tasked with, my squad,</i>

523
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,499
to safeguard this,
this artwork,

524
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:52,834
I guess you'd call it.

525
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:56,171
It's in the one
presidential palace

526
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:58,240
that's still held by the enemy.

527
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,975
So we shoot our way
into the palace,

528
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,645
we engage multiple targets
down this long hall.

529
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,214
We finally get into the
room where this is,

530
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:09,417
this-this national treasure
we've risked our lives for,

531
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:12,353
this solid gold bust
of Saddam...

532
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:15,356
and somebody's already replaced
it with a Mr. Potato Head.

533
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,125
(all laugh)

534
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,168
Will you excuse me, gentlemen,
for one second?

535
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:28,204
Sure.
Thank you.

536
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:30,072
Would you excuse me?

537
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:36,779
Okay, I have to ask.

538
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,414
I know what you're gonna say.

539
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:40,049
So I'm not imagining.
Everyone's...

540
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,385
being really nice to us, yes.

541
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,088
It's weird. And that guy...

542
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:49,725
Head of the Democratic
National Committee.

543
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,561
His wife practically jumped me.

544
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:53,596
She said, "I want you
to think of me..."

545
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,931
"...of me as
your new best friend"?

546
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:55,965
Exactly.

547
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,933
What's going on?

548
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:00,069
I don't know.

549
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:02,471
(chuckles)

550
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:03,705
Want to get some air?

551
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,007
Yes.

552
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:14,083
What are you thinking about?

553
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:17,586
I'm thinking about
all the things

554
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,389
that happen in people's lives...

555
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:23,960
that pull them together
or split them apart.

556
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:27,830
The million little events,

557
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,999
coincidences...

558
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,802
the outside forces.

559
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:38,007
Mira leaves tomorrow, right?

560
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,246
I've been there myself, Saul.

561
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
Three times.

562
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:48,416
I know what it looks like,

563
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,918
what it feels like.

564
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,354
If you ever need
to talk to somebody,

565
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:58,027
believe it or not,
I'm a good listener.

566
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:10,074
You know, you were asking what
Brody's being groomed for.

567
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,210
You're about to find out.

568
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,812
Make yourself useful.

569
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,114
Get the Brodys to the library.

570
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,820
REPORTER (on TV): Capitol Hill is
calculating the political fallout

571
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,555
following the press conference

572
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,224
by Eighth District Congressman
Richard Johnson

573
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,159
caught in
a sexting scandal, sending nude

574
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,794
and seminude pictures
of himself

575
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,130
to a number of
Congressional interns,

576
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,200
charges he vehemently denies.

577
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,036
This is a setup, a persecution.

578
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,505
The facts will show these
accusations

579
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,841
to be completely without merit.

580
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,078
My wife and I are gonna get
through this together.

581
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:51,550
And no, I have absolutely no
intention of deserting

582
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:55,321
my office or the voters
who put me there.

583
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,390
REPORTER: The Congressman pledged
to disprove the allegations

584
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,892
and serve out his term.

585
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:00,993
House Minority Leader

586
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,596
Ellen Randall expressed
disappointment

587
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,566
at the news and has called
for an Ethics Committee

588
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,336
investigation to determine
whether any other violation...

589
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,771
He'll be gone in two days.

590
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,607
I have an idea who
might replace him.

591
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:16,875
The impact of the scandal
on Johnson's status

592
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,078
as Chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee.

593
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:22,214
The Congressman has been
a fierce opponent

594
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:25,050
of the administration's efforts
to allocate more funding

595
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,919
for unmanned surveillance

596
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,221
and drone strikes in
the Middle East.

597
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,560
(chuckles)

598
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:37,596
"Dick Johnson?" Really?

599
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,531
That's his name.

600
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,933
Well, he should think
about changing it

601
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:45,036
if he's gonna be doing
stuff like that!

602
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,373
You're drunk.

603
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,242
Not as drunk as I bet Dick
Johnson is right now!

604
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,677
(both laugh)

605
00:31:57,284 --> 00:32:00,287
You saw how everyone
was looking at you, right?

606
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:02,088
They were looking at you.

607
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:03,957
They were looking at you.

608
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:13,802
This was a... really nice
date, Sergeant Brody.

609
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:18,339
You showed me
a really good time.

610
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,781
Dick Johnson.
(chuckles)

611
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,136
Wow. My feet are killing me.
Oh, shh!

612
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,537
(TV playing)

613
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:50,938
How was it?

614
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:52,440
Fancy.

615
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,976
You guys said you'd be
in bed by 11:00.

616
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:56,678
It's <i>Ice Age,</i> Mom.

617
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,515
I think I missed this one.

618
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:01,117
Not one. You missed,
like, three.

619
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:03,119
What's wrong with the elephant?

620
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:04,688
It's a woolly mammoth, Dad.

621
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:06,523
Shh!

622
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:09,127
(sighs) Here. Move over.
I'm coming in.

623
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,195
(groans)

624
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,232
(sighs) Your arm okay?

625
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,900
Hmm...

626
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:20,472
Mmm, popcorn.

627
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,374
I'll have some of that.

628
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,377
Mmm.

629
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:36,188
(phone rings)

630
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,924
Hello?

631
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:45,297
Tom, is that you?

632
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,469
Tom?

633
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:57,209
Lucas said he thought
he saw you

634
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,744
at his school.

635
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,381
Holy shit!

636
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,549
(phone buzzes)

637
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,950
Hey, Carrie, we're live.

638
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:06,218
You sure?

639
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,387
Yeah.
I didn't hear it ring.

640
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:13,292
Notify the FBI team on the
ground, then patch me in.

641
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:19,697
Where's Helen?

642
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:21,299
I don't know.

643
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:26,437
Saul, we're on. Get up.

644
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,906
I am, Carrie. I'm up.

645
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,850
No GPS data.

646
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:44,555
Phone must have it blocked.

647
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:46,757
Well, get past it so I'm not
just guessing here.

648
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:47,958
Okay, I'm on it.

649
00:34:51,362 --> 00:34:53,497
You don't have to say anything.

650
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:56,900
I know you're listening.

651
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,835
I can feel you there.

652
00:34:59,937 --> 00:35:02,839
Okay, I think we're there.

653
00:35:02,873 --> 00:35:04,173
Got it.

654
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:05,341
Tac One,

655
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,976
immediate left onto
New York Avenue.

656
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,510
Proceed five blocks, then left.

657
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:09,945
(tires squeal)

658
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:13,748
And I need you to know

659
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:16,318
that I never gave up on you,

660
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,822
I never lost hope.

661
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:22,859
But Lucas,
he was getting so big...

662
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:28,466
And a boy needs a father,
that's what you always said.

663
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,772
And it... it wasn't enough,
me raising him on my own...

664
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:36,842
not if he was to have a future.

665
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,844
Our son.

666
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,883
But I never stopped
loving you...

667
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:46,718
never.

668
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,955
Not for one second.

669
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,723
(voice breaking):
And when Lucas said he thought

670
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,959
he'd seen you
that day at his school,

671
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:56,895
my heart was so glad.

672
00:35:56,929 --> 00:36:01,166
Just the thought of it
was a miracle.

673
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,172
And I don't care
why you're back, I don't.

674
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,940
Just that you are.

675
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:12,911
TOM:
Helen.

676
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:15,346
(gasps)

677
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,318
Oh, baby, I've done
a horrible thing.

678
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:21,888
No, Helen, no. Don't! Don't!
They're tracing this call!

679
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,322
You got to get out of there!

680
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:24,657
You hear me?!

681
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,125
Get out now!

682
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,695
(tires squealing)

683
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:39,537
Patch me into the tac team.

684
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,938
GALVEZ:
Okay, you're connected.

685
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:43,375
Do not lose the target!
He's not the target!

686
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,809
He's my husband!

687
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,880
(tires squealing)

688
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,350
Okay, what's your position?

689
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:54,786
Okie Street pushing east. He's
moving towards the rail yard.

690
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,389
Negative. That position
would be too exposed.

691
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,857
We've got a sighting.

692
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:00,758
No, he'll stay
where there's cover.

693
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:04,128
(groans)

694
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:05,229
Hello?

695
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:10,366
Galvez, what just happened?
I'm not sure.

696
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:11,968
I think Tac One is down.
Where?

697
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,472
What is his position?

698
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:17,873
Mount Olivet Street.

699
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:18,974
Olivet.

700
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:21,377
Okay, they're on him.

701
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:22,445
Following.

702
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,451
Target in sight.

703
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:30,486
No.

704
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,821
Wait.
What do you mean?

705
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:36,459
They need to flank him
on the next street.

706
00:37:36,494 --> 00:37:37,828
Contain him, but stay back.

707
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,401
Galvez, tell me you copy.

708
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:46,437
It's too late. They're in.

709
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,914
He's running!

710
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:04,587
Gun!

711
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:05,822
(gunfire)

712
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:07,423
(clamoring)

713
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,592
FBI! Do not move!

714
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:13,095
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands now!

715
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,466
FBI! Do not move!
Do not move!

716
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,202
Do not move!

717
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,309
(sighs)

718
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,712
(crowd clamoring)

719
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:39,124
OFFICER: Folks,
I need you to stay back.

720
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,728
(angry clamoring)

721
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:50,669
OFFICER: Stay back, all of you.
Behind the barricade.

722
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:55,141
(angry clamoring continues)

723
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:05,552
Anyone care to tell
me what happened?

724
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:09,556
The tac team followed
Walker here.

725
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,857
Two casualties.

726
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:13,160
Local Muslims here
for morning prayer.

727
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:15,596
We cleared the building,
including the Imam.

728
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,731
I think I saw him outside.
Looked very unhappy.

729
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:19,700
Walker assaulted
our team leader.

730
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,168
Took his weapon.

731
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:23,337
Operating theory is
that he fired first.

732
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:24,738
That's very much in dispute.

733
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:27,340
Where's Walker?

734
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,109
SAUL:
<i>We're looking.</i>

735
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:32,044
ESTES:
<i>Meaning you have no idea.</i>

736
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,746
CARRIE: <i>We were right on top of him.
</i> <i>We'll find him again.</i>

737
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,215
ESTES:
<i>It better be soon.</i>

738
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:08,045
This is a nightmare.

739
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,880
I couldn't agree more.

740
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,152
Suggestions?

741
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:16,821
The way I see it,
we're down to one option.

742
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:18,489
We go public about Walker.

743
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:20,091
Appeal for help finding him.

744
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,659
And what about
what happened here?

745
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:25,130
Call him a terrorist.
What happened here won't matter much.

746
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,767
Saul?

747
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,909
(sighs)

748
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:40,179
I'll draft the language.

749
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:41,446
Let's regroup at Langley.

750
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,081
The sooner we get this
done, the better.

751
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,053
(conversing indistinctly)

752
00:40:57,296 --> 00:40:59,129
(buzzing)

753
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:07,006
Who is it?

754
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,775
It's okay.

755
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,044
Go back to sleep.

756
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:24,555
What are you doing here?

757
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:26,524
There's something
you need to know.

758
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:28,392
Not at 6:00 in the morning.

759
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:32,162
Tom Walker is alive.

760
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,500
You're lying.
No.

761
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:39,202
It's not possible.
It's true.

762
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:42,037
I killed him with my own
hands, just like I told you.

763
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:45,241
No. Abu Nazir made
you think you did.

764
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,977
There's a manhunt on
for Walker.

765
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:50,246
He's somewhere in the area.

766
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,849
We're going public with the
information in a few hours.

767
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,785
I thought you deserved
to hear it first.

768
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,089
I wanted to tell you
at Langley, but I couldn't.

769
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:01,325
It was still classified.

770
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,662
But I need you to know that I did not
betray your confidence to anyone.

771
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,465
I would never do that.

772
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:14,105
I knew for a fact an American
P.O.W. Was turned.

773
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,242
I didn't know Walker was still
alive any more than you did.

774
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:19,377
Don't hate me because
I thought it was you.

775
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,780
I don't hate you.

776
00:42:22,814 --> 00:42:25,549
You just did what you had to.

777
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,453
Just did your job.

778
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,522
No, it wasn't just my job.

779
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:34,257
(door opening)

780
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:57,580
Is she...?
CIA.

781
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,850
(sighs)

782
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:20,636
SAUL:
Mira, I'm so sorry.

783
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:23,805
We had a severe meltdown.
Two innocents were killed.

784
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,107
Muslims waiting
for morning prayers.

785
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:27,009
I got it, I got it, I got it.

786
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:28,911
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

787
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:31,247
I said I'd be here to make breakfast,
take you to the airport.

788
00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:34,317
I'm already late, Saul.
I'm here now. I'm here.

789
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:36,319
It's better I take a cab.

790
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:42,325
You know how far it is
from here to Delhi?

791
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,427
7,503 miles.

792
00:43:44,462 --> 00:43:46,696
Well, we're still
going to talk.

793
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,698
Sure.

794
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:50,099
I'll text you.

795
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:52,935
(sighs)

796
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:55,671
Please don't do this.

797
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:02,812
When I woke up this morning,
Saul, you were gone,

798
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:08,319
and it hit me that there hasn't
been one day since I've been home

799
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:09,954
that you were there at night

800
00:44:09,988 --> 00:44:11,789
and then you were still
there the next morning.

801
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:15,827
And I couldn't even remember
when was the last time

802
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,296
you were home
for 12 straight hours.

803
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,499
And I don't think
you could remember either.

804
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:27,972
It's my weakness.

805
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:29,139
(sniffles)

806
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:32,175
My Achilles heel.

807
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,412
Every time they'd
call me, I'd go.

808
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:52,164
I'm gonna miss my plane.

809
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,537
(engine starts)

810
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:04,243

(stifled sob)

812
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:41,282
The first news reports
about Walker

813
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:43,150
hit the air less
than five hours ago.

814
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:47,588
We've already had
nearly 2,000 sightings.

815
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:51,225
All of them probably nothing.

816
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:56,463
If I'm Walker I'm burrowing
into my hole right now.

817
00:45:57,665 --> 00:45:59,466
Carrie?

818
00:46:02,337 --> 00:46:06,840
We're going to have tips
a mile deep by morning.

819
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:09,976
It'll be tough to wade through.

820
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:12,278
We'll need to prioritize.

821
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:18,919
I had a kind of epiphany today.

822
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:20,454
About Walker?

823
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:23,190
I wish.

824
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:26,193
No, about me.

825
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:37,539
I'm going to be alone
my whole life, aren't I?

MAN: Could this be just an
extreme case of PTSD,

834
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:57,890
or is Walker a member
of al-Qaeda?

WOMAN:
This isn't some troubled vet.

836
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,061
The FBI called Walker
a credible threat

837
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:03,630
with ties to subversive
elements.

Walker?
Are you crazy?

The entire country is
looking for you.

You can't be here.

842

You people told
me Walker was dead.

My friend.

(screaming) You told
me I killed him.

848
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:31,324
You made me believe.

849
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,392
I don't know!

Really, really!
You have to talk to Abu Nazir!

00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,834
I'm through talking with Nazir,

853
