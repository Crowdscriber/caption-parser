00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,509
(inhaling deeply)

2
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:14,149
(inhaling)

3
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:18,519
(dogs barking in distance)

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,059
(footsteps approaching)

5
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:30,360
(lightbulb buzzing)

6
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,465
(knocking)

7
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,799
(dogs continue barking)

8
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,837
Johnny, right?

9
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:49,371
Pandora?

10
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:51,669
That's me, honey.
New and improved.

11
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:53,170
Had my baby three weeks ago.

12
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,009
Just wanted to make sure.

13
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:01,912
The pictures on the Web site

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,014
don't show your beautiful face.

15
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:06,917
Oh, you won't be looking at my face.

16
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,853
Not once these triple D's
come out to play, and trust me,

17
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,688
I haven't had one complaint yet.

18
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,227
You understand what I want, right?

19
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,196
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:24,865
You were, um...
you were very clear.

21
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,533
I've been saving up all day, honey.

22
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:30,336
Even gave my baby a bottle of formula

23
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,773
so there's no way...
I'll run dry.

24
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,541
Ooh.

25
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,144
They're so juicy

26
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,013
right now,

27
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,851
they're ready to burst.

28
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,786
(sighs)

29
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,696
If you hear the sound of crying,

30
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:56,265
will they leak?

31
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:58,567
Mmm. 'Cause I...

32
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,603
I heard that about new mothers
and breast milk.

33
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,405
If I hear my baby cry,

34
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:05,040
I get this

35
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,374
uncontrollable feeling,

36
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:09,344
like a faucet opening,

37
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:10,912
and then I find myself...

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,181
Mmm.

39
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,716
...with a soaking wet bra.

40
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,885
Breast-feeding is so important

41
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:18,354
for early development.

42
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,790
Mm.

43
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,959
I'm gonna take care of you, Johnny.

44
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,495
All you need is

45
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,729
just... a little mothering.

46
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:29,666
Yeah.

47
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:33,103
But... you don't have to cry

48
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,840
to be my baby.

49
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,209
Mmm.

50
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,678
Are you hungry, baby?

51
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,880
How bad do you want to taste this?

52
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,283
(sighs)

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,218
I'd kill for it.

54
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:50,120
(moans)

55
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:51,388
Then come to Mama.

56
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:53,690
(panting)

57
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,095
(moaning)

58
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,833
(moaning)

59
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:15,281
(door creaks open)

60
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,350
THREDSON: Rise and shine.

61
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,833
What time is it?

62
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:24,606
Well, it's time for you to spend some
quality time with your baby, Papa.

63
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:25,847
What have you done with him?

64
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,695
He's received his smallpox inoculation,

65
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:30,678
and he's on the schedule for
circumcision later today.

66
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,914
Carl, you want to help Kit up?

67
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,382
He looks a little weak in the knees.

68
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:35,583
And let's get him cleaned up.

69
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,351
What have you done with him?!

70
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:40,671
What's your endgame, Thredson?
Just tell me now.

71
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,724
Kit, you have a very limited
understanding of me.

72
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,060
If there's anything in
this world that I hold sacred,

73
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:48,330
it's a child's need
for love and protection.

74
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:53,492

If you're having any trouble

89

with your let-down reflex,

90
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,849
there are some things that
we can do to help with that.

91
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,050
PEPPER: I know everything
you're up to.

92
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:43,452
You don't fool me for one second.

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,855
Carl, Pepper seems a bit agitated.

94
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:48,991
Why don't we take her for a quiet soak

95
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,459
in the hydrotherapy room?

96
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:51,860
And turn up the temperature ten degrees.

97
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:53,595
See if that helps with her nerves.

98
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,029
Everyone else, we'll have
a group therapy session

99
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,731
in the cafeteria.

100
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,633
We'll all have a chance

about the new baby.

102
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,238

110
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:27,194
Am I crazy,

111
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,963
or does he look a little like me?

112
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,698
He looks exactly like you.

113
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,435
You want to hold him?

114
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:36,270
(laughs)

115
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:38,072

Shh.

00:06:57,193 --> 00:07:00,061
(sniffles)

120
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,263
(baby cooing)

121
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,999
Grace...

122
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,336
I...

123
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,573
There are so many questions.

124
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,177
I don't even know where to begin.

125
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,513
It comes back to me in pieces,

126
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:20,948
but they're like shards of broken glass.

127
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:24,152
They don't... they
don't fit together.

128
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,655
Just tell me what you remember.

129
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,524
Anything.

130
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:35,697
(gunshot)

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,767
GRACE: <i>I prayed for death.</i>

132
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:44,139
I thought my prayers were answered

133
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:45,808
when I saw a bright, white light.

134
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,743
(baby cooing)

135
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:51,380
Just like old people talk about.

136
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:53,683
<i>I thought it was heaven.</i>

137
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:09,232
(baby crying)

138
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,103
<i>I felt like I was being torn in half.</i>

139
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:16,340
(heart beating)

140
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,242
I didn't think I could survive it.

141
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,481
But it was him.

142
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:27,552
Our baby.

143
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,256
They were putting him inside me.

144
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,193
How did he grow so fast?

145
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,795
Time works differently up there.

146
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:42,098
It felt like a hundred years to me.

147
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,100
They're not like us, Kit.

148
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:46,735
They're not cruel.

149
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:50,072
And Alma?

150
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,374
You said you saw her,

151
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,109
she was alive.

152
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:56,345
They're not perfect, Kit.

153
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:59,181
They make mistakes.

154
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,502
(gasps)

155
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,639
<i>I'm so sorry, Kit.</i>

156
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,477
<i>I know how much you loved her.</i>

157
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,380
(screaming)

158
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,585
All the plans you made.

159
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:39,621
To have children, build a life.

160
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,959
You wanted all that with Alma, not me.

161
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:45,927
What did they want with her?

162
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,163
With either of you?

163
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:49,664
Our only link is you.

164
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,032
What?

165
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,834
What?

166
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,503
You're special, Kit.

167
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:59,174
Our baby is special.

168
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:02,277
People will listen to him.

169
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,912
He's going to change
the way people think.

170
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,015
Well,

171
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:09,183
I don't know about all that.

172
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:12,086
I just want to be
a decent father to him.

173
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:16,257
Alma would want that.

174
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,699
She'd want me to do the right thing.

175
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,837
Marry me, Grace.

176
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,677
(chuckles)

177
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,278
That a yeah?

178
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,546
Yeah.

179
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:58,898
(speaks quietly)

180
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:02,769
GRACE: Maybe the monsignor
can marry us.

181
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:05,038
Grace. Kit.

182
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,340
I'd like to introduce you to.

183
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,108
Sister Colette.

184
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,377
She's here from St. Ursula's
Home for Lost Children.

185
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:11,645
(baby cries)

186
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,947
I'm sorry to say
she's here for the baby.

187
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,749
SISTER COLETTE: We have
an excellent track record

188
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,918
at placing lost children
in loving homes.

189
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:21,788
He's not a lost child... I'm
his mother, this is his father.

190
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,323
A pair of crazies in an asylum.

191
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,358
Not exactly a Norman Rockwell.

192
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:27,394
You're not taking him.

193
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:30,063
I'm sure this is difficult
for you, but we have to consider

194
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:31,497
what's best for the child.
That's bullshit!

195
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,366
A baby belongs with its mother,
everybody knows that.

196
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,567
Give me the baby. Forget it!

197
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:35,515
Give me the baby! Stop!

198
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,569
(yelps)

199
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:37,837
(baby cries)

200
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,172
You call yourself Christians?!

201
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,007
GRACE: My baby!

202
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,842
I'll get him back for you, I swear!

203
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,378
THREDSON: Kit, I am so sorry.

204
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,714
I can only imagine the heartache

205
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,082
of having your only son
ripped from your arms.

206
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,251
(gasps)

207
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:52,352
Maybe I can help.

208
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,357
Lana Winters?

209
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,492
Yes?

210
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,893
Please come with me.

211
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,361
Why?

212
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,463
I'm taking you out of this place,

213
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:04,598
but we must be quick.

214
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,533
I don't know you.

215
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,203
My name is Mother Claudia.

216
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,704
I am a friend.

217
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,272
I don't have friends in this place.

218
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,874
You have at least one.

219
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:18,580
She told me what she did to you.

220
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,715
And she's asked me to make it right.

221
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,051
You can't make it right.

222
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,118
No.

223
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,422
But maybe you can.

224
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,292
In some measure.

225
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:33,061
Your patient file.

226
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,764
Documentation of every

227
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:37,867
foul thing that was done to you here.

228
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,036
Trust me when I tell you
it can't possibly all be

229
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,571
in that file.

230
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,574
Which is why you need
it for your exposé.

231
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:46,410
It's irrefutable proof
that you were here.

232
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:47,945
When your story comes out,

233
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:50,080
there are those who will
try to deny even that.

234
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:53,017
You want this place shut down.

235
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:56,253
I want it pulled down
and the earth salted.

236
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,088
Now...

237
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,324
the clothes you wore
when you were admitted,

238
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:01,826
along with your personal effects,

239
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,428
are in the lavatory next door.

240
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:05,463
There's a taxicab on its way here now

241
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,697
that will take you

242
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,199
wherever you want to go.

243
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,600
But we must hurry.

244
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,102
All right.

245
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:14,738
Hang on.

246
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,348
That goes with me.

247
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:29,720
There's just one more thing.

248
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,727
Sister Jude. It's Lana Winters.

249
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,163
Your friend Mother Claudia's
taking me out of this place,

250
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,765
and she says that's because of you.

251
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:47,304
I'm coming back for you, Jude.

252
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:48,405
I won't leave you here.

253
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,049
(woman screams in distance)

254
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,352
KIT: We both know if I get
you that tape, I'm done for.

255
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,981
You won't really do anything to help me.

256
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,089
You're wrong, Kit.

257
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,458
Get me that tape,
and I will not only see to it

258
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,294
that your son is not swallowed
by the system,

259
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,862
but I will also do
everything in my power

260
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,431
to secure your freedom,
so you can be with him again.

261
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,066
You and Grace, together as a family.

262
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,168
I mean it.

263
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:19,565
Well, how do you figure to do that?

264
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:22,474
Well, for one,

265
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,910
the police are going to need
a new, credible suspect

266
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:26,178
for the Bloody Face killings.

267
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:27,179
I got one for 'em.

268
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:28,280
So have I.

269
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,383
Dr. Arthur Arden.

270
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,951
I understand he's come under
suspicion a number of times

271
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,954
already, and with his sudden
disappearance...

272
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:37,791
...his guilt is plausible.

273
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:41,095
But Lana... she, uh...

274
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:42,496
she'll never tell me
where that tape's at.

275
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:44,532
I made her swear not to.

276
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,800
Just talk to her.

277
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,068
Try to get her to see reason.

278
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,602
Yeah, well, what if she won't?

279
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,639
I mean...

280
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:54,074
she can be pretty stubborn
when she wants.

281
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:56,544
She's a spirited girl.

282
00:14:56,611 --> 00:15:00,214
If anyone can reach her...

283
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:01,282
it's you.

284
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,717
Okay.

285
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:04,985
I'll try.

286
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,153
(door opens)

287
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,734
(door slams shut)

288
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,018
LANA: In a hurry, Oliver?

289
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:14,273
Quick trip out of town?

290
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,860
Good.

291
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,495
You are here.

292
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,063
Saves me the trouble of
having to look for you.

293
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,464
Did you come here just
to bring me the tape?

294
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:25,732
The police have the tape.

295
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,302
They're going to be here very soon.

296
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,103
It's over.

297
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:34,140
You've been exposed.

298
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,910
(sighs)

299
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,212
That's it?

300
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,314
It's done.

301
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:43,249
(exhales)

302
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,650
I knew this would happen one day.

303
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,485
I wondered how

304
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,586
I would feel.

305
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,188
I thought I would go crazy,

306
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,789
but I'm actually relieved.

307
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:52,090
Living with secrets

308
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,293
is not... healthy.

309
00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:58,396
I was right, Lana.

310
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:00,999
I knew...

311
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,901
you were the one.

312
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,002
I am the one.

313
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,003
I am the one

314
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:09,040
that's going to put your ass
in that electric chair.

315
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:12,410
You're gonna pay for every
sick thing you did to me,

316
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,378
to Wendy,

317
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,514
and to every other woman you murdered.

318
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,499
Where do you think you're going?

319
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:25,890
Making myself a drink.

320
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,358
Care to join me?

321
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:34,732
Sit down.

322
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,835
(sighs) There is no
alcohol where I'm going.

323
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,336
I'm not gonna let you

324
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,272
take away my last chance
to have a martini.

325
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,983
You sure you won't change your mind?

326
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,352
You think I'm crazy.

327
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,454
Oh, wait.

328
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,856
That'd be you.

329
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,390
I think we established that

330
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,792
when you chained me to the bed

331
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,126
and called me Mommy.

332
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,038
PANDORA: Go ahead, baby,
you can call me Mommy.

333
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:26,816
(exhales)

334
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,886
You'd be surprised how many...

335
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,921
how many men have mommy issues.

336
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:36,593
You think that's my problem?

337
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,896
From the way you drained my tit?

338
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,532
I'd either say that you
have a mommy fixation,

339
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,602
or... a calcium deficiency.

340
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,437
(laughs)

341
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:49,140
Oh, honey, I'm just kidding.

342
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,143
I just want to slow you down.

343
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,378
Make sure you're enjoying yourself.

344
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,983
You're right.

345
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:01,385
I'm fixated.

346
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,554
I'm stuck on that cold bitch.

347
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,190
Oh, honey.

348
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:08,426
You tell me all about her.

349
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:13,231
JOHNNY: <i>She never loved me.</i>

350
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:15,466
<i>She didn't love my father.</i>

351
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,371
<i>There was only one person</i>
<i>she ever loved.</i>

352
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,539
LANA: Tell me what you did

353
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:23,174
with Wendy's body.

354
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,544
Nobody cares about
a spinster schoolteacher.

355
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:26,779
Not the cops,

356
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:30,382
nor the school, or her family.

357
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,985
Everyone knows what she was.

358
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,820
What we were together.

359
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,589
And I'm the only one who gives a damn.

360
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,159
She deserves a proper burial.

361
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:44,396
(gas roars)

362
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,664
(flames crackling)

363
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,470
Her story's pretty complicated.

364
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,206
Are you sure you want to hear
all the details?

365
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:55,340
I want to know everything.

366
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,953
She was the first body I had
that remained... intact.

367
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,590
I put her on ice just for you.

368
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,694
I was gonna dispose of the body, but...

369
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:17,296
once I realized how well things
were going with us,

370
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:18,832
I thought she could come in handy.

371
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:22,235
For practice, you know.

372
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,204
THREDSON:
<i>It was awkward at first.</i>

373
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,441
<i>Every approach I made</i>
<i>felt false, artificial.</i>

374
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:29,409
<i>I felt like she was watching me.</i>

375
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,545
<i>Being judgmental.</i>

376
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,814
<i>I must confess, I couldn't do it.</i>

377
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,049
<i>I thought about plucking out her eyes.</i>

378
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,118
<i>But then I thought, that's not real,</i>

379
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,319
I need to make this work.

380
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,689
<i>So I turned her around.</i>

381
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,294
And finally it happened.

382
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,897
(sighs)

383
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,332
More than once.

384
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,535
It was a triumph.

385
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:58,239
Better than I ever
thought possible, Lana.

386
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,140
Wendy allowed us to create

387
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,809
this life you have growing
inside of you.

388
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,048
It's a little miracle,
if you think about it.

389
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:08,582
Where is her body, goddamn it?

390
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,051
Well, after you left me,

391
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:11,419
I had to dispose of all the evidence.

392
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,020
So what I couldn't burn,

393
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:14,855
I cut up.

394
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,824
There are pieces of her

395
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,659
scattered from Plymouth to Springfield.

396
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,327
But you know what, Lana?

397
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,731
We'll always have Paris.

398
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,106
Let go, baby.

399
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,774
Cry your heart out.

400
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:37,943
There's no shame in tears.

401
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,718
It's my mother.

402
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,420
She's the one! The only one

403
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,055
who can make me feel this way.

404
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,957
Every time I think about her,

405
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:52,259
it makes me want to do things.

406
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:56,063
Bad things! Johnny...

407
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,664
Don't let that bitch ruin
our whole night.

408
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,266
Now, look at me.

409
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,102
I have a rockin' body
and a titty full of milk.

410
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,004
Let me help you forget about her.

411
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,973
You think it's easy?
You think it's easy?

412
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,743
Come on, baby. I can't forget.

413
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,846
Come on, I'm about to
burst out of my skin.

414
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,381
Do me a favor and just
give me some relief.

415
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:13,749
(screams)

416
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:15,284
Please! Oh, God.

417
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:17,953
No! Please, baby, oh, stop.

418
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:19,106
Stop! Stop!

419
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:21,097
You know what bitch did, don't you?

420
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:23,534
Stop, stop, please!

421
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:29,766
Time for a refill.

422
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,668
(sirens wailing in distance)

423
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,600
They're here.

424
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:40,769
Drink up.

425
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:43,620
This is your last taste of alcohol.

426
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,041
Now that you're out of Briarcliff,

427
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:47,913
you'll never keep that baby, will you?

428
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,506
Not a chance in hell.
So I shouldn't

429
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,626
expect a little Oliver

430
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:51,733
to come visit every few months?

431
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,429
Oh, even if I had this thing,

432
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,464
you'd never see him.

433
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:56,799
You're gonna fry in that chair.

434
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,735
(sirens wailing)

435
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,188
I hardly think so, Lana.

436
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,607
(grunts)

437
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,676
I'm clearly insane.

438
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,511
I'll be institutionalized.

439
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,580
At the very worst, I'll live
a long life in prison.

440
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:12,682
Maybe I'll even start
some therapy groups.

441
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,784
God knows there are
some disturbed individuals

442
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,519
behind bars.

443
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:19,255
As for you...

444
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,091
...I have no use for you

445
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:23,392
anymore.

446
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,505
Best you should just be known as

447
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,029
my last victim.

448
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:32,167
Prison's too good for you.

449
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,235
LOIS: I can't believe
the cops didn't find

450
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:55,480
anything connected to her.

451
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:58,306
No bones, nothing. Jesus, Lois,

452
00:23:58,374 --> 00:24:00,508
is this really
the place? Really?

453
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:02,043
It's fine.

454
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:05,447
They found a lot of
ashes in the furnace.

455
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:08,417
I know maybe it's not all Wendy, but...

456
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:10,419
I just needed a place to visit...

457
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,390
...a place where I can
remember her.

458
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:15,591
BARB: Of course.

459
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,760
You did the right thing, Lana.

460
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,728
So, are you going to

461
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:21,463
move back into your house?

462
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:23,065
'Cause... it's a big place,

463
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,600
and if you need a roommate...

464
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:25,802
I have a couple of things

465
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:26,836
I need to tidy up,

466
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:28,171
and...

467
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:29,772
when I'm finished, I've decided

468
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,173
to move to New York.

469
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:37,946
I can't help but feel this is my fault.

470
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,882
Don't do that, Lana.

471
00:24:39,949 --> 00:24:42,551
It is not your fault.

472
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,387
This was the work of a crazed maniac.

473
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:46,255
A man you had to kill
in self-defense.

474
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:49,658
If anyone, it was that nun.

475
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:50,793
No.

476
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:54,664
It was the story.

477
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:57,466
I was going to do anything
to get that story.

478
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:02,405
I just didn't realize how much
it was going to cost.

479
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:06,476
You still have the address

480
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:08,378
I gave you?

481
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:10,213
She's a real doctor. A good one.

482
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,582
She'll take care

483
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:12,716
of your little problem.

484
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:13,717
Thank you.

485
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:15,119
Both of you.

486
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:17,054
I don't know what I would do...

487
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:18,522
(bulbs popping)

488
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,324
LOIS: Shit, they found us.
MAN: Hey.

489
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:22,627
Goddamn vultures.
Oh, sorry, Lana.

490
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,994
I... forgot you're one of 'em.

491
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:26,431
No, we are vultures.

492
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:29,700
Attracted to the scent of rotting meat.

493
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:31,335
If you don't

494
00:25:31,402 --> 00:25:33,003
want to be linked
to the "Sapphic Reporter,"

495
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:34,371
you should leave through the back gate.

496
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,273
Yeah, I better.

497
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,075
No one in my family suspects.

498
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:45,481
Sorry to abandon you.

499
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,950
I still have a job because

500
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:50,938
my lecherous boss thinks
he has a chance with me.

501
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:02,196
(piano plays somberly)

502
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:13,007
(birds chirping)

503
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:24,185
(reporters shouting)
MAN: Miss Winters, can you give us any more

504
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:26,254
details about how Bloody Face
tortured you

505
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:27,322
when you were his captive?
MAN 2: Sources tell me

506
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:28,522
you've obtained the services

507
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,291
of Cohen and Mathews...

508
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:31,692
they're the best lawyers in town.

509
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,494
Are you planning to sue?
Any truth to the rumors that

510
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:34,862
you received electroshock
treatment daily?

511
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,697
Lana, do you have any comment

512
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:38,199
about your reported homosexuality?

513
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,835
(reporters yelling indistinctly)

514
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:45,239
Please, Miss Winters!
Miss Winters, talk to us!

515
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:47,609
All I can say is...

516
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:48,777
read my book.

517
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:50,278
Miss Winters...

518
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:53,315

523

It's a horse tranquilizer!

524
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,142
Come now, Judy.

525
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,544
These pills are perfectly safe.

526
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,112
You signed for them yourself.

527
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,447
Don't you remember?

528
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:33,424
Don't take these pills...

(knock on door) Come.

530
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:05,790
Brother James, those reporters
who were here when I arrived,

531
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,492
have they been removed
from the premises?

532
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,460
From the immediate grounds.

533
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:13,031
There's nothing I can do about
those camped outside the gates.

534
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,567
Hopefully if we remain
resolute in our silence,

535
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:18,737
they'll eventually tire...

536
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,773
and go away.

537
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:23,976
Monsignor, there's been a disturbance

538
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,478
in the Common Room.

539
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:29,249

Jude?

545
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:44,163
Carl said you caused quite a commotion.

546
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:48,434
It's a good thing you and I are friends

547
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:51,203
or you'd be in solitary right now.

548
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,905
She got one thing right,

549
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,908
that Devil of yours.

550
00:28:56,976 --> 00:29:01,646
This jukebox has
a strange healing effect,

551
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:02,981
it keeps the joy alive.

552
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,719
(music stops playing)

553
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,888
What did you want to see me about?

554
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:17,896
Have you fully recognized

555
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:19,964
the irony here?

556
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:22,700
You relinquished your virtue

557
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,868
not to a loving woman,

558
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:27,170
but to the Devil.

559
00:29:27,238 --> 00:29:30,674
It's so perfect...
it's perfect, it's perfect.

560
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:33,044
I don't want to hear you talk like this.

561
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,179
I don't know this person.

562
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:40,351
What have you decided to do?

563
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:44,089
Renounce your vows?

564
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,793
Not at all.

565
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,462
I'm going to stay the course.

566
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:53,499
I have too much to give,
too much to offer.

567
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:54,967
I can't just

568
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:57,370
throw it all away.

569
00:29:57,437 --> 00:30:00,039
I thought you hung the moon, Timothy.

570
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,010
I had impure thoughts,
I'll admit to that.

571
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,112
But I would have done

572
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,015
anything for you,

573
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:13,719
I would've done anything
you asked me to do,

574
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:16,588
that's how much I believed
in your fantasy

575
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:19,191
of the magic carpet ride to Rome.

576
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,262
Believe me, Jude,

577
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,166
it's not a fantasy.

578
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:29,535
Brother Matthew? Carl?

579
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:32,204
Can you imagine

580
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:33,772
the disillusionment,

581
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,143
the shame and the disgust I feel

582
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,778
now that I see through you

583
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:44,949
and your stupid, pitiful,
naked ambition?

584
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:46,950
Shut your filthy mouth!

585
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:50,153
You're an embarrassment.

586
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:51,688
(laughs)

587
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:53,323
It's an extraordinary thing.

588
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:55,459
You know that?

589
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:57,861
You throw me in the madhouse,

590
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,598
you strip away everything I have,

591
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:03,300
everything I know,

592
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,869
you treat me like a rabid dog,

593
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:06,303
like a madwoman.

594
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:09,474
And you know what happens?

595
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:13,778
I'm blessed with the gift
of total clarity.

596
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:15,814
I am more sane

597
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:19,084
now as a madwoman than I ever was

598
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,186
as the head of Briarcliff.

599
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,255
You sound mad as a hatter.

600
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,795
Oh, Carl.

601
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:31,963
Jude needs some time alone

602
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:35,801
to reflect and pray for guidance.

603
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:38,270
Take her to solitary.
(Jude laughs)

604
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,807
You will not prevail, Timothy.

605
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:42,775
My God would

606
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:45,645
never allow it.

607
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,327
Sign here.

608
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,629
And here.

609
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:06,431
What for?

610
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:07,632
Your release papers.

611
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,501
They're letting you out, Kit.

612
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:15,340
(woman yells in the distance)

613
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:17,075
Thredson... they caught him?

614
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,810
Lana gave them the tape?

615
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:20,112
Yeah, and she did one better.

616
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,014
The lezzie blew his head off.

617
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:24,183
It's all over the papers.

618
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,118
Reporters are hanging off the rafters,

619
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,285
trying to sniff out

620
00:32:27,353 --> 00:32:30,055
the "Corruption at Briarcliff."

621
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:32,256
That's why you're suddenly a free man.

622
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:36,628
Clothes from the Salvation Army.

623
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:38,129
They should fit you...
just leave

624
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:40,165
what you're wearing on the bed.

625
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:55,914
Wait.

626
00:32:57,717 --> 00:33:02,254
I have to see the monsignor.

627
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,755
Mr. Walker,

628
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:07,025
I can't tell you how pleased I am

629
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:09,593
that justice has finally been served.

630
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:12,563
I'm only happy to have been
a small part of that.

631
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:14,232
This isn't justice.

632
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:15,933
I don't understand.
You're a free man.

633
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:16,968
What more could you want?

634
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:18,136
I want my son back.

635
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:19,504
Your son?

636
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:21,006
You took him from our arms.

637
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:24,042
He's got two parents...
me and Grace.

638
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,377
And we aim to raise him as a family.

639
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:27,079
That's hardly possible, is it?

640
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:29,781
Given that you've just been released

641
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,185
and Miss Bertrand's confined here.

642
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:34,720
That's why you're gonna let her out.

643
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,121
I beg your pardon?

644
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:38,157
You're gonna let Grace
out of this place.

645
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,593
Then you're gonna call
over to St. Ursula's

646
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:43,162
and tell them little Thomas'
folks are coming to pick him up.

647
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,497
If you do that,

648
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,332
we'll never bother you again.

649
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,968
Otherwise,

650
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,037
I might have to start talking
to those reporters.

651
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:53,439
And believe me,

652
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:55,707
I have a lot of stories.

653
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:59,211
I bet you do.

654
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,048
Be reasonable, you can't
seriously expect me to release

655
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:06,352
an axe murderess
back into the community.

656
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,486
I'm not asking you to.

657
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:09,321
All you got to do is

658
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,756
release her body to me.

659
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:12,691
Her body?

660
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,460
Is this a riddle?

661
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:16,996
Grace isn't dead.
Look at her file.

662
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,765
In it you'll find a death certificate

663
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,700
made out by Dr. Arden
before he disappeared.

664
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,703
Frank McCann signed it as a witness.

665
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,337
Her death certificate?

666
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:27,540
Officially, if anybody ever asks,

667
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,909
Grace Bertrand died here.

668
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:32,545
It's already taken care of.

669
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,913

00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:00,606
he might calm down.

837
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,675
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:04,643
It seemed worth a try.

839
00:44:05,846 --> 00:44:08,247
(crying continues)

840
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:09,681
Give him here.

841
00:44:18,892 --> 00:44:20,626
(baby fussing)

842
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,603
(crying continues)

843
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:38,477
(crying stops)
