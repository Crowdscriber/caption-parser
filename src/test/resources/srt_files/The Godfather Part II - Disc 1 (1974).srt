1
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,762
The nurse.

2
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:58,531
- Do you have any money?
- No.

3
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,367
Interpreter.

4
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,938
Where are you from?

5
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:13,013
- What is your name?
- Maria.

6
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:19,578
What is your name?

7
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:23,219
Come on, son.
What is your name?

8
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:29,556
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

9
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:34,062
Vito Corleone.

10
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,627
Okay. Over there.

11
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:40,833
Next. Your name.

12
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:51,580
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine, three months.

13
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,221
Vito Corleone?

14
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:10,636
Here he is.
This is him.

15
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,772
Did you bring the car keys?

16
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:34,877
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

17
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,144
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

18
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,845
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Excuse me.

19
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:46,984
- Here I am.
- After one week?

20
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:50,587
I sent the car out to the airport
last week to pick you up.

21
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:52,097
It was chaos.

22
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,192
Anyway, here I am,
just one week late.

23
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,861
And this is for my mama.

24
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:59,496
- What is this?
- You remember Merle, don't you?

25
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,302
- Hello, Mama.
- Yeah, hello.

26
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,309
How are you?
Thank you.

27
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:05,038
Where's Michael?
I gotta talk to him...

28
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:08,445
and get a few things straight,
and I can't wait on line.

29
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,484
You go see your children first...

30
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:15,078
and then you worry about waiting
on line to see your brother...

31
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:17,487
Like everybody else.

32
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:25,160
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Frankie, wake up.

33
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:28,497
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

34
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:33,006
Would you please welcome Senator
Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

35
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:35,007
And there's Mrs. Geary.

36
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,052
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

37
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:51,990
And this is a very,
very happy day for me...

38
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:54,561
and my wife, Mrs. Geary.

39
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:58,925
We see Nevada far too seldom...

40
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,126
but particularly today...

41
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:03,931
when we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends...

42
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:07,701
and we help celebrate
a young man's first communion...

43
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:11,669
and also to thank
that boy's family...

44
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,873
for a magnificent contribution
to the state.

45
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,083
I have here in my hand a check...

46
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:21,417
made out to the university...

47
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:24,286
and it is
a magnificent endowment...

48
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,292
in the name of...

49
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:30,591
Anthony Vito Corleone.

50
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:34,963
And the check is signed
by that young man's parents...

51
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:37,663
whom I think
we should recognize now.

52
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,262
Mike, Pat, Kay--

53
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:42,274
Stand up, please.
Let the folks see you.

54
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,435
Folks, I want you to join with me...

55
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:47,412
in giving a real
Nevada thank-you...

56
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:50,245
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

57
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,316
We also have,
as a special added attraction...

58
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:01,520
the Sierra Boys Choir...

59
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:04,097
who have chosen...

60
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,032
a certain special song
and a special arrangement...

61
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:12,038
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

62
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,233
Boys.

63
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:25,418
- Why this feeling
- Why this feeling

64
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,923
- Why this glow
-Just why this glow

65
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,424
The plaque.

66
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,427
Okay, fellas, I got that one.

67
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:39,027
Okay, this is yours.

68
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,033
Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.

69
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:04,887
- Excuse me.
- This is my lawyer Tom Hagen.

70
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:06,892
- Senator Geary.
- Mr. Hagen.

71
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:10,054
He's the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man Turnbull.

72
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:12,394
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

73
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:19,838
I was under the impression
that you and I would talk alone.

74
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:24,470
I trust these men
with my life, Senator.

75
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,672
If I were to ask them to leave,
it would be an insult.

76
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:32,216
It's all right with me, but I should
tell you I am a blunt man...

77
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,153
and I intend to speak
very frankly to you...

78
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:40,785
more frankly than anyone in my
position's talked to you before.

79
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:43,557
The Corleone family has done
very well here in Nevada.

80
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:49,034
You own, or you control,
two major hotels in Vegas...

81
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,502
one in Reno.

82
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,733
The licenses
were grandfathered in...

83
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:57,038
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission.

84
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,215
But now my sources tell me that...

85
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:05,843
you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

86
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:08,319
They tell me that within a week...

87
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:10,913
you're gonna move Klingman out.

88
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,186
That's quite an expansion.

89
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:16,957
However, it will leave you
with one little technical problem.

90
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,468
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

91
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,470
Turnbull is a good man.

92
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,542
Yeah, well, let's just--
Let's cut out the bullshit.

93
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:31,806
I don't want to spend any more time
here than I have to.

94
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:34,380
You can have the license.

95
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:36,712
The price is $250,000...

96
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:39,786
plus a monthly payment
of five percent of the gross...

97
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,582
of all four hotels...

98
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:44,453
Mr. Corleone.

99
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:52,162
Now, the price for the license
is less than $20,000.

100
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,166
- Am I right?
- That's right.

101
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:58,001
Now, why would I ever consider
paying more than that?

102
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:01,302
Because I intend to squeeze you.

103
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:04,003
I don't like your kind of people.

104
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,306
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country...

105
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,245
in your oily hair...

106
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:12,016
dressed up in those silk suits...

107
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,078
and you try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

108
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,091
I'll do business with you,
but the fact is that...

109
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:21,991
I despise your masquerade...

110
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:25,031
the dishonest way
you pose yourself--

111
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:27,327
yourself and your whole
fucking family.

112
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,906
Senator...

113
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,310
we're both part
of the same hypocrisy...

114
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:45,779
but never think it applies
to my family.

115
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:48,480
All right, all right.

116
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:53,051
Some people have to play
little games.

117
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,718
You play yours.

118
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:01,060
Let's just say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest to.

119
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,096
But I want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

120
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:09,472
And one more thing:
Don't you contact me again, ever.

121
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:13,536
From now on, you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

122
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:18,006
Senator, you can have
my answer now if you like.

123
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:23,886
My offer is this:

124
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:25,390
nothing.

125
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:29,028
Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

126
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,657
which I would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

127
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:39,797
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

128
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,804
Ladies. I didn't know
you were out here.

129
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:49,041
- We have to go. We're late.
- Really? I'm sorry.

130
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,744
It's been a delightful party.
Thank you for inviting us.

131
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:55,219
It's been our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.

132
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:43,195
Fredo, you son ofa bitch!

133
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:45,067
You look great!

134
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,037
Frank Pentangeli!

135
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:49,871
I thought you was never
coming out west, you big bum.

136
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,604
I gotta check on my boys, huh?

137
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,407
- What's with the food around here?
- What's the matter?

138
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,145
Kid comes up to me
in a white jacket...

139
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:01,448
gives me a Ritz cracker
and a chopped liver...

140
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:03,284
he says "canapes."

141
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,450
I said, "Can of peas my ass!

142
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,824
That's a Ritz cracker
and chopped liver."

143
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,093
- Bring out the peppers and sausage.
- Hey, Freddie.

144
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:18,831
Seeing you reminds me of New York.
The old days, huh?

145
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:22,272
Hey, Fredo,
you remember Willi Cicci?

146
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:24,674
We was with old man Clemenza
in Brooklyn.

147
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:29,912
We were all upset about that.

148
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,348
Heart attack, huh?

149
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:33,352
No, there was no heart attack.

150
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:39,047
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

151
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,094
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

152
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:44,164
I mean, what do I gotta do?
Do I have to get...

153
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:47,632
a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

154
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,202
You can't get in to see Mike?

155
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:52,067
He's got me waiting in a lobby!

156
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:58,040
-Johnny Ola.
- AI Neri.

157
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:06,108
Do you know my lawyer
Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.

158
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,849
Sure. I remember Tom
from the old days.

159
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:12,892
Rocco, what's this?

160
00:22:12,993 --> 00:22:15,723
It's an orange from Miami.

161
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,627
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

162
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:24,035
- Good to see you.
- Tom isn't gonna sit in with us.

163
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:26,766
He only handles specifiic areas
of the family business.

164
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:28,774
- Tom?
- Sure, Mike.

165
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:36,045
What are you drinking, Johnny?

166
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,549
Anisette.

167
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:45,021
If you need anything
I'll be outside, all right?

168
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,025
Just tell Rocco we're waiting.

169
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,625
I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.

170
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:58,432
- How's his health?
- It's not good.

171
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:03,103
Is there anything I can do,
anything I can send?

172
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,668
He appreciates your concern,
Michael, and your respect.

173
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:11,376
That casino you're interested in,
the registered owners are...

174
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:15,512
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay,
both Beverly Hills attorneys.

175
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:18,558
The real owners are the Lakeville
Road group from Cleveland...

176
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,093
and our friend in Miami.

177
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:22,753
Meyer Klingman runs the store.

178
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:25,525
He owns a piece of it too,
and he does all right.

179
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,431
But I've been instructed to tell you
that if you move Klingman out...

180
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,935
our friend in Miami will go along.

181
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,798
That's very kind of him.

182
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,139
You tell him
that's greatly appreciated.

183
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,506
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

184
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,850
One by one,
our old friends are gone.

185
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:52,289
Death, natural or not...

186
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:54,554
prison, deported.

187
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:58,863
Hyman Roth is the only one left...

188
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:02,197
because he always made money
for his partners.

189
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:04,634
My God!
I can't believe...

190
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:06,831
out of 30 professional musicians...

191
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,374
there isn't one ltalian
in the group here.

192
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,376
Come on.
Let's have a tarantella.

193
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:19,876
You, up! Come on!
Up, up, up!

194
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:55,914
I'll see my sister alone.

195
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:58,924
It concerns me too.
Is it okay if I stay?

196
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:00,755
How are you, honey?

197
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:03,989
You've met Merle.
He was with me in Vegas.

198
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,931
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink or something?

199
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:13,403
Al, would you please
get him a drink?

200
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:19,410
We're going to Europe. I'd like
to book passage on the Queen.

201
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:22,277
So what do you come to me for?
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

202
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,213
We're getting married first.

203
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:36,888
The ink on your divorce isn't dry
yet, and you're getting married?

204
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,860
You see your children on weekends.

205
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,370
Your oldest boy
was picked up in Reno...

206
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,702
for some petty theft
you don't even know about.

207
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:50,936
You fly around the world with men
who use you like a whore.

208
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:53,740
- You're not my father!
- Then what do you come to me for?

209
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,371
'Cause I need money.

210
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:20,105
I wanna be reasonable with you.

211
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,141
Now, why don't you stay here
with us, with the family?

212
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:28,509
You can live here on the estate
with your kids.

213
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:32,107
You won't be deprived of anything.
You can have everything you want.

214
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:39,487
Now, I don't know this Merle.
I don't know what he does.

215
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:41,493
I don't know what he lives on.

216
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,130
Tell him marriage
is out ofthe question...

217
00:26:45,232 --> 00:26:48,292
and you don't want
to see him anymore.

218
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:50,836
He'll understand.
Believe me.

219
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,582
If you don't listen to me...

220
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:07,586
and marry this man...

221
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,953
you'll disappoint me.

222
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:52,628
What's cent'anni?

223
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,701
Cent'anni.
It means a hundred years.

224
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:59,932
It means we should all live happily
for a hundred years, the family.

225
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,871
It'd be true
if my father were alive.

226
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:08,575
Merle, you've met
my sister-in-law Deanna.

227
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:11,275
- Fredo's wife.
- A pleasure, Merle.

228
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,285
- How do you do?
- My pleasure.

229
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:18,113
What did she mean by that?

230
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,459
What's the matter?
I just wanna dance.

231
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,661
Dancing is one thing.
You're falling all over the floor.

232
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,467
I know what's the matter. You're
jealous 'cause he's a real man.

233
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,634
I swear to God, I'm gonna
belt you right in the teeth.

234
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:12,336
You couldn't belt your mama.

235
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:16,414
You know something? These dagos are
crazy when it comes to their wives.

236
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:19,451
Michael says that if
you can't take care of this...

237
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,885
I have to.

238
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,787
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop!

239
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,792
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop!

240
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:30,819
Stop that!

241
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,024
What are you doing to me?

242
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,533
You big slob! Help!

243
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,760
I can't control her, Mikey.

244
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:42,364
You're my brother, Fredo.
You don't have to apologize to me.

245
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:48,113
Clemenza promised
the Rosato brothers...

246
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:50,206
three territories in the Bronx
after he died.

247
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,285
You took over,
and you didn't give it to them.

248
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:53,546
- I welched?
- You welched.

249
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:56,622
Clemenza promised them "ugatz. "

250
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:58,486
Clemenza promised them nothing.

251
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:00,822
He hated those son ofa bitches
more than I do.

252
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:04,055
Frankie, they feel cheated.

253
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:07,725
You're sitting high up
in the Sierra Mountains...

254
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,233
and you're drinking--

255
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:11,065
- What's he drinking, Cicci?
- Champagne.

256
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,162
Champagne cocktails.

257
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:15,332
And you're passing judgment
on how I run my family.

258
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:41,730
You're a good old man.

259
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,427
I like you.

260
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:46,330
And you were loyal
to my father for years.

261
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:51,869
The Rosato brothers,
they're taking hostages.

262
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:56,778
And Mike,
they spit right in my face...

263
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:59,283
all because they're backed up
by that Jew in Miami.

264
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:02,378
I know. That's why
I don't want 'em touched.

265
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,547
- You don't want 'em touched.
- No.

266
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:06,217
I want you to be fair with them.

267
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:08,294
You want me to be fair with 'em?

268
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,491
How can you be fair to animals?

269
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:13,998
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen.

270
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:17,628
They recruit spics.
They recruit niggers.

271
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:21,730
And they do violence in
their grandmothers' neighborhoods.

272
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,470
And I tell ya,
everything with them is whores.

273
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:28,036
Whores and junk. Dope.

274
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:30,810
And they leave the gambling to last.

275
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,977
Now, I wanna run my family
without you on my back...

276
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:37,113
and I want those
Rosato brothers dead.

277
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:47,895
Now, I have business that's
important with Hyman Roth.

278
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,263
I don't want it disturbed.

279
00:31:51,438 --> 00:31:53,497
Then you'll give your loyalty
to a Jew before your own blood?

280
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:00,972
Come on. You know my father
did business with Hyman Roth.

281
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,571
He respected him.

282
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:05,412
Your father did business
with Hyman Roth...

283
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,919
your father respected Hyman Roth...

284
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:10,455
but your father
never trusted Hyman Roth...

285
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:14,357
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

286
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:24,635
And I want everybody here to know...

287
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:27,764
there's not gonna be
no trouble from me.

288
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:29,808
Don Corleone.

289
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:42,087
You want him to leave now?

290
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:48,191
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

291
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:52,163
The old man had too much wine.

292
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,497
It's late.

293
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,343
How's the baby?

294
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:16,286
Sleeping inside me.

295
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:20,189
- Does it feel like a boy?
- Yes, it does, Michael.

296
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,789
I'm sorry about
all the people today.

297
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:29,562
Bad timing.

298
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:32,069
It couldn't be helped, though.

299
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:34,800
It made me think
of what you once told me.

300
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:41,607
In five years, the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.

301
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,615
That was seven years ago.

302
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,248
I know.

303
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:50,914
I'm trying, darling.

304
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:55,854
Did you see this?

305
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:13,670
Michael, why are the drapes open?

306
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,697
- Kay, you all right?
- Yeah.

307
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:45,327
- Are you hit?
- No.

308
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:49,572
It's over. It's over.

309
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:54,046
Now! Shut it off!

310
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:57,376
Hold it!

311
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:11,961
They're still on the property.
Please, stay inside.

312
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:13,589
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

313
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,860
Rocco! Alive!

314
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,870
Stay by the door.

315
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,437
Check by the boathouse!

316
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:40,043
Yeah, come in.

317
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,289
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

318
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:50,794
Yeah?

319
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,632
There's a lot
I can't tell you, Tom.

320
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:01,367
Now, I know that's
upset you in the past.

321
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,007
You felt it was because of some
lack of trust or confidence...

322
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,916
but it's because
I admire you and I love you...

323
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,954
that I kept things
secret from you.

324
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:21,183
That's why at this moment you're
the only one I can completely trust.

325
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:25,831
Fredo?

326
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:28,867
Well, he's got a good heart...

327
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:30,993
but he's weak and he's stupid...

328
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:33,004
and this is life and death.

329
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:37,574
Tom, you're my brother.

330
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:46,509
I always wanted to be thought of
as a brother by you.

331
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,143
A real brother.

332
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:52,715
I know that.

333
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:01,892
You're gonna take over.

334
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:04,367
You're gonna be the don.

335
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,837
If what I think has happened
has happened...

336
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:12,707
I'm gonna leave here tonight.

337
00:39:13,947 --> 00:39:17,474
I give you complete power
over Fredo and his men--

338
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,677
Rocco, Neri, everyone.

339
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:27,055
I'm trusting you with the lives
of my wife and my children--

340
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,718
the future of this family.

341
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:33,259
When we catch these guys...

342
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:35,163
do you think we'll be able to
find out who's back ofall this?

343
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:37,463
We're not gonna catch 'em.

344
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:41,271
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

345
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,041
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

346
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:48,704
Inside.

347
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:51,443
Very, very frightened
they botched it.

348
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:53,849
Yeah, but your people,
Rocco and Neri...

349
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:56,114
you don't think that they had
something to do with this?

350
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:04,052
See, all our people
are businessmen.

351
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:07,455
Their loyalty's based on that.

352
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:13,104
One thing I learned from Pop...

353
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:18,337
was to try to think
as people around you think.

354
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,806
Now, on that basis,
anything's possible.

355
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:29,452
I seen them!
Right out my window!

356
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,251
I wanna get out of here!
They're lying there dead!

357
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:33,655
Get her inside!

358
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,839
Over here.
There's two of'em.

359
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:48,736
Looks like they were
hired out of New York.

360
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:51,105
I don't recognize 'em.

361
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,441
We won't get anything
out of them now.

362
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,105
Fish 'em out.

363
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:23,540
All right, get rid of the bodies.

364
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:25,634
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

365
00:41:56,676 --> 00:42:00,305
Anthony, everything's
gonna be all right.

366
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:01,971
Try to sleep.

367
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:20,929
Did you like your party?

368
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,591
I got lots of presents.

369
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:26,468
I know.
Did you like 'em?

370
00:42:26,572 --> 00:42:29,234
I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

371
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:32,576
Well, they're my friends.

372
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:36,840
Did you see my present for you?

373
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:38,814
It was on my pillow.

374
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:44,487
Anthony, I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

375
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,783
Will you take me?

376
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:51,227
- No, I can't, Anthony.
- Why do you have to go?

377
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:55,466
'Cause I have to do business.

378
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:57,468
I could help you.

379
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:03,574
Well, someday you will.

380
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,269
Get some sleep.

381
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:17,746
Good night.

382
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:43,646
Vito. Come on.

383
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,858
We'll go see her backstage.

384
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:58,427
Come here.

385
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:44,239
Vito. Come here. Come on.

386
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:49,445
Come here.

387
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:28,777
You speak ltalian?

388
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:45,932
Yeah, sure.

389
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:53,903
Come on in.

390
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:58,675
It's all right. Come on.
Hyman's in there.

391
01:01:58,777 --> 01:02:01,746
I was just making some lunch.
Would you like a tuna sandwich?

392
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:03,746
Uh, no, thankyou.

393
01:02:09,387 --> 01:02:12,185
Pickup of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

394
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,622
and the ball is at
the Trojan 38-yardline.

395
01:02:14,726 --> 01:02:15,954
Mr. Roth?

396
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:17,961
Come in, Michael.

397
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:22,898
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

398
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:26,860
It's almost over.

399
01:02:29,307 --> 01:02:30,831
You follow the football game?

400
01:02:30,942 --> 01:02:34,309
- Pickup offive.
- Not for a while I haven't.

401
01:02:34,412 --> 01:02:37,245
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

402
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:40,284
One of the things I love
about this country.

403
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,478
Baseball too.

404
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:44,452
I've loved baseball...

405
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:48,583
ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

406
01:02:48,693 --> 01:02:52,094
...47. Marked down there,
say the officials.

407
01:02:52,197 --> 01:02:54,791
And at that point
it'll be first and ten--

408
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:56,457
I heard you had some trouble.

409
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:59,503
It'll be third and ten, another
of those big plays now...

410
01:02:59,604 --> 01:03:02,266
- Stupid.
- coming up for S.C.

411
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:04,638
People behaving like that
with guns.

412
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,303
...but it looks like
it could stall here.

413
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:10,176
The important thing is,
you're all right.

414
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:14,240
Good health.
The most important thing.

415
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:16,877
More than success.
More than money.

416
01:03:16,988 --> 01:03:19,752
- Now he's back to pass.
- More than power.

417
01:03:19,858 --> 01:03:21,951
Rolls up field for Hayes.
He's intercepted.

418
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:27,726
Hurd has it to the lrish 40.
To the far sideline. Gets by the 45.

419
01:03:27,832 --> 01:03:32,201
He's hit and dropped
at the S.C. 42-yardline.

420
01:03:32,303 --> 01:03:34,931
Notre Dame's first bigbreak
of the game.

421
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,840
I came here because there's
gonna be more bloodshed.

422
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:41,275
I want you to know about it
before it happens...

423
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:43,847
so that there's no danger
of starting another war.

424
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:46,974
Nobody wants another war.

425
01:03:47,085 --> 01:03:50,748
Frank Pentangeli came to my home
and he asked my permission...

426
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:52,379
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

427
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,822
When I refused,
he tried to have me killed.

428
01:03:54,926 --> 01:03:58,418
He was stupid. I was lucky.
I'll visit him soon.

429
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:01,829
The important thing is that
nothing interfere...

430
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:03,833
with our plans for the future.

431
01:04:03,935 --> 01:04:07,632
- Yours and mine.
- Nothing is more important.

432
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:09,229
Good.

433
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,241
You're a wise
and considerate young man.

434
01:04:12,343 --> 01:04:15,210
And you're a great man,
Mr. Roth.

435
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:19,340
- There's much I can learn from you.
- What can I do to help, Michael?

436
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:22,284
To the 32, and is downed there
by Danny Zika.

437
01:04:22,387 --> 01:04:24,878
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Oh.

438
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:26,889
- Okay.
- Ohh!

439
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:29,892
Hyman, you're gonna
break my ear drums.

440
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:33,188
- Okay, enjoy it.
- Thanks.

441
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,136
You're young.
I'm old and sick.

442
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:46,039
What we'll do together
in the next few months...

443
01:04:46,144 --> 01:04:48,271
will make history, Michael.

444
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:51,280
History.
It's never been done before.

445
01:04:51,382 --> 01:04:55,716
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

446
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:00,722
And Pentangeli is a dead man.

447
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:03,885
- You don't object?
- Pickup of four.

448
01:05:03,995 --> 01:05:05,895
He's small potatoes.

449
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:19,168
What's up?

450
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:23,246
We got company, huh?

451
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,388
Don Corleone, I wish you would've
let me know you were comin'.

452
01:06:06,497 --> 01:06:08,988
I could've prepared
something for you.

453
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:12,000
I didn't want you to know
I was coming.

454
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,036
You heard what happened
in my home?

455
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:24,080
- Mike, I almost died myself.
- In my home!

456
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:30,452
In my bedroom
where my wife sleeps!

457
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:37,191
Where my children come
and play with their toys.

458
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:39,194
In my home.

459
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:59,373
I want you to help me
take my revenge.

460
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:01,508
Michael, anything.

461
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,518
What can I do?

462
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:09,556
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

463
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,288
Mike, I don't understand.
I don't--

464
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:15,126
I don't have your brain
for big deals...

465
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:16,961
but this is a street thing.

466
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:20,195
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
That--

467
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:22,431
He's backin' up
those son-of-a-bitches.

468
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,471
I know.

469
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:26,907
Then why? Why do you ask me
to lay down to him, Mike?

470
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:36,384
It was Hyman Roth that
tried to have me killed.

471
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:41,316
I know it was him.

472
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:43,791
Jesus Christ, Mike.

473
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:45,794
Jesus Christ, look,
let's get 'em all.

474
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:49,195
Let's hit 'em all now,
while we got the muscle.

475
01:07:53,871 --> 01:07:56,271
This used to be
my father's old study.

476
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:59,775
It's changed.

477
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,612
I remember
there used to be a--

478
01:08:03,714 --> 01:08:05,614
A big desk was here.

479
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:10,519
I remember when I was a kid,
Frankie...

480
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:13,021
we had to be very quiet
when we played near here.

481
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:24,632
I was very happy that this
house never went to strangers.

482
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:29,499
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.

483
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:34,771
My father taught me
many things here.

484
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,278
He taught me in this room.

485
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:44,146
He taught me,
keep your friends close...

486
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,552
but your enemies closer.

487
01:08:46,657 --> 01:08:50,058
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that
I interceded in this thing...

488
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,027
in the Rosato brothers' favor...

489
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,928
he's gonna think his relationship
with me is still good.

490
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:02,497
That's what I want him to think.

491
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:07,305
I want him completely relaxed
and confident in our friendship.

492
01:09:07,411 --> 01:09:11,313
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

493
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:43,072
- Yeah?
- Fredo. This is Johnny.

494
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,580
Johnny Ola.
We need some more help.

495
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,843
Johnny?

496
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,852
Jesus Christ,
what the hell time is it?

497
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,923
- Who is that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

498
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:57,050
What are you callin' me here for?
I don't want to talk to you.

499
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,390
Pentangeli's set up a meeting
with the Rosato brothers.

500
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,828
- He's gonna go for their deal.
- Oh, God.

501
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:04,457
- Will he come alone?
- I don't know anything.

502
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,128
- You got me in deep enough already.
- Just go along.

503
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,228
Everything will be allright,
Fredo.

504
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:11,637
Pentangeli says he's
willing to make a deal.

505
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:14,643
All we wanna know is
if he's on the level.

506
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:19,272
You guys lied to me. I don't
want you to call me anymore.

507
01:10:19,383 --> 01:10:21,851
Your brother's not gonna
find out we talked.

508
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:24,853
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

509
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,731
Who was that?

510
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,733
Uh, wrong number.

511
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:48,844
Frank, I got nobody here.

512
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:50,846
- Wait in the car, Cheech.
- Frankie--

513
01:10:50,948 --> 01:10:52,848
It's okay, Cheech.

514
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:03,391
- What's this, Rosato?
- A lucky "C" note for our new deal.

515
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,230
Richie.
Give us a taste, huh?

516
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:17,863
Yeah, we're all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

517
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:22,412
- You're not gonna regret it.
- I don't like this "C" note.

518
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,980
I take that as an insult.

519
01:11:25,082 --> 01:11:27,312
Michael Corleone says hello.

520
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,495
Get him in!
Close the fuckin' door!

521
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:50,004
Your friend the cop.
What the--

522
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:52,837
Hey, Rich, it's dark in here.

523
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:57,346
- Are you open or closed?
- I just come in to clean up.

524
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:03,049
What's the matter?

525
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:06,122
- Is that somethin' on the floor?
- Carmine, no, no. Not here!

526
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:08,691
- Not here!
- Not here, Carmine! Not a cop!

527
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,692
What?

528
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:14,252
You open your fuckin' mouth,
I'll blow your head off!

529
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:02,143
Freddie. Good to see ya.

530
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,948
Where is he?

531
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,712
He's okay. He's in the back.

532
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,124
Come on, girls.
Take a hike, huh?

533
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:21,129
In this room here.

534
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,060
- I wanna talk to him alone first.
- Come on, huh?

535
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:39,181
I thought I could
help you, Senator.

536
01:13:43,053 --> 01:13:45,317
Hagen?

537
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:49,216
- Listen, Hagen, I did not--
- No.

538
01:13:49,326 --> 01:13:51,385
- It's all right.
- I didn't do anything.

539
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:53,622
It's okay.

540
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,994
You're very lucky.

541
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,567
My brother Fredo
operates this place.

542
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:01,466
He was called before anyone.

543
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:03,300
Now, if this had happened
someplace else...

544
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:04,464
we couldn't
have helped you.

545
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:12,982
When I woke up
I was on the floor...

546
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,983
and I don't know
how it happened.

547
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:16,985
You can't remember?

548
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:22,749
I passed out.

549
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,565
I'll fix it.

550
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:32,635
Okay.

551
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:41,004
It was just a game.

552
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:42,510
Jesus.

553
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:47,182
Oh.

554
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,783
Jesus! Jesus!

555
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:01,959
Jesus God.

556
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,999
Oh, God.

557
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:10,033
I don't know and I don't
understand why I can't remember.

558
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,973
You don't have to remember.
Just do as I say.

559
01:15:13,076 --> 01:15:15,670
They're putting a call in
to your office.

560
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:19,715
Explain that you'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

561
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:21,943
You decided to spend the night...

562
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:25,954
at Michael Corleone's house
in Tahoe as his guest.

563
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:29,557
I do remember
that she was laughing.

564
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,428
We'd done it before...

565
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,863
and I know that I could
not have hurt that girl.

566
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:39,901
This girl has no family.

567
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:41,994
Nobody knows
that she worked here.

568
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:44,573
It'll be as though
she never existed.

569
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:49,677
All that's left
is our friendship.

570
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,295
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.

571
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:11,356
- We're not to let you through.
- I'm just going to the market.

572
01:16:11,468 --> 01:16:14,028
Well, if you'll just give us a list,
we'll pick up anything you want.

573
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,368
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming.

574
01:16:17,474 --> 01:16:20,602
All right, well, I'm just gonna
have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

575
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:29,544
I wanted to explain this, but
I had business in Carson City.

576
01:16:29,653 --> 01:16:31,678
Now, this is Michael's
request for your safety.

577
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:34,382
- We can send out for anything.
- I see.

578
01:16:34,491 --> 01:16:36,459
I'm supposed to stay
in my house.

579
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,050
No, within the compound
would be fine.

580
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:41,426
I was going to take the children
to New England next week.

581
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:44,762
- That's off now.
- Am I a prisoner? ls that it?

582
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:47,336
- That's not the way we look at it.
- All right, come on, kids.

583
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,337
We're going back to the house.

584
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,608
Joe.

585
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:41,117
Cuba! Cuba!

586
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:25,200
Most respected gentlemen...

587
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:27,462
allow me to welcome you
to the city of Havana.

588
01:18:29,606 --> 01:18:34,600
I want to thank this distinguished
group of American industrialists...

589
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:38,546
for continuing to work
with Cuba...

590
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:42,511
toward the greatest period
of prosperity...

591
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:46,054
in her entire history.

592
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:51,550
Mr. William Shaw, representing
the General Fruit Company;

593
01:18:53,463 --> 01:18:55,328
Misters Corngold and Dant...

594
01:18:55,432 --> 01:18:58,230
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company;

595
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,767
Mr. Petty,
regional vice president...

596
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,272
of the Pan American
Mining Corporation;

597
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:10,172
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar;,

598
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:14,642
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada...

599
01:19:16,519 --> 01:19:19,818
representing our associates in
tourism and leisure activities;

600
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:24,258
and my old friend and associate
from Florida...

601
01:19:26,396 --> 01:19:28,557
Mr. Hyman Roth.

602
01:19:28,665 --> 01:19:30,428
I would like to take this
opportunity...

603
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:32,398
to thank United
Telephone and Telegraph...

604
01:19:32,502 --> 01:19:34,402
for their lovely Christmas gift:

605
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:40,942
a solid gold telephone.

606
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,581
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like to take a look at it.

607
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:49,813
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

608
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:52,979
Perhaps you would discuss
the status of rebel activity...

609
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:55,819
and what this can mean
to our businesses.

610
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:57,392
- Of course.
- Very lovely.

611
01:19:57,494 --> 01:19:59,962
I want to assure you
that although the rebels...

612
01:20:00,063 --> 01:20:03,260
have mounted an impressive
campaign in Las Villas...

613
01:20:09,506 --> 01:20:11,804
my staff indicates
with assurance...

614
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:16,811
we'll drive them out of the city
of Santa Clara before the new year.

615
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:21,975
And I want to put you all
at ease.

616
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:25,987
We will tolerate no guerillas
in the casinos or swimming pools.

617
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,774
He say that they are
making arrest...

618
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,777
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

619
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,372
Johnny.

620
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:18,032
Well, I hope my age
is correct.

621
01:21:18,141 --> 01:21:21,235
I'm always accurate
about my age.

622
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:24,905
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

623
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:31,447
I'm very pleased...

624
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,455
you were all able to come
from such distances...

625
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:35,751
to be with me today.

626
01:21:37,694 --> 01:21:40,390
When a man comes
to this point in his life...

627
01:21:41,931 --> 01:21:45,367
he wants to turn over the
things he's been blessed with--

628
01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:47,459
turn them over to friends--

629
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:51,802
as a reward
for the friends he's had...

630
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:57,141
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

631
01:21:57,247 --> 01:21:59,909
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear.

632
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:03,850
The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

633
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:10,383
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana...

634
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:13,553
and there's no limit to
where we can go from here.

635
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:18,430
This kind of government knows how
to help business, to encourage it.

636
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:22,561
The hotels here
are bigger and swankier...

637
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:25,300
than any of the rough joints
we've put in in Vegas.

638
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:28,741
And we can thank our friends
in the Cuban government...

639
01:22:28,845 --> 01:22:31,837
which has put up half of the cash,
with the Teamsters...

640
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:33,472
on a dollar-for-dollar basis;

641
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,416
has relaxed restrictions
on imports.

642
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:40,922
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

643
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,788
real partnership
with a government.

644
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,487
Smaller piece.

645
01:22:46,596 --> 01:22:49,156
You all know Michael Corleone...

646
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:51,495
and we all remember his father.

647
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:55,230
At the time of my retirement
or death...

648
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:59,798
I turn over all my interest
in the Havana operation...

649
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:01,137
to his control.

650
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:05,305
But all of you will share.

651
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:09,112
The Nacionale will go to
the Lakeville Road boys.

652
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:15,088
The Capri to the Corleone family.
The Sevilla Biltmore also.

653
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:19,059
But Eddie Levine of Newport will
bring in the Pennino brothers...

654
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:20,925
Dino and Eddie, for a piece...

655
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,863
and also to handle
the actual casino operations.

656
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:27,493
And we've saved a piece for
some friends in Nevada...

657
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:31,266
to make sure that things
go smooth back home.

658
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:36,334
I want all of you
to enjoy your cake...

659
01:23:36,446 --> 01:23:38,346
so enjoy.

660
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:40,348
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

661
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:46,144
I saw an interesting thing
happen today.

662
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:49,383
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police...

663
01:23:49,492 --> 01:23:51,255
and rather than be taken alive...

664
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:53,989
he exploded a grenade he had
hidden in his jacket.

665
01:23:54,097 --> 01:23:57,498
He killed himself, and he took
a captain of the command with him.

666
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,795
- Right,Johnny?
- Those rebels, they're lunatics.

667
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:03,167
- Yes, I agree.
- Maybe so.

668
01:24:03,272 --> 01:24:04,864
But it occurred to me...

669
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:08,307
the soldiers are paid to fight,
the rebels aren't.

670
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:10,572
What does that tell you?

671
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,580
They could win.

672
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:17,215
This country has had rebels
for the last 50 years.

673
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:21,950
It's in their blood. I've been
coming here since the '20s.

674
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:25,892
We were running molasses out
of Havana when you were a baby...

675
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:29,590
the trucks owned by your father.

676
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,167
Michael.

677
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:41,175
I'd rather we talked about
this when we we're alone.

678
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:47,014
The two million
never got to the island.

679
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:55,983
I wouldn't want it to get around
that you held back the money...

680
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:59,459
because you had second thoughts
about the rebels.

681
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:07,769
Ah, sit down, Michael.

682
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,770
Sit down.

683
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:20,079
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

684
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:22,515
Ohh.

685
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:25,086
What I wouldn't give for...

686
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:27,088
20 more years.

687
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:31,183
Here we are, protected--

688
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,353
free to make our profiits without
Kefauver...

689
01:25:33,463 --> 01:25:37,160
the goddamn Justice
Department and the FBl--

690
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:40,793
90 miles away, partnership
with a friendly government.

691
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:46,436
Ninety miles. It's nothing.

692
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:49,102
Just one small step,
looking for a man...

693
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:52,375
that wants to be President
of the United States...

694
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:55,849
and having the cash
to make it possible.

695
01:25:55,952 --> 01:25:57,852
Michael...

696
01:25:59,455 --> 01:26:02,322
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

697
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:30,884
Mikey, how are ya? Okay?

698
01:26:32,922 --> 01:26:35,652
Hiya. Freddie Corleone.

699
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:41,125
Jesus Christ, what a trip.

700
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,663
The whole time I'm thinkin'...

701
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:44,858
"What if somebody knows
what I got in here?"

702
01:26:44,967 --> 01:26:49,301
Imagine that. Two million dollars
on the seat next to me.

703
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:51,305
All right.

704
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:55,275
- Whoops. Excuse me.
- No, it's okay.

705
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,480
You wanna count it?

706
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,378
Mikey, what the hell's
goin' on anyway?

707
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,720
The family's making
an investment in Havana.

708
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:13,158
- This is a gift for the president.
- Oh.

709
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:15,230
Well, that's great.

710
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:17,231
Havana's great.

711
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:20,234
It's my kind of town.

712
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,864
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- I don't know.

713
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,941
Hyman Roth? Johnny Ola?

714
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:31,937
No. I never met them.

715
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:38,016
Listen, Mikey...

716
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,020
I'm kind of, uh--

717
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:44,958
kind of nervous from the trip.

718
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:48,690
Uh, can l-- can I get
a, uh, drink or somethin'?

719
01:27:48,798 --> 01:27:52,063
I thought maybe we'd--
we'd go out together.

720
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:55,069
I know a place we can spend
some time together. Okay?

721
01:27:57,573 --> 01:28:00,736
Sometimes I think I should've
married a woman like you did...

722
01:28:00,843 --> 01:28:03,243
Like Kay.

723
01:28:03,346 --> 01:28:05,746
Have kids, have a family.

724
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:11,818
For once in my life
be more like...

725
01:28:13,222 --> 01:28:14,814
Pop.

726
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:21,826
It's not easy to be a son,
Fredo. It's not easy.

727
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:25,059
Mama used to tease me. She'd say,
"You don't belong to me.

728
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:28,694
You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

729
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,671
Sometimes I think it's true.

730
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,674
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

731
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:37,302
Mikey, I--

732
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:39,313
I was mad at you.

733
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:50,491
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

734
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:52,993
You want a drink, right?
Waiter.

735
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:03,670
- How do you say banana daiquiri?
- Banana daiquiri.

736
01:29:03,773 --> 01:29:06,037
- That's it?
- That's it.

737
01:29:06,142 --> 01:29:09,043
- Uh, uno banana daiquiri.
- Banana daiquiri. Si, senor.

738
01:29:09,145 --> 01:29:11,545
And, uh, a club soda.

739
01:29:19,388 --> 01:29:22,186
Senator Geary's flying in
from Washington tomorrow night...

740
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,691
with some people,
some government people...

741
01:29:24,794 --> 01:29:27,957
and I want you to show 'em
a good time in Havana.

742
01:29:30,299 --> 01:29:32,733
It's my specialty, right?

743
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:35,998
- Can I trust you with something?
- Ofcourse, Mike.

744
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:43,142
In the evening, we're all invited
to the presidential palace...

745
01:29:43,245 --> 01:29:45,805
a reception to bring in
the new year.

746
01:29:45,915 --> 01:29:47,815
After it's over...

747
01:29:47,917 --> 01:29:50,442
they're gonna take me home
in a military car...

748
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:54,250
alone, for my protection...

749
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:57,757
and before I reach my hotel
I'll be assassinated.

750
01:30:16,112 --> 01:30:19,172
- Who?
- Roth.

751
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:27,888
It was Roth who tried
to kill me in my home.

752
01:30:29,692 --> 01:30:31,751
It was Roth all along.

753
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:37,094
He acts like I'm his son,
his successor...

754
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:40,134
but he thinks he's gonna live
forever and he wants me out.

755
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:46,333
How can I help?

756
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:49,809
You just go along
as though you know nothing.

757
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:53,848
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

758
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,440
Hyman Roth'll never see
the new year.

759
01:31:13,769 --> 01:31:16,363
He says you have to take it easy
and he'll give you a prescription.

760
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:17,734
He'll be back tomorrow.

761
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,274
I want my own doctor.
Fly him in from Miami.

762
01:31:20,376 --> 01:31:22,571
I don't trust a doctor
can't speak English.

763
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:30,851
Honey, go down to the casino.

764
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:34,354
- If you're sure you're better.
- Feel fine.

765
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:39,089
- Play the bingo game.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

766
01:31:39,195 --> 01:31:41,163
-Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

767
01:31:43,032 --> 01:31:44,431
My sixth sense tells me...

768
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:47,058
your brother Fredo brought
a bag full of money.

769
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:50,332
Where is it?

770
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:52,873
You're pulling out?

771
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:56,877
Just wanna--
I just wanna wait.

772
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:02,843
How do you feel?

773
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:05,147
Terrible. I'd give four million...

774
01:32:05,254 --> 01:32:08,485
just to be able to take a piss
without it hurting.

775
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:11,890
Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?

776
01:32:11,994 --> 01:32:14,360
The Rosato brothers.

777
01:32:14,463 --> 01:32:18,024
I know. But who gave
the go-ahead?

778
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:21,034
I know I didn't.

779
01:32:28,244 --> 01:32:30,769
There was this kid
I grew up with.

780
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,041
He was younger than me.

781
01:32:33,148 --> 01:32:35,639
Sort of looked up to me,
you know.

782
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:39,312
We did our first work together.

783
01:32:39,421 --> 01:32:41,480
Worked our way
out of the street.

784
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,581
Things were good.
We made the most of it.

785
01:32:44,927 --> 01:32:47,418
During Prohibition...

786
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:49,497
we ran molasses into Canada.

787
01:32:49,598 --> 01:32:52,066
Made a fortune. Your father too.

788
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:57,629
As much as anyone...

789
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,265
I loved him and trusted him.

790
01:33:03,312 --> 01:33:06,770
Later on he had an idea...

791
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:09,043
to build a city...

792
01:33:09,151 --> 01:33:12,848
out of a desert stopover for G.I.s
on their way to the West Coast.

793
01:33:14,924 --> 01:33:18,621
That kid's name was Moe Green...

794
01:33:18,727 --> 01:33:21,958
and the city he invented
was Las Vegas.

795
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:26,133
This was a great man...

796
01:33:26,235 --> 01:33:28,726
a man of vision and guts...

797
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:34,002
and there isn't even a plaque
or a signpost or a statue of him...

798
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:37,010
in that town.

799
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:40,570
Someone put a bullet
through his eye.

800
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:45,182
No one knows
who gave the order.

801
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:48,415
When I heard it I wasn't angry.

802
01:33:48,524 --> 01:33:50,549
I knew Moe;
I knew he was headstrong.

803
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:54,561
Talking loud,
saying stupid things.

804
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:57,894
So when he turned up dead...

805
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,197
I let it go...

806
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,534
and I said to myself...

807
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:08,542
"This is the business
we've chosen."

808
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:11,442
I didn't ask...

809
01:34:11,547 --> 01:34:13,447
who gave the order...

810
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:16,484
because it had nothing
to do with business.

811
01:34:25,127 --> 01:34:29,029
That two million
in a bag in your room--

812
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:33,867
I'm going in...

813
01:34:33,969 --> 01:34:36,028
to take a nap.

814
01:34:36,138 --> 01:34:38,231
When I wake...

815
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:42,003
if the money's on the table
I'll know I have a partner.

816
01:34:42,111 --> 01:34:44,511
If it isn't,
I'll know I don't.

817
01:35:40,202 --> 01:35:42,329
All right, does everybody
know everybody here, huh?

818
01:35:42,438 --> 01:35:44,406
- This is Senator Geary.
- How are you, Senator?

819
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:47,737
Good to see you, Mike. I'm glad
we could spend time together.

820
01:35:47,843 --> 01:35:50,903
- Senator Payton from Florida.
- How you doing, Mike?

821
01:35:51,013 --> 01:35:53,447
- And Judge DeMalco from New York.
- How do you do, sir?

822
01:35:53,549 --> 01:35:55,710
- Fine, thank you.
- Senator Ream from Maryland.

823
01:35:55,818 --> 01:35:59,117
- I've been looking forward to this.
- This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

824
01:35:59,221 --> 01:36:02,713
- I know Fred. How are you?
- Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha.

825
01:36:02,825 --> 01:36:06,283
- Oh, he does, huh?
- Gentlemen, it's refiill time.

826
01:36:06,395 --> 01:36:10,923
Try some of them local drinks--
uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

827
01:36:11,033 --> 01:36:14,901
I think I'll try one of
those redheaded Yolandas.

828
01:36:15,003 --> 01:36:18,939
- That you got. Congusto.
- Johnny.

829
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:22,670
You don't know my brother Fredo,
do you, Johnny? Johnny Ola, Fredo.

830
01:36:22,778 --> 01:36:24,939
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

831
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,914
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana.

832
01:36:30,018 --> 01:36:31,918
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

833
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:35,883
- Happy New Year.
- That's right, huh?

834
01:36:40,062 --> 01:36:43,395
- Checkin' in now. Right now.
- Never fear! Pat Geary's here!

835
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:46,332
- Hey, Fred.
- Cheers! Hey!

836
01:36:46,435 --> 01:36:48,926
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standin'?
- Come on, man!

837
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:51,801
Everybody stands,
but it's worth it.

838
01:36:51,907 --> 01:36:54,705
- You're not gonna believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

839
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:58,337
- That's right. Fifty dollars.
- You got a bet, mister.

840
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:09,256
That's him. That's Superman.

841
01:37:41,924 --> 01:37:44,518
- Jesus Christ!
- Did I tell ya, or did I tell ya?

842
01:37:46,295 --> 01:37:48,855
- I don't believe it.
- That thing's gotta be a fake.

843
01:37:48,964 --> 01:37:52,866
That ain't no fake. That's real.
That's why they call him Superman.

844
01:37:52,968 --> 01:37:56,961
Hey, Freddie. Freddie.
Where did you find this place?

845
01:37:57,072 --> 01:37:59,438
Johnny Ola told me about
this place. He brought me here.

846
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,441
I didn't believe it,
but seein' is believin', huh?

847
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:05,001
- I see it and I don't believe it.
- Fifty bucks, Pat.

848
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:06,671
Old man Roth'd never come here...

849
01:38:06,782 --> 01:38:09,649
but ol'Johnny knows these places
like the back of his hand.

850
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,345
Now watch him. He's gonna
break the cracker with it.

851
01:38:12,454 --> 01:38:15,719
I wanna see him break a brick.

852
01:38:15,824 --> 01:38:18,224
He could knock down a building.

853
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:39,835
Relax, Senor Roth. We're
taking you to the hospital.

854
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:31,390
And in my judgment
you'll continue to get those...

855
01:40:31,493 --> 01:40:34,360
because I don't believe
that President Eisenhower...

856
01:40:34,463 --> 01:40:35,930
will ever pull out of Cuba.

857
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:39,728
Not as long as we have over one billion
dollars invested in this country.

858
01:40:42,971 --> 01:40:46,532
Now, the American public
believes in nonintervention.

859
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:49,542
Fredo. Where you goin'?

860
01:40:49,644 --> 01:40:52,841
I'm gonna get me a real drink,
'cause I can't--

861
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:52,328
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

862
01:41:52,441 --> 01:41:55,968
Ream, what's the protocol? How long
should we stay around here?

863
01:41:56,077 --> 01:41:58,978
Oh, I don't know. I think
a half hour oughta do it.

864
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,571
Just long enough
to bring in the new year.

865
01:43:36,077 --> 01:43:40,070
There's a plane waiting for us
to take us to Miami in an hour.

866
01:43:40,181 --> 01:43:42,581
Don't make a big thing about it.

867
01:43:46,655 --> 01:43:49,055
I know it was you, Fredo.

868
01:43:49,157 --> 01:43:51,955
You broke my heart.

869
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:55,086
You broke my heart.

870
01:45:36,264 --> 01:45:39,631
Fredo! Come on.

871
01:45:39,734 --> 01:45:43,033
Come with me. It's the only
way out of here tonight.

872
01:45:43,138 --> 01:45:45,732
Roth is dead. Fredo.

873
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,775
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother!

874
01:45:48,877 --> 01:45:51,710
Fredo! Fredo!

875
01:46:10,732 --> 01:46:12,563
U.S. passports only.

876
01:46:15,303 --> 01:46:20,070
- U.S. passports only.
- I'm from the United States Senate.

877
01:46:22,744 --> 01:46:25,076
- Back, please.
- Please! I must leave!

878
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:36,541
Al, get me a wet towel.

879
01:47:43,591 --> 01:47:45,491
Kay know I'm back?

880
01:47:50,298 --> 01:47:53,597
What about my boy? Did you get
him something for Christmas?

881
01:47:53,701 --> 01:47:57,193
- I took care of it.
- What was it so I'll know?

882
01:47:57,305 --> 01:48:00,763
It was a little car with an electric
motor that he could ride in.

883
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:02,775
It was nice.

884
01:48:05,013 --> 01:48:07,846
Thank you, Al.

885
01:48:07,949 --> 01:48:10,383
Fellas, could you step outside
for a minute, please?

886
01:48:28,536 --> 01:48:30,436
Where's my brother?

887
01:48:30,538 --> 01:48:34,474
Uh, Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

888
01:48:34,576 --> 01:48:37,511
He had a stroke.
He recovered okay.

889
01:48:37,612 --> 01:48:42,106
- Your bodyguard's dead.
- I asked about Fredo.

890
01:48:42,217 --> 01:48:45,152
I think he got out. He must be
somewhere in New York.

891
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:51,081
All right.

892
01:48:51,192 --> 01:48:54,093
I want you to get
in touch with him.

893
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:57,221
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything's all right.

894
01:48:57,332 --> 01:48:58,993
Tell him I know Roth misled him;

895
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,694
that he didn't know
they were gonna try to kill me.

896
01:49:03,605 --> 01:49:05,869
And they can come in now.

897
01:49:05,974 --> 01:49:08,670
Oh, there was something else.

898
01:49:08,776 --> 01:49:11,404
What?

899
01:49:16,417 --> 01:49:18,351
What?
Come on. What?

900
01:49:20,855 --> 01:49:22,982
Kay had a miscarriage.
She lost the baby.

901
01:49:36,004 --> 01:49:38,404
- Was it a boy?
- After three and a half months--

902
01:49:38,506 --> 01:49:42,772
Can't you give me a straight answer
anymore? Was it a boy?

903
01:49:45,446 --> 01:49:47,346
I really don't know.

904
01:54:17,885 --> 01:54:18,817
I take care of everything.

905
01:56:00,888 --> 01:56:02,856
Vito, here's my $50.

906
01:56:21,976 --> 01:56:25,935
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
