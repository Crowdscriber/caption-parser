Previously on "Vikings":

2
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:03,785
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

3
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:05,921
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

4
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,089
The seer prophesized

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,890
that your father
would have many sons.

6
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:10,759
I'm with child again.

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,128
I know you're a boy - my son.

8
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:16,364
Lord Ragnar, I have come
to swear my allegiance to you

9
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:17,733
and your family.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,801
Leif, you are my friend.

11
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:20,969
I would like to be a free man.

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,370
Does it matter?

13
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:23,972
Everyone else in your
world is subject to the law.

14
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:25,807
Why do you say, "your world"?

15
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:28,443
<i>You live here now.</i>
<i>This is your world.</i>

16
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,312
You were once
married to an Earl,

17
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,247
would you not like to be married
to another one?

18
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,316
Who? Me.

19
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:36,985
The gods desire
you to have a great future,

20
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:40,856
<i>but they can withdraw</i>
<i>their good will at any time.</i>

21
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:44,192
<i>Our lives are fated,
we all have to accept that.</i>

22

32
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,573
Every nine years,

33
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:03,411
we travel to the temple
at Uppsala,

34
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,679
to give thanks to the gods

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,616
and to offer them sacrifices
for all they do for us.

36
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:12,620
For protecting us,
for the success in battle,

37
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:16,124
<i>for the rains that they bring</i>
<i>that grow our crops</i>

38
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:20,228
and, of course,
for our children.

39
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,534
<i>This year</i>
<i>I was not going to go,</i>

40
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:30,638
for there is too much to do
around here.

41
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:37,945
Then my unborn son
was cruelly taken from me,

42
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,851
and it made me wonder
what I had done

43
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,187
<i>to anger the gods.</i>

44
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,769
What do christians do
about such pain?

45
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:06,374
In the Bible, it says that
all sorrows will pass.

46
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:12,914
In any case,
I've decided to go.

47
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:18,219
I'm going to take the children
for the first time,

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,788
for it's important
that they go.

49
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,890
What about you?

50
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,694
Me? What about me?

51
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:30,164
Will you come with us?

52
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:35,570
<i>Perhaps you would prefer</i>
<i>to stay here</i>

53
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:38,172
and worship your own God.

54
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,881
No, I'll gladly come with you.

55
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,584
Good.

56
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:52,687
I would have taken you anyway.

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,362
A gift for the
gods, for the children.

58
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,103
<i>Pray for my
daughter's recovery.</i>

59
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,772
A gift for the gods.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,842
Pray for health and prosperity.

61
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:25,152
<i>My gift for the gods.</i>

62
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,856
<i>I ask their blessings</i>
<i>for my son.</i>

63
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:35,162
Gyda, you take the offerings.

64
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,598
For the gods in
thanks for my new baby.

65
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,400
Thank you.

66
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,106
Ragnar...

67
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:50,511
Are you not happy
that we're going to Uppsala?

68
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,813
Of course I'm happy.

69
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,617
Why should I not be happy?

70
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:00,554
When we reach Uppsala,

71
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:04,659
we shall ask the gods
why they give with one hand,

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,595
but take away with the other?

73
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:11,699
Why they make me Earl,
yet kill my son?

74
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:16,671
We can have more sons.

75
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:19,840
Have we not tried?

76
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:04,085
Arne.

77
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:13,327
<i>Gyda, step up.</i>

78
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,963
<i>Careful.</i>

79
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,065
Ragnar.

80
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,072
Uppsala!

81
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,088
Floki!

82
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,390
Does he know?

83
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:51,826
No.

84
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:38,973
Hail to the
Aesir and the Vanir.

85
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:42,209
Hail to the gods and goddesses.

86
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:45,746
Hail to Odin, Thor, and frey.

87
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:50,050
Hail to Vali, Sif,
and Heimdall.

88
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:54,188
Hail to Balder, Bragi, and Eir.

89
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:57,558
Hail to Freja, Loki, and Frigg.

90
00:08:57,626 --> 00:09:01,595
Hail to Lin, Ifon, and Mimir.

91
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:04,732
<i>Hail to Njord, Ran, and Tyr.</i>

92
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:09,703
Hail to Odin's spear,
Thor's hammer.

93
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:13,140
Hail to the mighty
fecund earth.

94
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:14,808
All...

95
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:18,946
All hail.

96
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:20,114
<i>All hail.</i>

97
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,049
All hail.

98
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:34,295
You know who
that is, don't you?

99
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:36,230
Of course.

100
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:40,167
This is Thor,
holding his hammer, Mjollnir.

101
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:44,138
Who hasn't heard him beating
his anvil in the storm?

102
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,973
Who doesn't believe in
mighty Thor,

103
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:47,975
slayer of frost and fire?

104
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:50,644
<i>Freja, Loki, and Frigg.</i>

105
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,747
<i>Hail to Lin, Ifon, and Mimir.</i>

106
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:57,318
<i>Hail to Njord, Ran, and Tyr.</i>

107
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,587
<i>Hail to Odin...</i>

108
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:03,090
Frey, lord,

109
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:07,995
fill me with seed
and give me a son.

110
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:10,331
Do as you will with me,

111
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:13,601
make me blind
or deaf if you want to,

112
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:18,505
but give me a son
before it's too late.

113
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:22,610
<i>- Hail to...</i>
<i>- All hail.</i>

114
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,183
<i>Hail to Freja, Loki, and Frigg.</i>

115
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:32,319
Odin, father.

116
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,022
<i>I have come to ask</i>
<i>for your love.</i>

117
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:37,057
<i>I want to grow and to prosper,</i>

118
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:40,361
<i>to quicken and be wise.</i>
<i>Hear me, lord.</i>

119
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:42,863
<i>All hail.</i>

120
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,135
<i>Hail to the
Aesir and the Vanir.</i>

121
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,871
<i>Hail to the gods</i>
<i>and goddesses...</i>

122
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:54,808
<i>Lord of lords,</i>

123
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:59,880
father, hear my prayer.

124
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:04,485
Let me understand your will.

125
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:08,222
<i>Is it true that I shall</i>
<i>have more sons</i>

126
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,291
like the seer says?

127
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,064
Accept the sacrifice
I plan to offer you...

128
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,834
And then answer me.

129
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:25,472
<i>Hail to the Aesir
and the Vanir.</i>

130
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:28,575
<i>Hail to the gods</i>
<i>and goddesses...</i>

131
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:30,377
<i>Hail to Odin, Thor...</i>

132
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:33,580
Who will bear me my son?

133
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:35,582
<i>Sif, and Heimdall.</i>

134
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:38,786
<i>Hail to Balder, Bragi, and Eir.</i>

135
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:43,057
<i>Hail to Freja, loki, and Frigg.</i>

136
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,629
How good is this, rollo?

137
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:50,564
Especially because
we're here together.

138
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:53,467
Yes, while we're here
in Uppsala

139
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:58,038
let us enjoy and revel
in every moment.

140
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:07,447
Have you been here before,
Helga?

141
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:09,149
No.

142
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,817
Do you know what happens here?

143
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:12,819
I've heard some stories.

144
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,755
<i>And they're all true.</i>

145
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:17,090
But they still don't
prepare you

146
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,925
for what really happens here.

147
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:23,863
I can't wait to find out.

148
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:28,034
When is the food ready, Helga?

149
00:12:28,135 --> 00:12:29,536
I'm hungry.

150
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:32,839
You're always hungry.

151
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:36,610
Of course I am...
But not always for food.

152
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:48,788
Can you feel it, Gyda?

153
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,460
Can you sense the presence
of the gods gathering here?

154
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,463
They have left
their bright halls to see us.

155
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,632
They are here for sure.

156
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,467
<i>They walk among us.</i>

157
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,602
And make their judgments on us.

158
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,939
So when do we offer
our sacrifices?

159
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,108
At the end of the festival.

160
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,744
<i>And in the meantime,
we celebrate the gods</i>

161
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:14,080
<i>and enjoy their presence</i>
<i>in any way we can.</i>

162
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,785
Give Athelstan a drink.

163
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:23,223
Priest... your cup.

164
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:31,698
<i>Mother, you came here before?</i>

165
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,866
Once.

166
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,201
And did you ask the gods
for anything?

167
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:40,206
Yes. And they granted
my every desire.

168
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,508
What is this?

169
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:20,513
These will all be killed
as sacrifices.

170
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,584
Six, seven, eight, nine.

171
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:26,086
<i>Seven, eight, nine.</i>

172
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:28,154
And nine goats, and nine pigs.

173
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:29,823
There's nine of everything!

174
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,926
Yes, nine of every kind.

175
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:39,432
And this?

176
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,503
It's for all the humans
that have been chosen.

177
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,588
Come join us, priest.

178
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:18,928
Drink.

179
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:28,905
And, uh, eat these.

180
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,464
I heard a rumor
today that King Horik himself

181
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:31,567
may attend the festival.

182
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:36,673
It is not a rumor.

183
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,941
I desire to meet him.

184
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,914
There are great stories
and legends told about him.

185
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,420
Thank you.

186
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:08,604
You want to go out there,
don't you?

187
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,943
Please stay.

188
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,948
Why can't you stay?

189
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,428
<i>Priest...</i>

190
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,783
You are surely
not tired, Athelstan.

191
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,653
<i>Not on this great journey</i>
<i>you have begun,</i>

192
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,922
and must finish.

193
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,296
Leif...

194
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,300
If you let me go
I will fall again.

195
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:27,370
No, the gods will hold you.

196
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:59,535
Priest, I have
been waiting for you.

197
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:47,616
Gyda, what is it, child?

198
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:49,719
I am bleeding.

199
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:54,423
Then you are no longer a child.

200
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:55,958
Forgive me.

201
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,894
You are a woman.

202
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:08,404
But let me cradle you
in my arms a last time,

203
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:11,140
as I always used to do.

204
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,512
It is hard for me
to let go of you.

205
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:54,183
Why do you do this, Thyri?

206
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:58,087
Don't you understand?

207
00:22:58,188 --> 00:23:00,456
I have to.

208
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,479
Priests, stir yourselves!

209
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,849
- You ignorant peasant!
- Wake up!

210
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,284
How dare you disturb us?!

211
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:00,785
Wake up! Get out!

212
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:02,921
Get out of the temple!

213
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,090
<i>Priests!</i>

214
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:08,326
If you value your lives,
stop this at once.

215
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:11,329
Fools! This is king Horik.

216
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:41,426
Athelstan, I want
you to meet someone.

217
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,943
Ha! Ha! You
must be Ragnar Lothbrok!

218
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:05,083
I must tell you it is
my privilege and pleasure

219
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:06,785
to clap eyes on you.

220
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:09,187
Your reputation goes ahead
of you, Ragnar Lothbrok.

221
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:12,490
I know this because
so many have told me

222
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,126
how you killed Earl Haraldson

223
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:17,228
and then built
a new kind of ship...

224
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:18,997
were the first to sail west

225
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:21,432
and defeated a king of england!

226
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,870
In fact,
I can hardly believe my eyes

227
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:29,574
that you are standing right here
in front of me.

228
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:31,910
Please, please.

229
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,848
Travelers and
storytellers have described

230
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,817
how you came to your throne

231
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:40,919
by defeating, one by one,

232
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,921
the six uncles
that killed your father.

233
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,989
And my mother,

234
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,159
and all my sisters
and brothers.

235
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:53,531
I also know how you
favor the poets at your court,

236
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,100
and your people respect
your law making,

237
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:58,136
your justice, and your rule.

238
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:03,308
And as a consequence,
here, on this site,

239
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,644
in the living presence
of the gods,

240
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:11,883
I offer you my fealty

241
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:15,220
and my service.

242
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:25,897
I accept your pledge,
with a glad heart.

243
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:30,902
What can I do for you
in return?

244
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:35,173
You could join forces with me.

245
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:36,341
I am not satisfied

246
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:39,344
with what I have achieved
so far.

247
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:43,581
I want to send bigger
raiding parties to the west;

248
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:45,116
Yes, to plunder,

249
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:48,119
but also to explore new lands.

250
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,455
There are other lands
to the west?

251
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:52,991
There is a kingdom
called Frankia...

252
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:56,060
a kingdom far larger,
far richer,

253
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:59,797
and far more powerful
than england.

254
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:01,900
Athelstan, come.

255
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:05,637
<i>Come.</i>

256
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:08,940
This man has seen it.

257
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:13,311
I was a
Christian monk in england.

258
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,347
I traveled to other lands
as a missionary.

259
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:18,983
I have heard of christians,

260
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,885
<i>and of their God.</i>

261
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:24,656
And are you still a Christian?

262
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:27,458
No.

263
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,793
Of course not!

264
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:32,363
How could you be a Christian
and walk among our gods?

265
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,265
I share your appetite
for new adventure,

266
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,067
<i>Ragnar Lothbrok,</i>

267
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:38,269
and I will gladly join forces
with you,

268
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,472
since, as king,
I am naturally not in favor

269
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,541
of individual enterprise

270
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,977
by my earls, or anyone else.

271
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,381
But, believe me,
I will be happy enough

272
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,083
just to have my name
linked with yours

273
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:56,020
when the poets tell the story
of how we norsemen sailed west

274
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,022
and discovered new worlds.

275
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:05,563
Please, come. Eat, eat.

276
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:16,741
Why did you
bother to come back?

277
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,409
I was hungry.

278
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,844
Hmm.

279
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:27,452
How many women
have you been with?

280
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,721
I don't suppose you know.

281
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:32,457
I do what I want here.

282
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:35,126
I thought we came here
together.

283
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,495
We came here with Earl Ragnar.

284
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,464
I thought we came here
together and...

285
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:42,867
we did come here together.

286
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,969
We are together.

287
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,941
Why do you keep pestering me?

288
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:55,780
I am who I am
and I won't change,

289
00:28:57,383 --> 00:29:00,018
not for you,
not for my brother,

290
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,553
not for anyone.

291
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,925
So leave if you want to.

292
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:16,234
But one day
I will be a great man

293
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:17,702
and you'll regret leaving me

294
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:21,172
just because I sleep
with other women.

295
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:41,059
If you really want to be
a great man,

296
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,896
should you not be meeting
with king Horik now?

297
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,064
What do you mean?

298
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:50,334
Well, that's where
your brother is now,

299
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:53,137
and no doubt
he's already boasting

300
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,339
about how he sailed west,
alone,

301
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:59,510
and all he has achieved...
Alone.

302
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,980
If you weren't so stubborn
and so drunk,

303
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:06,017
you would be there too,
but you weren't invited.

304
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:09,220
You didn't even know about it.

305
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,224
I could have told you.

306
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,961
You see, rollo,

307
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:19,464
you need me
as much as I need you.

308
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:25,369
That is, if you really
want to be something.

309
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,815
Ragnar Lothbrok,

310
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:45,017
I drink to your good fortune.

311
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:46,919
May the gods continue
to favor you

312
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,522
and increase your fame.

313
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:53,626
May they do the same to you,
king Horik.

314
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,628
You have done me the honor
of pledging your fealty,

315
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:56,862
as Earl, to me.

316
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:59,698
Forgive me, then,
if I seem anxious

317
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:03,802
to make use of your skills
and reputation...

318
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,405
As soon as possible.

319
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,809
To do what?

320
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:14,079
There is a Jarl in Gotaland,
Jarl Borg.

321
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:15,314
He is an important fellow,

322
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,917
but he continues to claim
he has legal rights

323
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:20,286
over some of my land.

324
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:21,720
He threatens me.

325
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:24,623
He nearly invaded my territory
a year ago,

326
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,092
but at the last moment
he drew back.

327
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,763
And now, once again,

328
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:34,667
he is making
threatening noises.

329
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:42,675
And how can I be of help
in such a matter?

330
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:49,882
Would you be prepared to travel
to Gotaland as my emissary?

331
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,050
I can think of no one

332
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:52,785
who I would rather
represent my case,

333
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:56,689
for your fame is widespread.

334
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,891
If the issue is settled,

335
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,127
I shall be forever
in your debt.

336
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,332
<i>What do you say?</i>

337
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:37,396
Come.

338
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:31,250
Have you come here
of your own free will?

339
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:38,290
Yes.

340
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:43,829
At first, I was
suspicious of you.

341
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,899
I sensed something,

342
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,502
so I spoke to lord Ragnar.

343
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:55,607
That you were a priest,

344
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,877
that you were a Christian,

345
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:02,014
and worshipped a God
called Jesus Christ.

346
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:04,083
Is that true?

347
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:07,019
Yes.

348
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,723
And do you still worship
this God?

349
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:14,593
Are you still, in your heart,
a Christian?

350
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:16,362
No.

351
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:20,632
Say again.

352
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,635
No.

353
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:28,774
And a third time...

354
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,277
say it.

355
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:38,417
No.

356
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:49,995
You know why you're here,
don't you?

357
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:55,033
<i>You have been brought here</i>
<i>as a sacrifice to the gods.</i>

358
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,162
<i>I have come to tell you</i>

359
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:28,801
that the sacrifice of this man
will not please the gods.

360
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:30,636
<i>He is neither willing</i>

361
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:34,673
<i>nor is his faith acceptable</i>
<i>to Odin.</i>

362
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:37,676
<i>His heart is corrupt.</i>

363
00:35:37,777 --> 00:35:41,780
<i>He has not renounced</i>
<i>his false God.</i>

364
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:48,787
Looks like your God
finally came through for you.

365
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:54,693
<i>Instead, one
amongst you must agree</i>

366
00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:58,497
<i>to take his place tomorrow</i>
<i>at the sacrifice.</i>

367
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:01,600
<i>If not, then all shall fail.</i>

368
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,874
<i>The gods in their anger</i>
<i>will punish everyone,</i>

369
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:13,378
<i>and withdraw their protection</i>
<i>from all of us.</i>

370
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:23,822
No, not you.

371
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:47,346
Before anyone else
can claim this honor,

372
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:53,785
I desire to be sacrificed.

373
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,555
<i>For the sake of my family,</i>

374
00:36:56,623 --> 00:37:01,159
for the sake of all of you,

375
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:05,864
my friends.

376
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,038
<i>But even more, for the sake</i>
<i>of all humans in Midgard.</i>

377
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,675
I trust that the gods will find
my sacrifice acceptable.

378
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:21,780
In which case,
I look forward to it joyfully.

379
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:30,900
