thinking fishing boat.

and you didn�t knock out the 75,

11
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:50,363
your offer would be about 37,000,

12
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:53,782
so there's a wedding plus a gown.

13
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:56,828
There's no denying, Michael,
that is exceptionally good cash.

Yeah, I�m OK. Sorry.

44
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,403
I probably should have
said it a bit slower

45
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:16,365
and not just go and blurt it out
like that.

- They took her away.

What about the cops, honey?

50
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,831
They showed up and they took
a statement and that,

51
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:28,832
but I said that I was 18

52
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,293
and now I don't really know
what I�m supposed to do.

53
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:32,836
Right, right.

54
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,589
They didn't say anything, you know.

55
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:36,633
Like, am I supposed to organise
the funeral and that?

56
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,717

what I�m supposed to do

Yeah.

61

that you were on top of everything,

62

You're one of the weak ones.

just weak because you're young.

a raid on the house.

1279

what with all the strange activity,

I think J's made his position clear.

1352
01:35:55,905 --> 01:35:59,535
Where that leaves us now
is to decide how best to proceed,

1353
01:35:59,535 --> 01:36:02,320
given the brave offer
of assistance he's made.

1354
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:07,293
You know, this thing's going to trial
with or without J, that's a given.

01:36:07,293 --> 01:36:09,534
What we want is to win it.

You know what I liked
about the committal hearing?

1357
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,845
Despite the fact that we've been
ordered to stand trial, of course.

1358
01:36:17,845 --> 01:36:22,139
But what I liked about the committal
was that for the most part,

1359
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:24,600
their case looked
pretty flimsy to me.

1360
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,269
Largely dependent
on witness testimony

1361
01:36:26,269 --> 01:36:29,646
that shouldn't be too hard to
discredit, I wouldn't have thought.

1362
01:36:29,646 --> 01:36:32,983
And if the committal�s any indicator,
then J here's their star witness.

1363
01:36:32,983 --> 01:36:36,861
Without him, they'll need
to strengthen their brief,

1364
01:36:36,861 --> 01:36:39,319
which they will do
with something else.

1365
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:43,827
Personally, I�d rather tackle
the evidence I saw at the committal

1366
01:36:43,827 --> 01:36:46,414
than any rejigged brief
they come up with

1367
01:36:46,414 --> 01:36:48,914
should J suddenly decide to leave.

1368
01:36:48,914 --> 01:36:50,583
You know what I mean?

1369
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,420
So I think we should
just get into it.

You shouldn't have left the house.

I was hiding.

OK? They'd been told
something funny was going on here.

1377
01:37:35,374 --> 01:37:37,211
It was just a fuckin' mix-up.

1378
01:37:37,211 --> 01:37:39,460
Now, you're not in any danger,
alright?

1379
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,005
I need you to understand that.

No.

1383

I�m fine.

- Yeah.

1418
01:40:49,056 --> 01:40:53,302
So to some extent you feel
responsible for Nicole's death.

1419
01:40:54,894 --> 01:40:57,398
I don't know, maybe to an extent.

1420
01:40:57,398 --> 01:40:59,524
But you want your uncles
put away for it,

1421
01:40:59,524 --> 01:41:01,692
even though you didn't see them do it

1422
01:41:01,692 --> 01:41:04,362
and she was justifiably upset
on this night

1423
01:41:04,362 --> 01:41:05,987
because you had ended
the relationship.

1424
01:41:05,987 --> 01:41:07,573
You're looking for someone to blame

1425
01:41:07,573 --> 01:41:09,241
for something
you feel responsible for.

1426
01:41:09,241 --> 01:41:12,325
Would you agree with that?
Blah, blah, blah.

1427
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,872
It's good.

1428

- You feel OK?
- You OK, sweetheart?

1429
01:41:26,507 --> 01:41:29,177
Yeah, I�m fine. Can you go grab us
a drink or something?

1430
01:41:29,177 --> 01:41:31,219
Of course.

1431

There must be a drink machine
around here somewhere.

SMURF: That's all due to this trauma.

1435
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:49,350
Now, my family�s been dragged
through the mud over this.

1436
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:52,062
And that kind of action
plays heavy on your mind.

1437
01:43:52,062 --> 01:43:55,188

Alright. Maybe that's enough of that.

What?

1446
01:44:19,418 --> 01:44:23,006
So we'd shoot you guys
watching the TV

1447
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:25,925
Like you're watching a news report
of yourselves, celebrating.

No, I�m not doing that.

No, these might be different.

Hi.

I just want you to know I don't
bear you any ill will, Mr Leckie.

I really don't.

You were just doing your job.

I hope you catch the people
who did that terrible thing.

1459
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:29,859
If you're as smart
as I think you are,

1460
01:45:29,859 --> 01:45:31,570
you'd know to walk right on by me

before in our lives,

You'll come unstuck.

I've got a feeling about it.

1465

I think you do too.

1466
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:48,295
I reckon you probably carry
that feeling around with you
