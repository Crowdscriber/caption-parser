00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,690
<i>I'm not wrong about Flint.</i>

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,392
- <i>To him we're all disposable.</i>
- I don't believe that.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,796
That's because you don't know about
Mrs. Barlow.

5
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:16,097
You found the schedule.

6
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,433
What if I forgo payment
for the schedule

7
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,468
in exchange for my share
of the prize?

8
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:21,870
We'll need some
additional items.

9
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:24,305
- <i>New guns... 12-pounders.</i>
- You'll have it.

10
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:25,774
Without the Urca
we have nothing.

11
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,909
Without Vane
we don't have the Urca.

12
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:30,812
Our friend tried to protect you.
You left anyway.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,449
- Why?
- How did you feel when
she threw you aside?

14
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,651
Eleanor, wait.

15
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:41,322
<i>- Listen to me carefully.</i>
<i>- You are finished.</i>

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,192
Unless you decide to join
the crew of Captain Flint.

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,627
Looks like she just
gave us a ship.

18
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:47,762
Ship with no captain.

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,071
- So sorry he did this to you.
- He didn't do this to me.

20
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:51,599
You did.

21

22
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,014
Captain Gates.

23
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:53,621
It's time.

24
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:16,577
First item for the council
concerns leadership.

25
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:19,314
As you know, I've been
asked to serve as captain

26
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:22,050
of the Ranger when next we sail.

27
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,419
Obviously that means less
time spent with you idiots.

28
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,087
So...

29
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:29,757
you will need somebody to act
as your quartermaster in the meantime.

30
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:33,261
Unless anybody's got
any better ideas,

31
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,430
I was thinking Billy Bones.

32
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,804
I thought so.

33
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,605
Billy.

34
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,509
<i>Ahem.</i>

35
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:51,980
Next item... careening.

36
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,215
<i>Bad start, Billy.</i>

37
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,851
She's long overdue.
If we're gonna win the Urca,

38
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,720
the Walrus must be shipshape.
That means we tip her.

39
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:00,888
Plain and simple.
The question is,

40
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,623
where do we do the tipping?

41
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:05,693
Wherever there's plenty of rum.

42
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:07,562
As always, the ship's
account is open.

43
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,965
Rum casks and Mr. Simpson's buttered
oranges are on their way.

44
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,501
And the pigs are being readied
for Mr. Silver's spit.

45
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:17,165
Now, to return to the issue
of location.

46
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,539
What about the fuck tent?

47
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,242
That's probably something
we can discuss.

48
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,545
Fuck tent! Fuck tent!

49
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:27,215
Mr. De Groot.

50
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,153
You may not like
what I have to say,

51
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:35,123
<i>but if it remains unsaid,</i>
<i>I fear the worst.</i>

52
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,325
<i>I've inspected the shoreline</i>
<i>proposed by the captain</i>

53
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:39,894
for this undertaking
and it is simply unsuitable

54
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:42,363
to the task at hand.
The anchorage is poor.

55
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,332
<i>The incline too steep.</i>

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,001
I cannot endorse it.
The risk for calamity is too high.

57
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,038
<i>With the crew's assent,</i>

58
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:53,674
I ask for time to find
a more suitable beach.

59
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,109
<i>And delay our efforts</i>
<i>by how long?</i>

60
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:58,212
Two weeks?
A month?

61
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,251
A clean hull

62
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:06,521
means an extra knot
or two in speed,

63
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:09,490
five degrees or more
in coming about.

64
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,260
It's essential
to the job at hand.

65
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:16,798
If we had weeks,
we'd surely take them.

66
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:19,333
But we must sail within days

67
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,335
<i>if we are to meet the Urca.</i>

68
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:23,805
Now, Mr. De Groot's
concerns are valid...

69
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:27,909
<i>but they come at a price.</i>

70
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:32,413
$5 million in Spanish gold,
to be exact.

71
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,059
All those in favor
of the captain's plan

72
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,327
to careen here near the bay?

73
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,930
Aye!

74
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,932
It would appear
the ayes have it.

75
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,533
Nay.

76
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,708
Mr. Morley's dissent is
noted along with Mr. De Groot's.

77
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:05,279
All right,
let's beach this bitch.

78
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:09,016
Yeah, quick question, then. Where are
we on the issue of the fuck tent?

79
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,320
- Yeah!
- This job is gonna happen fast.

80
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:15,823
That means more risk,
more danger.

81
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,592
Now you've put a great
deal of trust in me

82
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,861
to serve in Mr. Gates' absence,
and I take that seriously.

83
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:23,464
So given the potential
for distraction and delay

84
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,266
at a time that we need
to be at our best,

85
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,035
perhaps we can all
agree to forgo,

86
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:31,639
just this once, a fuck tent.

87
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,799
You shouldn't have.

88
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,684
Stale winds, still waters.

89
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:19,387
Don't be such an old lady.

90
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:20,821
The men will rise to it.

91
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,457
What say you,
Mr. Quartermaster?

92
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,626
You think it's a good idea?

93
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,862
Yeah, I think the captain
knows what he's doing.

94
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:36,270
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

95
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,707
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

96
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,179
Number of years back,

97
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,149
before you crewed up with us,

98
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,652
Flint had us hunting
a merchant ship,

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,021
the Maria Aleyne.

100
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,623
Sephardic trade...

101
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:59,060
gold, pearls, jewels.

102
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:02,763
"More than we'd ever know
what to do with," he said.

103
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:05,533
But that's Flint's gift,
isn't it?

104
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:09,870
Always knows just what
to say to push us harder,

105
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:13,674
further, make us all
pull together for the cause.

106
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:16,244
We tracked that bitch for months

107
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,813
without refitting or careening,

108
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,582
till finally we spotted her.

109
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,552
We lost good men taking her

110
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,256
for a haul nowhere near
what Flint had promised.

111
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:31,692
While I was exploring the hold,

112
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,996
I chanced upon a cabin
and that's when I heard it.

113
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:39,267
'Twas a man and a woman
begging for their lives.

114
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:44,105
"Spare us,
and our fortune's yours."

115
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:48,242
For a moment, I thought
all our shares

116
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,611
were gonna be worth
a whole lot more.

117
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,448
But that's when
the screams began.

118
00:08:57,252 --> 00:09:00,821
And when I watched
the murderer leave,

119
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:03,457
I saw him plain.

120
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:08,963
Did you tell anyone?

121
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,032
Gates.

122
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:16,137
He was unmoved,
to say the least.

123
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:20,508
"Just one rich bastard less
in the world," he said.

124
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,611
At the time, I'll admit,
I took his point.

125
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,982
But days later we come ashore.

126
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,485
I see a lady waiting for Flint.

127
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:35,523
The rest of the crew thought she's
just some fancy bit of Puritan tail.

128
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,958
But when Flint reaches her,

129
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:41,562
<i>two words escape his lips.</i>

130
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,331
<i>"They're dead."</i>

131
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,966
Hunting the Maria Aleyne

132
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,536
was never about money.

133
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:50,404
It was an execution.

134
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:53,007
<i>All those men we lost</i>
<i>taking her,</i>

135
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,943
they died so Flint could settle

136
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:59,814
some personal vendetta <i>for her.</i>

137
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,717
You watch.

138
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:06,520
Good men will die
for some hidden agenda.

139
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,756
The Barlow woman's agenda.

140
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,524
Mark my words, Billy.

141
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,862
It's all happening again.

142
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,786
<i>Will you be staying long?</i>

143
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,222
I have to get back.

144
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,696
If you're upset with me,
I'd appreciate you saying so.

145
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,234
You know why I'm upset.

146
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,070
Because I read to him?

147
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:32,239
There's a whole shelf
full of books.

148
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,742
Why'd you have
to read him that one?

149
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,912
Perhaps because
I am no longer willing

150
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:41,148
to bury it on a shelf and
pretend it has no meaning for me.

151
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:50,157
That book is something
I shared with Thomas.

152
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:56,630
<i>I just missed it.</i>

153
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,568
Our life then

154
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:03,237
when he was alive.

155
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,374
I can feel myself forgetting it

156
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:08,843
and I don't want to forget it.

157
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:15,149
This place, this life
that we've been living here,

158
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:18,419
it doesn't feel like
living anymore.

159
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,258
I can't be alone
in feeling this way.

160
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:29,230
Some part of you
must feel it, too.

161
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,548
Things will get better here.

162
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,719
I promise you they will.

163
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,533
Here you go.

164
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:15,910
Christ.

165
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:19,246
<i>One week without a ship</i>
<i>and you go completely to hell.</i>

166
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,549
Is it too much to ask
that you not pick a fight

167
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:24,118
over every insult
thrown our way?

168
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:26,946
<i>Especially when I'm out there swallowing
what little pride I have left</i>

169
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:28,656
trying to set things right.

170
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,460
I see we've graduated to opium.

171
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,902
Miss Guthrie has
dealt us quite a blow.

172
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,438
But we still have assets.

173
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:47,741
<i>Eight loyal men, my wits,</i>

174
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:50,244
<i>and an unshakable captain.</i>

175
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,214
I'm doing what I can
to regain us our livelihood,

176
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:56,650
but once that's done,
this crew, such as it is,

177
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:59,320
will need its captain back.

178
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,255
See what you can do
about finding him.

179
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,097
Fuck you, Jack.

180
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,363
It was an isolated incident.

181
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,032
No cause for concern.

182
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,268
Your girl humiliated one of
this island's strongest earners,

183
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,070
threatened his crew
with embargoes

184
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:52,806
so they had no choice
but to toss him aside.

185
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:54,475
I've had three other
captains approach me

186
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,143
all asking the same question...

187
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,345
who's next to lose
their livelihood

188
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,347
<i>because they crossed her</i>
<i>on the wrong day?</i>

189
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,949
No one is next.

190
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,320
Every morning for months now
when I walk the beach into town,

191
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:09,456
I see Captain Lilywhite
standing on his stoop

192
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:11,425
and jabbering away
to anyone who will listen

193
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,161
<i>about the evils</i>
<i>of a centralized fence.</i>

194
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,563
Arguing that this island
will never be free

195
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:20,067
until we all come together
to cast off the tyrannical yoke

196
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,836
of Queen Eleanor.

197
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:25,005
I see him out there, too.

198
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,275
And I have never seen
any more than three men

199
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,977
paying him any attention.

200
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,211
Half-wits,
all of them.

201
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,213
There were 12 of them
this morning.

202
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,584
This business with Vane
has changed things.

203
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,288
Get control of her,
Mr. Scott,

204
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:42,923
before it's too late.

205
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,196
Sail spotted.
The Andromache.

206
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,006
Captain Bryson is arriving
on the Andromache.

207
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:00,441
<i>You'd best get down</i>
<i>to the beach.</i>

208
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:02,009
What did Captain Hornigold want?

209
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:07,948
Let me guess.

210
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,550
The captains grousing
about last week

211
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,938
think I've lost
my grip on reason.

212
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,253
<i>Fuck Hornigold.</i>

213
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:15,022
Fuck the captains
and fuck anyone else

214
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,091
who doesn't like the way
I manage this place.

215
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,567
What we're about to attempt
with Captain Bryson,

216
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,869
it is very risky.

217
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,738
If he will not cooperate,

218
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:32,806
we cannot,
under any circumstances,

219
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:34,875
attempt to detain him.

220
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,610
- What makes you think I'd try?
- 'Cause I know you.

221
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,479
I know what you think
is at stake.

222
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,115
And I know you think you
cannot take no for an answer.

223
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:42,950
Why should I?

224
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,021
Eleanor, if you make a move

225
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,857
against Captain Bryson
or his ship,

226
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:52,493
you'll be making a move against
the Guthrie Trading Company.

227
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,461
A direct affront
to your grandfather

228
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,196
<i>and his interests in Boston.</i>

229
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,332
That ship belongs to him.

230
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,933
When he finds out
what you've done,

231
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:03,403
no one...
not I nor your father...

232
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,974
will able to protect you
from the consequences.

233
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,811
If Bryson balks,
we must let him go.

234
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:14,782
And the guns Flint needs?
What about them?

235
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,550
We'll find them some other way.

236
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:20,053
I never ask anything of you.

237
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,822
This I must insist on.

238
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,092
Tell me you understand.

239
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,898
I understand.

240
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,794
- How we doing?
- Ahead of schedule.

241
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,897
Ready to raise the keel.
I think we might actually pull it off.

242
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,300
We'll have Billy
to thank for that.

243
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,768
<i>I have no idea how he's done it,</i>

244
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,503
<i>but he's kept them</i>
<i>to a schedule.</i>

245
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,038
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I've ever seen a crew</i>

246
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,439
<i>work this fast and this hard.</i>

247
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,109
<i>A few more days,</i>
<i>we'll have the keel cleared</i>

248
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:19,179
<i>and tarred and she'll be ready</i>
<i>to go back into the water.</i>

249
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:21,181
Excuse me, Captain.

250
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,018
That's it.
Secure these ropes.

251
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:27,354
<i>Listen here,</i>
<i>you smart-mouthed fuck.</i>

252
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,356
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

253
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:32,693
I said I've got the shits. What part
of that don't you understand?

254
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,194
What's going on?

255
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:36,630
His rotten pig gave the lot of us
the bloody squirts.

256
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,265
It's possible it wasn't
the pig, you know.

257
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,867
Some people have
weak constitutions.

258
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,236
Hey!
Settle down.

259
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,678
Mmm. It's delicious.

260
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,547
It's likely as not
it wasn't the pig.

261
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,083
It's just something that's going around.
Get back to work.

262
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,655
Thank you.
I'm glad someone here likes...

263
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,092
What the fuck
did you do to that?

264
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:06,894
I cooked it...?

265
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:08,495
You absolutely did not.

266
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,197
The men seemed to think
it looked done.

267
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,432
Yes, well, they'd eat it raw if left
to their own devices.

268
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,935
That's awfully cynical.

269
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:24,244
Go get another pig.

270
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,582
Do exactly as I say.

271
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,608
Now you see how it can be?

272
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:57,477
When I'm made
to feel comfortable,

273
00:19:57,545 --> 00:20:02,115
you are made to feel
<i>le toucher de dieu.</i>

274
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,721
<i>It's like our bodies</i>
<i>are all made up of these</i>

275
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,090
secret little
compartments, she says,

276
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,793
what's got pleasures
hidden inside 'em.

277
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,529
And it just takes someone

278
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:19,066
who knows how to unlock 'em.
That's it.

279
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:49,262
Your friends,
they have seen the reward

280
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,365
<i>for gentle obedience.</i>

281
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:54,001
If pleasure is what you want,

282
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:57,637
I assure you I can give it to you
if you let me.

283
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:08,615
Indeed.

284
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,156
- Captain Bryson.
- Mistress Guthrie.

285
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,027
I trust your passage
was comfortable.

286
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,530
My cargo will be inventoried
and off-loaded in the morning.

287
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:58,198
You'll find the books
in good order.

288
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,586
That's good to hear, but I was
hoping we could have a word.

289
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:05,505
Seeing as our every word only
prolongs my stay in this cesspool,

290
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,507
I trust you'll make it quick.

291
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:10,143
I thought it best
you heard from me first.

292
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:13,246
One of our crews intends
to hunt the Urca de Lima.

293
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,350
A move against a state asset?

294
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:19,019
And your father
hasn't quashed it?

295
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,721
- No, he hasn't.
- Why on earth not?

296
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:23,590
Why don't you ask him yourself?

297
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:25,859
He'll be in my tavern shortly.

298
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:34,267
I understood you meant
to hide his presence here.

299
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,536
We did until this morning.

300
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:39,973
Stand up, please, sir.

301
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,048
Once upon a time Mr. Scott
was my personal houseboy.

302
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,351
Until he proved himself worthy

303
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,286
of greater responsibility.

304
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:55,355
That earned him an education

305
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:57,591
which he then
passed on to my daughter.

306
00:22:57,658 --> 00:22:59,926
And look where that's gotten me.

307
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,463
I'm afraid I still don't follow.

308
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:08,668
Captain Bryson commands the largest
of my supply ships.

309
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:11,338
My daughter needs
the guns from that ship

310
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:13,073
to arm Captain Flint

311
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,009
for his move against
the Spanish treasure galleon.

312
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:18,812
Parting Bryson
from his guns, however,

313
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,081
will require some convincing.

314
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,718
Evidently, Eleanor knows
better than to try to do it herself.

315
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:27,654
And how can she be sure
you won't betray her

316
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:31,591
and alert Captain Bryson
to the fact of your arrest?

317
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:34,928
Because Bryson would have no choice
but to liquidate our holdings here

318
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,264
and return me to Boston
a failure.

319
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:41,368
Therefore, whatever resentments
I might feel towards my daughter

320
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:44,738
and your friend the captain,
I must put aside.

321
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:48,175
Absorb the blow, as it were.

322
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:50,043
Like a rocky promontory.

323
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,315
At any rate, I have
a meeting to attend.

324
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,689
Shall we?

325
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:22,342
When I get my share
of that Spanish gold,

326
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,345
I'm going to fuck my way
through high society.

327
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:27,981
Nary a duchess's
snatch be uncharted.

328
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:34,754
What the fuck is this?

329
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,389
You said tie it to the palm.

330
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:38,558
That palm.
That one.

331
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:41,294
<i>You tied it to</i>
<i>the wrong fucking tree.</i>

332
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:45,999
Yes, it matters.

333
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,034
Jesus, fix it, will you, please?

334
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:53,540
Christ.

335
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:56,209
Give a man a little
bit of power.

336
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,078
What the fuck
difference does it make?

337
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,846
They're both trees, ain't they?

338
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:02,048
Agreed.

339
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,785
Quick fuck?

340
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,547
<i>Shove over, Randall.</i>

341
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,718
The shade's mine
for the next hour.

342
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:40,420
Don't want no arguments.

343
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:42,489
Did you bring me barnacle?

344
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:44,557
Oh, fuck.

345
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,793
Sorry, mate.

346
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:48,795
I forgot.

347
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:51,798
You promised.
For Betsy.

348
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:54,567
You're right.

349
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,936
Hold my spot.

350
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:02,809
What the...?

351
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,681
Hey, what the fuck
is your problem?

352
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:09,349
No problem at all, sir.

353
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,584
Just doing my share
for a worthy cause.

354
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:13,987
Oh, so what is it?
You tell me a story

355
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,122
and I'm supposed to fall
in lockstep behind you?

356
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,758
You wouldn't even
raise your voice

357
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,728
to question the captain's plan.
Didn't even consider it.

358
00:26:21,796 --> 00:26:24,698
Maybe I considered it and
decided it was making sense.

359
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,333
Maybe.

360
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,903
Or maybe there's something
you'd rather not say out loud.

361
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:34,207
Thought when that lackey
Gates stepped aside,

362
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:36,076
we might have finally
gotten a quartermaster

363
00:26:36,143 --> 00:26:38,211
who wasn't fully in
the captain's pocket.

364
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,048
Guess I was mistaken.

365
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,302
How exactly does the most feared
captain of the high seas

366
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,304
learn how to spice
and glaze a pig?

367
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,339
What do you care?

368
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:10,043
Well, I don't, really.

369
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,231
It's just that there's something
we need to talk about

370
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,781
and I thought a little
small talk beforehand

371
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,289
might be better
than diving right in.

372
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:18,651
What the hell
are you talking about?

373
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,056
What are we going
to do about Billy?

374
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,192
Beg your pardon?

375
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,695
As much as it pains
me to say this,

376
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:31,464
as he has been nothing but warm
and welcoming to me,

377
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:35,034
he appears to be
straining at the seams.

378
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:37,537
- I thought maybe we ought to have...
- <i>Stop.</i>

379
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:41,508
There is no we. Billy Bones is
a dutiful boatswain

380
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:45,145
who commands enormous respect
from his crew as well as from myself.

381
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:47,847
I trust him
a thousand times more

382
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,216
than I would a rodent
like yourself.

383
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,352
Understood.

384
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:55,955
- All that being said...
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

385
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:58,057
I saw Billy speaking
with Mr. Morley

386
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,692
late last week.

387
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,628
At night.

388
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:03,096
In secret.

389
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,298
That supposed to mean
something to me?

390
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:08,535
Well, he lied about
the page being blank.

391
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:10,603
I believe it's wearing on him.

392
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,939
I told you once,

393
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,774
I won't tell you again.

394
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,776
I trust Billy.

395
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,244
Trust <i>me.</i>

396
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:20,947
I'm purely in this for
myself and you know this.

397
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:23,817
I've no reason to tell you anything
other than the truth.

398
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:26,352
Both our futures depend on this.

399
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,888
I haven't decided yet
whether you even have a future.

400
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,757
But I can tell you this,

401
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:33,092
trying to play me
against my own crew

402
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,528
will not help your cause.

403
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:40,834
Turn your pig.
It's almost done.

404
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:26,980
- I can't do it, Jack.
- Of course you can.

405
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,949
You simply present my crew's haul
to Miss Guthrie as if it were your own.

406
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,851
You get a percentage.
Everybody wins.

407
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,753
I get caught selling
a grain of salt for you,

408
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:36,322
the girl puts my crew
on the outs same as you.

409
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,492
<i>I just can't risk it.</i>

410
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,828
It ain't you she has
a problem with, Jack.

411
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,796
Why stick with him?

412
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,866
<i>It's a good question.</i>

413
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:48,701
No, it's not.

414
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:50,303
There are other ships.

415
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,305
Had a few offers, have you?

416
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,874
Makes sense.
You'd be an asset to any crew.

417
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,744
Now ask how many offers
good old Jack has received

418
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:00,079
since our run-in
with the lady Guthrie.

419
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:04,417
My only assets are my wits,
and as the man who just lost

420
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,686
5,000 pesos
of his ship's own money,

421
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:08,354
they are ill-valued
at the moment.

422
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:11,257
Join another crew right now,
the only task

423
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:15,061
I will be trusted with is swabbing out
the piss buckets.

424
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,370
And that, my darling, I feel
compelled to state out loud,

425
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:20,600
life is simply
too fucking short!

426
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,938
What, you're angry with me, too?

427
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:26,973
Hey! Jack Rackham!

428
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,909
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- A word.

429
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:32,345
I'm sorry, I'd prefer you made
an appointment. Quite a full day ahead.

430
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,281
You took one of my best
whores for your private use.

431
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:39,452
Every day she's not under
my roof fucking costs me money.

432
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,754
Ah, yes, but my crew
sees her as responsible

433
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:43,542
for the loss of a great deal
of their money.

434
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,591
They see this as a debt
being repaid, nothing more.

435
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,527
Well, I see it
as thieving bullshit.

436
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,295
Then I believe
we're at an impasse.

437
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:55,034
Disagreement without
prospect of resolution.

438
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:56,536
Fuck you, Jack.
Give me back the whore.

439
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,405
You'd take her back yourself
if you had the balls.

440
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:06,980
A few less men outside
that tent than yesterday,

441
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:09,782
which had fewer
than the day before.

442
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,252
Maybe I'll take you
up on that offer

443
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,388
sooner than later.

444
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:22,962
What the hell was that?

445
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,531
Do you have some problem with us
holding onto that whore?

446
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:31,137
You do realize she's the only thing keeping
what's left of our crew at our side.

447
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:34,741
Fuck you.

448
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,851
You want the guns
from my ship...

449
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,588
to hand over to a pirate?

450
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,156
That is correct.

451
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:52,125
Have you lost your mind?

452
00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:55,294
You know as well as I do your family
would never approve of this.

453
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:57,864
What my family approves
or does not approve

454
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:01,034
rests solely on one thing...
Eleanor...?

455
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,969
Profit.

456
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,605
Eleanor's arranged
a plan to deliver them

457
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,574
<i>quite a bit of it upon the success</i>
<i>of this operation.</i>

458
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:11,711
Enough to assuage any fears they
may have about repercussions.

459
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,713
I find that hard to believe.

460
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:17,150
You're a brilliant
seaman, Dyfed.

461
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:19,952
But in this instance,
you're out of your depth.

462
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:24,757
Commerce in this place
requires bold moves.

463
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:28,494
I'm fortunate enough to have a daughter
who has found one for us.

464
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,402
Perhaps you're right.

465
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,040
<i>Maybe I am out of my depth.</i>

466
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,778
And yet this feeling persists.

467
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:47,413
And what feeling is that?

468
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,416
I wonder, Mr. Guthrie,
if this might have something to do

469
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:53,519
with His Majesty's Ship the Scarborough
currently docked at Harbour Island.

470
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:55,655
Docked outside your home.

471
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,859
<i>My intent was to stop there first
and unload the slaves in my hold,</i>

472
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,494
<i>but when I saw her,</i>
<i>I thought better of it.</i>

473
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:05,698
His Majesty's ships
often use my port for resupply.

474
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:08,835
What are you implying?

475
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,607
I'd like to speak
with your father alone.

476
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:19,178
Whatever you can say to him,
you can say to me.

477
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:21,848
Eleanor, it's all right.

478
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,937
Your father can handle this.

479
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:46,706
He'll get you those guns.

480
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,741
Perhaps.

481
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,922
I couldn't leave it to chance.

482
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,194
Let us be frank.

483
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,996
You and I both know
the low regard

484
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:11,798
in which your family
in Boston holds you.

485
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:14,934
Quite frank, it seems.

486
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:17,436
If I returned unarmed
and they find

487
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:19,338
that I did so under
these circumstances

488
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:22,308
with only your orders
as justification,

489
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:25,978
I'll be buried in a shallow grave
somewhere out in Cambridge.

490
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:29,282
And what exactly do you believe "these
circumstances" to be?

491
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:31,884
The Navy on your doorstep.

492
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:33,820
You and your daughter

493
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:36,856
supporting a plan
as reckless as this.

494
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:40,193
It would seem, sir, that something's gone
terribly wrong with the operation here

495
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,462
and you two are scrambling
to save yourselves.

496
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:47,567
Tell me I'm wrong.

497
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:53,172
Let me tell you
how wrong you are.

498
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,374
I knew you wouldn't approve.

499
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:58,077
But I couldn't let him leave here
without giving up those guns.

500
00:34:58,145 --> 00:34:59,745
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:01,547
With everything
we've been through,

502
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:03,616
with everything
I've done for you...

503
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,918
- I'm doing this for us both.
- You lied.

504
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,490
Shame on you.

505
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,215
The guns are yours.

506
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:38,885
Mr. Hayes.

507
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,932
Truly something
to behold, this place.

508
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,700
You should be proud.

509
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:58,771
Come now, Mr. Scott.

510
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,841
It's as much your work
as Eleanor's.

511
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,511
What is this if not the moment
of your vindication?

512
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:08,547
It's time we got you back.

513
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:10,683
She'll get herself killed.

514
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:18,391
If she proceeds with
this Spanish galleon business,

515
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,393
attempting to steal
treasure from one empire

516
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,028
to finance a war
against another,

517
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:23,930
she will get herself killed.

518
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:26,866
Whether by English noose
or Spanish sword,

519
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,168
it's inevitable and you know it.

520
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,672
If she proceeds...

521
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,342
what did you say
to Bryson in that room?

522
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:39,779
Rest assured I had a plan.

523
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:41,981
Not just to end this insanity,

524
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,750
but to contend with
what comes next.

525
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,320
To keep her safe.

526
00:36:47,387 --> 00:36:49,288
I don't envy you.

527
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:53,459
You know that she'll stop at nothing
to save this place.

528
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,227
A place where she matters.

529
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:57,697
A place where <i>you</i> matter.

530
00:36:57,764 --> 00:37:00,766
Except that in your heart
you know the truth.

531
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,272
Places like this
aren't meant to last.

532
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:10,142
Help me, Mr. Scott.

533
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,179
Please.

534
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:16,048
Help me save her from herself.

535
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,105
Well, hello.

536
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,843
There's no need to be afraid.

537
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:48,948
You could help me if you like.

538
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:54,153
Aren't you the Gladwin boy?

539
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,658
Does your father know
you're out here all alone?

540
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:01,427
I can take you to him.

541
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,364
Oh!

542
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:07,700
Witch!

543
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,895
Captain. Visitor.

544
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:45,337
The guns are yours.

545
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:47,606
Captain Bryson's preparing
to off-load them as we speak.

546
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,876
Mr. O'Malley is on
the lookout to ensure he complies.

547
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:52,978
Take a seat.

548
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:03,222
To our endeavor

549
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,325
and success close at hand.

550
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,430
What's wrong?

551
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:13,566
Your father step out of line?

552
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,701
It's Mr. Scott.

553
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,904
In order to guarantee
Captain Bryson's acquiescence,

554
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:21,474
I put a plan into place
without Mr. Scott's knowledge.

555
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:25,411
I lied to him.

556
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,279
<i>Betrayed his trust.</i>

557
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:29,787
I didn't want to, but I just
didn't think he would understand.

558
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,784
Well, you can't expect him to.

559
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:34,587
Nobody will believe
it's possible until we show them.

560
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:36,722
But when that day comes,

561
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,758
you know what they'll say?

562
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,695
They'll say
that it was inevitable.

563
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:07,987
<i>Get back!</i>

564
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:11,390
Back off! Back off!

565
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:19,798
Get away!
Get away!

566
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:22,401
Everyone, get up to the beach now!
Come on!

567
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,811
<i>- Let's go! Let's go!</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

568
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:41,554
<i>She's going!</i>

569
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,291
Get out!

570
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:04,910
Oh, shit.

571
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,579
Randall!

572
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:10,983
- I'll go.
- Captain, there's no time.

573
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,818
The mainmast is holding
too much weight.

574
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,253
We have to cut her loose!

575
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:16,121
Save the mast.
Don't wait for me.

576
00:41:23,096 --> 00:41:26,198
He's dug in.
Help me.

577
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:29,735
Me leg! Me leg!

578
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,875
Pull! Pull!
One, two, three, pull!

579
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:41,347
It's taking too long.

580
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:48,387
How much time do we have?

581
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:49,588
We don't.

582
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:53,359
Billy, the time is now!

583
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,201
It's no bloody use.

584
00:42:10,243 --> 00:42:13,412
Your belt.
Give me your belt.

585
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,417
- Billy.
<i>- Cut the ropes!</i>

586
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,619
- Billy!
- All right!

587
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:22,921
Right.

588
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,391
Do it!

589
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:34,366
Bite.
Bite down on it.

590
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,971
Hold on, Randall.

591
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,139
Hold on.

592
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,576
All right, pull!

593
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:49,675
Shit.

594
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:08,527
I talked to De Groot.
You did everything you could.

595
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:13,465
Not everything.

596
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:14,900
<i>I should have stopped Flint.</i>

597
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,336
Honestly, son,

598
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,338
how could you have done that?

599
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,176
Careful, Billy.

600
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:31,650
Flint pushed it through and
I went along when I knew better.

601
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:33,786
Because you know
what's at stake here.

602
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:35,687
You know he's right.

603
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:37,623
That's not why I...

604
00:44:44,197 --> 00:44:46,398
It's because I'm afraid of him.

605
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,696
Billy and Morley.

606
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:19,832
That night on the ship,

607
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:21,800
what were they talking about?

608
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:25,070
Well, I didn't hear much,

609
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:28,006
but it sounded like they
were talking about a woman.

610
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:30,375
Somebody Barlow.

611
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:23,128
Success?

612
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:26,899
Would you mind?

613
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:37,309
The music you were playing,

614
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,779
<i>that's Purcell's Chaconne</i>
<i>if I'm not mistaken.</i>

615
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:46,018
You have an educated ear.

616
00:46:47,353 --> 00:46:50,155
My father employed a tutor
for all his children

617
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:52,457
so that they might learn
to appreciate music.

618
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:55,727
I took to it the least
of my siblings.

619
00:46:55,795 --> 00:46:59,131
But for reasons beyond me,
some of it stuck.

620
00:47:03,636 --> 00:47:06,438
<i>There's a pronounced</i>
<i>sense of sadness</i>

621
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:08,640
<i>in Purcell's pieces.</i>

622
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:11,343
Considering your circumstances,

623
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,978
I can understand their appeal.

624
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:18,050
And what is it you think you understand
of my circumstances?

625
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:19,952
Truthfully,

626
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:22,854
I might know everything,
Mrs. Hamilton.

627
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:26,959
<i>Don't be alarmed.</i>

628
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:30,395
<i>I have no intention of
disclosing your identity to anyone.</i>

629
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:34,299
I'm sorry, sir. I think you have me
mistaken for someone else.

630
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:37,102
The portrait
in your room depicts you

631
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,204
alongside Lord Thomas Hamilton,

632
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:41,707
son of Alfred Hamilton,

633
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:44,776
the lord proprietor
of these Bahama Islands.

634
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:47,980
Forgive me.

635
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:51,083
I must have gotten
disoriented and wandered.

636
00:47:53,686 --> 00:47:56,622
You see, I've had extensive dealings
with the earl over the years,

637
00:47:56,689 --> 00:48:00,325
and so I'd long heard
of the tragedy

638
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:03,128
that befell his eldest son.

639
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:05,364
<i>But Thomas's wife,</i>

640
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:08,567
long rumored to be
the cheating sort,

641
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,602
had begun a torrid affair

642
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,105
with her husband's
closest friend,

643
00:48:13,172 --> 00:48:17,142
a promising young officer
in His Majesty's Navy.

644
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:22,714
And upon discovering the affair,

645
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:25,450
Thomas went mad with grief.

646
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:29,321
<i>His despair so great,</i>

647
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:32,457
<i>even the asylum couldn't</i>
<i>protect him from himself.</i>

648
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:38,730
As for Thomas's wife,

649
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:42,234
she's said to have fled
London along with her lover.

650
00:48:42,301 --> 00:48:45,303
Partly out of shame,

651
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:48,573
<i>partly to escape retribution.</i>

652
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:51,243
Given the facts at hand,
I am forced to assume

653
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,545
that the lover is none other

654
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:56,181
than our friend Captain Flint.

655
00:48:57,483 --> 00:49:00,419
<i>Please understand,</i>
<i>I raise this issue</i>

656
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:03,121
<i>not to disturb or harass you.</i>

657
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:06,992
In fact, I wish to help you.

658
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:10,696
Help me?

659
00:49:10,763 --> 00:49:14,366
I can only assume that
your exile in this place

660
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:17,335
has been less than ideal.

661
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:21,707
I understand how desperation

662
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:23,675
may have driven you here,

663
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:27,779
but perhaps it's time
you were offered a hand

664
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,015
and a return to civilization.

665
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:36,521
And you could offer me that?

666
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:43,028
Boston is quite a different animal
from London.

667
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:48,533
More forgiving of one's past

668
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,469
in a general sense.

669
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:52,504
And in this specific sense,

670
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,273
with my family's assistance,

671
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:59,277
one might find
total absolution there.

672
00:49:59,345 --> 00:50:01,780
<i>New identities.</i>

673
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:04,750
<i>A clean start.</i>
<i>A new life.</i>

674
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:06,852
I could do that for you.

675
00:50:06,919 --> 00:50:09,354
Why on earth would you?

676
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:12,424
<i>Because I know what it is</i>
<i>to be judged unfairly.</i>

677
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:14,459
And because
it's just possible that,

678
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:17,329
while I am uniquely situated

679
00:50:17,396 --> 00:50:19,831
to offer you your freedom,

680
00:50:19,899 --> 00:50:22,734
you may be able
to do the same for me.

681
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,220
<i>Hello, Charles.</i>

682
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,798
You've looked better.

683
00:50:52,865 --> 00:50:54,633
Fuck you.

684
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,968
<i>We're alone.</i>

685
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:01,873
You don't have
to pretend with me.

686
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,912
The fuck did I ever do to you?

687
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:10,582
You made me look weak.

688
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:15,053
Standing beside you,
I was your lesser.

689
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:20,325
I was a girl.

690
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:24,196
<i>From the moment you met me,</i>

691
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:26,464
<i>you must have known</i>
<i>I'd never settle for that.</i>

692
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,802
For being less than.

693
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,838
That's why I loved you.

694
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:37,642
And you destroyed me.

695
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:41,847
<i>I exposed you.</i>

696
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:44,482
The weakness behind the mask.

697
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:50,789
The fear.

698
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:57,095
So much I have taken from you.

699
00:51:59,265 --> 00:52:00,932
And yet still...

700
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:06,137
you know you could
take it all back.

701
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:11,309
You could be strong again.

702
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:14,012
<i>You could resist me.</i>

703
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:18,783
You could take this whole
fucking island from me.

704
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:25,657
You know exactly what
it is you need to do.

705
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,394
Where it is
you need to go to do it.

706
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,331
If only you weren't
so goddamn afraid.

707
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:54,646
Ain't this a sad sight?

708
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:03,088
Miss Guthrie should
have just had you killed.

709
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:05,590
It would have been
more merciful.

710
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:08,560
Now, are you going
to give me back me whore?

711
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:14,766
Jesus!
On my shoe!

712
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,135
<i>Oh, fuck it.</i>
<i>Put him out of his misery.</i>

713
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:28,013
Oh, for Christ...

714
00:54:44,196 --> 00:54:46,598
Wait!

715
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:47,899
Listen to me!

716
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:55,473
The whorehouse,

717
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:58,176
<i>I'll cut you in for half.</i>

718
00:54:58,244 --> 00:55:00,779
We'll be partners.

719
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:02,313
Please.

720
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:32,911
Do you know who I am, Pastor?

721
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:34,979
I do.

722
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:38,550
You're the reason this island
is infested with criminals.

723
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:43,054
God teaches us not to cheer
when others stumble.

724
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:46,424
In your case,
I may ask His forgiveness.

725
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:49,894
And what does God
say about redemption?

726
00:55:49,962 --> 00:55:52,964
Accept His love
and you'll find it.

727
00:55:53,032 --> 00:55:54,472
What if I was prepared
to go further?

728
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:56,067
Further?

729
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:59,504
Penance for my past sins.

730
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:02,807
<i>Good works.</i>

731
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,776
<i>And they begin tonight.</i>

732
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,845
Who's there?

733
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:09,080
Mr. Scott.

734
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:11,249
What are you doing here?

735
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:13,284
I thought you might use a hand.

736
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:18,223
Bastard's finally bringing in the first
of the guns.

737
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:21,226
Took him long enough.

738
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,363
He takes his cargo seriously.

739
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:31,302
You look tired.
Why don't I take over?

740
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,239
Miss Guthrie told me I was to see
those guns off with my own eyes.

741
00:56:36,308 --> 00:56:38,576
I understand.

742
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,989
<i>I brought the fiends</i>
<i>to this place.</i>

743
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:54,425
Encouraged them.

744
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:56,427
Enriched them.

745
00:56:56,495 --> 00:56:58,897
Empowered them.

746
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,568
It seems as though my penance
ought to be a simple one.

747
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,872
I will see to it

748
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,008
that they are cast
out of this place.

749
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,478
Soon.

750
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:15,547
And for good.

751
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:21,486
The Andromache.
It can't be.

752
00:57:21,554 --> 00:57:23,054
Captain Bryson
hasn't had time to unload.

753
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:25,056
He didn't.
She's riding low.

754
00:57:25,124 --> 00:57:27,425
<i>Those guns are still on board.</i>

755
00:57:27,493 --> 00:57:28,860
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

756
00:57:32,097 --> 00:57:34,098
Get them back.

757
00:57:35,562 --> 00:58:39,180
