2
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:07,411
What's with all the yogurt?

3
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:10,183
Shh! Durkas has been
breaking into my locker.

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,334
But I've got a little revenge planned.

5
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:14,603
Sorry. I just remembered
I don't really care.

6
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:20,557
Where's mom?
Oh, my God, what is that outfit?

7
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:21,613
Are you going goth?

8
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:23,216
You still sleep with a stuffed panda.

9
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:25,086
Don't you have a fraternity
to pass out in?

10
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:27,576
Is there anything else
you need for your procedure?

11
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,693
Um, I think I'm supposed
to have ice cream.

12
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,309
Hmm.
Actually, I don't...

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,038
I'm sorry. Is it a vasecto-you,

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,452
or a vasectomy?

15
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:35,999
- You can have ice cream.
- Thanks.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,782
- Today...
- Snip-a-dee-doo-dah!

17
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:40,894
We-we've been talking
about doing this for a while.

18
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:42,704
Yeah. Yeah, ever
since dad and Gloria

19
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,078
had their little accident,
we don't need any surprises.

20
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,919
Also, though, it will
allow for a little more

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,224
freestylin' in the boudoir

22
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,537
if we're not having to worry
about adding more critters.

23
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:52,582
More importantly, it is an essential part

24
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,745
of our 5-year plan.

25
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:56,409
Oh, the 5-year plan.
Talk about the... the Rosses.

26
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,621
The Rosses... Okay,
the Rosses are this couple

27
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:00,532
we have known forever, and...

28
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,191
they were never able to have kids,

29
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,260
- so we always felt a little...
- Jealous of them.

30
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,701
- Yeah.
- I mean, we love our kids,

31
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,671
but John and Chrissy can travel...

32
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:08,885
They're always tan.

33
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:11,664
Did you know that Chrissy
is eight years older than me?

34
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:13,350
I would have said eight years younger.

35
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,236
There's just this spark in her that...

36
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:17,317
Well, look who I'm talking to.
You used to have it.

37
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,478
- Wow. It's like you don't... hear...
- The point is,

38
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,131
as long as we don't have another baby,

39
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,236
that life is ours in five years

40
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,760
when Luke goes off to college.

41
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,214
Or somewhere.

42
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,475
It will actually be a pleasure

43
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:29,815
walking into that doctor's office today...

44
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,658
There you are. Mom...

45
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,649
Hang on a second. What is this?

46
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,931
Uh... is this because
of your new friend Skylar?

47
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,819
Oh, she's just trying to change her image.

48
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,781
Nice work, by the way.

49
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,663
You went from dork to Count Dorkula.

50
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,201
Can we talk about my clothes?
You were supposed to send them!

51
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:44,762
I'll be with you in a second.
Hang on.

52
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,241
I don't like this Skylar.

53
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,835
You don't need to change who you are

54
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:49,824
to fit in with the cool kids.

55
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,478
Oh, of course she does.
She just is so uncool,

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,146
she doesn't know who the cool kids are.

57
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,692
Don't you have a class to fail?

58
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,299
Don't you have a raven to train?

59
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,477
Listen, I have repeated
outfits twice this week.

60
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:02,764
- It's a disaster.
- And I will deal with it tomorrow,

61
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,755
but today I'm taking
your father to the doctor.

62
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:07,398
- He's having an ass-ectomy.
- What?

63
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,887
- I hear things.
- You're getting your tonsils out?

64
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:12,105
Ohh! This family needs
a dumbass-ectomy.

65
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:14,242
Oh, shut up! I'm tired
of you thinking you're so...

66
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,803
Did dad ever tell you you were adopted?

67
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:17,268
- No, I wasn't!
- Five more years.

68
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:18,315
Okay.

69

70
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:33,460
Okay, so after school,

71
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,301
you're going to your friend
Ashley's to swim,

72
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,385
so I'm gonna need you
to go get your swimsuit,

73
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:40,296
your swim goggles,
and your sunscreen, okay?

74
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,593
And change into a dress
that's not covered in cat fur.

75
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,884
Oh, that cat is really losing its hair.

76
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:47,698
Maybe we should slip it
one of your Propecia, huh?

77
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:48,906
What Propecia?

78
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,458
Your Pro...

79
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,079
Is that not something that we're...

80
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:55,690
So, uh, what you got going on today?

81
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,606
Ohh. Busy, busy, busy, busy.

82
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,887
I might buy some light bulbs,
and then, if time permits,

83
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,205
I might do a little work
on my master project.

84
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,341
- Top secret.
- Okay.

85
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:06,451
- So don't you dare ask what it is.
- I won't.

86
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,121
Since Lily started kindergarten,

87
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,995
Cam's had a lot of free time.

88
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:13,543
Now, I-I'd like to suggest
he go back to work, but...

89
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:17,906
Historically, uh, that has proved
to be a sensitive topic.

90
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:21,372
We sent those adoption papers
to Vietnam last summer.

91
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,072
No, thank you very much,

92
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:25,445
and please remember my tone, not my words.

93
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:27,686
She said it could take up
to nine months to get a baby.

94
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:28,496
It's inhuman!

95
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:31,186
Is it? Don't...
I-I know it's frustrating,

96
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:33,307
but maybe instead
of driving yourself crazy

97
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:36,060
waiting for the phone to ring,
you could go back to work.

98
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:36,947
Excuse me?

99
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,633
Get a job!

100
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
No, it... it'll help you take
your mind off the baby.

101
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,561
Oh, what, because
I'm a big, giant freeloader?

102
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,825
Actually, I think I laid out
the reasons pretty clearly.

103
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,346
No, I think you pegged me.
Bone lazy,

104
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:48,739
just like on the farm...
first to bed,

105
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,980
last to wake up in the morning.

106
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,661
You know what?
Why don't you call my dad,

107
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:52,822
and you two can gab all night

108
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,614
about what a teet-sucking
layabout I am?

109
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:55,975
Okay, I think I might have paddled

110
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,136
into some deeper waters here.

111
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,953
What, you think I sit around all day?

112
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,738
Well, I'm not sitting now.

113
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,459
What's happening?

114
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,287
You keep a packed suitcase?

115
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:07,009
That's a healthy baby.

116
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,543
- Hold on.
- What?

117
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:10,877
Is that a license plate and a hubcap?

118
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,576
You know, like in "Jaws"?

119
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:13,771
I never saw it.

120
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:14,972
I saw it, but I don't remember

121
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,653
a scene with a hubcap in a pregnant woman.

122
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:17,887
Ah, forget it.

123
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:18,928
So, would you like to know

124
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,249
if you're having a boy or a girl?

125
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,288
- Yes.
- No.

126
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,116
Ay. I want it to be a surprise,

127
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,355
don't you, Jay?

128
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:27,174
I'm having a baby at 65.

129
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:28,881
You want another surprise, Gloria?

130
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,436
Buy yourself a box of cracker Jacks.

131
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,995
Estupid dry cleaners!

132
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,062
They shrink my clothes!

133
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:37,837
Might be time for maternity wear.

134
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,190
Are you crazy?
I'm barely showing.

135
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,678
Sweetheart, your shirts barely
fit before you were pregnant.

136
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,992
And I never heard you complain.

137
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:48,816
We're gonna need a bigger belt.

138
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,981
Come on.

139
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,444
This is hard.

140
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,716
Hey, Cam.

141
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:57,862
Who's hungry?

142
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:01,994
Ohh! Were you thinking
about dropping by for lunch...

143
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,753
Again?

144
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,349
You know, I-I really wish I could,

145
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,548
but it's, uh, it's a zoo around here.

146
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:11,470
Um... but, hey, Cam...

147
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,330
Cam, would you mind, uh,
stopping by Longinus' boutique

148
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:15,902
and picking up a few shirts for me?

149
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,622
- Sure.
- Thank you.

150
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:18,895
Or we can do it together.

151
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,052
- Hey!
- Hey!

152
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,183
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,444
- How are you?
- Good.

154
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,697
Okay.

155
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,763
Um... that's... that's good.
Okay. Yeah.

156
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,822
You didn't send the little green jacket?!

157
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:30,238
Honey, I am not doing this again.

158
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,619
It took me an hour to mail
that package before.

159
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,009
I have post-post office
traumatic stress disorder.

160
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,811
Stop smiling.
It's not that clever.

161
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,890
It is clever, and there's no way
I'm going back there today.

162
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,739
Oh, my God, I hate you so much!

163
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,809
Oh, sorry, that's your father.
Gotta go!

164
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,097
Claire, where are you?

165
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,861
Oh, honey, I just had a hellish experience

166
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:49,224
at the post office.

167
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:52,710
I have post-post office
traumatic stress disorder.

168
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:54,485
- Nailed it.
- Yes!

169
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:55,983
And Luke forgot his science project,

170
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,624
so now I'm at the school dropping it off.

171
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,476
Um, but what about my appointment?

172
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:02,443
I'm so sorry, honey.
I made other arrangements,

173
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:04,508
but I promise I will be
there when you wake up.

174
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,617
Arrangements?

175
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:08,271
What... um...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

176
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,587
What... what arrangements?

177
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:12,822
I, um... I kinda
wanted you to take me.

178
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,985
Let's go! Chop, chop!

179
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,385
Seriously? "Chop, chop"?

180
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:18,001
Oh, right.

181
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,148
Ohh! What?

182
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:37,833
What is this?

183
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,513
- Mom?
- Luke!

184
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:40,580
What are you doing?!

185
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,750
I was dropping off your science project.

186
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,161
Not to my locker!

187
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,818
When are you ever gonna
stop embarrassing me?

188
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:49,862
Five more years.

189
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:51,952
Five more years.

190
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,212
Oh, my God!

191
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:05,548
Oh, my God!

192
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,457
Oh, my God!

193
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,658
If you're gonna go any higher,

194
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,019
maybe I should put this down, huh?

195
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,860
So? What do you think?

196
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,054
Finally, a store that sells shirts

197
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:16,091
men actually wanna wear.

198
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:18,090
Thank you.
Look, holla if you need me.

199
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,411
We're a little shorthanded today.

200
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:20,602
What happened to J'Marcus?

201
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,354
Don't ask. She's a j'mess.

202
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,235
I'm telling you, it is
so hard to find someone

203
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,059
who knows clothes and is good with people.

204
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,438
Well, I wish I knew somebody.

205
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,384
Oh, my God.
Wait a second. Cam?

206
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,465
You wouldn't think about
taking the job, would you?

207
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,969
Do you realize how perfect you'd be?

208
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,205
Well, yes. Um, but I-I...

209
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,668
You'd only work part-time.

210
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,732
You'll get employee discounts
on the clothes.

211
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,314
Stop me if I'm wasting my breath.

212
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:44,275
Well, I don't know.
What do you think, Mitchell?

213
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:46,276
Well, I-I would miss
having you around the house,

214
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:48,977
but, you know, if...
if it's something that you love...

215
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:49,887
Mulling.

216
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,648
You know what?
It was nice of you to offer,

217
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,849
- but he should probably think about it.
- I'll do it!

218
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,330
Really?

219
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:56,411
Yep. Just until he can
find somebody to replace me,

220
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:57,372
and good luck with that.

221
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,307
Oh, and I don't fold.

222
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,097
Longe, I'm getting a protein shake.

223
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:05,644
Okay. Mitchell, this is Jeoux.

224
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:06,950
Hi. Oh, just "Joe"?

225
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:09,151
Yes, Jeoux. J-e-o-u-x.

226
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:09,758
There it is.

227
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,519
Oh, is this the Mitchell
you're helping out

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,320
because he wants
his boyfriend to get a job?

229
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,201
I don't know what you're doing.
Should I wave?

230
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:17,171
Did your boyfriend take the job?

231
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,592
Oh, my God!
That looks so good on you, Cam!

232
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:21,733
Don't even.

233
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,517
It is everything I can do
to not create a scene right now.

234
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,775
You will pay for this. Mnh.

235
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:30,917
And this.

236
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:33,787
And this.

237
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,955
Manny, you don't seem so happy.

238
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:43,824
You usually love when I pull you
out of school to play hockey.

239
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,077
"A," it's "hooky,"

240
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:47,844
and "B," don't ever take me
out of school to play hockey.

241
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,737
Did something bad happen at school?

242
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,109
They fired the music teacher.

243
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,421
Mr. Hideo Namagachi?

244
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:53,640
That you say perfectly.

245
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,913
Manny, don't worry.
He'll find another job.

246
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:57,013
What about me?

247
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,742
I've been buttering up
Mr. Namagachi for years.

248
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:02,091
He was gonna give me the lead
in the school musical,

249
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:02,906
"Oliver!"

250
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,445
Is it not all over.

251
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,725
"Oliver!"

252
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,182
Manny...

253
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,584
You are a very talented boy.

254
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:12,173
You're gonna find plenty of music teachers

255
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:13,393
to put butter on.

256
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,268
But what if I can't?
I don't want to spend

257
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,245
my last year of middle school
in the chorus.

258
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,709
Maybe I can help.

259
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,341
Maybe when they pick
the new music teacher,

260
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:24,760
I'll go and I'll flirt
a little bit with him.

261
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,874
Hey, mom, since we're just talking here,

262
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,162
about your shirt.

263
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:31,093
Uh... what about my shirt?

264
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:32,227
Nothing.

265
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,020
I just noticed you got some, uh,

266
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,893
some pizza...
on the ice cream on it.

267
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:39,299
Ah, a little piece of... mm.

268
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,590
It's natural to want to know the sex.

269
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:47,342
And there's practical matters...
how you paint the nursery.

270
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,583
Gloria should... Phil, would
you please knock that off?

271
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:49,881
What?

272
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,561
- What's the matter? Are you nervous?
- I'm not nervous.

273
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,162
May-maybe you're
the one who's nervous.

274
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:55,232
You ever think about that?

275
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:56,273
Okay. "Nervous."

276
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:58,539
Okay. Okay.

277
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,257
Because if you've had a change of heart...

278
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,538
I haven't had a change of heart.

279
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,819
Maybe you had a change of heart,
but I'm totally pumped.

280
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,580
Pump, pump, pumped.

281
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:06,552
Pump up the jam
in my pumped-up... kicks.

282
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:08,219
Pumpty-dumpty.
Pumplestiltskin.

283
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,180
Because they do this
kind of thing all the time,

284
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:11,021
and in about an hour,

285
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,865
you're gonna be wanting to ride a horse.

286
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:21,698
Mr. Dunphy, can you please
come to the desk?

287
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,738
What's the plan, Phil?

288
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,219
Just sit here.
I'm just gonna sit...

289
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,958
I'm gonna sit a bit.
Sitting pretty.

290
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:30,596
Is there a Phil Dunphy here?

291
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,687
I'm his father-in-law.
He's gonna need a moment.

292
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:34,900
Is there anything
I could fill out for him?

293
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,495
Not unless you want the vasectomy.

294
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:37,859
Where were you six months ago?

295
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,468
Barbados. Now I really need
to speak with the patient.

296
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,328
Got it.
Phil, get over here.

297
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,162
Phil?

298
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,417
He just ran ou...

299
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,887
You know what could do wonders
for your business here?

300
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,503
A recovery room.

301
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,419
Okay, wait, wait.
I'm not sure about this.

302
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,777
Don't be a baby.

303
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:14,015
It's gonna look cool.
Just hold still.

304
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,235
Ohh! Mom, what
are you doing here?

305
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:18,465
I am changing my shirt.
Why aren't you at school?

306
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,226
- Mrs. Dunphy, we just...
- Oh, no, you don't get to talk, Morticia.

307
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,122
Okay, we cut last period...
big deal...

308
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:24,963
because we're shaving
the backs of our necks,

309
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,171
which is totally a style.

310
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,932
But of course now
you're going to freak out

311
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,733
like you always do about
every little thing.

312
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,503
Let's do it.

313
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,403
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah. Let's shave up some heads.

314
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:35,728
Come on. Who's first?

315
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,009
Uh, okay. Okay, mom, we...
we don't need you to do that.

316
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,450
- Are you afraid?
- I'm not afraid!

317
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,595
Then let's do this. It's shaving time.

318
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,183
Shavy gravy.
Shaved by the bell.

319
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,184
- Why are you talking like dad?
- Hair up, girls!

320
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,215
Let's see some napes. Come on. Let's...

321
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:48,234
oh, God. No!

322
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,755
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What did you do?!

323
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:53,612
What did you do?
I have my sister's wedding on Saturday!

324
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,970
I'm so sorry.

325
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,057
Uh, Skylar, wait!

326
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:58,138
I could... I could...
I could even that up for you.

327
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,768
Stay away from me, both of you!

328
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:02,611
Uhh! You ruined my life!

329
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,154
Skylar!

330
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:07,885
Cam.

331
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,514
Cameron! Ohh! You're gonna
have to talk to me at some point!

332
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,675
Oh, well, let me put that
on my list of things to do,

333
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:16,189
- right after "get a job."
- Would you stop running away?

334
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,028
Nope.

335
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,432
C-Cam! Come on!

336
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,550
You know, I can barely catch up with you

337
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,012
now that you lost all that weight.

338
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,493
You know what?
I am sleeping better,

339
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,934
and I do have more energy...
Oh, you know what? You're good.

340
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,349
You're very good.

341
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,551
Cam, the only reason
I tried to get you that job

342
00:12:36,552 --> 00:12:39,177
is because you've been seeming
a little... unfulfilled.

343
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:40,698
Oh, what, and you thought you'd fix me

344
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:42,841
by turning me into some common shopgirl?

345
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,722
You're not going anywhere.
We have a daughter.

346
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,675
It's not for me. It's for you.

347
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:48,734
Cam, I'm not go...
Okay, well, that's packed.

348
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah, and if you're going someplace cool,

349
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:53,096
- I have a winter one packed as well.
- No, I'm not going anywhere!

350
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,337
And I should be able to talk
to you about these things.

351
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:56,462
Oh, what things?

352
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:58,928
How empty my life is?

353
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:00,658
You know, you have no idea what I do

354
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,193
around this house every day.
I shop for food,

355
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,865
I pay the bills, I maintain the house,

356
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,773
I grocery shop.

357
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:06,905
Same as shopping for food.

358
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:10,266
And still I have enough time
to work on my master project.

359
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:13,396
And you never ask me
what my master project is.

360
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:15,156
Because you told me not to ask!

361
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:17,234
Fine, since you won't let it go...

362
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,001
Does this...

363
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,535
look like the work
of an unfulfilled slacker?

364
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:25,649
A mermaid costume?

365
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,646
Hand-sewn from my own design.

366
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,740
Have you ever stitched lycra?

367
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,656
It's like sewing water, Mitchell.

368
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,320
It looks a little small for Lily.

369
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,958
It's not for Lily.

370
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:36,997
It's for the cat.

371
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:40,824
It's a mermaid costume for the cat.

372
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:44,769
My master project.

373
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:47,481
It's a mermaid costume...

374
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:49,170
for a cat!

375
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:50,546
Okay. Hey, don't cry, okay?

376
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,678
No, no, it's... it's nice. It's...

377
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,593
it's a very nice cat costume.

378
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:56,041
Oh, stop it!

379
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,853
This is eight weeks of my life!

380
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,715
My... my stupid, empty, creepy,

381
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,157
useless cat-dressing life.

382
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,335
Let me get you a tissue, all right?

383
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,001
- Here.
- Okay.

384
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,948
Oh! You packed me tissues.

385
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,002
I know how you are with your allergies.

386
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,921
Cam! You know
I don't think you're lazy.

387
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:16,504
I know.
That's just stupid dad stuff.

388
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,305
You know, I didn't like
working on the farm,

389
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:19,907
and he just took it as me being lazy.

390
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,059
The truth is, is I am unfulfilled.

391
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,723
And I do need to find something.

392
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:27,204
Well, you just... you seem happier
when you have a challenge.

393
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:28,993
- You know?
- I know, I know.

394
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,108
You know, I loved teaching music to kids,

395
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:34,385
and then... then Lily,
she came along, and...

396
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:36,480
That's the best job
in the whole wide world.

397
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:39,003
You know? And now
she doesn't need me as much.

398
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,176
No, come on, come on.

399
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,097
We're gonna find you
something else, all right?

400
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:42,333
Yeah.

401
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,732
And it doesn't have to be Longinus.

402
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:46,466
- Or this.
- Yeah.

403
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,596
We'll just... you know,
I do like these shirts.

404
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,386
Yeah. Yeah.

405
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,450
Mulling.

406
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,187
Okay. You know, if I'm gonna mull,

407
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:54,548
I could really use some chocolate.

408
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:56,869
Well, since your diet,
we don't keep it around the house.

409
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,795
- Side pocket.
- Yeah? Oh.

410
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:01,033
- Remind me to replace these.
- Okay.

411
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,668
Oh. Hey, Jay! How you doing?

412
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,213
Phil, you gotta stop running
from things because...

413
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,952
Running? I'm not running.

414
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,433
You're running. Look, I'm not up
for another round with this.

415
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:14,594
Just get in the damn car!
I'm not having a great day!

416
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,086
You're not having a great day?!

417
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,426
Are you about to get spayed
like a common schnauzer?!

418
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,616
They don't spay you,
they fix you. You're a man!

419
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,677
I just want to stay one!

420
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:29,446
Phil, what's scaring you here?

421
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,447
That people are gonna think
less of you as a man?

422
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,179
No, I'm afraid it's gonna hurt.

423
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,637
- That's what this is about?
- Wait, people think that?

424
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:37,532
That you're less of a man?

425
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,842
That never even occurred to me.

426
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,728
Look, no one's gonna think less of you.

427
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,154
And it hardly even hurts.

428
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,242
I'm unusually sensitive down there.

429
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:48,969
I can't go in certain jacuzzis.

430
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,675
I'm gonna be with you the entire way.

431
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,404
Plus it's the fear of pain

432
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,073
that's always more than
the actual experience.

433
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,434
That's easy for you to say.
You're not afraid of anything.

434
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,863
- Of course I'm afraid of stuff.
- Like what?

435
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:02,665
Look...

436
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:06,092
You remember before, when I told you I was

437
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:09,019
wanting to know the...
the sex of the baby...

438
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:12,188
For practical matters?
Well, that wasn't true.

439
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm kind of afraid of having a girl.

440
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:17,319
Give me a break.
That's not a thing.

441
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,097
You'd just rather have a boy.

442
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:20,661
Everyone would rather have a boy.

443
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:23,265
No. I'm actually scared.
I get boys.

444
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,451
It's girls... they're...
they're complicated.

445
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,626
Half of Claire's childhood,
I did everything I could

446
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,297
to try to turn her into a boy.

447
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:31,787
Well, whatever your issues were,

448
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,031
you and Claire are good now.

449
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,748
Yeah, but I may not get that kind of time

450
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:37,337
with this new one,
and I can't screw it up.

451
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:41,210
I don't think I'm sensitive
enough to raise a girl.

452
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,863
Jay, you're being sensitive right now.

453
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:46,640
I mean, I was pretty hysterical,
and you calmed me down.

454
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,065
I-I don't think you're
the guy you used to be.

455
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,906
So you're saying that
if I can deal with you,

456
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:54,294
then I can handle...
any other little girl?

457
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,415
I think I'd put it
a-a little differently.

458
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,625
No, I-I-I think that's right.

459
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,080
Thanks.

460
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,582
We gonna do this?

461
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,372
Promise it's not gonna hurt that much?

462
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:07,454
Tiny, little pinch.

463
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,702
- I built it up in my head, didn't I?
- Totally.

464
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,730
And I can still achieve
a-a full and satisfying...

465
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,691
You know what?
We had a nice little moment here.

466
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:16,225
We don't have many of those.

467
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,253
I think I'm gonna commemorate it.

468
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:20,015
- Okay.
- All right?

469
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:21,571
So sit up straight.

470
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,936
There you go.

471
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:26,160
No, no, the arms down.
Uh, better arms down.

472
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,481
- All right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:29,240
That's right. Relax.

474
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,916
There you go.

475
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:33,177
Perfect.

476
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,010
Can I get a copy?

477
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,291
Oh, there'll be a lot of copies.

478
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,706
Oh, great.

479
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,797
You were kind of hard
on that cinnamon bun guy.

480
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,609
Did you hear what he said to me?

481
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,283
"Congratulations"?

482
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,102
He thinks I'm pregnant!

483
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:48,477
That is an insult when
the person doesn't look it.

484
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:50,124
Mom, wait.

485
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,819
You need to hear this.

486
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:55,494
You are pregnant, and you look it.

487
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:59,691
I hope that this new one
has some good manners!

488
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,427
Mom, stop!

489
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:05,026
I know this whole thing
is a little scary for you.

490
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,107
Last time you were pregnant,
you kinda did it alone

491
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,005
'cause dad wasn't around much.

492
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,490
But this time you have two partners.

493
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,362
That's sweet.

494
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,106
And so are you.

495
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,087
Especially with a little bit
of sugar in your face.

496
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,607
Let me see.

497
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,430
Ohh! What happened?!

498
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:26,871
Your shirt couldn't take it anymore!

499
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,056
The stupid dry cleaners!

500
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,492
W... where is it?!

501
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,163
Ay, no!

502
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:32,709
Oh! You're running out
of arms, mom!

503
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,706
A maternity store's right over there!

504
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,628
- What was that?
- I don't know, but let's go!

505
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:41,703
It's you. I thought it was
the guy coming to shave me.

506
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,161
Oh, good. They haven't started.

507
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:44,962
He had a little piece
of bloody toilet paper

508
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,780
on his neck.
It was disconcerting.

509
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,694
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

510
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,257
Yeah. I had a pretty crazy day,

511
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:53,536
but it... it had
an interesting ending.

512
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:56,547
And this tortoise was 200 years old.

513
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:58,399
I'm sorry.
I'm boring you with my trip.

514
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,389
No, not at all.

515
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,005
You hot-air-ballooned
over an active volcano.

516
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:04,634
Three weeks ago I made
every green light on Jefferson.

517
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:05,975
Couldn't stop talking about it.

518
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:08,600
- You e-mailed me.
- Oh, God.

519
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:14,453
Mom shaved Skylar's head?
That's hilarious!

520
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:15,575
It's not gonna be so fun

521
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:17,536
the next time she bothers
to show up for school.

522
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,617
What do you care?
You know you don't even like her.

523
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,195
I don't. Skylar's awful.

524
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,093
Mom actually did me a huge favor.

525
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,730
Oh, my God. Do not tell her that.

526
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,020
She will never shut up.

527
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,381
I know. Remember when you admitted

528
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:30,262
that you didn't hate that
James Taylor concert

529
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:33,482
- she dragged you to?
- She was unbearable! "I told you!

530
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:36,336
- He's got the voice of an angel!"
- "He's got the voice of an angel!"

531
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,695
She's such a nerd.

532
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,924
I kind of miss her, though.

533
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,175
You know, honey, I don't want to do this

534
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,952
unless you are really ready.

535
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:01,436
I am ready.

536
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,254
- I don't know if I am.
- Me, either.

537
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:07,708
You wanna wait?

538
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:10,656
Five more years?

539
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:16,378
I've always seen life
like a series of doors.

540
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,807
Sometimes you get to choose
the door you go through,

541
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,718
sometimes you don't get that choice.

542
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,025
But you still gotta walk through.

543
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:28,513
So you can either go
kicking and screaming...

544
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,481
Or walk through with your head held high.

545
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,531
And since I don't get to choose

546
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,926
the door I'm about to go through,

547
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,614
I just pray it's a healthy, happy kid.

548
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,173
And a boy.

549
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,451
Honey, look what Manny just sent me.

550
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:02,091
Hang on one sec. Okay.

551
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:05,401
- Is that the funniest thing ever?
- Oh, yeah!

552
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,200
Oh... oh, my gosh.
Mitchell, come here.

553
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:08,641
You have to see what Claire sent us.

554
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,330
Okay, wait. One... one second.

555
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,071
Okay. Is that hilarious?

556
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,765
That's great! Oh, Phil!

557
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:17,120
Ay, this is embarrassing.

558
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,506
I don't know how comfortable I am

559
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:20,547
with this guy teaching our kid.

560
