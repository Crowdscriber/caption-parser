1
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,998
What's up?

2
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,098
Great view.

3
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,297
Harbor, I mean.

4
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:46,298
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.

5
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:49,498
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...

6
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:51,697
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"

7
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:54,497
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...

8
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,497
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...

9
00:00:57,597 --> 00:01:01,497
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.

10
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,296
Good anchorage, good cranes...

11
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:14,296
good railroads, close to l-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?

12
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,397
That's my fucking town.

13
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,396
Except, the thing is,
we're another 1 10 miles...

14
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:23,396
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.

15
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:24,896
So why come?

16
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:26,896
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...

17
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:28,996
fast and clean through the port.

18
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,896
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...

19
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,795
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...

20
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,696
and will make sure your cargo...

21
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,395
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.

22
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:42,895
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.

23
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:45,295
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.

24
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:49,495
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...

25
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:50,795
outside Patapsco terminal?

26
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:53,794
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.

27
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,395
The cameras come back.

28
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:57,794
I'm serious.

29
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:01,594
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.

30
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:04,494
They're gone. We turned them over already.

31
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,194
To who?

32
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:16,094
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.

33
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:19,694
-I don't need this shit right now.
-I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.

34
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:22,694
-You ain't hearing me!
-What? You think this shit is easy?

35
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:26,294
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.

36
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,994
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.

37
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:31,793
You need money, you come to me.

38
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:34,093
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...

39
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,593
on the docks lately.

40
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:38,793
-No doubt, his pockets are full.
-You think it's for me?

41
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,493
Is that what you think?

42
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,593
It ain't about me, Nick!

43
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:47,992
I know, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,793
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?

45
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:58,092
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.

46
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,892
Come on, let's go to work.

47
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,492
How much?

48
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:18,591
Twenty.

49
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:21,991
-Three-way split.
-Who's the inside man?

50
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,191
You don't know?

51
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,591
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.

52
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,390
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?

53
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,191
Yeah.

54
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,687
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.

55
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:19,287
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.

56
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,887
This was intentional?

57
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,387
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...

58
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:25,686
with all kinds of chemicals.

59
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:28,686
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.

60
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,686
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...

61
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,487
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.

62
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:37,286
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.

63
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:39,786
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.

64
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:40,986
What do they wanna know?

65
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,386
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.

66
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:45,085
It got in like everything gets in.

67
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:47,886
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...

68
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:50,186
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.

69
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:52,785
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.

70
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,685
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?

71
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:57,285
We need to show the flag on this.

72
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,785
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.

73
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,185
What do you mean?

74
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,485
If this case gets made from an informant...

75
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:06,085
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...

76
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:08,484
if you're ready to shave some years.

77
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,784
Colonel.

78
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,684
-Jimmy.
-Winona.

79
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:31,884
Gilligan, little buddy.

80
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:35,683
Don't you have a job?

81
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:36,984
Ouch!

82
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,783
I smell fresh police work.

83
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,483
Okay, be like that.

84
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,683
You got some paper from inside the can?

85
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:55,083
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?

86
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:57,383
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.

87
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,183
-You got the submission slips?
-He does.

88
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,482
-Lester.
-You want to pull all of it?

89
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:10,983
Hold it.

90
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,182
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...

91
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:17,082
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.

92
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:20,282
I got a full set of llene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.

93
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,782
-No problem, I got you covered.
-You found Omar?

94
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,982
I never lost him, my friend.

95
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:32,082
-He's got Omar?
-Bullshit.

96
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:33,481
Who's Omar?

97
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:47,681
My papers are in.

98
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,781
They are.

99
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,280
You want out, you're out.

100
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,681
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.

101
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,980
-You and me.
-Why?

102
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,680
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.

103
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,180
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...

104
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,580
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.

105
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,180
People you can trust.

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
And you ain't that?

107
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,880
All right. You're a snake.

108
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,479
But you seem to know your business.

109
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.

110
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,579
Why not put it off for a year or two...

111
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,579
Ieave the department
with a major's pension?

112
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,779
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.

113
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,079
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...

114
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:39,478
and you'll have that posting.

115
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,379
Why would you do that?

116
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,178
I value you, Cedric.

117
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,579
You're arrogant and disloyal.

118
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,379
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.

119
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,479
-What's the detail?
-Drug case, probably.

120
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,378
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...

121
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:01,678
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.

122
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,778
He thinks they've got too much money.

123
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,878
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.

124
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:09,577
That it? Pretty thin.

125
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,678
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.

126
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:15,978
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...

127
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,478
feeling he got his money's worth.

128
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:22,977
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?

129
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:27,177
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.

130
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,177
How about this?

131
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,077
If I bring in the case...

132
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:42,477
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...

133
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:44,076
within CID.

134
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,477
Fair enough.

135
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:48,276
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...

136
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,376
-a drug case or two.
-One other thing.

137
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:53,876
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?

138
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:56,475
I choose my own people.

139
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,676
Fuck me once, shame on you.

140
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:03,275
-Fuck me twice--
-Make a list.

141
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:06,475
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.

142
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,675
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.

143
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,574
I mean, Tae? Lizard? lf it was a hotshot...

144
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:30,474
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.

145
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,975
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?

146
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,575
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.

147
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,174
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.

148
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:46,374
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.

149
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:04,373
Fucking-A right.

150
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:18,573
Jane Doe, number five.

151
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,372
Five.

152
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,371
What's up, baby?

153
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,571
Not here, put it away.

154
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:50,771
Shot and a beer, darling.

155
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:54,771
Kept one for yourself, did you?

156
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:57,571
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.

157
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:00,971
-You even got film in that bitch?
-No, it's digital.

158
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,071
I know it's digital, so what?

159
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:06,571
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.

160
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,771
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.

161
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,970
Thanks.

162
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,270
Ziggy.

163
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,471
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?

164
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,170
Hell, no.

165
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,670
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.

166
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,970
-Also, your father knows.
-How does he know?

167
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,769
Horse saw us, right?

168
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,170
Fuck me, he told?

169
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,269
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.

170
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,969
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.

171
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:43,969
What did you say?

172
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,869
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...

173
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,369
and after a while, he stopped yelling.

174
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,169
At you, maybe.

175
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:56,569
Anyway.

176
00:12:57,868 --> 00:12:59,969
It's low profile for a while, all right?

177
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:01,268
All right.

178
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:10,968
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...

179
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:14,168
-to get it turned around?
-No, it goes on a computer.

180
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,568
I got to take a leak.

181
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:27,867
I go next, all right?

182
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,266
Pretty boy. Hey, there.

183
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,467
Christ, Ziggy.

184
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,967
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.

185
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,066
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.

186
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,966
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.

187
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:12,466
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.

188
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,966
Okay? Great.

189
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:19,166
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.

190
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,565
Motherfucker, I am serious.

191
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:25,265
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.

192
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,466
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...

193
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,765
and we haven't heard from you.

194
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,465
Give us a call, please.

195
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:33,865
McNulty, this is your dear friend
llene Nathan.

196
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,865
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...

197
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,765
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness....

198
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:52,064
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a....

199
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:10,664
-Go around, asshole.
-What'd you call me?

200
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:13,864
I'm sleeping on this side.

201
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:16,763
Because you got to get up, everybody does?

202
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:20,864
Yup.

203
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,762
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.

204
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:40,863
-If I could fart now, I would.
-That's a surprise.

205
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:46,562
No chance for breakfast?

206
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,062
No. I'll stop by the bar.

207
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:51,362
No, you won't. You ain't got time.

208
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:53,762
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.

209
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:57,062
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.

210
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:00,262
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.

211
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,162
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.

212
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:07,262
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?

213
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,161
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.

214
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:15,361
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?

215
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:17,361
They're decent people.

216
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,360
-We ain't got time.
-I know.

217
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,260
-So, why you grabbing?
-They were staring right at me.

218
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,560
I'll meet you out back.

219
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,160
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?

220
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,759
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...

221
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,959
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.

222
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,060
-Who are they?
-Local 1514.

223
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,359
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...

224
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,059
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.

225
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,959
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.

226
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,659
-Or not.
-Or not.

227
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:17,659
So we need to talk to a checker.

228
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,258
What?

229
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:22,758
Black, white, Polish, lrish, ltalian,
it doesn't matter.

230
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,559
No one talks to police.

231
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,558
How do you make a case then?

232
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:30,858
I patrol.

233
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,758
I write traffic tickets.

234
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:35,858
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...

235
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,258
I take a report.

236
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:39,658
We got something stolen,
I take another report.

237
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:44,258
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...

238
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,457
-I keep writing.
-That's the job?

239
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:50,257
How long you been on?

240
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:53,357
-Two years.
-What did you do before that?

241
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,357
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.

242
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,657
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.

243
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,357
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...

244
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,957
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...

245
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,557
read the MDOT job posting.

246
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:12,756
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.

247
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,456
Toll-taking days were over?

248
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:22,556
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...

249
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:25,456
hasn't so much as called in three years.

250
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:27,356
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.

251
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,155
Not with kids, I wasn't.

252
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,355
Did you want to be a police?

253
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,554
-Could've been me the other night.
-True.

254
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:04,254
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.

255
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:06,854
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?

256
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:10,254
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...

257
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:12,355
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.

258
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:15,254
Five dead. More in the infirmary.

259
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,554
-How did you know?
-I did as your uncle should...

260
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:21,754
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.

261
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,653
You knew.

262
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,053
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.

263
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,553
I might know who did, though.

264
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:32,254
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?

265
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:36,253
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?

266
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:40,153
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.

267
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,953
Play or you gonna get played.

268
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:44,153
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.

269
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,453
That's what I need to know.

270
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:48,753
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.

271
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:52,952
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.

272
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,552
Once you done with all that...

273
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,652
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.

274
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:59,452
And not just for me, for you, too.

275
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:02,553
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.

276
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,452
They need him to fall. And you know what?

277
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:07,552
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.

278
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:10,452
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...

279
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:13,051
and we can get some of our lives back.

280
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,052
You dig?

281
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,851
So, stay close.

282
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:22,352
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...

283
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,351
we got it all covered.

284
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:31,151
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?

285
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,751
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.

286
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,350
Whatever it is.

287
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,850
Anyone seen Omar?

288
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,449
We're back in!

289
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,549
Six ships in one day.

290
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,349
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.

291
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,649
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.

292
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,649
-What the fuck are you wearing?
-Italian leather, all right?

293
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,048
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?

294
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:36,449
-How much does that shit cost?
-$2,000.

295
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:39,549
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?

296
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,248
Fuck it.

297
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:43,748
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.

298
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:46,449
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.

299
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:50,247
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...

300
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:53,647
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.

301
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,947
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.

302
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:59,848
-I'm gonna walk, all right?
-See you.

303
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:04,147
What?

304
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:07,047
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?

305
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:10,048
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.

306
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:14,947
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.

307
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:19,047
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.

308
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:20,246
I do.

309
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,346
The Greeks wanna talk to us.

310
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:29,847
What about?

311
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,246
We did good by them.

312
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:33,846
Yeah?

313
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:37,546
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...

314
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:40,546
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.

315
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:42,346
All right, no problem.

316
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,446
-All right. See you later.
-See you.

317
00:23:10,844 --> 00:23:12,245
Yo, quit it.

318
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:19,045
Gentlemen.

319
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,844
We don't need that now.

320
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:24,144
-Say what?
-I don't give a shit about drugs.

321
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:27,544
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.

322
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:30,244
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.

323
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,644
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.

324
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:36,444
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...

325
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,844
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.

326
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:42,444
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.

327
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,243
Does anyone know where he hangs?

328
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:47,144
Who he's running with?

329
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:51,843
What he's driving?

330
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,143
Fuck you, Officer.

331
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,943
The second package came
even weaker than the last.

332
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,842
It won't take the cut like it did before.

333
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:08,042
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.

334
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:10,643
Came in at 25.

335
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,742
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.

336
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,142
And lose my money?

337
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:16,042
I lose my money.

338
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:20,842
Step on that motherfucker.

339
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,142
How hard?

340
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,042
Make it 10.

341
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:27,242
-It's shit now.
-I know.

342
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:41,541
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.

343
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,942
Which leaves us the port itself.

344
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:47,341
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...

345
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:49,241
was supposed to pick that container up.

346
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:51,340
Which is why it stays on the dock.

347
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,141
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.

348
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,240
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.

349
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,141
Bottom line for me is different.

350
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,940
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.

351
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,340
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.

352
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,540
Sir, the witnesses--

353
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,140
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...

354
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,640
with a cocksucker's lisp.

355
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:21,239
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.

356
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:23,840
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...

357
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,740
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.

358
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,240
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.

359
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,739
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.

360
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:40,339
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.

361
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,539
So what can I tell you?

362
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,939
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...

363
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,638
trying to explain what happened.

364
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:53,539
So, work it as you see fit...

365
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:56,038
but understand...

366
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,338
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...

367
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,139
I got one to throw.

368
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:21,637
Fuck me.

369
00:26:59,736 --> 00:27:01,436
What did you want to talk to us about?

370
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,035
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.

371
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:06,035
Like what?

372
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:09,635
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.

373
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:13,435
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.

374
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:15,535
Stuff we need is not like that.

375
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,035
No?

376
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:24,335
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.

377
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,335
-Chemicals?
-It's like paint thinner, shit like that.

378
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:30,835
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.

379
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:33,234
No. We need much.

380
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,234
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.

381
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:40,034
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.

382
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:43,534
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.

383
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,334
Good money for those.

384
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:53,834
How much?

385
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:59,433
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?

386
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,033
-Eight?
-I'll look into it.

387
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,432
Yo, Bubbles!

388
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:27,032
McNulty.

389
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,132
My meanest man.

390
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:33,932
Get in the car.

391
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:39,232
Where you been at, brother?

392
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:47,532
What did you get? Walkman.

393
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,631
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.

394
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,031
Taxation without representation, you know?

395
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,431
I don't want much. I need Omar.

396
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:01,731
Wild Omar?

397
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,931
You want us to wander around town...

398
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:07,731
Iooking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?

399
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,031
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.

400
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,830
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.

401
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,630
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.

402
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,930
-Here.
-Keep it, part of my tax.

403
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,431
Your tax is Omar.

404
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,129
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.

405
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,730
Fuck!

406
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,930
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

407
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,030
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

408
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,030
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...

409
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,729
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.

410
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:45,430
Cellblock talk is cheap.

411
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,529
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...

412
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:50,529
-if that's what you're interested in.
-Your terms?

413
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:53,429
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.

414
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,329
We'd like to trim that to a year...

415
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,829
and have your assurances
of institutional support...

416
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,028
for work release and early parole.

417
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:01,929
One year on a seven-year bit?

418
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,929
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.

419
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:07,228
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...

420
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:09,828
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...

421
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:11,528
and staff at MCl.

422
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:16,028
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.

423
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:17,928
He has no priors whatsoever.

424
00:30:18,928 --> 00:30:22,827
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.

425
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:25,328
-No, sir.
-You don't remember that?

426
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:27,728
I remember the officer got shot.

427
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:31,628
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...

428
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,727
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.

429
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:38,427
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...

430
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:39,727
"it's bad on everyone."

431
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,127
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...

432
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:44,527
on what happened to your friend.

433
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:49,626
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.

434
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:53,526
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...

435
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:56,326
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.

436
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:57,826
Or the day after.

437
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:01,326
Consider the offer.

438
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,426
But the next time we talk...

439
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:06,426
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.

440
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,126
Tuna surprise?

441
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:25,526
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.

442
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:28,625
How about a meal for that kind of day?

443
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,925
-Where's Pop?
-He's at the bar with the horses.

444
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,024
Go tell him it's dinner.

445
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:05,324
-We winning, Pop?
-Nicko.

446
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,424
You up today?

447
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:12,424
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.

448
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:15,023
Go easy. That's my inheritance.

449
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:21,623
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.

450
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,523
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.

451
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:26,523
Try your system out for real.

452
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:28,123
Too tempting.

453
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:29,923
Just once.

454
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:36,123
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.

455
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,323
Yeah, we offloaded her today.

456
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:49,622
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.

457
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:54,122
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.

458
00:32:55,122 --> 00:32:56,821
She still floats?

459
00:32:58,322 --> 00:33:00,121
Of course she still floats.

460
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,021
You ever miss it, Pop?

461
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:04,321
You ever miss it, Pop?

462
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:08,521
Wouldn't do no good.

463
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:13,921
What's for dinner?

464
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,321
Tuna surprise.

465
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:32,521
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.

466
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,521
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

467
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,020
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.

468
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,520
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.

469
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,420
-They're all CID.
-Correction.

470
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,920
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...

471
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,020
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.

472
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,019
If they work for me, they need my okay.

473
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:01,219
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.

474
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:05,419
Except McNulty. No McNulty.

475
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,519
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.

476
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:11,619
-That bad?
-He quits or he drowns.

477
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:16,019
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.

478
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,718
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?

479
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:23,619
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.

480
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,419
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.

481
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:28,118
I heard.

482
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,618
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?

483
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,717
Girl.

484
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:57,318
No! Kima, who cares?

485
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:02,517
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumbass frat boys.

486
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:05,317
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?

487
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,317
What would a lawyer say?

488
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:10,617
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.

489
00:35:11,516 --> 00:35:13,717
That's what I'm talking about.

490
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:26,916
-Get your ass down, fool.
-Fuck you, lady.

491
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:35,716
Ain't no lady.

492
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:42,615
-Bitch, drive it or lose it.
-Oh, my God, let's get out of here.

493
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:54,315
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.

494
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:58,915
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs....

495
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:03,615
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.

496
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:07,615
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.

497
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:09,514
To perform at this level...

498
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:12,214
an animal has to follow orders
without question.

499
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:13,414
It is not instinct.

500
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:14,714
Come on upstairs.

501
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,614
All dogs have instinct.

502
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,114
Jesus Christ.

503
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:42,213
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.

504
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:44,113
Who do we know at Fairfield?

505
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:47,613
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.

506
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:51,812
What do they want with those for, anyway?

507
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,913
Beats the fuck out of me.

508
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:59,612
-Jesus, I'm sorry.
-Fuck, man, shit.

509
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,812
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.

510
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,412
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Clumsy, I guess.

511
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:09,512
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...

512
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,412
and just clean yourself up.

513
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:16,512
You fucking goof.

514
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,511
Dick.

515
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,911
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.

516
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:29,011
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?

517
00:37:29,111 --> 00:37:31,711
-I was out the damn door.
-You don't know Cheryl.

518
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:33,411
You don't know Marla.

519
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:36,211
If you want...

520
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:39,010
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.

521
00:37:39,111 --> 00:37:41,311
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.

522
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,010
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.

523
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,809
In the car, but not out in the open.

524
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,310
Yo, Rock.

525
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,909
Be subtle with it, man.

526
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:19,809
-You know what subtle means?
-Laid back and shit.

527
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,808
-Good tunes, Pop?
-Yeah.

528
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:39,208
Thanks for the phones.

529
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,908
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...

530
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:58,308
if you go rolling over rocks...

531
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:01,108
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?

532
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,408
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.

533
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:10,107
You got to give a working police his due.

534
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:18,806
-So, Bee's working for Lamar?
-All of them work for Lamar.

535
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:21,207
He got that whole corner to hisself.

536
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:24,507
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?

537
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:25,906
In the second court.

538
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:29,506
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.

539
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:32,107
How many doors down from the end?

540
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,307
Three.

541
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:41,406
Yo, Pops.

542
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:54,806
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?

543
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:58,306
-Omar?
-Yeah, I need Omar.

544
00:39:58,406 --> 00:40:00,305
What do you want with Omar?

545
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:02,805
Just want a word with him.

546
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:04,905
Just a word.

547
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,005
You want to get with Omar...

548
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,905
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...

549
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:12,904
with a big-ass package.

550
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:16,404
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.

551
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:26,404
You feel anything?

552
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:31,004
Let's go.

553
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,504
Come on.

554
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:03,803
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...

555
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:07,202
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...

556
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:10,402
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.

557
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:13,202
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.

558
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:14,902
We need the dope on the table.

559
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:16,202
Of course you do.

560
00:41:16,302 --> 00:41:19,103
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...

561
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:23,002
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...

562
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:25,702
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.

563
00:41:25,802 --> 00:41:27,202
"We are confident"?

564
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:30,301
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...

565
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:33,101
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.

566
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:36,501
But if we come up empty on this....

567
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:38,702
You won't.

568
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,201
Five will get you ten...

569
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,601
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.

570
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,301
You have proof of this?

571
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:53,400
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.

572
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,700
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.

573
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,100
Lieutenant.

574
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,400
-Welcome to the southeast.
-Major, I understand you asked for me.

575
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,800
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.

576
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,099
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?

577
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,200
-You want to tell me about this target?
-Frank Sobotka.

578
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:38,599
A union man down at the port.

579
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,698
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.

580
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:46,998
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...

581
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,298
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.

582
00:42:50,498 --> 00:42:53,198
-You seen the off-site?
-Not yet.

583
00:42:53,398 --> 00:42:55,599
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.

584
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,498
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.

585
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,498
It's from a young woman to her mother...

586
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:08,098
or at least an older woman.

587
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:10,397
She mention any names?

588
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:14,197
There is an Anya here.

589
00:43:14,397 --> 00:43:17,997
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.

590
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,698
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.

591
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:33,997
-So who's she writing to?
-There is no name.

592
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:36,697
The letter is for the whole family.

593
00:43:37,496 --> 00:43:38,797
But...

594
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:46,197
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.

595
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:48,796
-Nadya.
-Is she in trouble?

596
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:51,096
She's dead.

597
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,996
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?

598
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:58,496
If you had an envelope, I could....

599
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:02,696
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...

600
00:44:02,796 --> 00:44:05,296
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

601
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:06,696
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

602
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,095
-Father Vasyl, it says.
-There's no names or places or....

603
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:14,395
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...

604
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:17,395
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.

605
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:23,095
But leave the letter. I will try.

606
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,795
Thank you.

607
00:44:30,694 --> 00:44:35,094
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.

608
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:36,995
There's enough work.

609
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:43,994
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...

610
00:44:44,094 --> 00:44:45,894
from about a month ago.

611
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:48,694
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.

612
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:51,394
Stop, Ash.

613
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,993
I was thinking...

614
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:02,193
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.

615
00:45:02,293 --> 00:45:04,393
You could cover that?

616
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,994
And maybe we don't rent.

617
00:45:07,493 --> 00:45:10,494
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.

618
00:45:10,893 --> 00:45:13,293
Nothing too big, just....

619
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:18,393
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...

620
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:20,493
has been fixed up real nice.

621
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:25,392
Like with wood floors and all.

622
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,892
Ash, what's that ship right there?

623
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:34,792
-Cable ship.
-And what's the gray one next to it?

624
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:36,392
Military Sealift.

625
00:45:37,392 --> 00:45:38,692
Attagirl.

626
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:42,392
You cold?

627
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:50,592
-Dwight?
-What's up?

628
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:53,192
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.

629
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,591
Search? What the fuck?

630
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:57,392
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.

631
00:45:57,491 --> 00:45:59,591
You got no call to be doing me like this.

632
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:02,891
-No call and no damn warrant.
-You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...

633
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:05,091
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.

634
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:07,191
Where's the key, Dwight?

635
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,891
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.

636
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,990
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...

637
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,790
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.

638
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:52,989
Here it be.

639
00:46:54,389 --> 00:46:56,589
You all planted that shit.

640
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,689
You fucking know you did.

641
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:17,188
-What's with the whistle squad?
-It's for us.

642
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:19,788
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.

643
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:22,088
-That's him.
-That's Horseface?

644
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:25,688
-How did he get the name?
-You need a close-up?

645
00:47:26,288 --> 00:47:27,688
Thomas Pakusa.

646
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:31,687
We need to talk to you about something.

647
00:47:31,787 --> 00:47:32,887
What?

648
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,187
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?

649
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:40,487
If you say so.

650
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:42,687
You remember that container
that came off that day?

651
00:47:42,787 --> 00:47:44,887
-With all the dead girls.
-No.

652
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,387
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?

653
00:47:47,487 --> 00:47:48,887
Come on, Horse.

654
00:47:48,987 --> 00:47:51,187
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.

655
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,787
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.

656
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,587
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.

657
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:57,687
No.

658
00:48:00,187 --> 00:48:01,586
Get the fuck in the car.

659
00:48:01,686 --> 00:48:04,187
-Am I locked up?
-Get in the damn car.

660
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:06,386
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.

661
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:09,286
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...

662
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,886
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.

663
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:17,886
Dad, what--

664
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:20,586
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?

665
00:48:21,186 --> 00:48:22,585
Say cheese.

666
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:25,585
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.

667
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,885
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!

668
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:37,385
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?

669
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:38,885
All right.

670
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:57,384
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.

671
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,784
Get your dick out of my computer!

672
00:49:09,684 --> 00:49:11,883
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?

673
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:15,283
Dead. To me, anyway.

674
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:18,883
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.

675
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,683
What kept you?

676
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:37,483
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.

677
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,383
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.

678
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:42,382
-How's it hanging, Prez?
-How're you doing?

679
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:43,682
I'm all right.

680
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:46,182
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?

681
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,782
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...

682
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:51,282
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.

683
00:49:51,382 --> 00:49:52,482
Not McNulty though.

684
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:55,182
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.

685
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:57,282
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.

686
00:49:57,382 --> 00:50:00,582
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.

687
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:05,481
I'll leave you to it, then.

688
00:50:07,982 --> 00:50:11,482
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.

689
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:14,081
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?

690
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,581
On what?

691
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:18,880
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.

692
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,581
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.

693
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:25,281
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.

694
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:27,481
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.

695
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:29,780
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.

696
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:37,780
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.

697
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,380
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.

698
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,080
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...

699
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,879
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped--

700
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,280
Jackpot.

701
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,380
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.

702
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,480
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.

703
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,579
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.

704
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:00,079
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.

705
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:01,380
Okay?

706
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,679
This is good, right here.

707
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:06,479
This is $10 right here.

708
00:51:09,479 --> 00:51:11,079
Snitching Bubs.

709
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,378
You be asking for me?

710
00:52:07,677 --> 00:52:11,777
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.

711
00:52:14,877 --> 00:52:18,477
-You hear the boys?
-No, it's quiet up there.

712
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,076
A little too quiet.

713
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:23,676
That means they're probably
playing video games.

714
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:25,676
Or with a book of matches.

715
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:31,176
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?

716
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:33,075
I did.

717
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:38,076
-And?
-He says I shouldn't sign it.

718
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:41,575
Says I'm giving away too much.

719
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,075
I would never, under any circumstances...

720
00:52:44,175 --> 00:52:46,975
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.

721
00:52:47,075 --> 00:52:48,475
That's what he says?

722
00:53:00,174 --> 00:53:01,975
Signed and notarized.

723
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:08,174
I don't wanna argue about the money.

724
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:10,574
I wanna get back together.

725
00:53:19,274 --> 00:53:20,173
Yeah.

726
00:53:26,473 --> 00:53:29,174
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.

727
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:33,473
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...

728
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:35,573
one who was, himself, incapacitated...

729
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,573
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...

730
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,674
a 10-year veteran.

731
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:42,273
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...

732
00:53:42,373 --> 00:53:44,673
and the State Public Safety Secretary...

733
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:47,973
to announce that the maximum penalties...

734
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:50,572
will be sought against this officer....

735
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:53,073
I got a midterm. I got to study.

736
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:21,871
-So this is their joint?
-What's the plan?

737
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:26,172
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.

738
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:51,670
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?

739
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,970
I hate that country shit.

740
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,270
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.

741
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,869
No, sir.

742
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:18,569
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.

743
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:20,569
Left tackle.

744
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:24,169
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.

745
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:27,669
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.

746
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:28,969
Darling.

747
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:34,668
What's the deal?

748
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:38,468
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.

749
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,568
How about you?

750
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:42,668
I'm leaving after this one.

751
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:57,168
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.

752
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,268
-City Homicide.
-Homicide?

753
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:03,268
-Who got killed?
-Those dead girls in the can.

754
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:07,567
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.

755
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:09,968
That's what I heard, anyway.

756
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,067
Excuse me.
