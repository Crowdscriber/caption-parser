PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces</i> <i>of the United States</i>

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:11,607
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,609
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

5
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,087
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned</i>
<i>acts of terror</i>

6
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:17,778
<i>in Africa, Europe,</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

7
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:20,390
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand,</i>
<i>this</i> <i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

8
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:22,160
<i>REAGAN:</i> <i>This relentless
pursuit</i> <i>of terror.</i>

9
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,794
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

10
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:25,297
REPORTER:
<i>The</i> USS Cole <i>was attacked</i>

11
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:26,506
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,473
This was an act of terrorism.

13
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:30,982
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

14
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:33,319
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

15

is one of the good old
favorites.

16
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:37,090
Until something stops him.

17
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,931
WOMAN: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

18
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:43,538
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

19
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,176
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

20
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:50,879
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

22

SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

23
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,960
God!

<i>I won't...</i> <i>I</i> can't
<i>let that happen again.</i>

26
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,203
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

<i>Previously, on</i> Homeland...

30
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,816
You're telling me
the fucking CIA

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,617
thinks I'm working for Al Qaeda?

BRODY: <i>Ask me anything.
</i> <i>What goes on in your garage?</i>

34
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:35,092
Why do you go there

<i>so early in the morning?</i>

36
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:37,763
To pray.

37
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,331
You're a Muslim?

38
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,400
Why did they kill
Walker and not you?

39
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,669
I killed him.

40
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,004
CARRIE:
<i>Who told you to kill him?</i>

41

BRODY:
<i>Yes. If you want to arrest me,</i>

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,576
you can come to my house.
No! Brody!

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,344
We were wrong about Brody.

45
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,746
A POW <i>was</i> turned.

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,914
<i>It wasn't him.</i>

47
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,116
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.

48
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,117
Tom Walker died!

49
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,118
No.

50
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,486
He's the terrorist.

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,955
HELEN:
<i>Tom was dead.</i>

52
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:03,989
That's what they told me.

53
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,490
What we need to do is find him

54
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,858
before anything happens.

55
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,993
Oh, baby, I've done
a horrible thing.

56
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:10,995
No, Helen, no. Don't. Don't!
They're tracing this call.

57
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,298
You've got to get out of there!

CARRIE: <i>The tac team</i>
<i>followed Walker here.</i>

61
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,040
Two casualties.

62
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,310
Local Muslims here

TV NEWSWOMAN: Congressman Richard
Johnson, caught in a sexting scandal

64

sending nude and semi-nude
pictures of himself

65

to a number of
congressional interns.

66
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,621
He'll be gone in two days.

<i>I have an idea</i>
<i>who might replace him.</i>

68
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:37,191
Are you crazy?

69
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,060
You people told me
Walker was dead.

70
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,195
I-I don't...

71
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,963
My friend!

72
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,064
(screams)

73
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,532
You told me I killed him!

74
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,000
You made me believe!

75
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,901
I don't know!

76
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,170
You have to talk to Abu Nazir!

77
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,038
(grunting)

78
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,074
I'm through talking with Nazir.

79
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,143
Tell him it's over.

(vacuum humming loudly,
phone vibrating)

83
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,779
Hey, Jess. It's me.
I'm in the store.

84
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,415
What's... I think
it says Vitamin Water?

85
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,784
What is that,
some kind of medicine?

86
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,853
If you get this
in the next few minutes,

87
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,055
will you call me back? Thanks.

88
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,429
(vacuum stops)

89
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,300
You finish your homework?

90
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:58,738
I just can't believe that Tom
Walker is really actually alive.

91
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,774
I know.
It seems crazy.

92
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,976
What's Dad say?

93
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,479
So far, not a whole lot.

94
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,581
Well, have you even asked him?

95
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,717
Yes, Dana, of course
I've asked him.

96
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,218
He can't believe it.

97
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,987
He says there's got
to be some mistake.

98
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:16,056
It's not the first time the
FBI have gotten it wrong.

99
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,092
Yeah, but what
if they're right?

100
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:20,560
Two Marines are captured

101
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,295
and one comes back a terrorist?

102
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,965
Dad must be going
out of his mind.

103
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,500
Did you find everything
you're looking for today, sir?

104
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,702
Yes, thank you.
You're welcome.

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,740
Just one thing.
Yeah.

106
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,475
What does that say?

107
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,278
Vitamin Water.
What is that?

108
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,414
It's-It's good. It's
like flavored water.

109
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,517
Would you like me to get
someone to find it for you?

110
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,285
What flavor?

111
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,654
I don't know, what you got?
Um...

112
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,525
Hey, you're that Marine
war hero guy, right?

113
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,381
(cell phone ringing)

114
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,851
(grunts)

115
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:20,187
(car alarm wailing)

116
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:23,424
(grunts)

117
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,571
(cell phone continues ringing)

118
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:40,574

(speaks Arabic)

125
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,603
IMAM: We have nothing to do
but pray for our brothers,

126
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:11,173
that they were going
to heaven for God.

127
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:14,242
And the FBI said that
they were fired at first.

128
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:15,743
Which is a lie.
(crowd murmuring)

129
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:18,279
The truth is,
they shot and killed

130
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,181
two innocent people
in a house of worship.

131
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,082
Without provocation.

132
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,584
REPORTER: What about the man
they were chasing-- Tom Walker?

133
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,252
What do you know about him?

134
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,955
All any of us know is that a
stranger ran through our mosque

135
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,622
being chased by FBI agents

136
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,925
while we were gathering
for morning prayers.

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,761
REPORTER: Have you been told the names
of the agents who fired the shots?

138
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,296
IMAM:
No, we're still awaiting

139
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,064
a full investigation.
We don't know anything yet.

140
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,900
(crowd clamoring)

141
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,134
IMAM:
No, sir.

142
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,435
We do not condone hate.

143
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,838
Or violence.

144
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:47,975
HALL:
Ms. Mathison.

145
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,043
Special Agent Hall.

146
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:51,712
I asked to meet
the SWAT team commander,

147
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,447
the man who was on
the ground for this.

148
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,949
And you got me.
His boss.

149
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,651
How can I help?

150
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,853
Would you mind taking
your shoes off, please?

151
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,759
What are we doing
here, exactly?

152
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,727
Everything we can
to catch Walker.

153
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,663
You're aware there's an
FBI manhunt up and running.

154
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,134
All 56 field offices,
canceled leave...

155
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,303
The reason why I asked to meet
the actual SWAT commander

156
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,272
is because I need him
to walk me through exactly

157
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,975
what happened here.
Which he already did with me.

158
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,581
So, Walker comes in from the
alley, through this door here.

159
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,116
And we already know
he was armed,

160
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,518
because he stole a gun
from one of your men.

161
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,187
And?

162
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:34,055
Did Walker open fire first?

163
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:37,592
Yes. Yet the imam is
standing out there,

164
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,527
telling the world that's a lie.

165
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,930
The imam?
It's his word against mine.

166
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:45,367
He also says that neither he nor
any of his flock know Walker.

167
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,035
Which is not true.

168
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,037
Do you want to know why?

169
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:50,338
Please.

170
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,607
Walk with me.

171
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:56,544
He hauls ass down these stairs
to a service corridor

172
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,980
that goes left to
a janitor's storage room,

173
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:01,549
or right, doubling back
underneath the building

174
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,117
to a bilko door on Raum Street,

175
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,153
all the way on the east
side of the building.

176
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,555
Son of a bitch goes right.

177
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,157
He knew exactly where
the fuck he was going.

178
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:12,360
You following me
on this so far?

179
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,162
He knows this mosque.

180
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,565
Correct.

181
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,234
And probably a lot of people
that come here, too.

182
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,261
<i>Assalamo alliakum.</i>

183
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,763
<i>Wa 'aliakum-as-salam.</i>

184
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,265
Imam, let me begin by saying
how deeply sorry I am

185
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,167
for your loss.
Losses.

186
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,269
Plural.

187
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,637
There were two dead.

188
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,279
Imam, my name is
Carrie Mathison.

189
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,515
Another government official
here to suggest that if

190
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,283
we weren't all guilty,
one way or another,

191
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,551
none of this would
have happened.

192
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,786
Right?

193
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,396
I'm also well aware of your
good work in this neighborhood,

194
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,031
beyond just here in the mosque.

195
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,433
Then you should know
how violated we all feel.

196
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,135
I do. Yes.

197
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,804
I have seven eyewitnesses,
including myself,

198
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,806
who saw what happened.

199
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,043
Please forgive me, but my job
right now, my only job,

200
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,780
is to catch this man Walker
as soon as possible.

201
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,915
He did not fire a single
shot at the agents.

202
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,252
He was moving too fast,
trying to get away from them.

203
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:47,289
Either Walker was very lucky to
get away as quickly as he did,

204
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:48,824
or he knew this mosque
well enough

205
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,392
to use it as an escape route.

206
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,829
I have families to comfort.

207
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,830
I have funerals to arrange.

208
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,399
I have a community who believes

209
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,401
they will never get justice
for what happened.

210
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:03,271
If you do know Walker,
or anything about him,

211
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:05,473
or anyone who might...

212
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,809
whatever you tell us,
no matter how small,

213
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:09,277
would be in total confidence.

214
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,814
And yet you offer me
nothing in return.

215
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,484
What do you mean by that?

216
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,920
Specifically.
Just so I'm clear.

217
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,290
Two families will
get no justice,

218
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:22,125
unless the FBI tells the truth

219
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,027
about how they killed
two innocent people

220
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:27,298
who were doing
nothing but pray.

221
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,367
In other words,
you do know something.

222
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,638
Good-bye, Ms. Mathison.

223
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:37,040
Mr. Galvez.

224
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:40,544
He knows Walker.

225
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:42,312
You saw that, right?
I'm not crazy?

226
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:43,947
You're not crazy.
(sighs)

227
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:45,615
I don't give a shit
what it takes,

228
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,884
that imam is going to talk to me.
What it takes?

229
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:49,352
He wants a full FBI mea culpa.

230
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:51,821
Good luck with that.

231
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,291
(kettle whistling)
It's not medicine,

232
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:56,726
it's a drink.

233
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,528
Dana likes the "Revive" flavor,

234
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,730
and Chris likes
the "Energy" one.

235
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,666
And Dana's been asking
a lot about Tom Walker.

236
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,169
It's all over the Internet, and
I don't really have any answers,

237
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:07,004
so if you can come home
as soon as you can...

238
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,674
Oh, um, I told Chris that
I would take him to a movie

239
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,509
if he got all his
homework done today.

240
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:15,246
He specifically asked if
you would come, too, so...

241
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,881
just... call me back. Okay?

Hey.

00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,358
What, are you stalking me now?

270
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,260
How'd you find me here?

271
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:55,029
They spent years training me.

272
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,264
Ah. So, what's
the problem?

273
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,866
The imam.

274
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,868
He'll calm down
in a day or two.

275
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,603
I don't have a day or two.

276
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,038
He says your men fired first.

277
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:05,406
I know what he's saying.

278
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,174
He has seven eyewitnesses,
including himself,

279
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,944
saying Walker didn't shoot,
or even raise a weapon at them.

280
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:12,446
And?

281
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,783
I believe he's withholding
information about Walker.

282
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,119
You people have rubber hoses,
don't you?

283
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:21,622
He's a good man
caught in a bad situation.

284
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,257
He runs a mosque

285
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,626
that a terrorist suspect used
as an escape route.

286
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,695
He wants justice for the men
who were killed,

287
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,398
for which I think he'll tell me
what he knows about Walker.

288
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,801
Justice?

289
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,704
W... What does that mean?

290
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,473
(sighs)

291
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,875
Well, for one thing it means
compensation for the families.

292
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,311
Look, if one of
your men made a mistake,

293
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:44,981
you need to come clean.

294
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:46,316
Let me ask you something.

295
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:48,152
You ever been in a firefight?

296
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:50,488
Yes.

297
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:55,325
Okay.

298
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,827
So, my men follow
an armed terrorist suspect,

299
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:00,296
based off intel
provided by you people,

300
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,998
at zero dark-thirty
into a fucking building

301
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,934
that they don't even
know is a mosque.

302
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,803
In seconds, a member of the team
thinks he has a clear shot

303
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,505
at bringing down a terrorist,

304
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:11,074
and he takes it.
Accidentally,

305
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:12,976
he drops two civilians
in the crossfire.

306
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,911
Shit happens.

307
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:18,482
But if you think
that I or the bureau

308
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,417
are gonna let the CIA come in

309
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:22,319
and throw any of my guys
under the bus,

310
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,689
you're fucking high.

311
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,311
Hey. Hey, Issa,
come closer.

312
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,879
Don't be afraid.

313
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:50,447
Come on.

314
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:52,049
Want to play?

315
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:59,156
Hey. Hey, you know
how to do this?

316
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:06,063
Can you do this? Yeah?

317
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,699
Want to learn?

318
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:15,337
Yeah?

319
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,140
Look. Soccer ball.

320
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,574
It's a soccer ball.

321
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,009
Soccer.

322
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,877
Can you say that? Soccer.

323

Soccer...

324
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,514
Hey.

325
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,184
Hey.

326
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:30,352
Hey, Issa.

327
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,355
Hey, wait.

328
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:37,092
HALL (recorded): <i>Accidentally, he drops</i>
<i>two civilians in the crossfire.</i>

329
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,495
Shit happens.

330
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:42,998
But if you think that I
or the bureau are gonna let

331
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,568
the CIA come in and throw
any of my guys under the bus,

332
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,605
you're fucking high.

333
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,874
You're really fucking
something, Carrie.

334
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:54,743
I got to hand it to you.

335
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,444
There is no bridge
you won't burn,

336
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,046
no earth you won't scorch.

337
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,748
When it comes
to catching Walker,

338
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,450
or any terrorist suspect,
for that matter, damn straight.

339
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,353
You recorded a senior
FBI agent who thought

340
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:07,188
he was talking off the record
to someone on the same side,

341
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,223
so you could leverage the
FBI into admitting a mistake.

342
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,058
Are you really prepared

343
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,393
to sacrifice the very agency
that, with all their manpower,

344
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,462
is the best chance
we have to get Walker?

345
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:18,364
They accidentally shot
and killed two people.

346
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:21,300
Now, I get that it's not easy,
or even ideal,

347
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:23,702
but we need to convince them
to just make a statement

348
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,471
taking responsibility.
For what?

349
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:28,707
The hope that this imam
will give you information

350
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,442
that you don't even know he has?

351
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:31,976
No disrespect,
David, but I think

352
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:33,745
I've been
in the field long enough

353
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,414
to know a source
when I see one.

354
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,885
You will not,

355
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,721
I repeat, not,

356
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,824
do anything to
sabotage the FBI manhunt

357
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:46,825
for Walker.

358
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,460
That is a direct order.

359
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,818
What's happened here?

360
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,957
I was showing him a trick
with the ball.

361
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:20,559
And I, uh,
I knocked over some glasses.

362
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,261
(panting)

363
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,307
What the hell...

364
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,343
are you doing, Carrie?

365
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,079
What? Nothing.

366
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:19,516
The last I checked,
this was my office.

367
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,321
Just needed somewhere private
to calm down.

368
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:26,190
Somewhere private?

369
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:28,392
Okay, so I was hoping you'd
be here. Where have you been?

370
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:32,196
I just heard about the imam
and the FBI.

371
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,698
Estes is right.

372
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,701
That imam knows Walker.

373
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,037
I fucking know it, 100%.

374
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:40,538
You think the Imam's bad?

375
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:41,906
No. No, that's
the problem.

376
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,541
He's practically a saint.

377
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:44,909
I've got nothing on him.

378
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,377
I've got zero leverage.

379
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,212
You're 100% sure he's not bad?

380
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:49,914
Pretty much.

381
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:58,589
So?

382
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:00,090
Maybe you're approaching
the problem

383
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:01,692
the wrong way around.

Please, have some tea.

I'm sorry, this isn't easy.

404
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,724
I understand.

405
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:43,193
Imam, I've done my research.

406
00:24:43,227 --> 00:24:45,194
I know of your work
in the community--

407
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,163
the woman's refuge you
run with Father Rose

408
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:49,398
from St. Agnes'
down the street.

409
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:52,735
I have no doubt you and
I want the same thing.

410
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:54,370
Which is a better world.

411
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:56,640
And a better America.

412
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,644
If there's another terrorist
attack, this country

413
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,080
is primed to turn on itself.

414
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,850
You and I both know we're
halfway there already.

415
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,519
But if an attack happens

416
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,421
that can be traced
back to information

417
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:13,558
that you chose to withhold when
you were given the chance...

418
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:18,528
the mosque,

419
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:21,698
this community that you
worked so hard to build...

420
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,702
they'll put a match to it all.

421
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,339
Our only hope--

422
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:33,709
and it's a good one--
is that people like us

423
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:36,612
put our heads together
and help each other.

424
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:39,548
Now, I need to find Tom Walker.

425
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,018
Will you help me?

426
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:49,291
I pray what you say
about another attack

427
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:51,627
on America is wrong.

428
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:53,195
But you're right.

429
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,797
It takes more than just prayer.

430
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,099
We have to help each other.

431
00:25:57,134 --> 00:26:01,037
Action speaks
louder than words,

432
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,739
yet so far you've done
nothing but talk.

433
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:06,943
What were you expecting?

434
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:09,479
It's very simple: the truth.

435
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,248
Two people
were tragically caught

436
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,118
between a terrorist suspect
and those whose job it is

437
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:17,586
to stop more
attacks on America.

438
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,289
That is the truth.

439
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:23,825
I know you know Walker.

440
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:30,266
Please.

441
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:35,571
If I say I have no information,

442
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:37,507
I have no information.

443
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,108
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:58,194
In case you reconsider.

445
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,467

00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:06,293
Nice.

488
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:07,528
What you hunting?

489
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:09,163
Office supplies.

490
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,498
(chuckles)

491
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,367
What you got there?

492
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,036
Marlin 336
with the Vari-X.

493
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,371
Yeah, gets the job done.

494
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:18,039
Oh, it'll get her done.
(both chuckling)

495
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,175
It sure is
a beautiful day for it.

496
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,344
You, uh, you have yourself
a good one.

497
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:25,045
Want to see this
thing in action?

498
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,313
Just about got it
in the sweet spot.

499
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:30,750
Sure, sure,
w-why not?

500
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,543
I didn't get your name.

501
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:59,013
It's, uh, Dan.

502
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,882
N-Name's Dan.

503
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,851
Good talking to you, Dan.

504
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,687
Good luck out there.

505
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:07,690
Right, y-you, too.

506
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,400
Hello, Zahira.

507
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,935
When you came to our home,

508
00:31:18,969 --> 00:31:21,071
you knew it was not permitted

509
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,373
for you to be alone
with my husband.

510
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:25,074
Two pairs of ears

511
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:27,443
to hear what you had to
say being better than one.

512
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:30,212
Maybe.

513
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:33,382
I love my husband, Carrie.

514
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,616
He is a good man.

515
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,052
I don't doubt it.

516
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,894
I understand what you
said about this country--

517
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,830
the knife edge it's on.

518
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:53,803
Please, I need your word that
you will not say anything

519
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:55,971
to anyone about our meeting.

520
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,240
You have it.

521
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:04,180
This man Walker-- over
the last few weeks,

522
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:08,985
he has come to the mosque
maybe eight or nine times.

523
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,620
Every time, he meets with a man

524
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:13,455
who does not come to
the mosque to pray.

525
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,958
Just to do business.

526
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:17,860
Do you know the name
of this man?

527
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,328
All I know is,

528
00:32:20,363 --> 00:32:23,431
he drives a car with
the diplomatic plates.

529
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:25,533
Which country?

530
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:30,270
S-Saudi Arabia.

531
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:34,441
Thank you.

532
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:46,320
(breathing heavily)

533
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:00,099
(gasps)

534
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,370
Bad dream?

535
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:08,207
Yeah, yeah, it was.

536
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,242
(panting)

537
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:16,014
Hey, what you got there?

538
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,988
Hey, this is beautiful, Issa.

539
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:25,658
This is really great.

540
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:30,095
Thank you.

541
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:39,839
(sighs)

542
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,984
What is this? What's going on?

543
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,388
(groans softly)

544
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,367
(sighs)

545
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,383
(tapping)

546
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,318
Nicholas?

547
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:27,588
Can you hear me, Nicholas?

548
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:30,592
Nicholas.

549
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,598
Yeah, I can hear you.

550
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,466
You're angry.

551
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:40,069
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

552
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:43,039
You're also in shock.

553
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,576
Which is why you told our friend

554
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,811
in Washington to tell me
that it's all over.

555
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,646
I've been living
the last eight years

556
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:53,349
thinking I killed Tom Walker.

557
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,285
Which I now find out
is not true.

558
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:59,354
Which means everything I did--
everything...

559
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,090
Is the peace you found
in Islam a false peace?

560
00:35:02,124 --> 00:35:04,025
Everything I believed in.

561
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:06,360
You believed
in Allah's forgiveness

562
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,828
and, through Allah's mercy,
in yourself.

563
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,163
It was all a trick!

564
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:12,099
It was based on a lie!

565
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,202
I did not let you actually
kill your friend.

566
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:18,038
Isn't that good news?

567
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,048
What is Walker doing?

568
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,218
Helping.

569
00:35:32,252 --> 00:35:33,886
That's all you need to know.

570
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:39,960
You remember the new
beginning you were given?

571
00:35:39,995 --> 00:35:42,530
Yes, I remember.

572
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:44,232
Issa.

573
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:49,638
You trusted me with Issa.

574
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:51,073
Why?

575
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:54,143
Why not trust a man
who would rather die

576
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:56,179
than give information
to his enemy?

577
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,849
You got your enemy
to teach your own son.

578
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:03,320
No, we only began as enemies,

579
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:06,723
because that's what
the others told us to be.

580
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:10,059
Are we enemies now?

581
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,264
Have you forgotten?

582
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:26,911
BOTH: Buy me some peanuts
and Cracker Jack

583
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:31,549
I don't care if I never...

584
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:33,585
BOTH:
...get back

585
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,119
I want to...

586
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:38,857
BOTH:
Root, root, root for the

587
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:40,391
home team...

588
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:43,093
Finish it.

589
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:45,463
Come on, brat.
You're almost done.

590
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:50,268
Let me root, root, root
for the home team

591
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:53,939
If they don't win, it's a shame

592
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:56,975
For it's one, two,

593
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,211
three strikes, you're out

594
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:02,782
at the old ball game.
♪ ...ball game. ♪

595
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:08,288
You air brat.

596
00:37:08,322 --> 00:37:09,589
You <i>are</i> a brat.

597
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:12,292
You are a brat.

598
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:14,461
And you're gonna be late
for school. Get out of here.

599
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:19,933
(sighs)

600
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:23,003
Hey, are you forgetting
something?

601
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,540
Score a goal today.

602
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:35,483
(explosion)

603
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:44,426

(both praying in Arabic)

623
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:13,299
NAZIR:
I pray every day

624
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:16,469
that you never lose sight of
what you committed

625
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:18,070
to do in Issa's name.

626
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:24,209
I never wanted or planned
any of this.

627
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:27,246
It was your choice
doing what you are doing

after what happened that day.

629
00:41:29,716 --> 00:41:34,820
But... in the end,

630
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:39,258
you are... a soldier,
as you say.

631
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,561
And you will either stay true

632
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:45,864
to that and do what
you feel is right...

633
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:49,835
or you will not.

634

<i>Alamdulilla.</i>

635
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:59,577
Nazir? Nazir?!

636
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,253
Nazir said that you would
remember this

637
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:10,621
from two years ago.

638
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:17,128
At 4:42 p.m. local time, a drone
missile hit and destroyed

639
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,031
part of a compound 120 miles
northeast of Mosul

640
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:22,067
in the mountains
of Northern Iraq

641
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:24,236
from which Abu Nazir,

642
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:25,771
the leader of the IPLA,
is believed

643
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:27,373
to have been operating.

644
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:29,910
The images being broadcast on
some news outlets

645
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:32,779
around the world of the bodies
of 83 dead children

646
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:36,483
allegedly killed in the strike,
we believe to be false,

647
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:39,887
created by the terrorists
for propaganda purposes.

648
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:43,090
And they call us terrorists.

649
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:52,132
Make no mistake, that in
the planning of these missions,

650
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:55,768
all that can be done is done
to protect the innocent,

651
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:58,905
in particular, the precious
lives of children,

652
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,441
while we keep our promise
to hunt down the terrorists

653
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:02,943
who continue to plot against...

654
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:04,945
(turns off TV)

655
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:06,947
As you already know,
that man there,

656
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:08,582
the Vice President,

657
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:10,450
the former Director of the CIA,

658
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,786
and the man most instrumental
in the drone attack

659
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,421
that killed young Issa,

660
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:16,856
as he prepares to become
President,

661
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,858
he's going to want to use you,

662
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,526
to be seen with you,

663
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:22,528
his American hero,
more and more.

664
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:24,130
Let him.

665
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:28,100
We also believe
that he's going to ask you

666
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:29,935
to run for political office.

667
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,837
Say yes.

668
00:43:31,871 --> 00:43:33,939
This will be a signal
to Abu Nazir

669
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:35,942
that you are committed still

670
00:43:35,976 --> 00:43:38,044
to doing this.

671
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,868
Ah, Jesus.

672
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,241
(gunshot)

673
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,089
The doctor says you should
take these with food.

674
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,828
Go out the back way.

675
00:44:27,862 --> 00:44:29,196
Take a right.

676
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,998
Your car is across the street.

677
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,799
The groceries are inside.

678
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:49,551
(engine starts, country music
playing over radio)

679
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:52,888
♪ So glad he never made the
choice that he'd always regret ♪

680
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:57,459
♪ And the tougher things got,
the tougher that he stayed... ♪

681
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:25,017
(grunts softly)

682
00:45:43,203 --> 00:45:47,006
SAUL That's it on the left,
home of our Saudi diplomat.

683
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:53,680
CARRIE:
Diplomatic fucking immunity.

684
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:55,182
Just like "Klaus" in '03.

685
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:57,017
That was the Swiss
embassy in Caracas,

686
00:45:57,051 --> 00:45:58,519
and we nearly
let Klaus slip away.

687
00:45:58,553 --> 00:46:00,856
I'm not losing this guy, Saul.

688
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,991
For now, we wait and see

689
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:04,993
if Mr. Zahrani does anything
or goes anywhere

690
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:07,162
that will help us
get to Walker.

691
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,465
You live for this shit.

692
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,635
So I've been told.

693
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,846
What if Mr. Zahrani doesn't
give us anything anytime soon?

694
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,718
We figure out an elegant way
to lift and interrogate him.

695
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:53,141
(groans softly)

696
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:55,511
I'm not gonna ask you
where you've been all day.

697
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:59,048
I know you have a lot on your
mind, and a lot to process,

698
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,050
and I'm in danger of sounding
like a broken record.

699
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,852
Oh, my God, what happened?!

700
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,755
I got mugged.

701
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,323
What do you mean, mugged?

702
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,893
As in, attacked and robbed.

703
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:11,730
Are you all right?
Did you call the cops?

704
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:13,599
What good are the cops
gonna do?

705
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:15,267
By the time I came round,

706
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:17,369
the fuckers that did this
were long gone.

707
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:18,938
Where did this happen?

708
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:20,906
Grocery store parking lot.

709
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:22,675
Three of the bastards.

710
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,444
I-I'm fine.
I'm fine.

711
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:27,380
I went to the, uh...
I went to the emergency room.

712
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:28,882
Why didn't you call me?

713
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:30,251
They got my phone.

714
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:33,053
I didn't want to worry you
and the kids.

715
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:36,023
Seriously, it's no big deal.

716
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:37,958
Are you hurt?

717
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:39,527
Ah, a couple broken ribs.

718
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:41,261
It... Hey, hey.

719
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:44,430
I'm fine, I'm fine.
All right?

720
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,101
Fuck, Brody, you should've
called the cops.

721
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:52,103
I really don't need
the attention right now.

722
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:53,872
What else did they take?

723
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:57,308
Oh, a few bucks, my pride.

724
00:47:58,978 --> 00:48:00,978
You're all right,
that's what's important.

725
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:02,379
Mm-hmm.

726
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:04,448
You know what
the worst part of it is?

727
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:07,118
I really wanted
to spend the day

728
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:09,254
with you and the kids.

729
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:14,492
I want us to spend
more time together...

730
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:16,895
as a family.

731
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,964
That sounds so good.

732
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:25,806
(sighs)

733
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,908
Eight years out there,
I come back,

734
00:48:27,943 --> 00:48:29,443
I get mugged outside
the grocery store.

735
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:30,745
It's unbelievable.

736
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:32,413
(both chuckle)

737
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:33,781
America's a violent country.

738
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:35,450
What can I tell you?

739
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:39,120
Oh...

740
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:40,588
(groans) I'm sorry.

741
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:42,189
Oh, and guess what.

742
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:43,524
What?

743
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:45,159
There's a message on
the voicemail...

744
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:48,195
from the Vice President's
office.

745
00:48:49,156 --> 00:48:59,333
