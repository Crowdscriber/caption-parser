00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,402
I don't care where he is.
Find him.

3
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:18,669
It's urgent.

4
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,304
Yes, I'll hold.

5
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:31,315
<i>He's been locked up</i>
<i>for almost a year</i>

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,684
<i>and overnight they decide</i>
<i>to hold a trial</i>

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,253
<i>and pronounce a death sentence?</i>

8
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:37,021
What did you expect?

9
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:39,290
Hasan blew up 129 civilians
in the marketplace in Ramadi.

10
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:40,825
I know what he did.

11
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,126
I also know he's got intel

12
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,761
about an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

13
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,029
He's been dangling
this so-called attack

14
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:46,931
for the last three months.
Yeah.

15
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,167
And now he'll come clean
if we commute his sentence.

16
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:51,769
We don't dictate law
to the Iraqis anymore.

17
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:53,237
This is their jurisdiction.

18
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:54,405
And Hasan is their prisoner.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,474
David...

20
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,116
Hold on a second.

21
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:10,121
He's Abu Nazir's
bomb maker, David.

22
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,523
Execute him now, and everything
he knows is gone forever.

23
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:14,325
It's over.

24
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,594
I'm on my way to the prison now.
At least petition JSOC.

25
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:18,629
- Have them appeal to the Iraqi Army.
- JSOC can't do anything either.

26
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,874
David, you're a CIA deputy
director... you can do this.

27
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,893
- I told you it's over.
- Please don't shut me down.

28
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:27,111
David, Senator Feldman's
looking for you.

29
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,573
- Tell him I'll be right there.
- David, please,

30
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:30,174
this is
my last chance with Hasan.

31
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,109
- Carrie, I have to go.
- David...

32
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:33,644
I'm hanging up.

33
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,226
Estes didn't go for it.

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,428
I knew he wouldn't.

35
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,399
Is that him?

36
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,468
Yes.

37
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,505
I'm not sure we can trust him.

38
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,973
Can he get me inside or not?

39
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,307
He says he can.

40
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,780
Now you have only two minutes.

41
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,482
Understand what I say...
two minutes.

42
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:12,783
Ibrahim...

43
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:16,187
I tried to get the
Agency to intervene,

44
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,822
but they couldn't do anything.

45
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,290
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,359
So I have nothing to say to you.

47
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:22,660
Ibrahim, you said

48
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,161
your family was in hiding,

49
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:25,329
afraid for their lives.

50
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:26,964
I can get them to Amman.

51
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,833
Tell me what you know,

52
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:32,169
and I will personally
guarantee their safety.

53
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:35,039
Why should I believe
you will do what you say?

54
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,841
We have to go.
You said two minutes.

55
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,843
The guards, they are coming.

56
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:40,611
I need more time.

57
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,017
You don't believe me?

58
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,419
Well, maybe I was wrong
to believe you.

59
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,420
You said you were
an important man.

60
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:50,788
You said you had information

61
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,690
about an attack by Abu Nazir.

62
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,692
- I have information.
- Prove it.

63
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,794
Because unless you do,

64
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,763
I won't protect your family.

65
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:07,038
Please, we're out of time!

66
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,643
My family!

67
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,614
My family!
You promised to protect them!

Last night, at 2300 GMT,

78
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,538
one of our ground assets
produced a live lead

79
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:50,207
on an enemy operating base
in the Korengal Valley.

80
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:51,676
Nice of you to join us, Carrie.

81
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,477
How is it you are
the only analyst

82
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:55,946
in this section that can't
get to a briefing on time?

83
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,015
I wanted the whole
group to hear this.

84
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,918
Within the hour,

85
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,520
Delta Team was on site.

86
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,022
where they identified multiple
insurgents on our hit list.

87
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:07,958
Minutes later, two UH-60
Blackhawk gunships

88
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:10,828
lit the target with
over 8,000 rounds.

89
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:12,963
All 13 hostiles
were confirmed kills.

90
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:14,765
But, during the sweep,

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,002
one of the deltas found
something else...

92
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:21,505
a padlocked door
to an interior room.

93
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,641
I wanted you
to see for yourselves.

94
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:31,615
Get the fuck down!

95
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,684
Get him on his feet!

96
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:38,122
What did you say?

97
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,960
I'm an American.

98
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:46,831
Turns out he's one of ours.

99
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:49,467
Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

100
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,103
MIA since early 2003
and presumed dead...

101
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:53,804
until now.

102
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,073
What happened to his partner?

103
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,008
Brody was a scout sniper.
They work in pairs.

104
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,177
Corporal Thomas Walker also
went missing that day.

105
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:01,612
According to Sergeant Brody,

106
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,447
Walker was killed
during their captivity.

107
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:05,182
But that shouldn't dampen

108
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:06,984
what is a major win
for the agency and for everyone

109
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:09,320
in this room.
You should all take a moment...

110
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,489
give yourselves a big hand.

111
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:14,125
Because of you, an American hero
is coming home.

112
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,427
Good job.

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,735
What were his exact
words, please?

114
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,005
<i>An American prisoner of war</i>
<i>has been turned.</i>

115
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,239
He said this in English?

116
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,541
Yes. He whispered it
into my ear

117
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:04,875
right before the
guards pulled me away.

118
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,544
And when he used
the expression "turned..."

119
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:10,181
He meant turned...
working for Abu Nazir.

120
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,739
Why am I just hearing
about this now?

121
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,164
Because until ten minutes ago,

122
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:16,387
I didn't know there were any P.O.W.'s
still alive in Iraq or Afghanistan.

123
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,755
So you're suggesting
that Abu Nazir...

124
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,461
You're suggesting
that Abu Nazir

125
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,931
planted intelligence in
his own safe house

126
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:29,433
just so we could recover
Sergeant Brody?

127
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,535
I realize it sounds
like a reach.

128
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,205
To say the least.

129
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,840
Why not just drop him
near a checkpoint

130
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,474
and make it look
like he escaped.

131
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,876
Why would you sacrifice
13 trained fighters?

132
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,010
Because Abu Nazir

133
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,378
is playing the long game.

134
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:42,713
This way, no one
suspects a thing.

135
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:43,881
Except you.
Yeah, except me.

136
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,516
Yeah.

137
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,684
And Sergeant Brody's due home

138
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:48,118
from Germany tomorrow morning,

139
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:50,412
which gives us
just under 22 hours.

140
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,588
To do what?

141
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,273
To authorize a
surveillance package.

142
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,424
To tap his phones,
wire his house,

143
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,985
follow him wherever he goes.

144
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,653
David will never sign off
on that and you know it.

145
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:01,699
Of course he won't.

146
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,567
The White House needs
a poster boy for the war,

147
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,167
and David just served
him up on a platter.

148
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:06,219
That's why I'm coming to you.

149
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:07,938
I'm not going over his
head, not on a hunch.

150
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,341
But if I'm right,
if he is a terrorist,

151
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,807
we need eyes and ears
on Brody from the minute

152
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:13,978
he steps off the plane.

153
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:14,778
- Never happen.
- But...

154
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:18,115
Out of the question.
Carrie...

155
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,020
All right, fine.
What do I have to do?

156
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,993
Prove that the safe house
leak was planted.

157
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:31,161
Or at least give me a reason
to doubt its authenticity.

158
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:32,963
I'm in the penalty box, Saul.

159
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,132
I'm 5,000 miles away
from my contacts.

160
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,368
I can't collect intelligence
from behind a desk.

161
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,069
Find a way.

162
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,741
No, don't look at me that way.

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,577
We're all fighting
the same enemy here.

164
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,100
We're ready for you,
Sergeant Brody.

165
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,572
Your debriefing.

166
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:19,543
I want to call my wife first.

167
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,227
Oh, I think that's mine.

168
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:12,196
Oh, no. Oh...

169
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,365
Don't get it. Don't.

170
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,467
It might be one of my kids.

171
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:22,306
Hello.

172
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,774
Jessica?

173
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:28,178
It's me. Brody.

174
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:32,583
Brody?

175
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:38,956
Come on, Jess, talk to me.

176
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,657
What do you want me to say?

177
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:42,326
Tell me that you're okay.

178
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,495
I'm not okay.

179
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,830
I'm a long way from okay.

180
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,100
Hey.

181
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:26,603
Mom!

182
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:28,839
Where's your sister?

183
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:30,607
I thought you were
at the movies with Jody.

184
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:32,776
Dana!
Is she in her room?

185
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:34,011
Mom...
Come with me. Dana?!

186
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,679
Mom, just wait a second.

187
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,147
Come on. I have some
incredible news for you guys.

188
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:38,215
Mom! Come on, Mom!

189
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,050
Dana!
Mom, don't go in there!

190
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:43,787
Mom, just...
Tried to stop her.

191
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,857
How come you're home so early?

192
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:47,858
Who is he?

193
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,260
Xander.
Xander...

194
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,895
you need to leave right now.

195
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,997
I'll text you later.

196
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,467
Xan, your jacket.

197
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:03,974
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this, Mom?

198
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:06,110
Gee, Dana, I don't know, it's
either the lying or the drugs.

199
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:08,178
You're supposed to be looking
after your brother.

200
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:09,847
Well, he didn't
burn down the house.

201
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,115
Why don't you just do what
you say you're gonna do

202
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:12,683
for a change? What?
Mom!

203
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,785
You said you had something
important to tell us.

204
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,386
Shit!

205
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,322
What, Ma?

206
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:20,824
Come here, you two.

207
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,873
Touchdown in about two hours.

208
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:37,307
You need anything?

209
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,743
No, I'm good. Thanks.

210
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:42,846
You'll have some time
with your family first.

211
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,982
Then you'll meet
the Vice President,

212
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:46,884
who'll introduce you to
every major media outlet

213
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,685
in the whole country.

214
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,127
<i>The turnout is overwhelming</i>
<i>here at Andrews Air Force Base</i>

215
00:12:57,162 --> 00:13:01,198
where Sergeant Nicholas Brody
is scheduled to land

216
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,466
in just under two hours.

217
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,934
Now a White House spokesman
confirms

218
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:06,203
that the Vice President
will be on hand.

219
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:09,072
Do you even remember him?

220
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,141
Not really.

221
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,744
As we reported, Sergeant Brody
is one of two Marines

222
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:15,679
who went missing in action
eight years ago,

223
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:19,583
during a mission into
Iraq, near the Syrian border.

224
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:22,419
A former Marine Scout sniper,
Sergeant Brody was operating

225
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:25,055
in hostile territory
when his spotter...

226
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,857
Hi, Brody.

227
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,859
The soldiers
were then separated...

228
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,095
You coming or not, Mom?

229
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:36,366
'Cause I don't think it'd
appropriate if we were late.

230
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,102
Yeah, let me just get my coat.

231
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,038
Are you really wearing
that dress?

232
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,472
But after the announcement

233
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:45,142
that Sergeant Brody,
in fact, survived

234
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:49,112
the eight-year ordeal and was
greeted by a wave of enthusiasm

235
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:53,450
from an American public
eager to greet a true hero.

236
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,118
More details on
Sergeant Brody's captivity

237
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:56,753
are expected to come out

238
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:00,290
over the coming days,
but a military spokesman...

239
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,763
You look pretty, Mom.

240
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:09,066
Thank you.

241
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,575
Let's go.

242
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:41,265
Start in the living room.

243
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,405
I got 30 minutes.

244
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,041
And good to see
you, too, Carrie.

245
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,747
Who the fuck is he?!

246
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,615
Relax, it's all good.
It's my brother Max.

247
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,250
Max, say hi to the client.

248
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,585
Hi.

249
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:02,986
What happened
to Nick and Eddie?

250
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,321
Out of your price range.

251
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:05,989
I told you, for a grand a day,

252
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,524
it's gonna be bare bones.

253
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:08,925
Hey, you got
a bad feeling about this?

254
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,961
You want to roll this thing up

255
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:13,063
before we get started,
you just say the word.

256
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,467
Eyes and ears in every room.

257
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:20,037
Then it's back to my place
to set up the monitors.

258
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:31,548
No way you could delay
the ceremony?

259
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,484
Not without looking
like a complete asshole.

260
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,820
He's in the head now
puking his guts out.

261
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,789
I thought the Army docs
did a complete psych eval.

262
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,624
They did.
So what's the problem?

263
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:43,093
I don't know, David.
Maybe eight years at the bottom

264
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:44,661
of a hole had something
to do with it.

265
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,830
I have the Vice President
arriving as we speak.

266
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,932
And I need him smiling and
waving like a hero,

267
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,301
like it's the fucking
Macy's Day Parade.

268
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,091
The President asked me
to thank you personally.

269
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,893
I have to think the short list
for the directorship

270
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,395
just got a lot shorter.

271
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,696
Well, I appreciate
the consideration, sir.

272
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:21,198
Not that I'm pushing for it.

273
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,066
Sure you are.

274
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,036
Hi, Dad.

275
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,976
Dana.

276
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:43,980
How was your trip?

277
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:48,552
Look at how beautiful you are.

278
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:00,931
Chris.

279
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,267
Pleased to meet you.

280
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:08,472
Hug him, Chris.

281
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:25,889
Where's Mom?

282
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,262
When?

283
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:34,764
Four years ago.

284
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:40,604
Sergeant Brody,
the Vice President's here.

285
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,247
Sergeant Brody.

286
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,251
It's an honor.

287
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:58,989
Thank you, sir.

288
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,579
You okay?
Yeah.

289
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,527
Good morning, Marines.

290
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:38,929
Good morning, sir!

291
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:40,664
I said, "Good morning, Marines."

292
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:42,265
Good morning, sir!

293
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,034
Stand at ease.

294
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:46,670
<i>Sergeant Brody, on behalf</i>
<i>of the President</i>

295
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,838
of the United States and
a grateful nation,

296
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,408
it is my privilege to welcome
you home!

297
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:53,076
Oorah!

298
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,711
Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

299
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,521
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

300
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:07,791
I'm not really too good
at making speeches.

301
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:11,127
My wife does most of the talking
in the family.

302
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,933
Even though
I can't mention 'em by name,

303
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:22,072
I want to thank the Special
Forces team that saved my life.

304
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,209
And thanks
to all of you out there

305
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:28,211
for your prayers
and your good wishes.

306
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:29,412
It made all the difference.

307
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:30,480
Most of all,

308
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:33,149
I want to say...

309
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:36,820
I want to say
thank you to my family

310
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:40,357
for their strength
in my absence...

311
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:48,398
and for their undying faith
this day would come.

312
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:50,467
I'm a lucky man.

313
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,008
Guy's got game.

314
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,115
How long before you're set up?

315
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:06,816
The feed will be live
by the time

316
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,485
Sergeant Brody
gets back to his house.

317
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:12,455
More details on
Sergeant Brody's captivity

318
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,823
are expected to come out.

319
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,292
So, uh, you and Carrie,

320
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,595
how long you guys
known each other?

321
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:20,063
Long enough.

322
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,165
'Cause I'd kind of feel
a lot better

323
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,566
if I had a clear picture

324
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:24,834
about who we're dealing with.

325
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,771
We are breaking, like,
12 federal laws.

326
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,607
You would, would you?
A clearer picture?

327
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,142
Why don't you shut the fuck up

328
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,543
and get back to work, okay?

329
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:37,247
Hey...

330
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:40,116
I'm sorry, um... let's just say

331
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,685
that she's a little intense.

332
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,053
Yeah.

333
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,654
Yeah.

334
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,893
What's that?

335
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:51,728
It's what she hides
in her aspirin bottle

336
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:52,996
instead of aspirin.

337
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,633
I have one of my migraines
coming on, so...

338
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,234
Let me see that.

339
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:01,805
What do you think it is?

340
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:06,843
I don't know.

341
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,388
I'm driving.

342
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,356
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

343
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:22,826
Jesus, Mom, just let him drive.

344
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,495
Okay, I guess.

345
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:27,464
Marine!

346
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:29,532
Mike?

347
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,237
Welcome back.

348
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,271
Thanks, man.

349
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:38,842
How you holding up?

350
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:39,843
You look good.

351
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:41,578
It's great to be home.

352
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,580
It's great to have you home.

353
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,248
This is for real?
You stayed in?

354
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,649
Military intelligence.

355
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:49,085
I know, right?
Me, of all people, huh?

356
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:52,422
And Megan? How's she?

357
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,023
Long gone, buddy.

358
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,726
She divorced me between
my second and third tours.

359
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,428
Ah.

360
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,864
Look, I hate to bring this
up, but Langley wants to

361
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:02,565
schedule a follow-up to
your debrief in Germany.

362
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,234
- They asked me to arrange it.
- When?

363
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,569
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?!

364
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:08,905
I know. I said the
same thing, but...

365
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,107
this guy Estes, he wants it
done sooner than later.

366
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:13,743
He just got here.
It's okay, Jess.

367
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:15,845
I'd rather just
get it over with.

368
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,047
Well, I'll send
a car in the morning.

369
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,182
Good.

370
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:20,283
And when you're up for it...

371
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:24,154
I'm taking you to the Greeks
for some steak and beer, buddy,

372
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:26,589
'cause we got a lot of lost
time to start making up for.

373
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:28,625
Huh?

374
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,927
Yeah. God, it's good
to see you, buddy.

375
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:34,130
You, too.
You, too.

376
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:56,219
Look.

377
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,587
We're famous.

378
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,264
You said you'd be ready
by the time they got home.

379
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:11,768
It's just a minor glitch,
give me a few minutes.

380
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:20,076
You painted the house.

381
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,344
Mike's brother did it.

382
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:26,616
He's a contractor.
He gave us a really great rate.

383
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,252
What do you think of the color?

384
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:30,954
I like it.

385
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:32,755
Come on.

386
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,924
I'll show you
what we did inside.

387
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:56,646
How's it feel to be back?

388
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,715
Can we get a group shot
with the yellow ribbon?

389
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,384
What do you think?

390
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,686
Sure.
Sure.

391
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:04,754
Come on, come on.

392
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:11,694
Yeah. If you could just line up
in front of the tree, yeah.

393
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:14,197
Family shot.
That's fantastic.

394
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,639
Big smile.

395
00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:25,608
I'm having trouble collecting
that intel. I need you to get me

396
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,610
into Sergeant Brody's debrief
tomorrow morning.

397
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:30,013
And what good
would come of that?

398
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,448
I'm a trained interrogator.
I'll ask him a few questions,

399
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:33,883
poke around his story a little.

400
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,119
principals only.

401
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:38,121
David's all about punishing me.

402
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:40,456
And not just for what
happened in Baghdad.

403
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,958
- Do you blame him?
- No, but...

404
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:44,127
this shouldn't be personal;
I belong in that room.

405
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:45,328
Will you behave yourself?

406
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,564
Carrie?

407
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,166
Carrie?
Sorry.

408
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,501
Uh, yeah.

409
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:52,769
I need you to promise.

410
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,904
You will raise
no eyebrows in there.

411
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:56,472
You will break no china.

412
00:25:58,509 --> 00:25:59,742
I promise.

413
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:01,644
Good.

414
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,913
Then you can have your face
time with Sergeant Brody.

415
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:06,649
Thank you, Saul.

416
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:08,584
Yep.

417
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:10,520
Oh, Christ.

418
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,391
Well?

419
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,961
Hello, Big Brother.

420
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,210
So when do you want
me back tomorrow?

421
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,045
Carrie.

422
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,147
I need to be in the office
by 9:00, so get here at 8:00.

423
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,349
Okay.

424
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:16,652
Hello?

425
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,722
Hello?

426
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,958
Hello?

427
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,430
Who was that?

428
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:28,898
Oh, Jesus, you scared me.

429
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,569
Nobody. They hung up.

430
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,174
How was your shower?

431
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,913
God, you look beautiful.

432
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:50,053
How about a glass of wine?
I opened a bottle.

433
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,721
Oh, I see what this is now.

434
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,323
Dimming the lights,
plying me with liquor.

435
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:55,925
Is it that obvious?

436
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,261
Kind of.

437
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:01,731
I gotta say, I like you in
that nightgown, though.

438
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,533
My mother wears a nightgown.

439
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:06,636
This is a negligee.

440
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,478
How about that wine,
what do you say?

441
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:20,883
Sure.

442
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,927
The tag is still...

443
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:04,427
Is that okay?

444
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:06,662
Yeah.

445
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:33,556
Jess...

446
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,492
Jess...
Hmm?

447
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,895
Oh, my...

448
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,701
Hey.

449
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:47,203
What they did to you...

450
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:50,473
Hey. Hey...

451
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,909
Baby...
Oh, Jess...

452
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:57,813
Oh, God...
Hey.

453
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:58,848
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,583
No, it's okay.

455
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:01,651
I'm so sorry.

456
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:04,520
Let's sit down here.

457
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,391
It's over.

458
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,026
It's over now, baby.

459
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,561
I'm home.

460
00:30:11,595 --> 00:30:14,297
Okay.
I'm home now, baby.

461
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:17,934
Okay. Oh, baby.

462
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:42,858
Oh, God...

463
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:02,345
It hurts...

464
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,567
What time is it?

465
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:00,136
Quarter after 8:00.

466
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,237
The debrief!
I'm late!

467
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,605
- Shit!
- Want a donut?

468
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,241
Two calls came in;
both hang-ups.

469
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:07,076
Yeah?
One last night, one this morning.

470
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,111
Both times the wife answered;
both times there was no one

471
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:11,013
on the other end of the line.
Did a number pop up on a tracer?

472
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:14,350
No, and the calls were blocked.
Is there any way that...

473
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:15,685
No, not without a subpoena.

474
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:17,420
Look, Virgil,
if somebody's trying

475
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:19,121
to make contact with Brody,
it'll only happen once.

476
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:20,623
And when it does,
we'll be there.

477
00:32:20,657 --> 00:32:22,358
All right?
It's all good. Relax.

478
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:24,327
All right.
I've got to get dressed.

479
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:34,770
<i>Many of the men and women</i>
<i>in this room are involved</i>

480
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:37,373
in the operation which resulted
in your rescue, so we take

481
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:39,241
an extra measure of pride
in welcoming you.

482
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:40,609
Thank you, sir.

483
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:41,911
Now, we've all
read your debrief

484
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,312
from Germany, so
today we just have

485
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:45,548
a few more questions...
clarifications, really...

486
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:47,917
that might help us in our
ongoing fight against Al Qaeda.

487
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,786
- I understand.
- Good.

488
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:53,522
Good. We'll, uh, start
with Stuart Strickland,

489
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,725
lead analyst in
our Iraq section.

490
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,493
Sergeant Brody,
it's a pleasure.

491
00:32:57,527 --> 00:32:59,795
A few weeks after your capture,
Special Forces conducted

492
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,464
a direct action mission against

493
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:02,965
a former police HQ in Garma...

494
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,133
According to your debrief,

495
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,901
most of your incarceration

496
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:09,038
was spent at a secret military
facility outside Damascus.

497
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,906
What landmarks

498
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:13,709
or structural details can you
give us to help pinpoint...?

499
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,211
Eight months you were
smuggled overland

500
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,246
to an enemy operating base in
Afghanistan.

501
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,482
Now, after so many years,
what prompted...?

502
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:21,150
Sergeant Brody, my name
is Carrie Mathison.

503
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:23,085
I served as a case officer
in Iraq.

504
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,187
Your picture was on
our MIA wall.

505
00:33:25,222 --> 00:33:27,990
I saw it every day
for five years.

506
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:29,258
It's good to meet you in person.

507
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,026
Thank you, ma'am.

508
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:32,695
I'm sorry we were unable
to find you sooner.

509
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:34,230
I appreciate that.
I'd like to start

510
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,865
with the first few days
of your captivity

511
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,767
if you don't mind.
Not at all.

512
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:41,103
How soon after you were taken
did the interrogations begin?

513
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:42,438
Pretty much right away.

514
00:33:42,472 --> 00:33:44,340
What did they want to know?

515
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:47,443
Anything I could tell 'em
about U.S. ground operations,

516
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:51,614
supply routes, communication
codes, rules of engagement.

517
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,349
When you were debriefed
in Germany,

518
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:56,051
you said you gave up
no such information.

519
00:33:56,086 --> 00:33:58,320
My SERE training was excellent.

520
00:33:58,355 --> 00:33:59,889
And Corporal Walker?

521
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,690
Ma'am?

522
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,459
Did he give anything up?

523
00:34:03,493 --> 00:34:07,363
We were never interrogated
together, so I don't know.

524
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:10,032
But still you must have
wondered, especially

525
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:11,434
after you learned of his death.

526
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:12,668
I'm assuming

527
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,437
there's a point
to all this, Carrie?

528
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:17,440
There is, sir.
As you know, the first 72 hours

529
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:18,741
after a soldier's capture
are critical.

530
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,143
What he knows can be
used by the enemy

531
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:22,912
during that period to
devastating effect.

532
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:25,314
The point is Sergeant Brody
stopped being a source

533
00:34:25,348 --> 00:34:27,416
of actionable intelligence
fairly quickly,

534
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:30,686
and yet he was kept
alive for eight more years.

535
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,888
I'd like to ask him
if he knows why.

536
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,892
I often wondered that myself.

537
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:42,097
Who was your interrogator?

538
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:43,232
An Al Qaeda commander.

539
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,668
His name was Zayadi.

540
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,770
Zayadi?

541
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:50,172
That's what he told me
his name was, anyway.

542
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:53,108
Was this him?

543
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:01,150
No.

544
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:03,118
But you know who this man is.

545
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:04,520
Of course.

546
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:06,155
Every Marine in country
was briefed

547
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,990
on high-value targets.

548
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:09,925
Did you ever meet him?
Abu Nazir?

549
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,027
Was he ever present during
any of your interrogations?

550
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:13,162
No.

551
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:19,134
Look again.

552
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,698
<i>Sergeant Brody?</i>

553
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,104
No, I never met him.

554
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,209
What-what... what about Walker?

555
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:01,744
Did he ever mention Abu Nazir?

556
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:02,845
No.

557
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:05,381
You sure?
Carrie, how many times

558
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,583
does the man have
to answer the question?

559
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:10,653
It's just, I'm just
a little surprised, sir.

560
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:12,655
Abu Nazir was in charge
of coordinating attacks

561
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:13,923
against coalition forces
at the time.

562
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,658
No one had more

563
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:17,760
reason to sit down with the only
two American P.O.W.'s

564
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:19,094
in his custody.

565
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:22,364
Well, apparently, he didn't.

566
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:26,936
Is there anything else, Carrie?

567
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,905
No, sir, that's it.

568
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,040
Thank you, Sergeant Brody.

569
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:32,241
Thank you.

570
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,609
Moving on, Sergeant Brody,

571
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,344
I'd like to turn your attention

572
00:36:35,378 --> 00:36:37,046
to anything you may have
witnessed

573
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,213
or overheard when in captivity.

574
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:40,282
Remember Mrs. Base?

575
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:42,818
The math teacher?
Yeah.

576
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,887
Yeah, she was, like, my
least-favorite teacher of all time.

577
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:46,322
She's so annoying.

578
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:48,223
Hey, can you guys
come in here a second?

579
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:50,059
Hey, I need help
getting ready for tonight.

580
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,193
What's tonight?

581
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:52,828
Some of your father's buddies

582
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,763
from Bravo Company are coming
over for a barbecue.

583
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:57,066
There's a bag of corn
that needs to be shucked,

584
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,567
and the grill needs
to be cleaned.

585
00:36:58,602 --> 00:37:01,403
I'll do the corn.

586
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:03,305
So, do I have to be here?

587
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,475
Why is everything always
a problem with you?

588
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:08,477
I was just asking a question.

589
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:10,913
I know things haven't
been easy between you and me.

590
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:12,548
But we all have to find a way

591
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:14,149
to be there
for each other now, okay?

592
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:16,885
Yeah, okay.

593
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,287
Clean the grill.

594
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,825
Hello?

595
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,226
Hey, Jess.

596
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,594
Hey. How did it go?

597
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:27,630
I'm actually still here
at Langley.

598
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,164
I'm stuck in this debrief,

599
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,566
and it's taking a little
longer than I expected.

600
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,967
How much longer?

601
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,370
Oh, only an hour or two maybe.

602
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:37,039
Well, don't forget,
everybody's coming at 5:00.

603
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:38,207
Sure. I won't be late.

604
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,776
Okay. Bye, honey.

605
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,683
Sergeant Brody
you're a man who's endured

606
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:49,518
a terrible ordeal.

607
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:50,986
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

608
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,556
Anything?

609
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:57,326
As a matter of fact, yeah.
Brody just lied to his wife.

610
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,594
- Tell me.
- Max is tailing his town car.

611
00:37:58,628 --> 00:38:00,496
Brody just said
he was still at Langley,

612
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,498
but he told his driver to
drop him off at Bluemont Park.

613
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:04,833
This is it.
He's making contact.

614
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,235
All right, I'll meet you there.

615
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:08,070
Where's-Where's Bluemont Park?

616
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:12,941
Saul?

617
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:15,511
Hey. Late for a
meeting off campus.

618
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:18,847
How many boards
can one man sit on?

619
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:22,084
You kissed Carrie Mathison
into my debrief this morning.

620
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:24,720
I'm curious if that was
her request or yours.

621
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:28,624
Hers. Frankly, I'm surprised
you didn't assign her yourself,

622
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:31,393
since she's the only one in the
section who's ever been to Iraq.

623
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:33,228
It's not her resume
I have a problem with.

624
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:34,697
It's her temperament.

625
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,432
What happened?

626
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:39,501
She turned a routine follow-up
into a cross-examination.

627
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:43,005
Kept trying to connect
Brody to Abu Nazir.

628
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,039
It's always Nazir with her.

629
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,674
I won't deny

630
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:47,576
she can be a little obsessive
on the subject.

631
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,145
Is there something
I should know, Saul?

632
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,047
Not that I'm aware of.
Because the last time

633
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:53,749
I heard her like this,
she bribed her way

634
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:56,218
into an Iraqi prison,
caused an international crisis.

635
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,786
I appreciate your concern.

636
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,055
Carrie has learned her lesson.

637
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,957
And we both know
how good she is.

638
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,625
What did I tell you
when I agreed

639
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,227
to give her one more chance?

640
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,831
You said only if I agreed
to do the babysitting.

641
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:10,499
I said it would end badly.

642
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:11,967
For both of you.

643
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:17,806
You've got a big blind spot
where she's concerned.

644
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,842
Trust me.
I did, too.

645
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:21,543
Now my wife lives in Palm Beach,

646
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:23,746
and I only see my kids
twice a year.

647
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,155
Did you fix the audio?

648
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:07,523
Well, we'll know soon enough.

649
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:08,991
I set up a directional mic

650
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:11,794
near the band shell.
Max, switch

651
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:12,928
to channel three.

652
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:14,429
Somebody's approaching Brody

653
00:40:14,464 --> 00:40:16,932
from 1:00...
a female, dark red coat.

654
00:40:29,712 --> 00:40:31,613
I didn't think
you'd be able to make it.

655
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:34,283
I don't understand why
you had to go through Mike.

656
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:36,151
Why didn't you just
call me yourself?

657
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,587
I did. Twice.

658
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:39,788
Are you recording this?

659
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:41,423
But your wife answered.

660
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,158
She didn't give me
any messages.

661
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,660
Because I hung up.

662
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:46,628
She hates me, Brody.

663
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:48,063
Hates you? Why?

664
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:50,232
Because I got remarried.

665
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:52,334
Jessica reacted like
it was a personal insult.

666
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,803
Like I was publicly
giving up hope that you

667
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:56,071
and Tom were still alive.

668
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:58,307
What the...?
Who the hell is she?

669
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:01,009
Helen Walker. It's the wife
of the other missing Marine.

670
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,212
Ah, well, then,
she's not Brody's contact.

671
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:06,014
Just keep listening.

672
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,685
The Pentagon said
you both were dead.

673
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,753
And now they're refusing
to give me any information

674
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:13,222
about what happened to Tom.

675
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:15,724
What do you want to know?

676
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:17,659
How he died.

677
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:19,194
He's gone.

678
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,430
Does it really matter
how it happened?

679
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:24,199
It does to me.

680
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:29,538
He was beaten to death.

681
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:34,776
Were you there?

682
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,189
No.

683
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:51,493
Thank you for telling me.

684
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,597
I'm going home.

685
00:41:55,632 --> 00:41:57,099
Want to be there
in time for this barbecue.

686
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:58,367
Hold on a second.

687
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:01,436
Max, will you give us a minute?

688
00:42:03,006 --> 00:42:05,407
Max, step out of the van.

689
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:14,783
I didn't think that this was
any of my business.

690
00:42:14,817 --> 00:42:16,418
Now I'm thinking that it is.

691
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:19,621
Clozapine?

692
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:24,760
I'm sorry.

693
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,162
Was I supposed to say something?

694
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:28,797
Just tell me I'm not out here

695
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:30,399
risking federal prison
on behalf of a crazy person.

696
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,768
I am crazy.
It's not funny.

697
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:35,370
If anybody at the Agency
finds out about this...

698
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,440
I've got a mood disorder, okay?

699
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:39,875
I looked it up, Carrie.

700
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:41,610
Clozapine's an anti-psychotic.

701
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,278
I'm dealing with it.

702
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:45,580
I've-I've been dealing with it
since I was 22.

703
00:42:45,615 --> 00:42:48,116
- Does Saul know?
- God, no.

704
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:53,188
No. Nobody does.

705
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,990
Don't act so shocked.

706
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:58,360
I mean, it can't come
as a complete surprise.

707
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:01,430
You know I love you, Carrie,
but I got to be honest.

708
00:43:01,464 --> 00:43:03,532
None of this is making me feel
any better.

709
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,100
What are you saying?

710
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:08,837
That I'm making this shit up?

711
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:11,340
Well, maybe I am; you know,
maybe it is all in my head,

712
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:13,542
but you're in it now, Virgil,
up to your fucking neck,

713
00:43:13,576 --> 00:43:15,110
and so is your weird
little brother,

714
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:17,512
so don't even think
about bailing on me.

715
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:38,700
You think for one minute
you get away with this?

716
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:43,105
I thought that once
I had some proof...

717
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:44,639
Do you have any?

718
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,311
Anything?

719
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:52,714
Even suggesting that Sergeant
Brody's what you think he is?

720
00:43:56,953 --> 00:43:58,487
No.

721
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,255
Then get a lawyer.

00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:16,464
You're in charge now.
Wow.

813
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:18,366
Okay, I like it.

814
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:40,388
Are you coming?

815
00:50:40,423 --> 00:50:41,689
Hey, Carrie, are you okay?

816
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:44,192
♪ ♪

817
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,186
What am I looking at here?
His right hand.

818
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:18,092
He's just nervous.

819
00:51:18,127 --> 00:51:19,461
No. No. Look again.

820
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:20,962
It's a pattern that repeats,

821
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,297
like a musical phrase.

822
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,066
There.

823
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:32,106
That's hardly definitive.
No.

824
00:51:32,141 --> 00:51:34,642
Just... wait.

825
00:51:37,413 --> 00:51:39,080
This is him outside his house.

826
00:51:39,114 --> 00:51:41,483
And here he is at
Andrews Air Force Base.

827
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:44,619
Okay,
do you... do you see?

828
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:46,287
It happens

829
00:51:46,322 --> 00:51:48,623
whenever he's on camera,
whenever he knows the world

830
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:51,459
is watching... it's the same
sequence over and over again.

831
00:51:54,096 --> 00:51:55,630
A code of some kind.

832
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:57,699
He's making contact, Saul.

833
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:00,068
He's sending a message
to somebody... a handler,

834
00:52:00,102 --> 00:52:02,737
a sleeper cell, somebody.

835
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,680
We should explore this further.

836
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:14,148
Let's get the
crypto guys on it.

837
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:15,717
Pittman's team is
the best... plus,

838
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:17,185
he knows how to be discreet.

839
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:19,554
I'll get his number.

840
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:25,894
So am I still going to jail?

841
00:52:25,928 --> 00:52:28,196
Not just yet.

842
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:47,949
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

843
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:49,517
<i>How he died.</i>

844
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:51,953
<i>Were you there?</i>

845
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:53,087
<i>No.</i>

846
00:52:56,392 --> 00:52:58,459
- <i>Did you ever meet him?</i>
- <i>Abu Nazir?</i>

847
00:52:58,494 --> 00:53:00,895
<i>Was he ever present during</i>
<i>any of your interrogations?</i>

848
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:03,398
Again.

849
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:04,866
<i>No, I never met him.</i>

850
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,867
Harder.

851
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:20,214
Shh. Shh.

852
00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:56,151
