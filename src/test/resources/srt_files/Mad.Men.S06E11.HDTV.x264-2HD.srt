<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:05,672
I assumed that we were
forgetting about that.

3
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:07,488
Well, I haven't.

4
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:08,964
His name is Manolo Colón.

5
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,488
He's an army trained
registered nurse.

6
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:14,374
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise, Mother will refuse.

7
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:16,162
You know, we're losing the war.

8
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,210
Wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

9
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:20,096
Yeah, it's something, right?

10
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:23,609
I am going to continue on Chevy
evaluating other people's work.

11
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,502
That's all I can do right now.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,664
Call me around 1970 when
they're ready to make an ad.

Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Mr. Sterling's inside.

- Do you want ice?
- Coffee.

19
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:36,199
It's one thing to be near the bar,
it's another thing to be under it.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,944
Sunkist sent us a crate.

21
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,013
I've seen blind people juggle, but
somehow it seems to be beyond me.

22
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,105
Why don't you
just close your eyes?

23
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,576
That's what you did
in the meeting.

24
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,143
Whatever I did, it worked.

25
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:47,809
- We're in it.
- That's good news.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,244
Step one,
I send it to research.

27
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:52,447
Step two, you'll need to get that
little idea factory working.

28
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,249
There's only one angle.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,384
An orange--
that's orange on TV.

30
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,064
I thought they were pretty clear
they're too cheap to get out of print.

31
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:01,888
So talk 'em out of it,
or into it.

32
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,958
I'd love to, but I think it
demands a media strategy.

33
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,229
Forget research.
Put Harry Crane on it.

34
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,332
- Look at you.
- See?

35
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,500
Not all surprises are bad.

36
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,416
( chuckles ) The ants,
they look like peoples.

37
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,453
He should be right out. Is
there anything I can get you?

38
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,181
I think she would
like a cup of tea.

39
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,949
- In a teacup.
- Peter: <i>I'd be more excited</i>

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,918
if we didn't have to go
in Ted's plane to present.

41
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,800
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Peter.

42
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:39,236
Manolo, may I speak
with you a moment?

43
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,893
Of course, Mr. Campbell.
Your tea is coming.

44
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,328
I'll be fine.
I'm not a child.

45
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,366
Peggy, would you mind?

46
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,671
Mrs. Campbell,
nice to meet you.

47
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,544
There's no reason for you
to be so formal, dear.

48
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,109
Sit with me.

49
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,216
How are you today?

50
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,150
I can't tell you
how much it relieves me

51
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,452
to see you and Peter reunited.

52
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,422
Well, it was really
a by-product of the merger.

53
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,558
I'm glad you both
swallowed your pride.

54
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,768
If nothing else
but for the good

55
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,036
of the child you have together.

56
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:22,973
Excuse me?

57
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:26,502
Oh, I've embarrassed you.

58
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:29,280
Your son and I are not
together that way.

59
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,207
Trudy, dear, don't deny him.

60
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,475
Don't reject his caresses.

61
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:35,710
Mrs. Campbell--

62
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,379
I hope you two can someday find

63
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,120
what Manolo and I have found.

64
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,591
I waited long enough

65
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,761
to experience the physical
satisfactions of love.

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,568
Did she go
to China for that tea?

67
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,505
Thank you for driving
her out to Bud's.

68
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,536
I've paid you
for the extra day.

69
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,416
- I know you don't drive.
- Well, I do,

70
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,806
but not to her satisfaction.

71
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:10,816
Bob Benson was right about you.
You're worth every penny.

72
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,845
Bob is a wonderful salesman.

73
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,648
Still, I want you to have a
little something off the books.

74
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,516
Mr. Campbell,
I refuse.

75
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:19,785
It's important to me
that you treat my mother well,

76
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,886
but also
that you treat yourself.

77
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,189
- The pleasure is all mine.
- I know that isn't true.

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,343
Sally, get in here.

79
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,134
- <i>( door opens )</i>
<i>- Henry: Hello.</i>

80
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,704
- What?
- Julie's mother called and told me

81
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:43,073
- you were the only two girls on the trip.
- So?

82
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,952
You're not staying in a Midtown
hotel with all those boys.

83
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,878
Miss O'Shea is gonna be there.

84
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,280
She's 25.

85
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,424
What's the point
of having a mansion

86
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,383
if you're gonna spend
all your time in here?

87
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:55,685
Fine, I won't do the Model UN.

88
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,336
- It was his idea.
- Fine, you're not going.

89
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,739
- Can't we stay with Daddy?
- You mean with no one.

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,275
You hate that Daddy
supports my dreams.

91
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:07,178
He doesn't think I'm
just a pain in the ass.

92
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,547
Your father is a hero.

93
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,533
( sighs ) Like everything
else in this country,

94
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:14,850
Diplomacy Club's just
another excuse to make out.

95
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,971
I thought she should join
the Student Congress.

96
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,784
The UN's a joke.

97
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:26,048
- Oh, you're home.
- Who's this?

98
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:28,716
This is Mitchell,
Sylvia and Arnold's son.

99
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,321
Nice to finally meet you, Mitchell.
I'm Don.

100
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,559
Thanks again, Megan.

101
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,935
What did he want?

102
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,370
( sighs ) Um...

103
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm sworn to secrecy, but
he's in a lot of trouble.

104
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,651
- What happened?
- He's 1-A.

105
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,580
But he's in school.

106
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,464
He sent back his draft card

107
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,767
in protest.
They reclassified him.

108
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,335
What did he think
was gonna happen?

109
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,455
Stupid kid.

110
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,790
Don, he knows he screwed up.

111
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,125
He wants to run.

112
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:16,161
You know, to Canada.

113
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,763
I suppose I could
call my brother-in-law,

114
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,808
but I can't do that
to Sylvia and Arnold.

115
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,068
- Can I?
- Just leave it alone.

116
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,471
- He's so scared.
- He should be.

117
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:32,844
He can't spend the rest
of his life on the run.

118
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,394
I know how you feel,

119
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,482
but you don't want him
to go to Vietnam.

120
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,617
Megan, it's not our problem.

121
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,889
- <i>( plane engines whirring )</i>
<i>- ( laughing )</i>

122
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,691
Could you get me
another whiskey sour?

123
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,660
- Sure.
- Maybe I'll switch to whiskey sours.

124
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,061
How about
a Shirley Temple, then?

125
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,136
I don't think Dramamine
and booze go together.

126
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,472
I don't think Dramamine and cranberry
juice go together, either.

127
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:58,940
But I thought we'd be back
on your little plane,

128
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,970
not having a romantic dinner.

129
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,848
Don't you want to celebrate?

130
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,072
I want to live, Ted.

131
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,674
( laughs ) What?

132
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,777
He doesn't like flying.

133
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,378
Well, you've seen
how simple it is now.

134
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,752
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

135
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:14,422
My father died
in a plane... crash.

136
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:17,519
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,200
Was he a pilot?

138
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,869
Ha! No.

139
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,724
Passenger.

140
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,064
Look, you're driving.

141
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,827
Can we please, please
have another round?

142
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,864
You still have to get home
from White Plains.

143
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,997
I'll hail a cab.

144
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,700
( laughs )
He's such a New Yorker.

145
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,976
( sighs )

146
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,339
This is the agency
I always wanted.

147
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,608
Ambition, brains, and beauty.

148
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:43,744
Yeah, but what about him?

149
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:46,212
I'm gonna cut you
off too, my dear.

150
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,120
I should call home.

151
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,421
If the check comes, I'm
sending it to Ocean Spray.

152
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:01,994
Can you imagine what
it does to his wife

153
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,296
every time he takes that plane?

154
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,397
I guess so.

155
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,408
You don't want me
to talk about his wife.

156
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:10,843
You don't know
what you're talking about.

157
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:12,704
But I do.

158
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,206
I've seen that look.

159
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,547
I know, but...

160
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:20,879
( sighs )

161
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,688
nothing can happen.

162
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,882
And he's in love with you, too.

163
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:28,285
You're the one
who's in love with him.

164
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,788
Well, I could use an account
and he's been generous.

165
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:38,230
At least one of us
ended up important.

166
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,201
Please tell me
you don't pity me.

167
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,604
I don't.

168
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,073
Because you really know me.

169
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,345
I do.

170
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:03,652
Ahem--
I should tell you...

171
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:07,489
I had a very strange
conversation with your mother.

172
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,724
There's no other kind.

173
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,559
( chuckles )

174
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,060
Well, it doesn't matter.

175
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,968
What did she say?

176
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,839
I think she thought
I was your wife

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,005
and Manuel was her husband.

178
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,272
( laughs ) My father never
treated her that well.

179
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:29,856
Maybe that's it. She thinks
she's in love with him.

180
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:32,191
I can see it.
Manolo is very charming.

181
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,593
I don't think you understand.

182
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,996
She thinks she's...

183
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:40,253
making love with him.

184
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,888
Tell me exactly what she said.

185
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,336
Did your father ever
give her spa treatments

186
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,606
that released
a "fire in her loins"?

187
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,396
Oh!

188
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,465
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

189
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:57,769
( laughing ) I'm sorry.

190
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,203
I shouldn't have told you.

191
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,312
But I can't get the image
out of my head.

192
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:02,714
Stop it, please.

193
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,150
I don't even want to think
about her brushing her teeth.

194
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,285
- <i>( laughing )</i>
<i>- I thought I cut you two off.</i>

195
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,847
Ted.

196
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:14,432
I have never been less
afraid of flying in my life.

197
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,854
What?
What does he mean?

198
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:20,290
Nothing.

199
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,725
Well, I should get the check.

200
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,194
- ( TV playing )
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>

201
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:37,897
Honey, who's that gonna be?

202
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:45,772
- Arnold.
- Is it too late?

203
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,508
For what?
Come in.

204
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,144
Look, I would have
called, but Sylvia is...

205
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,882
Listen, about
this afternoon--

206
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:59,584
Oh, hello, Arnold.

207
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,287
I'm sorry about my kid
dropping in on you.

208
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,855
( sighs )

209
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:06,324
I didn't know
if I should tell you.

210
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:07,792
Well, he figured you would

211
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,494
and I don't want you
in the middle of this.

212
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,663
His mother's treating it
like he's dying.

213
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,665
She doesn't want
anyone to know.

214
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:17,635
Do you want a drink?

215
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:21,306
Sit up here drinking while they're
down there slamming the doors?

216
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,040
( sighs )

217
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,075
Been meaning to knock
on your door anyway.

218
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,211
You know, catch a game
or something.

219
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:31,648
I get baseball tickets.
Mostly the Mets.

220
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,883
- Well, then I'm glad you didn't.
- ( laughs )

221
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,856
You know, I didn't
even know he left school.

222
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,693
Sylvia says
she didn't know either.

223
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,929
She's doing that
a lot lately--

224
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,265
lying about little things.

225
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,668
Could tell something's
been wrong all year.

226
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,072
- Another Manhattan?
- Nah. No.

227
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:01,309
Should have never
let him go to Paris.

228
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,911
He got there right in
the middle of the riots.

229
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,814
His French is excellent.

230
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,451
I think he got a lot of girls

231
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:12,285
as an expatriate revolutionary.

232
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:14,287
Could kill him right now.

233
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:16,923
There has to be a way.

234
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:19,226
Oh, believe me,
everybody's an expert on it.

235
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,662
Sylvia's father was
suddenly Clarence Darrow.

236
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:25,632
It's thrilling to see a plumber
interpret international law.

237
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,167
You're one of the top
surgeons in the country.

238
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:31,303
You must know somebody.

239
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:33,205
I know a lot of people,
but it doesn't matter.

240
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,008
It doesn't matter
if he goes back to school.

241
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:39,044
He's 1-A. His induction
could be tomorrow.

242
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:41,280
He's on a damn list
for the rest of his life.

243
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,519
On some level you have
to admire his idealism.

244
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,987
You sound like Sylvia.

245
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,890
But she doesn't really
buy his bullshit.

246
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,191
You think she's gonna
let her baby

247
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,394
rot in jail for a cause?

248
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,029
( sighs )

249
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,930
I don't know what to do.

250
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,367
What would you do?

251
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,536
If it was my kid,
or if it was me?

252
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,304
You were in the service, right?

253
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:08,506
I was.

254
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,408
You see action?

255
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,414
It was very different.

256
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:20,316
I wanted to go.

257
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,819
And then when
I got there, well...

258
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,921
That's the trick.

259
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:27,457
Kids 18, 19 years old, they have
no sense of their own mortality.

260
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,358
Or anyone else's.

261
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,093
That's why they make
good soldiers.

262
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:33,695
Well, the Army
paid for med school.

263
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:37,032
I served in a hospital
in Pusan.

264
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,367
We were very lucky.

265
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,836
Lucky enough to live
in this country.

266
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,639
And service is part
of that bargain.

267
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,841
Sacrifice.

268
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,476
( sighs ) We knew that.

269
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,711
The war is wrong.

270
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,915
I'll tell you right now, if
anyone was ever gonna get it,

271
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,883
it's gonna be him.

272
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,453
He's soft.

273
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,521
I'm sure he's a good kid.

274
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,591
The best.

275
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,093
( sighs )

276
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:13,633
<i>( TV playing )</i>

277
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,438
What you watching?

278
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,573
I don't know.

279
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:25,578
What's the matter?
I called.

280
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,846
<i>( TV off )</i>

281
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,413
I didn't want to get into it
when you're about to fly,

282
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,148
but you were supposed
to have dinner with us.

283
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,217
I made a mistake.
We'll do it tomorrow.

284
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,252
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

285
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,753
Why don't you get a legal pad

286
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:38,022
and write down a bunch of
excuses for the next week?

287
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,891
Because none of them
mean anything to the boys.

288
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:43,695
What about food, clothing, and shelter?
Does that mean anything?

289
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,997
Remember what the minister
said at Frank's funeral?

290
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,666
"God can turn off
the lights at any moment."

291
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,768
You know where you're gonna be?
The office.

292
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,136
This is temporary.

293
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,539
I just have
to do this until--

294
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,907
Until what?

295
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,810
Until you are back

296
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,512
where you were at the old firm?

297
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:03,814
Because things weren't
so great then either.

298
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:06,884
So we've moved on

299
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,684
from I'm working too much
to something else.

300
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:11,086
The problem is even
when you do come home,

301
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,523
you're not here.
You're obsessed.

302
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:16,959
And I can feel how
disappointing this all is

303
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,394
compared to
your battles at work.

304
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,896
I'm not enjoying that.

305
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,097
How did we get to
the point where you think

306
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:25,066
I don't want you
to enjoy things?

307
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:28,637
I know you like having a young
copywriter in your airplane.

308
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:30,739
Come on, Pete was there, too.

309
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,941
I know you like
facing Don Draper

310
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,109
every morning
more than the clients.

311
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:38,547
( sighs )

312
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:43,250
How was your day?

313
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,520
I just wish you liked
being here more.

314
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,961
Could you get
Mr. Campbell?

315
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:56,696
Do you want to see him
before the status meeting?

316
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:59,132
- Ugh, when's that?
- Now.

317
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,201
And I also need to know if you're
attending the Chevrolet dinner.

318
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:04,103
- When's that?
- Tonight.

319
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,505
- Morning.
- May I speak with you?

320
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,682
Does your friend still work
at the Department of Defense?

321
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:18,516
No, he left for Union Carbide.

322
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,751
But he probably still
has pull over there.

323
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,954
What happened now?

324
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,726
You must know plenty of people
with kids getting deferments.

325
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,061
How are they doing that?

326
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,596
They go to college.

327
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,431
Divinity school.
Medical baloney.

328
00:16:33,432 --> 00:16:36,166
No, it's too late for that. I need
someone who can really pull strings.

329
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,035
Well, aren't you having
dinner with General Motors,

330
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:41,072
one of the largest defense
contractors in the world?

331
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,873
What are the politics of that?

332
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:45,275
I don't know, Don.
I'm not on Chevy.

333
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:48,212
<i>Shall we?</i>

334
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,147
That's not my fault.

335
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,683
Don't worry.
If I had Chevy

336
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,920
I wouldn't be able to devote my
full attention to Ocean Spray.

337
00:16:56,921 --> 00:17:00,123
- Don: Cranberries?
- Cranberry cocktail.

338
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,358
And they like us so much they
might even give us the blends.

339
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,761
- What about Sunkist?
- What about it?

340
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,562
It's orange juice.

341
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,831
Morning, everyone.

342
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,233
- Did you know about Sunkist?
- What about it?

343
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:13,669
Don told Harry to put together
a media plan right away.

344
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,604
Why didn't you
tell us about that?

345
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:18,140
Isn't this the meeting
where I tell you?

346
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:19,775
Are we having this meeting?

347
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,610
Why didn't you tell us you were
presenting to Ocean Spray?

348
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,077
There's been a series of memos.

349
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,079
Didn't you wonder
where everybody was?

350
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,282
- We can't present to both.
- Which one is bigger?

351
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,752
They're about the same.
Three million.

352
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:33,220
We've already spent
$5,000 on Ocean Spray.

353
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,789
What about our trip
to California?

354
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,590
Was it $5,000?

355
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,359
I have a lot of receipts.
I haven't figured it out yet.

356
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,929
Why don't you join this company
and read a memo once in a while?

357
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,770
( huffs )

358
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,038
Maybe they're not a conflict.

359
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,306
We don't have either yet.

360
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,441
I really didn't know.

361
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:04,517
I warned you
about the memos, Ted.

362
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,053
The more you send,
the less they get read.

363
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:10,823
Imagine if every time Ginger
Rogers jumped in the air,

364
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,992
Fred Astaire punched her
in the face.

365
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,027
Why are you taking
this to heart?

366
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,431
Because it's directed at me.
Can you not see that?

367
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,501
So what? You know we'll end
up with just one juice.

368
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,571
I don't want his juice.
I want my juice.

369
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,639
It's all your juice.

370
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,507
Tell <i>him</i> that.

371
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,781
<i>( door opens )</i>

372
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,282
Michigan's in the Big 10.

373
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,819
Ron Kutchinski just ran the
fastest half mile in the world.

374
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,653
He's going to the Olympics.

375
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,254
You're selling yourself short.

376
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,223
I'm telling you, they would
be lucky to have you.

377
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,925
I got it.

378
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,532
Look at this. Got a couple
of high fashion models.

379
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,234
Aren't you a gentleman?

380
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,536
- Hey.
- Hello.

381
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,237
Youse two don't know
each other.

382
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:02,839
These are my two
favorite people.

383
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,941
Mitchell Rosen, 16A,
I'd like you to meet

384
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:09,645
Sally Draper, 17B
and all points north.

385
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:13,382
I'm Julie.
I'm crashing at Sally's.

386
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:15,084
Cool.

387
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:18,120
They were supposed to leave a key for me.
I lost mine.

388
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,956
Nobody said nothing to me,
but that don't mean nothing.

389
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:23,225
We were going to go out
for dinner tonight.

390
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,560
- What's good around here?
- His mother's cooking.

391
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,664
Around here
it's just old people.

392
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,266
Are you a musician?

393
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,367
'Cause you look like one.

394
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,402
Who?

395
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,572
I don't see it.
I'll let you in.

396
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,074
Oh, good day to you,
Mrs. Rosen.

397
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,909
Hello. Mitchell,
did you get a cab?

398
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,411
- I was waiting for you.
- You're unbelievable.

399
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,580
I got it, Mrs. Rosen.
Do you know Sally and...?

400
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:49,783
- I'm Julie. - I'm sorry, girls,
we're in a bit of a rush.

401
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:52,118
I'll get you a cab
lickety-split.

402
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,287
Bring them right back.

403
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,160
You're living
with Mark Lindsay.

404
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,470
I don't live here.

405
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,419
What are you doing here?

406
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,288
I said I'd meet you
at La Grenouille.

407
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:12,258
Dorothy, you must let me
manage your calendar.

408
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,092
I'm not standing
in the hallway.

409
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:15,861
Come in.

410
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,566
You get ready, Mr. Campbell.
I'll entertain her.

411
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:26,404
Actually, Manolo, I'd like my
mother to myself this evening.

412
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,474
Very well.
Good night, my sweet.

413
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,011
Must he?

414
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,247
He has other plans, Mother.

415
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:39,816
Yes, Dorothy. I'll be
there when you wake.

416
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,127
- Can I fix you something?
- No.

417
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,362
Manolo doesn't
like me to drink.

418
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:54,997
He likes me sharp.

419
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:01,236
It's so nice the way
he looks after you.

420
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:04,740
Oh, Peter, he's a gift to me.

421
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,809
I just wanted to make
sure you're aware

422
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,344
he's your nurse.

423
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:11,112
You are prone to moments
of confusion.

424
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:14,248
I suppose there's a way
I could mistake

425
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:17,218
your tone for concern.

426
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,987
I am concerned
that you have--

427
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,157
how do I put this?

428
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,327
--misconstrued Manolo's
attention for affection.

429
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,130
If we're going to have
an adult conversation,

430
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,699
let's have
an adult conversation.

431
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,533
Has he taken advantage of you?

432
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,735
Manny has awakened a part of me

433
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,571
that was long dormant.

434
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:42,542
Don't you think I'm entitled
to the pleasures of love?

435
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:44,044
Do not be more specific.

436
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:46,713
Since when is it
any of your business

437
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,314
what goes on in my bedroom?

438
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:50,816
I am afraid that we are going
to have to let him go.

439
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:53,618
Oh, no.
What did he do?

440
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,654
He's a pervert.

441
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,592
You were a sour little boy.

442
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,528
And you're a sour little man.

443
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,832
How could I expect you
to be understanding?

444
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,601
You've always been unlovable.

445
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,805
Now I've lost my appetite.

446
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm leaving.

447
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,875
You'll never find
your way home.

448
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,043
I have carfare

449
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:21,479
and a piece of paper
with my address

450
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,715
written in his
elegant handwriting.

451
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,753
Mother.

452
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:38,595
- <i>( door closes )</i>
<i>- ( men laughing )</i>

453
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:40,263
Cheesecake?
Chocolate cake?

454
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:42,432
- Two of everything.
- And another round.

455
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,635
- Why not?
- Oh, I can never get enough of it.

456
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:47,970
Growing up in Cleveland, my dad
would take me right on Lake Erie.

457
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:49,839
But, eh, water's gone bad now.

458
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,173
You should go to Florida.

459
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:53,341
Saltwater.
Down off the Keys

460
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,677
- where the marlin run.
- Write your own Hemmingway story.

461
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,479
And if you don't catch anything,
you have to blow your brains out.

462
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,248
( laughing )

463
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,785
So, Ross, where do you
take your kid fishing?

464
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:05,921
I just got the two girls, and they
could never keep their mouths shut.

465
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,423
But my grandson's just like me.

466
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:10,024
Last summer we went
up to Muskoka.

467
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,559
Ontario.

468
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,359
Jesus, now we got to hear
about this kid again.

469
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,895
( men laugh )

470
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,530
Brendan's at Antioch.

471
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,665
Yup, studying the classics.

472
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,201
But I hope he'll come
to his senses.

473
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,003
( laughs )

474
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:25,539
He's got a couple of years
before he has decisions to make.

475
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,608
Well, as long as we're working
together, he's got a job with us.

476
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,410
( laughing )

477
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,947
Friend of mine's kid
just got to that point.

478
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:36,683
He doesn't have a lot of choices left.
1-A. Can you imagine?

479
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,855
Well, my heart goes out to him.

480
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,289
That's just one of those
problems that can't be solved.

481
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,860
I've got two sons.

482
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,361
Thank God they're too young.

483
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,931
I don't even like
to think about that.

484
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,365
I know.

485
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,034
My friend is just
beside himself.

486
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,505
I mean, people are
doing things, though.

487
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,607
Believe me, we know about that.

488
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,476
Makes me sick.

489
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,585
Well, next year this time,
we'll have won the war.

490
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,820
We'll take Brendan to
dinner, get him plastered,

491
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,522
and have him read
the menu in Latin.

492
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,893
Ted, are you an angler?

493
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,161
My hobby is coming up
with names for the XP.

494
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,163
( all laugh )

495
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:37,134
_

496
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,008
Last one.

497
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,417
Okay.

498
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:51,753
"Things I like
about Mitchell."

499
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,692
"His ass"?

500
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,895
- Shh.
- When did you see that?

501
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:02,262
I couldn't think
of anything else.

502
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:04,331
What did you put?

503
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,502
"How he smiled at me."

504
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:10,337
"His shoulders."

505
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,541
"His red shirt."

506
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,443
- ( giggles )
- ( knock on door )

507
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:18,578
You girls have
a big day tomorrow

508
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:21,714
and I can tell you right now, the next
time this door opens, it won't be me.

509
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:25,084
- Lights out.
- Good night, Mrs. Draper.

510
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:30,256
Why do you keep
calling her that?

511
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,758
'Cause she hates it.

512
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,259
Think about it.

513
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,895
He's right down there.

514
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,199
You should sneak down
and kiss him.

515
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,368
He talked to you.

516
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:48,239
God, I wish I lived here.

517
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,179
<i>( tires squealing )</i>

518
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,786
<i>( faint pattering )</i>

519
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:08,959
<i>( rattling )</i>

520
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,661
<i>( squeaking )</i>

521
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:16,499
( ringing )

522
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,737
- Yeah?
- Did I wake you?

523
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,673
- Yeah.
- There's a rat in my apartment.

524
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,910
Told you to get traps.

525
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:30,079
It's in the trap
and it's mortally wounded.

526
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,114
I'm pretty sure
'cause there's a lot of blood.

527
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:33,682
Did you call an ambulance?

528
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:36,051
You have to come over.
It went under the couch.

529
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,019
I can't even look.
What if it's still alive?

530
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,955
What if I lift the couch
and it starts flipping around?

531
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:44,058
I'm not your boyfriend.

532
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:48,630
Maybe I'll make it worth
your while if you come over.

533
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:51,432
No, you won't.
Now good night.

534
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,133
You're not interested?

535
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:54,868
No.

536
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,737
Then why are you using
your sexy voice?

537
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:58,204
( chuckles )

538
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,107
Tuesday morning's great.

539
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:01,541
For what?

540
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,977
Oh.

541
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:05,345
Why didn't you say so?

542
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:08,048
You can bring her.

543
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,349
It'll be dead by morning.

544
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:23,353
Eleanor Roosevelt.

545
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:26,289
I can't remember anything
'cause I didn't sleep.

546
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,124
Your floor smells like pee.

547
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,760
- No, it doesn't.
- Do I smell like pee?

548
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,294
You smell like Prell.

549
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,863
Sally, you're not ready?

550
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,564
I let the guest shower first.

551
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:37,533
Well, I have to go to work.

552
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:39,669
But first I have to put you
two in a cab, so shake a leg.

553
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,537
Oh, take out the trash.

554
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:43,438
I have to get ready.

555
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,507
I'll do it, Mrs. Draper.

556
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,242
It's Megan.

557
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:50,812
I would love to visit
the studio sometime.

558
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,048
Well, hopefully
I'll still have a job.

559
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:54,983
I have to make a phone call.

560
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:57,585
- Your agent?
- Yes, actually.

561
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:10,898
Could you get me some coffee?

562
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,370
What the hell were you
up to last night?

563
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:20,239
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
<i>- Dawn: Mr. Draper.</i>

564
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,142
I'm fine, Dawn.
You want some coffee?

565
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:24,944
What the hell
were you thinking?

566
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:28,114
You said you weren't going to be
involved in Chevy until 1970.

567
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:30,016
So stay the hell out of it.

568
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,817
Stop trying to poison
my relationship.

569
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,052
Last time I checked,
it's <i>our</i> relationship.

570
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,887
And not everything
is about you, Ted.

571
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,756
Then be better at it.

572
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,991
- What are you talking about?
- You know this.

573
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:43,461
A client shouldn't have a single
negative feeling in your presence.

574
00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:45,731
Not the food, not the wine,

575
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:47,765
and certainly not the war.

576
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:48,933
I was just taking
their temperature.

577
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,168
Why would you do that?

578
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:52,703
It's Chevy, Don.

579
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:55,672
- You'd do it for your kid.
- But it's not your kid.

580
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:58,008
Oh, is it your kid?

581
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,344
No, it's my friend's kid.

582
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:10,386
Well, I bet you don't have
a lot of friends, Don,

583
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:12,288
so I'm going to assume
this is important.

584
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,124
It is.

585
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:19,095
I just--
I don't know what to do.

586
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:21,096
Do you know how young 19 is?

587
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:22,998
Did you ever think
about talking to me

588
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,432
instead of our most
important client?

589
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,101
I don't know.
It's GM.

590
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:28,804
Who else has that kind
of clout in Washington?

591
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,505
Does he wear glasses?

592
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:32,841
I don't think so, but he could.

593
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:37,578
The guy who taught me to fly

594
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:40,581
is a brigadier general
in the Air National Guard.

595
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:42,483
They're always looking
for exceptional young men

596
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:44,819
to become pilots.

597
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:48,555
And you'd be willing
to call him?

598
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,758
I'd consider it.

599
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,660
But first, you're going
to have to stop the war.

600
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,428
I can't stop the war, Ted.

601
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:56,763
Don't be an asshole, Don.

602
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:58,464
The war you're waging on me.

603
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,133
You have to lower your weapons.

604
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,902
What are you talking about?

605
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:04,805
I'm talking about how we
are going to get Ocean Spray.

606
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:07,640
So you need to stop
chasing Sunkist.

607
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:10,242
You're not going to compete
with me like that anymore.

608
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,477
We're on the same damn side.

609
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:16,248
- That's it?
- Don't act like it's nothing.

610
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,483
It seems to be
impossible so far.

611
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:23,755
You'd really do that?

612
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,432
Thank you.

613
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,000
This is not
a handshake of gratitude.

614
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,569
- This is a binding contract.
- Of course.

615
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,771
- Whatever you want.
- That's what I want.

616
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,044
Hold on.
What's the next step?

617
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,279
( sighs ) Tell the kid
to write a letter

618
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,681
about his childhood
dream of being a pilot.

619
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,084
And it better be convincing.
You should write it.

620
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,785
And tell him to get a haircut.

621
00:30:56,786 --> 00:31:00,857
Be straight, Ted.
What are the chances?

622
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,825
I'm going to call right now.

623
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,526
Thank you.

624
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,334
Can you get Dr. Rosen
on the phone?

625
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,771
( phone ringing )

626
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:23,378
- Rosen residence.
- It's me. It's Don.

627
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:24,913
What do you want?

628
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,748
I'm trying to reach Arnold.

629
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:29,449
<i>The office said</i>
<i>he was home sick.</i>

630
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,285
It's about Mitchell.

631
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,053
What? Tell me.

632
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:35,923
I know someone who knows someone
in the Air National Guard.

You told someone?

635
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,661
It's my partner.

636

He's doing me a favor.

637

Did you fix it?

638
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,172
He just wants Mitchell
to cut his hair

639
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:55,808
and sign a letter.

640
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:58,311
And the two of you need to
make sure he follows through.

641
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,178
Oh, he'll follow through.

642
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,448

My God, is it possible?

645
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:12,991
I think so,
but we have to act fast.

646
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:16,161
They went upstate to the VA
to call on an army buddy.

647
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:18,596
I'll send them up tonight.

648

Yes?

I can't believe you
would do this for me.

658

You know I have children, too.

I know that's not
why you're doing it.

And I hope--

661

well, I hope you know that I
was just frustrated with you.

I didn't want you
to fall in love.

664

You didn't feel anything?

665

No, I just...

666
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,267
I don't want
to go through this again.

667
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:39,639
You were good to me.

668
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:44,176

You have given me
a terrible problem

671
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,390
and now you're going to fix it.

672
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:01,893
Is this about Sunkist?
Because I did some digging--

673
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:05,230
I told you we needed a nurse
and you sent us a rapist.

674

Manolo?

675
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:08,066
In fact, I never
told you anything.

676
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:09,666
You were just
"doing some digging."

677

Calm down.
Sit down.

That man took advantage of her.

681
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:25,081
I assume she told
you this story.

682
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:27,150
Don't you have
your answer right there?

683
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:28,885
She says they're in love

684
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:31,321
and it's the first time in months
she's seemed sure of anything.

685
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:35,624
I don't think that Manolo's
interests turn that way.

686
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,061
Great, so he's a degenerate.

687
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:40,196
That means he's capable
of anything.

688
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:47,169
What exactly did she say?

689
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,905
Please, I'm just

Yes.

696
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,459

is it impossible that you might

begin to feel something
for him?

707

it doesn't matter who it is.

709
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:15,618
Tell him I'll give him
a month's pay.

710
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:18,787
And tell him it's disgusting.

711

Its national language

going to think you're dumb.

797
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,211
- What?
- He didn't tell you?

798
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:44,749
Don talked to somebody for us.

799
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,083
Really?

800
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,653
Sylvia sends her gratitude.
She is overwhelmed.

801
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:53,356
Do you want something to eat?
We should celebrate.

802
00:43:53,357 --> 00:43:55,391
One step at a time.

803
00:43:55,392 --> 00:43:58,595
Anyway, Don,

804
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:00,430
I owe you.

805
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,102
Let's go.

806
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:07,703
Arnold: No, you eat. I got it.

807
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:13,709
You are the sweetest man.

808
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:17,446
You make me sick!

809
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:20,916
Sally, come back here!

810
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:23,017
What happened?

811
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:24,786
I don't know.

812
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,987
I'm gonna go talk to her.

813
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:27,622
No.
I'll talk to her.

814
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,961
She has a crush on Mitchell.

815
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,229
Oh.

816
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:42,636
Sally.

817
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,409
- Open the door.
- <i>No.</i>

818
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,544
You don't get
to talk to me anymore.

819
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,815
Sally?

820
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,120
Sally, open the door.
I need to talk to you.

821
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:23,008
I know you think
you saw something.

822
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:30,080
I was... comforting
Mrs. Rosen.

823
00:45:33,218 --> 00:45:35,753
She was very upset.

824
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,225
It's very...

825
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:45,762
complicated.

826
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,101
Sally, can you hear me?

827
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:54,971
Yes.

828
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:57,440
Did you hear what I said?

829
00:46:00,544 --> 00:46:02,444
Okay.

830
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:45,942
