1
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,399
- What kind is it?
- I don’t know. - White?

2
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:37,126
- And the frame?
- Dark.

3
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:40,090
- Postmark?
- Same as last time.

4
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,799
- No note.
- No.

5
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:47,054
I’m so sorry, Henrik.

6
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:11,950

<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

7
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:14,837
THE GIRL WITH
THE DRAGON TATTOO

8
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,329
What is this?
The media event of the year?

9
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,536
Don’t try to play it down, Mikael,
it won’t work.

10
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,478
Don’t try to play it up,
that won’t either.

11
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,022
<i>Will you appeal?</i>

12
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:32,251
Yes, I’ll appeal to  you , Viggo.

13
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,944
<i>Up until today,
Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim.</i>

14
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,202
<i>"The great journalist
stood up against the lion."</i>

15
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:43,118
<i>If you call a guy 'Criminal',
and nothing to back it up.</i>

16
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,595
<i>Mr.Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>

17
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,631
Can I get the sandwich.

18
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:56,379
And a black coffee.

19
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:02,263
<i>Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom -
founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - </i>

20
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:03,403
<i>used State funds</i>

21
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:05,825
<i> intended for industrial development
in Poland </i>

22
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,054
<i>in an arms deal</i>

23
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,104
<i>- with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia.
- Thank you.</i>

24
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,984
<i>I have nothing against Mr.Blomkvist.
He’s a fine journalist.</i>

25
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:13,708
<i>who I don’t believe is guided by malice.  </i>

26
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:16,216
<i>But what he wrote was
inaccurate, </i>

27
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:18,620
<i>and inaccuracies can’t go
unanswered. </i>

28
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:22,288
<i>All journalists -
have to accept like the rest of us, </i>

29
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,771
<i>actions have consequences.</i>

30
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:29,417
<i>Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
thousand SKE in damages </i>

31
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:32,367
<i>- and all court costs,
which could be significantly more.</i>

32
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,016
And a lighter.

33
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,644
- Where you been?
- Walking.

34
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,134
-   Thinking.
- Smoking?

35
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:17,502
- Just one.

36
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:24,917
TV4 called.

37
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:28,054
I told them no  statement until
we’ve read the judgment in its entirety.

38
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,270
I have.
Anyone else?

39
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,964
Everyone who’s ever wanted
to see you humiliated.

40
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:33,456
You’ve been on the phone all morning.

41
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:35,237
- I’m as much to blame for this as you.
- You are?

42
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,810
-   You wrote it?
- I read it.  I ran it.

43
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,058
Not the same.

44
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,108
- Our credibility isn’t dead, yet.
- Mine is.

45
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,019
I’m tired.

46
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:48,568
I'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet for a week.

47
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,631
I already called Greger and tell him
I'm not coming home.

48
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,893
Thank you.

49
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,109
It’s possible we could wait forever.

50
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,524
You called her and spoke to her.
Didn't you?

51
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:06,531
I’m afraid that doesn’t mean much.

52
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,904
No one here particularly likes her.

53
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:15,911
I find it’s much better
if she works from home.

54
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,522
But you told her
I wanted to meet her.

55
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:21,023
But I’ve told her many more times I
prefer her not to meet clients.

56
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,992
- But you  like her.
- Very much.

57
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,957
She’s one of the best investigators I have.

58
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:28,085
-  As you saw from her report -
- But....

59
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,823
I’m concerned you  won’t like her.

60
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:34,473
- She’s different.
- In what way?

61
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,481
In every way.

62
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:43,169
Ms. Salander’s here.

63
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:52,822
Lisbeth,
Mr. Dirch Frode.

64
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,799
How do you do?

65
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:09,354
- Something wrong with the report?
- No.It was quite thorough.

66
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,999
But I’m also interested in
what’s not in it.

67
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,495
- There’s nothing not in it.
- Your opinion of him isn’t.

68
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,107
I’m not paid to give my opinion.

69
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,901
So you don’t have one?

70
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,053
He’s clean.
In my opinion.

71
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,064
You mean, he is hygenic?

72
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,798
He’s who he presents
himself to be.

73
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,463
In his business,
that’s an asset.

74
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:33,903
There’s less in his asset column
after his conviction today.

75
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,739
True.  He made a fool of himself.
If it happened that way.

76
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:39,156
Are you saying he was set up?

77
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:42,094
That wasn’t part of my assignment.

78
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:43,503
You’re quite right...

79
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,388
he made a fool of himself..
professionally.

80
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,185
How much of a fool can
he make of himself financially?

81
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:52,043
The judgement will just about
empty his savings.

82
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,041
- May I go?
- A moment.

83
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,892
Your report is light
in another area.

84
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,997
His personal life.
Anything you chose not to disclose?

85
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:05,398
- Nothing that warranted inclusion.
- Does that means "yes" or  "no"?

86
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:07,256
I think what Ms. Salander means, and

87
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:11,044
I agree, is that everyone has a right
to a certain amount of privacy,

88
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,546
- even if they’re being investigated.
- Not in this case.

89
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,345
I need to know if there’s anything about him
I might find unsavory -

90
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,230
even if she doesn’t.

91
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:25,938
He’s had a long sexual relationship
with his co-editor of the megazine.

92
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,123
It wrecked his marriage,
but not hers.

93
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:30,463
Sometimes he performs Cunnilingus.

94
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,853
Not often enough,
In my opinion.

95
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,791
You were right not to include that.

96
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,471
I know.

97
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:33,445
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.

98
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:34,347
She offered.

99
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:35,903
- He declined.
- As she hoped.

100
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,144
Never a good idea mixing
family and business.

101
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,428
And I still would have lost, anyway.

102
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:40,829
It wasn’t even about Mikael.

103
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:42,956
It   was Wennerstrom sending
a message to the press

104
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:45,272
- and the FSA saying:
Don’t ask questions.

105
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,678
Cheer up.

106
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,595
- Dad.
- Nilla.

107
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:54,970
You don’t have to
worry about me.

108
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:56,866
- Mom’s worried.
- About me?

109
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:59,180
About the money.

110
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,566
Nilla?  What are you doing?

111
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,239
- Nothing.
- Is it serious?

112
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,034
I don’t want to talk about it since
I know you won’t approve.

113
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:16,923
Of -
Nilla...

114
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:19,058
- Light of Life.
- Light of- what?

115
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:29,636
- Hello.
- Mr. Blomkvist?

116
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,483
Forgive me for intruding on your
Christmas.

117
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,889
My name is Dirch Frode.
I’m an attorney.

118
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,668
I represent Henrik
Vanger.  Perhaps you’ve heard of him?

119
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:37,853
Yes, yes. Of course.

120
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,528
He’d like to speak to you
about a private matter.

121
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,987
This is..uh..
an awkward moment---

122
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:46,648
I’m sorry.  I’m about to sit down to
Christmas dinner myself.

123
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:48,426
No, that’s not exactly what I mean.

124
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:51,121
You’re referring to your recent
legal problems.

125
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,413
That has  provided us with much ammusement.

126
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,967
Herr Vanger has little love
for Wennerstrom either.

127
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,154
Have him call me.

128
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:00,301
But, he’d like to meet in person,

129
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:02,808
If possible.
Up north.  In Hedestad.

130
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,018
That's not gonna be possible.

131
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,728
Herr Vanger is far too old to make a trip to
Stockholm,

132
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,661
Please.
If you’d be so kind as to consider.

133
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,352
Hedestad is lovely in winter.

134
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:15,839
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?

135
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:31,739
Usually when I wake up in a cold
bed, it’s at home.

136
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,583
- I'm Sorry.
- What are you doing?

137
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,339
Writing the press release.

138
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:36,831
Saying...

139
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,446
You’re taking over as publisher.

140
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,010
You’re sorry for any nuisance
Wennerstrom was caused.

141
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,643
I can’t be
reached for comment.

142
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:49,101
- Are you giving up?
- Just stepping aside.

143
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:51,307
This makes me sick.

144
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:28,213
- FRODE: First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.

145
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,496
Oh, don't say that.
It’s lovely in the spring.

146
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,395
You said it was lovely
in winter.

147
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,913
Well, this is unseasonable.

148
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,798
I’ll be on the 4:30 train back to
Stockholm.

149
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:41,072
Unless we get snowed in ...
I’m joking.

150
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:44,249
You’ll be home tonight,
if that’s what you wish.

151
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,935
Welcome.  Come inside.

152
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:27,311
It’s warm.

153
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,795
How do you do?

154
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:35,977
So...

155
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,816
What do you know about me?

156
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,249
That you used to run one of the
biggest industrial firms in the country.

157
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:45,325
- Used to.  That’s correct.
- Right, I didn't mean to...

158
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:52,596
My grandfather forged the tracks
the 4:30 train will take you home.

159
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,213
We stitched this country together.
We made the steel--

160
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:59,825
and milled the lumber that built
modern Sweden.

161
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,995
And what our most profitable
product now is?

162
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,336
Fertilizer.

163
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,109
I’m not obsessed with the declining
health of the company,

164
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:09,183
but I am with
the settling of accounts -

165
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:12,191
and the clock is ticking.
I need your help.

166
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,813
Doing..doing what?

167
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,904
Officially, assisting me with my memoirs.

168
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:20,076
But what you’d really be doing..

169
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:24,538
is solving a mystery.  And
by doing what you do so well -

170
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,400
Your recent legal mishap of
yours notwithstanding.

171
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:31,913
You’d be investigating
thieves, misers, bullies,

172
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:36,495
- the most detestable collection
of people you’ll ever meet ...

173
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,930
my family.

174
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,890
Would you like to sit?  I could
possibly clear a place if necessary.

175
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,062
- Did you make it?
- Have you something for me?

176
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:57,181
I’m on welfare;
I don’t administer it.

177
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,712
This isn’t enough.

178
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,771
No ‘thank you?’

179
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:18,944
This is Harriet.  The grandaughter
of my brother Richard.

180
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,945
Richard, was a
Nazi of the first order -

181
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,483
joining the
- Nationalist Socialist Freedom League

182
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,042
when he was 17.

183
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:32,101
Isn’t it interesting how fascists
always steal the word freedom "freedom".

184
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:37,538
The 4:30.  Yes.
Okay...

185
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,934
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
cause -

186
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:45,941
in 1940, missed all  the real
excitement -

187
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:50,126
but not the opportunity
to regularly beat his wife Margareta..

188
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,927
and their son, Gottfried.

189
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:55,273
Now, Gottfried - Harriet’s father -
was what people used to call

190
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,627
-  a Good-Time-Charlie.
- They’re still called that.

191
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,979
Are they?  Okay.

192
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:01,652
He was a charmer, a ladies man,
a drunk.

193
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:04,502
In other words, a born salesman -
which is what he did for the company -

194
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,395
traveling around, taking clients
out to dinner and so forth.

195
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,683
- Well, Somebody has to do it.
- That’s right.

196
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,843
Anyway, he died in 1965.

197
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,890
Drowned.  Drunk.
Here on theisland.

198
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:19,451
His wife Isabella - who was pretty
much useless as a parent before  -

199
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,610
became even more so after his death -

200
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:24,471
which is when I began looking after
their children -

201
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,519
Martin - who runs Vanger Industries
now that I’m retired -

202
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,024
- I've been with him.
- and Harriet.

203
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,787
She was bright and curious,

204
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:38,401
a  winning combination in any person.

205
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,348
- And beautiful.
- Yeah.

206
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:44,944
Something happened to her?

207
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,217
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet.

208
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:52,382
And for the last forty years
has been trying to drive me insane.

209
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:58,537
It was September 24th, 1966.
A Saturday.

210
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,160
Harriet was 16.

211
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,102
My brothers - along with their
wives, children and grandchildren -

212
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,357
had gathered here

213
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,729
for our loathsome
annual board meeting and dinner.

214
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:13,755
It was also the day the Yacht Club held
its Autumn parade.

215
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,852
Harriet and a couple of school
friends had gone into town to see it.

216
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:20,188
She returned a
little after two o’clock.

217
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:23,414
She came to the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.

218
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,287
I honestly
don’t remember what I was doing

219
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:30,671
that I thought was more important, but I
told her to give me a few minutes.

220
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:36,146
It was during those few minutes,
that something else occurred.

221
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:42,863
The accident had
nothing to do with Harriet -

222
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,836
and yet, everything.

223
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:48,284
It was chaos as everyone put down
what they were doing.

224
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,542
Police, an ambulance,
fire brigade,

225
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,863
reporter, photographer and onlookers
quickly arrived from town,

226
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:58,864
just as those of us on the island - the family -
hurried to the bridge from our side.

227
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:02,772
The driver of the car -
a man named Aronsson -

228
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,692
was pinned and severely injured.

229
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:09,912
We tried desperately to pry him out
with our hands - since metal tools could spark.

230
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:14,990
It was an hour after the crash,
Harriet was in the kitchen.

231
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,426
Anna herself saw her.

232
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:24,780
We finally got poor
Aronsson out of his car

233
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,064
and off to the hospital,

234
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,329
Just us we from our side
slowly drifted back to the house.

235
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,605
The sun was down,
the excitement over,

236
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,364
we sat down to dinner.

237
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:42,697
It was then, that
I noticed Harriet wasn’t there.

238
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:47,942
And she wasn’t there the next
morning.  Or the next.

239
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,132
Or the next forty years.

240
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,899
What was she going to tell me?  Why
didn’t I make time for her?

241
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:57,385
Why didn’t I listen?

242
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:01,070
- And she couldn’t have run away?
- Not without being seen.

243
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,660
Firemen stayed
on the bridge all night

244
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,942
pumping out the gasoline.

245
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,132
And no one swam across,
or took a row boat.

246
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,148
All of them were still tied up
on this side Sunday.

247
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:13,233
Believe me,
I checked.

248
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,804
She couldn’t have just
fallen and drowned?

249
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:18,582
Oh, no. The currents
aren’t strong here.

250
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,384
Anything that falls into the water
turns up nearby.

251
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,320
Like her father.

252
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,625
His body didn’t drift more
than ten meters

253
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:28,350
when he drowned
the year before.

254
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,701
No. No. Someone killed her,

255
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:34,171
Someone on the island
that day.

256
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:38,432
Someone close enough to know
what she used to give me each year

257
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:40,417
on my birthday.

258
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:43,607
Those were from her.

259
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,709
The rest...from her killer.

260
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:04,453
- Who knows about these?
- Just me, the police, the killer...

261
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,225
and now you.

262
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,755
After, the police investigation evaporated,

263
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,163
I kept at it -
studying all the information there was,

264
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:25,020
I’ve spent half my life
examining the events of a single day.

265
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:27,192
I understand your frustration, But...

266
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:30,054
what you’re asking me to do is
a waste of money

267
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,548
We haven’t discussed your fee.

268
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,784
We don’t need to.

269
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,109
Thank you.

270
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:38,213
I can’t find something you haven’t
been able to  in forty years.

271
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,558
You don’t know that.

272
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,787
You have a
very keen investigative mind.

273
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,042
Here’s what I propose:

274
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,993
You come stay on the island. I have a nice little
cottage by the water you can use.

275
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,679
You study the material I give you.
You find something I’ve missed- or you don’t.

276
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:56,446
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career....

277
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,705
Think of it as a well
deserved holiday.

278
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:03,127
A way of avoiding all the
people you want to avoid right now.

279
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:07,800
As for compensation, I’ll pay you double
your salary for as many months as it takes.

280
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,827
I’ll quadruple it if
you solve the mystery.

281
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:11,106
- Herr Vanger.
- I’m not done.

282
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:12,504
I’ll throw in one  more thing -

283
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,643
even though you’re a
terrible negotiator.

284
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,813
It’s something you want more than anything else
and it can’t be bought at any price.

285
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:25,028
So, let me give it to you ...
Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

286
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,745
He began his career working for me.

287
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:31,133
And I’ve followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.

288
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:35,841
You were right about him.

289
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,265
You just couldn’t prove it.

290
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:10,821
We’re in the middle of our worst crisis ever
and you’re writing a memoir?

291
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:12,566
You fired me;
I need something to do.

292
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,118
You fired you;

293
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,815
I need you here,
not the North Pole.

294
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,435
Mikael, You know what this
is going to look like.

295
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,587
Like I’ve been gutted.  Like I’m
running away.  I am.

296
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,275
Wennerström wants to see me waving
a white flag, not a red one.

297
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,124
The more it looks like there’s a problem
between you and me, the more it’ll satisfy him.

298
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,622
There is a problem between us.  He
won’t be satisfied until he shuts us down,

299
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:35,593
You’re leaving me to fight him alone?

300
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,119
It’s four hours by train.

301
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,558
It’s not the North Pole.

302
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:26,434
Hey, hey.

303
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:24,481
<i>The network is busy,
please try again later.</i>

304
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,642
<i>The network is busy,
please try again later.</i>

305
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,307
What?

306
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:47,355
Want some Milk?

307
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:08,028
<i>The network is busy,
please try again later.</i>

308
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,310
You are Palmgren's daughter?

309
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,099
His ward,
He doesn't have a daughter.

310
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,395
Please.

311
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:59,226
He's had a severe
cerebral hemorrhaging.

312
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,467
Either from the fall itself,
or a stroke that led to the fall.

313
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:05,117
His blood pressure is too high.

314
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,846
I’m hopeful he’ll regain consciousness,
but that’s not assured.

315
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,564
And it’s possible, even if he does,

316
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,887
there will be
neurological damage.

317
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,521
Hi, I’m Gunner.

318
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:44,287
The caretaker.

319
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,776
Oh, hey, Gunnar.

320
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,229
You’re an author?

321
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:06,338
Well, I'm doing a biography
on Herr Vanger.

322
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,266
- I saw you on television.
- That’s unfortunate.

323
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,539
Bit of trouble, I guess.

324
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,849
No jail time, though.
That’s good.

325
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:19,747
Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?

326
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,536
There.

327
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:24,485
It's good.

328
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:30,427
The entire island is
owned by my family.

329
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:37,247
Your closest neighbor is
my brother

330
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:41,951
Harald, another Nazi if you can believe.
Two  in the family.

331
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:46,003
Oh, yes. He’s quite detestable
to put it nicely,

332
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:49,424
but you’ll probably never see him.
He’s a recluse.

333
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,102
- He was there that day?
- Indeed, he was.

334
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,553
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.

335
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:57,917
They don’t speak.

336
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:00,148
Does anyone speak to
anyone on this island?

337
00:29:00,553 --> 00:29:04,792
Isabella, Harriet’s mother
- who lives there - she speaks to Harald -

338
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:07,153
which is one of reasons
I don’t speak to her

339
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:11,907
Cecilia’s brother Birger
lives there.

340
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:14,383
- Who doesn’t he speak to?
- You, probably.

341
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,392
Not that you’d want him to.
He can be as unpleasant as Harald.

342
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,028
I’m quickly losing
track of who’s who, here.

343
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:22,551
Oh, how you’ll wish
it were always so.

344
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:26,772
Soon you’ll know us all only too
well - with my apologies.

345
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:32,540
Out there is my nephew Martin’s
house; Harriet’s brother.

346
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,738
- Who speaks to him?
- I speak to him.

347
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:37,438
He runs the company
now, as I think I told you.

348
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:42,816
Someone shooting their dinner.
Gunner probably.

349
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,992
Oh yes, I met him earlier.

350
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,746
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.

351
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:50,035
He lives over there.

352
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,587
- And you live there?
- Sorry?

353
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:54,848
Your house.

354
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:58,437
Oh, yes!

355
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,372
Yes, you’re right.

356
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:06,077
The man who  hires the detective should
always bekept on the suspects list.

357
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:05,896
<font color="#3399FF">DET. MORELL:</font> The fact that
I never found a body  was not surprising.

358
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,982
You can’t dig  up an entire island.

359
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:14,934
But neither could I find the motive.
Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated?

360
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:17,124
Did she know something someone
wished she didn’t?

361
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,508
-  Was it about business?
- Business?  But she was sixteen.

362
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,942
And very bright.

363
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:27,701
Henrik told me he could easily see her
running the business one day,

364
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:30,206
She was with some friends that day.
At a parade.

365
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,522
She told them she was  feeling unwell.
She left early

366
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:37,684
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them, too.

367
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:40,983
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

368
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,028
- I have one.
- Then, you know.

369
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:44,971
I wanted to...

370
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:48,195
Ask you about this.

371
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:53,911
She received that from Henrik,
the Christmas before.

372
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:58,722
I studied it more times
than I can say.

373
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:03,063
-  I know every page of it.
- The last page I’m curious about.

374
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:04,257
As was I.

375
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:07,516
List of Names, Numbers and..
Must have some significance.

376
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,581
They’re local phone numbers.

377
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:12,021
The first belonged to a woman
called Margot,

378
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:14,713
whose mother was Magda,
who denied she didn’t know Harriet.

379
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:17,897
The fourth, R.L., belonged to
Rosemarie Larsson,

380
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:20,663
an elderly woman who died
some years before.

381
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:25,343
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.

382
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,199
I’ve reminded you of things you’d
rather forget.  I’m sorry.

383
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,091
I can’t forget it.

384
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:34,430
It’s my "Rebecka Case".

385
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,238
I don't know what that is.

386
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,672
Every policeman has at least
one unsolved case to obsess over.

387
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,012
Back then we had an Officer,
Torstensson.

388
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:48,105
Year after year he kept
going back to his "Rebecka Case".

389
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,975
taking out the files -
studying them over and over.

390
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,719
We were young, we laughed at him.

391
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,626
That was also a missing girl case?

392
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,827
No, no, no. That’s not why I mention it.

393
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,931
I'm talking about the soul
of a policeman.

394
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:04,242
Poor old Torstensson never solved it,

395
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:06,428
and he never let it go.

396
00:34:13,736 --> 00:34:15,489
How’s Mr. Palmgren doing?

397
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,070
I heard he had a stroke of some kind?

398
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:20,457
That's Terrible.

399
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:23,442
What exactly do you do at this
security company?

400
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:25,999
Make coffee and sort mail.

401
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:27,342
But not full-time.

402
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:29,850
Not even part-time consistently.

403
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:32,674
They somehow got
along without coffee or mail

404
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,000
in July and August?

405
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:41,233
- How much did you made there?
- Enough.

406
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,209
- How much is your rent?
- I pay my rent.

407
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:50,819
And when was the last time you were late?

408
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,162
Never.

409
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:55,766
Do you think that ring in your eyelid
makes you attractive?

410
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,951
Here’s the problem.

411
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:03,731
There a discrepancy..

412
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,402
between the obligation of
Mr. Palmgren’s guardianship

413
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:08,095
and the management of your finances.

414
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:09,789
There's no discrepancy or a problem.

415
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:12,242
It was clear to him
I could manage myown finances.

416
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,579
- But that’s not clear to me.
- I’m not a child.

417
00:35:13,522 --> 00:35:15,351
No.  You’re not.
But you were.

418
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:19,237
And between then and now -
you're committed to a ward at  St. Stephens,

419
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,621
where you continued to display
a violent aggression -

420
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:25,998
And you failed to adapt to four foster homes

421
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,176
arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics

422
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:32,970
again for an assault: smashing
a bottle smashed into a man’s face.

423
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:34,769
And that's not even that long ago.

424
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,900
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
thinking you’ve changed, but

425
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,817
looking at this...

426
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:44,728
- not to mention how you’re looking
at me now -

427
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:47,233
I don't think you have.

428
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,702
So the Good
-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over.

429
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:56,158
Starting now, you’ll be given a monthly allowance.
You’ll provide me with receipts for your expenses.

430
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:59,451
If the numbers don’t balance, I’ll
have to assume the difference is going to drugs.

431
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:01,209
I’ve been on myself
since I was ten.

432
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,895
The State- has taken care of you.

433
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:05,665
Ms. Salander?  Please look at me.
Because this is important.

434
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:08,576
Since, behavior you’re displaying
right now is elaborately documented here -

435
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:11,416
- so it would come as a shock to no
one if I chose an alternative to

436
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,308
very lenient arrangement
I've just outlined.

437
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:21,824
Would you prefer
institutionalization?

438
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,464
- Mikael?
- Yes.

439
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:44,224
- I'm Liv.
- Hi.

440
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:45,686
We’re going to the same place.
Hop in.

441
00:36:45,658 --> 00:36:47,105
Okay, thank you.

442
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,614
I found him at death’s door
halfway up the hill.

443
00:36:58,511 --> 00:36:59,919
I’m afraid I’m a bit out of shape.

444
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:02,123
No, it’s a climb for anyone.
I should’ve warned you.

445
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:03,376
- Come on in.
- Thank you, Martin.

446
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:04,739
Henrik says great things about you.

447
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,746
What a place,
look at that view!

448
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:16,086
I used to work in the company’s
petrochemical division in Goteborg.

449
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,280
When it was sold, I went with it.

450
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,540
A dark day.

451
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,708
I live in Hong Kong now, but come
back to Stockholm for family events,

452
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,577
and when I do, I drive up to spend a
couple days with Martin.

453
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,452
- She comes for the moose steak.
- You can't blame her, it's wonderful.

454
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:32,506
Something let's open.

455
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:35,171
Would you like to try something
else?

456
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,751
No, no, no.
It's fine.

457
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:43,724
You’re writing a book now,
What is it?

458
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,619
- Henrik’s biography.
- I love Henrik.

459
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:47,862
He’s fascinating.
Martin, too.

460
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,945
Together they’re the
Old Sweden and the New.

461
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:52,663
They are.

462
00:37:54,428 --> 00:37:56,105
You know about Harriet, right?

463
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:58,842
- You don’t?
- Yes, I do.

464
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:01,939
The family doesn’t like
to talk about it,

465
00:38:01,872 --> 00:38:04,306
but it can’t just be
swept under the rug.

466
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,737
- What can’t.
- Harriet.

467
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:08,104
- We can talk about that  later.
- No.

468
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:10,041
We can talk about it now.

469
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,793
Liv knows everything about
my crazyfamily.

470
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:15,400
-  Which is why she’ll never marry me.
- That’s one reason...

471
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,127
I don't wanna read about that
in the book.

472
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,995
Everything else is fine,
Harriet certainly.

473
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:23,373
Everything changed after that.

474
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:25,981
Not just the family,
but the company as well.

475
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,102
- How so?
- We’re not Nordea or Ericsson,

476
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:31,354
but we’re still the largest family-owned
company in the country.

477
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:35,343
At the height, we had 40,000 employees.
We have about half that now,

478
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,587
and that downward slide -

479
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,286
began after my sister’s death.

480
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:44,927
It broke Henrik’s entrepreneurial spirit,

481
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:47,645
and his heart.

482
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,652
You were here that day?

483
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:53,160
I came in a little late, after the accident
on the bridge. The 4:30 train.

484
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,743
I know it well.

485
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:56,394
It was a terrible day.

486
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:00,009
And the days after -

487
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,391
searching and not finding her

488
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,926
- were even worse.

489
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:08,884
This event, Mikael, has to be a
big part of your book.

490
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,474
I got a call from social welfare.

491
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,573
I’ve been on to find a new guardian.

492
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,670
- Hi.
- Hello.

493
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,481
I thought I’d come over
and say hello.

494
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,046
-   I’m Cecilia.
- Oh, yeah. Please, come in.

495
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,482
Some coffee?

496
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,423
No, Thank you.

497
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,014
We’re all uncomfortable with the
idea of a chronicle of our family.

498
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:07,294
It’s not about the family.
It’s about Henrik and the company.

499
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:09,403
Like I said...

500
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:13,053
It’s not my intention to present a
malicious portrait of anyone.

501
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:15,075
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.?

502
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,453
Unlike that one. Yes.

503
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:21,440
So, what you’re saying is, you’re not really here
to look into what happened to Harriet?

504
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,465
I can’t ignore such
a dramatic event,

505
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,531
but no, that’s not
by any means my focus.

506
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:28,937
All those boxes Gunner carted  down here
- which are where? - in the closet now?

507
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:30,993
- those weren’t Henrik’s
private investigation?

508
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:34,000
I wonder sometimes who’s crazier -

509
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:37,328
my Nazi father
or my obsessed uncle.

510
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:42,382
Since we’re talking about it,
since you brought it up, what was she like?

511
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:44,228
I’m sure Henrik has told you.

512
00:41:44,161 --> 00:41:46,643
He was my age back then, he couldn’t know
what was going on

513
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:48,589
with a teenager,
anymore than I can with my own daughter.

514
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,031
-  You were the same age.
- Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.

515
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,285
She knew Harriet better than anyone -
You should talk to her.

516
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:55,491
I’d love to, where is she?

517
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,768
If I had to guess -
London.

518
00:41:57,706 --> 00:42:01,285
- You don’t know where your own sister lives?
- I haven’t seen her in years.

519
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,993
- We never really got along.
- I’m getting used to that comment.

520
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:06,005
She hates this place
even more than  I do.

521
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:08,775
She left, moved to London,
That was it.

522
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:12,380
You couldn’t pay her to send a Christmas card,
much less visit.

523
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,660
I’ll try to track and help you.

524
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:17,162
If you do,
and try talking to her about us,

525
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,083
don’t be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off.

526
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,838
<font color="#3399FF">Subtitle by d3xt3r</font>

527
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,101
You backed up?

528
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:34,151
- Hard drives at home, yeah.
- That’s good. B'cos this one is gone.

529
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,396
Have you ever had an STD?

530
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:48,671
When’s the last time
you were tested for HIV?

531
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:53,954
How many partners have you had
in thelast month?

532
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:58,069
How many of those were men?

533
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,007
It's regulation,
I have to ask you these things.

534
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,097
- It’s a matter of health.
- Write what you want.

535
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:07,658
Why do you need
such an expensive computer?

536
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:09,808
- For work.
- Making coffee and sorting mail ?

537
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:12,069
I shouldn’t even have to ask.
I should have control of my money.

538
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:14,551
And you will.
Once you learn to be sociable.

539
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:16,891
Get along with people.
Can you do that?

540
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:22,422
Why don't we start with that?

541
00:43:25,884 --> 00:43:28,601
Why don't we start with me?

542
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:38,197
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

543
00:43:40,082 --> 00:43:41,485
That’s how normal people do.

544
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,791
I want you to have that computer.

545
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:17,667
You feel that?
That’s gaberdine.

546
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:25,900
Unzip it.

547
00:44:34,794 --> 00:44:36,145
And ...

548
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:39,163
And ...

549
00:44:52,264 --> 00:44:53,659
I like the reticence.

550
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,492
It’s almost convincing.

551
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:30,835
- Anita Vanger?
- Through there.

552
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:32,072
Thank  you.

553
00:46:34,746 --> 00:46:36,062
Excuse me.

554
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:38,001
I probably should have made an appointment.

555
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:40,339
No, It’s fine.

556
00:46:40,725 --> 00:46:42,989
-   Please.  Have a seat.
- Thank you.

557
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,458
- Mikael.
- Mikael.  How do you do?

558
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:47,657
How do you do.

559
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:50,437
So, are you looking
for investment counseling?

560
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:52,675
Well, I would
if had any money

561
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:54,285
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

562
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,241
I’m writing a biography
of your  uncle Henrik.

563
00:46:57,168 --> 00:46:59,056
That’s why I’m here.

564
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,648
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.

565
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:04,904
Actually, it's more than that.

566
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:08,005
Haven't seen my sister.
Haven't seen anyone...

567
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:10,569
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that,

568
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:12,918
so your recollections are valid.

569
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,123
Where to start,
if that was a question.

570
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:19,383
Well than, let me narrow it down
I've gotten up to 1960

571
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,739
To the event that changed
everything in Henrik's life.

572
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,113
Harriet...

573
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:29,707
Everything I knew about
that I told to

574
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:31,873
- - whatever his name was -
- Morell.

575
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,153
My recollections then were a lot
better than they are now.

576
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:36,837
I'm not speaking of the event itself.

577
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:39,806
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
what Harriet was like.

578
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:43,917
She was messed up.

579
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:49,182
Like all us Vanger kids.

580
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:51,196
Crazy mother.

581
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:55,684
Drunken father.
At least hers wasn't a Nazi.

582
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:56,934
- Was he abusive?
- Mine?

583
00:47:56,911 --> 00:47:59,877
- No, her's.
- Not that I ever saw.

584
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:02,835
but you could
tell something was going on.

585
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:07,950
Somedays, she'd be very withdrawn.

586
00:48:08,821 --> 00:48:14,385
The next minute, she'd be putting on makeup
and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school.

587
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:18,146
And then, she'd be studying
a Bible like a nun -

588
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,707
no Vanger was ever religious -
can you imagine?

589
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:24,161
She was obviously,
very unhappy.

590
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:27,442
What do you think happened to her?

591
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:28,796
Everyone knows what.

592
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:32,751
You don't have any thoughts about who?
Why?

593
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:36,372
All I know is that
I always felt really sorry for her.

594
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:39,867
I got away when I was 18 and
never went back.

595
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:41,743
She would have done the same..

596
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:44,974
but she never made it to 18.

597
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,687
<i>Mr. Bjurman, please.
It’s Lisbeth Salander.</i>

598
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:49,503
<i>Wait for a moment, please.</i>

599
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:54,060
I’m fine.  I’m sorry I missed
our appointment.

600
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:55,279
I had a lot of work.

601
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:58,638
- Is something the matter?
- ... no, nothing to be concerned about

602
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:01,562
Actually, I need another
advance on my allowance.

603
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:04,131
Can I come to your office
tonight?

604
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:09,824
Why don't you come to my house?
Do you have a pen?

605
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:11,900
... I don’t need a pen,
what’s the address??

606
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:30,845
- Yes?
- It's me.

607
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:42,302
Lisbeth, come on in.

608
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:53,903
- You Like it?
- It's nice.

609
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:55,385
So.

610
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,622
- So, what do you need money for this time?
- Food.

611
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:04,961
How are you?

612
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:13,142
I'm so glad that you've decided
to come an visit.

613
00:50:14,192 --> 00:50:15,928
I just want my money.

614
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,620
Well, let’s see if I can help
you out with that.

615
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,368
Wait.

616
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:34,632
- Is there a problem?
- I just want to know...

617
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:38,529
am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?

618
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:40,548
You're so cute when are surly.

619
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,417
I fogot to ask you...

620
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:25,679
Do you like anal sex?

621
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:24,065
<i>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.</i>

622
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:28,934
<i>  Through faith we understand that
the world was created by the word of God - </i>

623
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:17,530
- I’ll drive you home.
- I can get home on my own.

624
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:19,726
Are you sure?

625
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:26,472
- Is it any warmer inside?
- No.

626
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:30,244
I apologize if you’re having
financial problems

627
00:55:30,162 --> 00:55:32,486
at the magazine
during Mikael’s absence.

628
00:55:32,424 --> 00:55:35,308
- We’ll work through them.
- Are you sure?

629
00:55:35,224 --> 00:55:38,844
How long do you think you can hang on?
Six months or so?

630
00:55:39,782 --> 00:55:43,152
- That sounds about right.
- You know, I used to be in the newspaper business.

631
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,270
We owned six dailies
back in the 50’s.

632
00:55:45,213 --> 00:55:47,132
We still own one.
The Courier, here in town.

633
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,539
Which, I let my nephew Birger run it since
he can’t run anything else.

634
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,864
So what do you say to
taking on a partner?

635
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,810
Well, We’ve never
had to considered it before.

636
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,178
We value our independence very much.

637
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:03,997
Independence is publishing
is dependant on advertisers -

638
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:06,114
However much you have, you’d retain.

639
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:10,263
-  We don’t care about content.
- Excuse me.  Did I miss something?

640
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:12,058
We’re talking about an
investment in the magazine.

641
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:13,725
I gather that.
Why would you want to do that?

642
00:56:13,689 --> 00:56:15,339
Well, not out of greed,
that’s for sure.

643
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:20,362
I feel badly that I’ve taken Mikael
away from you at the worst possible time.

644
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:25,268
Now i'm convinced that this is
the right thing to do.  The moral thing..

645
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:27,407
That’s one reason.
And.

646
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,778
And....

647
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,809
<i>The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.</i>

648
00:56:34,148 --> 00:56:36,031
How long have you
been discussing this with them?

649
00:56:35,988 --> 00:56:38,589
I haven’t been. They called yesterday
and asked me to come.

650
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:39,461
Why didn’t you tell me?

651
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:40,948
Why would I.
You live in the wood?

652
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:43,135
And so, I deserve
to be treated like an idiot?

653
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:44,836
I just wanted to hear
what they had to say?

654
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,075
You would’ve said 'no'
before they could.

655
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:49,731
I’m saying it now.
It’s a bad idea.

656
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:52,187
You heard me tell them we could
had six months.

657
00:56:52,552 --> 00:56:55,365
I lied. Without their money we’ll be out of
business in three.

658
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:58,084
You don’t know this family.
Like I do. They’re crazy.

659
00:56:58,355 --> 00:57:01,796
- We’re not marrying into it.
- If we do this. That’s exactly what we’re doing.

660
00:57:02,734 --> 00:57:04,545
You want to say no?
Let’s say no.

661
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:08,411
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let’s own 100 percent of nothing.

662
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,609
- Mikael?
- What?

663
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:18,439
- I’m leaving this God-forsaken
island in the morning.

664
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:20,268
- So?
- So, are you coming to bed or not.

665
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:29,386
How much do one of those cost?

666
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,217
Around three thousand.

667
00:57:34,448 --> 00:57:36,395
This is really gonna hurt.

668
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:40,454
Your call.

669
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:48,716
<i>Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries
has taken a controlling interest in Millennium magazine.</i>

670
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:50,960
<i>which according to analysts
has been in financial trouble....</i>

671
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:52,358
Millennium is an excellent magazine.

672
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:55,769
We also think it’s undervalued right now,
which is good business for us.

673
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:58,243
There’s another reason.
I don’t like bullies.

674
00:57:58,171 --> 00:58:00,014
Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?

675
00:57:59,972 --> 00:58:02,216
I’m referring to anyone who tries
to sue --

676
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:04,035
their enemies into submission.

677
00:58:03,992 --> 00:58:06,748
If Mr. Wennerstrom would
like to try it again,

678
00:58:06,669 --> 00:58:09,998
he’ll find himself fighting
a company that can afford to fight back.

679
00:58:09,895 --> 00:58:13,880
<i>I’ve always admired Henrik Vanger.
He’s a titan - and a gentleman.  </i>

680
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:16,540
<i>But he’s also quite old now -
which may explain..</i>

681
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:19,015
<i> how he could be taken in
by a convicted liar.</i>

682
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:39,083
Shit.

683
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:18,274
<i><font color="#3399FF">PHOTO EDITOR:</font>
The current archive is on CD’s, </i>

684
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:23,567
<i> The older stuff, still negatives.
What general period are you interested in?</i>

685
01:00:23,399 --> 01:00:25,202
September, 1966.

686
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:29,177
Thank you.

687
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:36,969
Is this about Harriet Vanger?

688
01:00:36,922 --> 01:00:38,611
You’re too young
to know about that.

689
01:00:38,575 --> 01:00:40,653
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.

690
01:00:43,028 --> 01:00:44,879
It’s how we’re taught
about strangers.

691
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:54,444
- Lisbeth?
- I need to pay my rent.

692
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,379
I need some money.

693
01:00:58,308 --> 01:00:59,671
Oh, come in.

694
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:10,262
I feel..a bit..badly,
how we left it last night.

695
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:11,449
- Me, too.

696
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:58,384
Good...

697
01:01:58,775 --> 01:02:00,091
You’re alive.

698
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,079
You recognize this?

699
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,276
I had it with me last time.
I set it here.  Remember?

700
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,363
And the snap,
you see it?

701
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,142
It’s not a snap.
It’s a wide-angle micro-lens.

702
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,079
I thought it was gonna be
just another blow-job.

703
01:02:32,032 --> 01:02:33,485
Which is disgusting enough.

704
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:36,735
I misjudged,
just how sick you are.

705
01:02:47,052 --> 01:02:49,604
Okay, this is what’s going to happen.

706
01:03:11,647 --> 01:03:12,949
Pay attention.

707
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:15,126
Look at me.

708
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:18,426
Once you can sit again,

709
01:03:19,044 --> 01:03:20,495
which could be a while, I admit.

710
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:24,132
we’re going to my bank and tell them that
I alone have access to money.

711
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:25,498
Nod.

712
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,779
After that,
you’ll never contact me again.

713
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:32,201
Each month you’ll prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.

714
01:03:32,859 --> 01:03:34,965
In it, you’ll describe
how well I’m doing,

715
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:36,548
how 'sociable' I’m becoming.

716
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:39,053
Then, you will negotiate
with the court--

717
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,491
to have my
declaration of incompetence lifted.

718
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:42,733
If you fail,

719
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:45,456
this video will spread
across the Internet like a virus.

720
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:46,678
Nod.

721
01:03:48,022 --> 01:03:49,771
And, If something happens to me

722
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:53,656
..if I get hit by a car -
if you run me over with a car -

723
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,356
This will upload automatically.

724
01:03:55,314 --> 01:03:57,288
Nod that you understand.

725
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,030
Oh, Gabardina.

726
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,019
I’m taking the keys to this apartment.

727
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:06,580
Because, I’ll  be checking on you.

728
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:08,479
And If I find a girl in here with you,

729
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:10,539
whether she came of her own
free will or not -

730
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:14,872
No.  Not the video.

731
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:24,668
I will kill you.

732
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,427
Do you doubt anything I’ve said?

733
01:04:29,253 --> 01:04:32,822
Do you doubt in the
reports that've followed me all my life?

734
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:34,010
What do they say?

735
01:04:34,514 --> 01:04:35,839
If you had to sum it up?

736
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:38,201
They say I’m insane.

737
01:04:39,153 --> 01:04:41,820
No, it okay. You can nod
because it’s true.

738
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:44,672
I am insane.

739
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:47,635
Nod!

740
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:52,417
I know it’ll be hard for you
to abide by my rules.

741
01:04:53,091 --> 01:04:55,222
The abstinence part,
most of all.

742
01:04:57,385 --> 01:04:59,105
So, I’m going to make it
easier for you.

743
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:13,986
Lie still.  I’ve never
done this before.

744
01:05:14,465 --> 01:05:16,278
And, There will be some blood.

745
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,883
- Hi.
- Hi.

746
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:42,931
- What are you doing here?
- On my way to Skelleftea.

747
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:44,428
I can only
stay for four hours.

748
01:06:47,098 --> 01:06:48,400
What’s in Skelleftea?

749
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:51,152
Bible Camp.

750
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,153
Oh, yeah.

751
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:15,949
- I'm not dangerous.
- It’s fine, Nilla.

752
01:07:16,842 --> 01:07:18,808
Whatever you want to do is fine.

753
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:22,168
-  Everybody needssomething.
- Just so long as it’s not God.

754
01:07:22,063 --> 01:07:23,476
I didn’t say that.

755
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:30,887
I’ve never been around enough to know
everything that’s going on with you,

756
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:34,771
and I apologize for that.

757
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:37,434
But I’d never want
you to not tell me something,

758
01:07:37,402 --> 01:07:39,607
B'cos you think
I might not want to hear it.

759
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:41,931
That’s what I’m doing.

760
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:45,971
It really should have been me visiting you.
I’m sorry.

761
01:07:45,915 --> 01:07:48,606
It’s okay.
It was nice seeing you.

762
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:50,955
Bye bye.

763
01:07:51,243 --> 01:07:52,680
- See you.
- Yeah.

764
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:58,817
Don’t go too hard on the Catholics.

765
01:07:58,744 --> 01:08:00,072
What?

766
01:08:00,018 --> 01:08:01,594
The article you’re writing.

767
01:08:01,531 --> 01:08:03,306
I'm not writing an article
about Catholics.

768
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:05,117
The Bible quotes on your desk...

769
01:08:43,637 --> 01:08:48,512
<i>A woman who is a medium
or a sorcerer; shall be put to death, by stoning.</i>

770
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:51,955
<i>If a dove is the sinner’s offering, </i>

771
01:08:51,902 --> 01:08:54,002
<i>the priest shall wring off its head, </i>

772
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:57,170
<i> cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar.</i>

773
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:01,415
Hello.

774
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:03,075
Detective Morell,
it’s Mikael Blomkvist.

775
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:04,647
Yes, Hello.
How are you?

776
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:07,377
Not still freezing in Hedestad,
I hope for your sake.

777
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:10,307
You know, The Rebecka Case
that you mentioned.

778
01:09:10,217 --> 01:09:12,000
Would you recall the last name?

779
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:14,564
Of course I do, but what would it
have to do with anything?

780
01:09:14,491 --> 01:09:18,787
- Nothing probably.
- Jocobsson. Rebecka Jocobsson.

781
01:09:20,142 --> 01:09:21,669
How was she killed?

782
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,156
She was decapitated.
Her arms were cut off and she was burned.

783
01:09:26,004 --> 01:09:28,933
But all this happened in the 1940’s -

784
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:31,844
What have you found?

785
01:09:31,824 --> 01:09:34,643
- I’m gonna have to call you back.
- Why?

786
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:48,288
- Is it Henrik?
- We were talking.

787
01:09:48,253 --> 01:09:50,249
He started rubbing at his arm
an then collapsed.

788
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:51,469
Is he gonna be okay?

789
01:09:51,417 --> 01:09:53,202
I can’t talk, Mikael,
I honestly don't know -

790
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:54,430
- You gotta go.
- I'm sorry.

791
01:09:54,378 --> 01:09:55,823
I'll talk to you later.

792
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,676
Good evening.

793
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,219
Come on up,
How is he?

794
01:10:11,642 --> 01:10:14,575
Well, The good news is he survived.

795
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:16,151
How  he does now,
we have to see.

796
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:18,692
-  He’s in Intensive Care.
- Right.

797
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,131
-  Can I have one of those?
- You want a sandwich?

798
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:25,945
- A small Scotch.
- Sure thing.

799
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,711
Thank you.

800
01:10:31,691 --> 01:10:34,138
I hate to be indelicate. But...

801
01:10:34,072 --> 01:10:37,118
Henrik promised me something
when I agreed to do this.

802
01:10:37,027 --> 01:10:39,534
- Yeah, Wennerström.
- I need to know what he has on him.

803
01:10:40,025 --> 01:10:42,757
- Now.  In case.
- In case he dies?

804
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,759
-  That is indelicate.
- And I apologize.

805
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:48,503
Well, I don’t know what he has on him,
if you’re asking me.

806
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:51,054
And he can’t tell you
in the condition he’s in.

807
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:55,705
We also didn't discussed
who I’d report

808
01:10:55,639 --> 01:10:59,367
- to if something happened to him.
- Who else, You'd report to me.

809
01:10:59,758 --> 01:11:02,580
We both know nothing’s going
to come of this, don't we?

810
01:11:03,664 --> 01:11:06,175
No, we don't know that.

811
01:11:06,106 --> 01:11:07,407
What do you mean?

812
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,471
- I may have found something.
- You're joking?

813
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:12,486
What have you found?

814
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:16,731
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure,

815
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:18,390
I lost me my life savings.

816
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,599
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

817
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:22,807
Yes.

818
01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:25,705
- Do you have one in mind?
- I can find someone.

819
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:28,876
I know a excellent one.  She did the
background check on you.

820
01:11:28,776 --> 01:11:30,213
The what?

821
01:11:30,188 --> 01:11:34,331
You don't think we can hire just anyone
without doing background check?

822
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,967
I want to read it.

823
01:11:37,305 --> 01:11:39,942
Herr Frode was kind enough to share
your report with me.

824
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:42,719
The investigator’s name...
That is her name, yes?

825
01:11:43,723 --> 01:11:47,549
I can find no record of her, and
I’m pretty good at that kind of thing.

826
01:11:47,973 --> 01:11:49,633
Would it really matter?

827
01:11:49,599 --> 01:11:51,141
But It would if I wanted
to speak to her, Yes.

828
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:52,408
It's against policy.

829
01:11:52,387 --> 01:11:55,063
- You sure?
- Just like your sources. You understand.

830
01:11:54,987 --> 01:11:56,289
Okay.

831
01:11:57,277 --> 01:11:58,850
Here's a name for you.

832
01:11:59,718 --> 01:12:02,252
My sister,
she's also my lawyer.

833
01:12:02,182 --> 01:12:04,029
She'll be contacting you.

834
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,797
There’s information in here that
could only have come from one place.

835
01:12:10,803 --> 01:12:13,236
The reason you can find no record
of her is because

836
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,879
her records have been sealed.

837
01:12:14,843 --> 01:12:17,231
-  She’s a ward of the State.
- What does that have to do with anything?

838
01:12:19,094 --> 01:12:20,902
She’s had a rough life.

839
01:12:21,594 --> 01:12:24,763
Can we please,
not make it rougher on her?

840
01:13:32,957 --> 01:13:34,258
Who is it?

841
01:13:34,754 --> 01:13:36,055
Mikael Blomkvist.

842
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,704
- Actually I’m not really up (yet) -
- May I come in? Please.

843
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:51,727
Hi.

844
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:53,771
You and I need to talk.
I got us some break...

845
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,248
I'm sorry, I need...

846
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:58,080
Who do you think you are?

847
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,788
I’m the guy you know
better than my closest friends do.

848
01:14:03,657 --> 01:14:06,396
Why don't you put some
clothes  on and get rid of your girlfriend.

849
01:14:07,118 --> 01:14:08,604
We need to talk.

850
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:20,072
I'm sorry,
You have to go.

851
01:14:20,015 --> 01:14:21,491
Okay.

852
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,433
Do you need me to stay?

853
01:14:39,085 --> 01:14:40,387
No.

854
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:48,089
- Bye.
- Bye.

855
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:56,553
Bye.

856
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:58,113
- Sorry.
- Bye.

857
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:06,198
I guess I alarmed you
turning up like that.

858
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,233
If you touch me,
I’ll more than alarm you.

859
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:10,101
That won’t be necessary.

860
01:15:11,134 --> 01:15:13,516
Your report, very detailed.

861
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:15,536
but for me,
It wasn't very entertaining.

862
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,804
- It wasn’t meant to be.
- When I write about people,

863
01:15:17,742 --> 01:15:19,781
I try to entertain the reader.

864
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:21,646
Wennerström
wasn’t entertained much.

865
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:28,359
Your boss, Armansky...

866
01:15:28,967 --> 01:15:32,523
He tells me, you only work on things
that interest you.

867
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:34,226
So, I suppose..
I should be flattered.

868
01:15:35,549 --> 01:15:36,855
Are you going to sit down?

869
01:15:37,812 --> 01:15:43,088
He also says that
you’re the one he goes to

870
01:15:43,966 --> 01:15:46,222
When the jobs is, ‘sensitive’

871
01:15:46,163 --> 01:15:50,824
I'm gonna use,‘illegal,’ b'cos that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

872
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:53,930
I’m not going to do anything about
that.  I could but I won’t.

873
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:58,345
What I’m going to dois tell you a story.
If it entertains  you,

874
01:15:58,194 --> 01:16:00,372
maybe you’ll
decide to help me research further.

875
01:16:00,317 --> 01:16:03,600
And if not, then I'll do the washing
and you'll never see me again.

876
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,941
What kind of research?

877
01:16:08,893 --> 01:16:11,229
Lisbeth...
Can I call you Lisbeth?

878
01:16:12,764 --> 01:16:15,333
I want you to help me
catch a killer of women.

879
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:18,663
I've got "R. J.",
Rebecka Jacobsson.

880
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:21,823
I have absolutely no idea
who the rest of this people are -

881
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:24,356
or how they’re connected to the death
of a 16 year old girl -

882
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:26,007
they must be somehow.

883
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,150
So, what we're gonna do is find out who
they are? What happened to them?

884
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:32,339
and what the Leviticus verses
have to do with anything?

885
01:16:34,935 --> 01:16:36,236
What are you doing?

886
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:38,256
Getting started.  You can keep
talking if you want.

887
01:16:38,205 --> 01:16:41,756
- Don't you need to look over this?
- I got it.

888
01:17:25,844 --> 01:17:27,146
Cat!

889
01:17:55,982 --> 01:17:57,283
How did you get in?

890
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,199
No one’s asked me about Magda
in over 40 years.

891
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:13,307
Why would a young lady like you want
to know about such an aweful murder?

892
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:15,832
- It interests me.
- Does it ?

893
01:18:18,968 --> 01:18:20,769
Her husband was our first suspect -

894
01:18:20,728 --> 01:18:24,024
the husband is always the first
suspect, and usually the last -

895
01:18:23,923 --> 01:18:25,293
but not this time.

896
01:18:25,271 --> 01:18:28,417
We moved on to a neighbor.
Then a vagrant -

897
01:18:29,295 --> 01:18:31,840
Once you get to strangers,
it’s only a matter of time...

898
01:18:31,769 --> 01:18:35,534
before you get to gypsies,
and you know you’re never going to solve it.

899
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:36,981
How exactly was she killed?

900
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,035
- Miss...
- Salander.

901
01:18:40,008 --> 01:18:42,268
I'm sorry..Miss Salander, I hope,
you don’t mind my asking,

902
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:43,621
when’s the last time you ate?

903
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:45,687
I have a high metabolism.
I can’t put on weight.

904
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:49,885
I'm asking because it’s better to look at
what I’m about to show you

905
01:18:50,753 --> 01:18:52,333
on an empty stomach.

906
01:18:55,479 --> 01:19:00,037
<i>If a man’s offering is a lamb, it
shall be a female without blemish.</i>

907
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:02,886
<i>He shall lay his hand upon it’s head
...slaughter it... </i>

908
01:19:02,797 --> 01:19:05,539
<i>empty it’s blood
on the base of the altar... </i>

909
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,524
<i>and he shall be forgiven.</i>

910
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:13,800
- How is he?
- He needs surgery

911
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,763
but there’s no DNR in place.

912
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:19,079
So it’s up to the family to decide

913
01:19:18,975 --> 01:19:20,443
whether to resuscitate or not,

914
01:19:21,032 --> 01:19:22,978
and they’re not good at decisions.

915
01:19:23,831 --> 01:19:26,099
- How’d it go with Ms. Salander?
- She said yes.

916
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:27,797
Do you think
I might be able to see him?

917
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:29,528
He was asleep when I last looked,

918
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:32,031
- but let me check.
- Thank you.

919
01:19:31,928 --> 01:19:33,245
Don't check.

920
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:36,136
- Tell him to pack his things and leave.
- Mother, please.

921
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:37,826
Don’t use that tone with me.

922
01:19:37,802 --> 01:19:40,352
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.

923
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:42,404
- We should put this to a vote.
- Don’t be an idiot, Birger.

924
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:44,853
We all know what Henrik wants,
Can we please just do that?

925
01:19:44,784 --> 01:19:48,955
Henrik is in there fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.

926
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:51,968
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,
there's nosmoke in here.

927
01:19:54,107 --> 01:19:55,604
Go back to Stockholm.

928
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:58,095
When we need a family chronicle

929
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:01,990
written by a libelist,
we know who to call.

930
01:20:07,598 --> 01:20:08,928
Alright, thanks.

931
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:11,687
This way, Miss.

932
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,679
<i>If a woman approaches any beast
and dies with it.</i>

933
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:22,044
<i>He shall kill the woman and the beast,</i>

934
01:20:21,976 --> 01:20:24,314
<i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>

935
01:20:36,954 --> 01:20:40,231
My family is impossible.
It’s why the company is such a mess.

936
01:20:41,925 --> 01:20:43,941
I apologize for my mother’s behavior.

937
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:45,544
I'm use to it.

938
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:47,926
It has nothing to do with you.
It’s between her and Henrik ...

939
01:20:48,392 --> 01:20:50,459
She lost it when my father died.

940
01:20:50,408 --> 01:20:56,220
Her drinking..it got so bad
Henrik took me and my sister away from her,

941
01:20:56,895 --> 01:21:01,878
And left her excommunicated,
in our old house on the other side of the island

942
01:21:01,707 --> 01:21:03,456
She hasn't forgiven him.

943
01:21:05,381 --> 01:21:06,753
You, you must stay.

944
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,833
You’re last chance that  Henrik has
at some kind of resolution.

945
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:14,476
Put this to rest for him one way of the other,
and I’ll try to keep my mother away.

946
01:21:15,212 --> 01:21:17,611
But, please, hurry.

947
01:21:17,546 --> 01:21:19,361
Of course.

948
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:31,991
Lisbeth?

949
01:21:32,256 --> 01:21:33,747
- I'll get that.
- It's okaya.

950
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,446
- This is Martin Vanger.
- How do you do?

951
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:37,717
Fine.

952
01:21:42,459 --> 01:21:44,462
- Girlfriend or...
- Assistant.

953
01:21:45,502 --> 01:21:46,803
Thank you, so much.

954
01:21:47,173 --> 01:21:48,944
- Good night.
- Good night.

955
01:21:53,506 --> 01:21:54,807
Any trouble finding the place?

956
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:57,063
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.

957
01:21:57,002 --> 01:21:59,988
That’s comforting.  Are you hungry?
Want a sandwich?

958
01:21:59,899 --> 01:22:01,200
No.

959
01:22:02,726 --> 01:22:05,589
- I used to have a motorcycle. A Triumph...
- I know.

960
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:08,726
The five cases from
Harriet’s list.

961
01:22:08,665 --> 01:22:10,379
And five more she missed -

962
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,643
three I’m sure about.

963
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:14,089
Rebecka was the first,
jsut as you thought ...

964
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:16,300
The Second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg
- a prostitute in Kalmar -

965
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:19,211
murdered in 1954.

966
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:21,345
Leviticus 20:8.

967
01:22:21,287 --> 01:22:23,953
<i>"If a man lies with a woman,
having a signatia,</i>

968
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:27,319
<i>made naked as a fountain,
and she has uncovered a fountain of blood."</i>

969
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:29,230
She was raped and stabbed, but the
cause of death

970
01:22:29,147 --> 01:22:31,800
was suffocation with a
sanitary napkin.

971
01:22:31,725 --> 01:22:36,936
R.L.  Rakel Lunde, 1957 -
Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader,

972
01:22:36,756 --> 01:22:39,258
tied up with a clothesline,
gagged, raped, head

973
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:42,173
crushed with a rock.
Leviticus 20:27.

974
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:45,760
<i>“A woman who is a medium or sorcerer
shall be put to death by stoning.”</i>

975
01:22:45,643 --> 01:22:47,804
I usually like to smoke outside.

976
01:22:47,749 --> 01:22:51,224
Sara Witt, 1964.
Daughter of a pastor.

977
01:22:51,116 --> 01:22:53,724
Tied to her bed, raped,
charred in the fire

978
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:56,353
that burned down her house.
Leviticus - 21:9.

979
01:22:57,234 --> 01:22:59,934
<i> “The daughter of any priest who profanes herself
by playing the harlot, profanes her father </i>

980
01:22:59,857 --> 01:23:01,653
<i>and  shall be burned
with (fire) - </i>

981
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:04,042
Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 -

982
01:23:03,976 --> 01:23:06,822
Found in a barn, stabbed and
raped with farm tools.

983
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,917
A cow in the next stall with its throat slit,
its blood splashed on

984
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:10,732
her, hers on it,

985
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:11,976
Levítico 20:16,

986
01:23:11,923 --> 01:23:14,799
<i>“If a woman lies with any beast,
you shall kill the woman and the beast, </i>

987
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:16,171
<i>their blood is upon (them) - "</i>

988
01:23:16,145 --> 01:23:19,761
Lea Persson, 1962. Found by her
sister in their pet shop -

989
01:23:19,648 --> 01:23:20,974
raped, beaten.

990
01:23:20,953 --> 01:23:23,850
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.

991
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,561
There was a parakeet
inside her.

992
01:23:26,124 --> 01:23:29,199
Eva Gustavsson, 1960.
A runaway. Raped,

993
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:30,559
strangled,

994
01:23:30,533 --> 01:23:32,374
a burnt pigeon
tied around her neck.

995
01:23:32,851 --> 01:23:35,734
Lena Anderson, 1967.
a student.

996
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,273
Raped,
stabbed, decapitated -

997
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,166
- Okay...
- I’m not done -

998
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,159
It’s all right, we’re looking for a
serial murderer but...

999
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:44,355
But what does i have to do
with a teenager on an island?

1000
01:23:45,017 --> 01:23:46,786
She was looking for him, too.

1001
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:50,677
Rape.  Torture.  Fire.  Animals.
Religion.

1002
01:23:51,703 --> 01:23:53,377
-  Anything I’m missing?
- The names.

1003
01:23:55,058 --> 01:23:56,359
They’re all Biblical.

1004
01:23:56,307 --> 01:24:00,308
The first woman, the whore,
the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel -

1005
01:24:00,178 --> 01:24:01,925
all from
the Old Testament.

1006
01:24:02,748 --> 01:24:04,408
Which means they’re all Jewish.

1007
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:09,740
If there’s one thing the Vangers have
more than their share of, anti-semites.

1008
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:15,591
There is one.

1009
01:24:18,492 --> 01:24:19,793
I can sleep on a couch.

1010
01:24:21,346 --> 01:24:22,647
Uhm...right.

1011
01:24:25,379 --> 01:24:29,616
There's that the...cash on it.

1012
01:24:29,476 --> 01:24:32,116
Good night.
- Harriet’s name isn’t.

1013
01:24:34,341 --> 01:24:35,642
Isn’t what?

1014
01:24:36,424 --> 01:24:37,771
Jewish.

1015
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,005
- What are you doing here?
- Reading your notes.

1016
01:25:07,957 --> 01:25:10,547
- They’re encrypted.
- Please.

1017
01:25:10,475 --> 01:25:11,840
Have some coffee.

1018
01:25:14,827 --> 01:25:18,140
Okay..And then we’ll have a talk
about what’s yours and what’s mine.

1019
01:25:20,363 --> 01:25:22,847
It’s amazing what you figured out
from the parade photos.

1020
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:24,080
Thank you.

1021
01:25:25,134 --> 01:25:27,747
- Too bad you don’t have hers.
- Whose?

1022
01:25:29,456 --> 01:25:30,757
Her.

1023
01:25:34,821 --> 01:25:36,122
Sorry.

1024
01:25:41,127 --> 01:25:46,166
There's the one.
Where the fuck is that...?

1025
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:53,899
What does that say there ?

1026
01:25:54,758 --> 01:25:58,954
- N, something, R, S, J -
- Norsjo.

1027
01:25:58,816 --> 01:26:02,051
Then something, K,
something, R, I, F,

1028
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:03,253
Carpentry.

1029
01:26:04,348 --> 01:26:06,013
Where do we go for a carpenter.

1030
01:26:08,782 --> 01:26:10,083
Fuck!

1031
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:03,879
The carpentry shop is gone.

1032
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:07,022
I don’t know even know if he worked
there or not. But If he did, maybe he used to

1033
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:09,106
use to come in
here to buy hardware.

1034
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:10,936
I don’t recognize him.
Sorry.

1035
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:13,498
I had to start somewhere.

1036
01:27:14,244 --> 01:27:15,589
I’m no detective, but...

1037
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:20,067
...1966, I would’ve started at
the retirement home.

1038
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,603
- This is Brannlund’s kid.
- Do you know where I might find him, the son?

1039
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:31,976
Next to his father
at the cemetery.

1040
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:36,678
He was killed in an accident on a job
site years ago.

1041
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:44,246
But uh..she might still be alive -
His widow.

1042
01:27:44,578 --> 01:27:46,127
Do you know where I might find her?

1043
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:01,181
In 1966, you were in Hedestad
with your husband.

1044
01:28:03,268 --> 01:28:05,649
- Who took this?
- A local photographer.

1045
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:08,024
You were taking pictures, too.
That day and ..

1046
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:11,117
I'd love to at them, if by some miracle
you still have them.

1047
01:28:11,022 --> 01:28:13,637
It wouldn’t be a miracle.  We were on
our honeymoon.

1048
01:28:13,564 --> 01:28:14,866
But why?

1049
01:28:16,893 --> 01:28:19,503
This, this girl there...I need you
to see it better in an enlargement.

1050
01:28:19,397 --> 01:28:20,699
So that's you there.
Just after this was taken...

1051
01:28:20,646 --> 01:28:23,790
After, she'd seen something
across the street,

1052
01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:24,996
She was murdered.

1053
01:28:27,262 --> 01:28:28,857
How awful!

1054
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:40,860
- There you are.
- Thank  you.

1055
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:01,395
Would you mind
if I made a copy of this?

1056
01:29:01,849 --> 01:29:03,153
No.

1057
01:29:03,952 --> 01:29:07,491
<font color="#3399FF">TECH CLERK:</font>I can’t give you
any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky.

1058
01:29:07,379 --> 01:29:08,984
So call him.

1059
01:29:16,692 --> 01:29:18,717
Next time,
fill out the proper paperwork.

1060
01:29:30,443 --> 01:29:31,925
Which one are you?

1061
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,220
How’s your sex life?

1062
01:29:57,223 --> 01:29:59,432
I didn’t care much
for your last report.

1063
01:29:59,376 --> 01:30:01,907
It's so perfunctory,
like your hearwasn’t in it.

1064
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:05,294
Let’s see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month’s.

1065
01:30:05,203 --> 01:30:06,713
- But...
- Don't speak!

1066
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:08,779
I don’t want to hear your voice.
Just nod.

1067
01:30:08,726 --> 01:30:10,222
Start looking for a shrink
you can bribe, this way..

1068
01:30:10,195 --> 01:30:13,077
under oath, he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

1069
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:16,333
And stop visiting
tattoo removal websites,

1070
01:30:16,672 --> 01:30:17,974
or I’ll do it again -

1071
01:30:19,483 --> 01:30:20,784
right here.

1072
01:33:02,849 --> 01:33:04,497
- Is that  dental floss?
- Yes.

1073
01:33:08,074 --> 01:33:09,550
you sterilize that,
Right?

1074
01:33:13,767 --> 01:33:15,717
Couldn't we just use tape
or something ?

1075
01:33:15,672 --> 01:33:16,973
No.

1076
01:33:18,538 --> 01:33:19,840
What ?

1077
01:33:23,905 --> 01:33:25,514
- Jesus!
- Drink.

1078
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:32,405
- Just, be careful, it’s my eye.
- Don't move.

1079
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,055
You're not a doctor.

1080
01:33:47,573 --> 01:33:48,874
Take off your wet clothes.

1081
01:33:51,939 --> 01:33:53,240
Thank you.

1082
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:59,582
I think it stopped bleeding.
That fucking hurts.

1083
01:34:13,622 --> 01:34:16,884
Fucking madness.

1084
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:26,682
Jesus, That hurts.

1085
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,135
Fuck.

1086
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:36,504
This is insane.
I mean this people...

1087
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:40,720
Somebody was shooting  at me...
It wasn’t an accident...

1088
01:34:40,623 --> 01:34:42,214
No one’s shooting at you now.

1089
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,928
You know, I’m pretty sure
this is a bad idea.

1090
01:34:47,885 --> 01:34:49,218
Why?

1091
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:51,559
Apart from the fact that I’m old and
we work together.

1092
01:34:51,496 --> 01:34:53,761
You work with what’s-her-name.
That’s worked out for you.

1093
01:34:53,702 --> 01:34:56,273
I have some standards,
believe it or not.

1094
01:34:57,777 --> 01:34:59,556
You need to stop talking.

1095
01:35:41,684 --> 01:35:43,214
You want me to open a window?

1096
01:36:09,454 --> 01:36:12,230
- I like working with you.
- I like working with you, too.

1097
01:36:19,245 --> 01:36:20,623
It could have been a stray shot.

1098
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,154
Not that Gunner. If he wanted to
shoot him, It wouldn't have been here.

1099
01:36:23,785 --> 01:36:27,022
And then, we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.

1100
01:36:26,923 --> 01:36:29,094
Or he’s right, Dirch.
What if he is?

1101
01:36:29,732 --> 01:36:31,894
- This has to stop.
- Do you want to stop, Mikael?

1102
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:34,135
I have police reports, photos,

1103
01:36:34,587 --> 01:36:37,133
Henrik’s notes, my own notes,
and Lisbeth’s research.

1104
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:39,645
What I don’t have is
Vanger Industries records.

1105
01:36:39,571 --> 01:36:41,487
- That’s what I want.
- Why?

1106
01:36:41,914 --> 01:36:43,215
Will you authorize it?

1107
01:36:43,162 --> 01:36:45,043
The private corporate records?

1108
01:36:45,378 --> 01:36:46,679
How far back?

1109
01:36:46,626 --> 01:36:48,413
Henrik said I have access to
everything I needed.

1110
01:36:48,341 --> 01:36:50,308
- This is what I need.
- That’s not what he meant.

1111
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:52,572
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement,
if that would help..

1112
01:36:57,217 --> 01:37:00,029
- You think Henrik would say yes.
- That’s why he has me.

1113
01:37:00,599 --> 01:37:03,171
To protect him from himself.
This is insane.

1114
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:07,062
- What do we have to hide?
- After a 120 years of business?

1115
01:37:07,197 --> 01:37:08,562
Probably, a lot.

1116
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:11,252
If this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.

1117
01:37:15,466 --> 01:37:16,786
What am I looking for?

1118
01:37:17,657 --> 01:37:19,869
Any connections between
Vanger Industries -

1119
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,908
and the towns where
the women were killed...

1120
01:37:22,991 --> 01:37:24,706
and everything about Frode.

1121
01:38:15,134 --> 01:38:18,045
Your father was taking pictures
that day no one has seen.

1122
01:38:18,452 --> 01:38:19,754
I'd like to take a look at that.

1123
01:38:20,232 --> 01:38:22,521
- So ask him.
- I was wondering if you could do that?

1124
01:38:22,461 --> 01:38:24,300
I don’t speak to him,
as you know.

1125
01:38:24,258 --> 01:38:26,245
You couldn’t make an exception
in my case.

1126
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:28,866
Are you afraid to be in
the same  room with him?

1127
01:38:28,816 --> 01:38:30,117
I’m not saying you shouldn’t be.

1128
01:38:31,235 --> 01:38:32,537
You won’t help me?

1129
01:38:34,544 --> 01:38:35,875
Sorry.

1130
01:38:41,112 --> 01:38:42,413
Please.

1131
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:44,252
Are you finished?

1132
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:46,855
I need to know where all the factories,
offices and projects were

1133
01:38:46,747 --> 01:38:49,251
from 1949 to 1966.

1134
01:38:49,182 --> 01:38:51,462
- You already have everything.
- No, I don’t.

1135
01:38:51,404 --> 01:38:53,120
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,

1136
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:55,882
- partnerships, or suppliers.
- Then you’ll have to do without.

1137
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:57,764
Mr. Frode said I have access
to whatever I need, and..

1138
01:38:57,717 --> 01:39:00,188
- this is what I need.
- He said you have access to this floor.

1139
01:39:00,585 --> 01:39:01,954
Call Him.

1140
01:39:37,821 --> 01:39:39,122
Thank you, for seeing me.

1141
01:39:41,485 --> 01:39:42,786
Come in.

1142
01:39:44,664 --> 01:39:46,105
- Tea?
- Please.

1143
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:57,288
Sven Olof Lindholm.
Me.

1144
01:39:57,885 --> 01:39:59,187
Handsome.

1145
01:39:59,942 --> 01:40:02,580
Birger Furugard.
Me.

1146
01:40:03,793 --> 01:40:05,215
Per Engdahl.

1147
01:40:05,191 --> 01:40:09,695
But your interest is in my more
candid photographic work.

1148
01:40:09,544 --> 01:40:11,685
Friends,
Relations, that kind of thing.

1149
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:13,780
Please.

1150
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:41,991
- "Blom" ou "Blum"?
- Blomkvist.

1151
01:40:43,805 --> 01:40:45,550
I’m not a recluse.

1152
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:49,917
I don’t close my door to anyone.

1153
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:51,965
They just don’t
visit.

1154
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,148
Perhaps if you redecorated.

1155
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:59,440
Hide the past like they do.

1156
01:40:59,883 --> 01:41:02,191
Under a thin, shiny veneer.

1157
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:03,713
Like an Ikea table..

1158
01:41:03,682 --> 01:41:06,243
I’m the most honest of all of them.

1159
01:41:06,172 --> 01:41:08,977
- The family?
- Sweden.

1160
01:41:19,348 --> 01:41:24,435
Landscape?
Some nice landscapes there.

1161
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:26,800
Who is this there?
The blurry one.

1162
01:41:27,643 --> 01:41:28,944
I can't tell.

1163
01:41:29,957 --> 01:41:33,107
- That’s Gottfried’s boy.
- Martin?

1164
01:41:33,012 --> 01:41:36,010
Handsome but useless young man,
Like his father.

1165
01:41:49,339 --> 01:41:50,649
We’re closing.

1166
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:52,097
Nowhere near finished.

1167
01:41:53,769 --> 01:41:55,423
I'm not authorized to stay late.

1168
01:41:55,356 --> 01:41:56,657
I am.

1169
01:41:56,605 --> 01:41:59,323
And I need access to all the
rooms, including any that are locked.

1170
01:42:02,404 --> 01:42:03,807
Call Frode.

1171
01:42:13,548 --> 01:42:15,343
Leave the keys with the guard.

1172
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:37,370

1927-1965

1180
01:46:16,798 --> 01:46:18,165
Martin?

1181
01:49:28,003 --> 01:49:29,308
Mikael?

1182
01:49:32,336 --> 01:49:33,637
Hi there.

1183
01:49:34,533 --> 01:49:36,119
Your evening stroll?

1184
01:49:36,957 --> 01:49:38,557
That's right, I...

1185
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,616
- How are you?
- Good.

1186
01:49:44,408 --> 01:49:46,680
I stopped at the hospital
on my way home.

1187
01:49:47,535 --> 01:49:49,419
Henrik asked me
to ask you something.

1188
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:50,961
What was that?

1189
01:49:51,914 --> 01:49:54,224
Come on in,
I’ll make you a drink.

1190
01:50:41,043 --> 01:50:42,388
Hello, Martin.

1191
01:50:43,898 --> 01:50:45,804
Shut the door,
It's quite windy.

1192
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,826
- What happened to  you?
- When?

1193
01:50:52,791 --> 01:50:54,092
Just now.

1194
01:50:55,994 --> 01:50:58,248
- I fell in the dark.
- You don't have a flashlight?

1195
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:01,664
- I'll get you one.
- I just wasn't being careful.

1196
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:10,323
How the investigation’s going?

1197
01:51:11,252 --> 01:51:13,206
- Nothing New.  To report..
- No?

1198
01:51:14,012 --> 01:51:18,138
Dirch says, the girl is really clever.

1199
01:51:22,782 --> 01:51:24,101
Maybe, she'll turn something up.

1200
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,175
Maybe.
Thank you.

1201
01:51:33,052 --> 01:51:34,750
- So, What did he say?
- What?

1202
01:51:34,714 --> 01:51:37,110
You said Henrik asked
you to ask me something.

1203
01:51:37,046 --> 01:51:39,335
- Well, I just did.
- What?

1204
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:40,679
How the investigation’s going.

1205
01:51:42,072 --> 01:51:43,374
That was his question.

1206
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,641
Do You hunt?

1207
01:51:52,561 --> 01:51:55,081
- We should go hunting together sometime.
- Sure.

1208
01:51:58,446 --> 01:51:59,786
Nothing at all?

1209
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:03,782
- New.  To report?
- No. Nothing.

1210
01:52:04,246 --> 01:52:06,447
- I can see you’re anxious.
- No.

1211
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,669
I mean, to get home.
After the walk.

1212
01:52:08,609 --> 01:52:10,587
Yeah, Sorry.
I suppose I am.

1213
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,446
To have dinner.
With your girlfriend.

1214
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:14,684
Assistant.

1215
01:52:17,965 --> 01:52:19,930
We’ll have better luck
with a gun.

1216
01:52:19,883 --> 01:52:21,947
- I'm sorry?
- When we go hunting.

1217
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,592
A gun.
Rather than a knife.

1218
01:52:29,773 --> 01:52:31,166
I want to show you something.

1219
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:36,033
Bring your drink.
Leave my knife.

1220
01:52:51,604 --> 01:52:52,906
To the right.

1221
01:52:58,925 --> 01:53:00,987
You know what’s harder than
shooting someone?

1222
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:02,939
Just missing them.

1223
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,114
That was a very good shot
up at the cabin.

1224
01:53:06,145 --> 01:53:08,775
It didn’t work.  I’m here.

1225
01:53:08,701 --> 01:53:12,595
Mikael, it did work.
You’re here.

1226
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:45,004
Inside.

1227
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,219
You spilled your drink.

1228
01:54:35,762 --> 01:54:37,504
Why didn’t you just go home?

1229
01:54:38,212 --> 01:54:39,513
May I?

1230
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:46,030
How’d you do it?

1231
01:54:47,863 --> 01:54:49,184
What did you find?

1232
01:54:52,454 --> 01:54:54,568
We can talk or
we can just get on with it.

1233
01:54:55,462 --> 01:54:59,248
I found a picture
no one had seen before.

1234
01:54:59,813 --> 01:55:01,452
- Of?
- You.

1235
01:55:01,418 --> 01:55:05,028
- In your Uppsala prep school blazer.
- What does that proof?

1236
01:55:04,914 --> 01:55:07,469
It shows that you lied about
where you were that day.

1237
01:55:07,398 --> 01:55:10,033
- Was I?
-  Or rather when.

1238
01:55:09,959 --> 01:55:12,320
So what.
People lie all the time.

1239
01:55:12,257 --> 01:55:16,066
It also said that Lena Andersson
was a schoolmate.

1240
01:55:15,943 --> 01:55:17,244
Lena...

1241
01:55:18,712 --> 01:55:20,473
That was a long time ago.

1242
01:55:22,084 --> 01:55:25,124
Where’s this photo now? Is it with all
the other crap on your desk?

1243
01:55:25,033 --> 01:55:29,906
There's a cope of that on my laptop,
And there's another on a secure website.

1244
01:55:30,758 --> 01:55:32,137
That’s a lie ...

1245
01:55:34,092 --> 01:55:38,639
How much does the girl know?
I hope it’s as much as you.

1246
01:55:38,486 --> 01:55:42,101
That’ll make it more fun.
Where is she?

1247
01:55:41,987 --> 01:55:44,235
Stockholm.
She went this morning.

1248
01:55:44,176 --> 01:55:45,620
And that’s a lie.

1249
01:55:46,138 --> 01:55:49,433
She’s atour offices
looking at more old crap.

1250
01:55:49,332 --> 01:55:52,892
I got a call from our archives manager -
she's very perturbed -

1251
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:57,385
with this girl.  Lisbeth.
I like that name.  Lisbeth.

1252
01:55:58,556 --> 01:56:00,330
So, when Lisbeth leaves

1253
01:56:01,102 --> 01:56:02,687
I’ll get a call from security,
so I can be

1254
01:56:02,655 --> 01:56:05,102
at your cottage
to greet her.

1255
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:10,248
I can’t thank you enough
for bringing her to me.

1256
01:56:10,946 --> 01:56:12,247
Mikael?

1257
01:56:37,676 --> 01:56:39,213
So what would you like to know?

1258
01:56:42,468 --> 01:56:44,491
You’re the journalist,
ask me questions.

1259
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:53,040
What do I do with my girls?
That's a good question.

1260
01:56:53,546 --> 01:56:57,874
Well, before - I do what we’re doing. Sit down,
Relax, have a drink,

1261
01:56:57,730 --> 01:56:59,287
I like that part a lot -

1262
01:56:59,257 --> 01:57:02,657
having a chat when you both know
that one of you is going to die.

1263
01:57:03,578 --> 01:57:06,401
After - I simply get rid of them.
Far out to the sea -

1264
01:57:07,106 --> 01:57:08,520
- unlike my father

1265
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,690
leaving them scattered all over
the place like trophies.

1266
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:13,516
That’s not smart if you ask me.

1267
01:57:13,973 --> 01:57:15,894
But he was a garish and loud man.

1268
01:57:16,461 --> 01:57:18,487
he got what he deserved.

1269
01:57:19,659 --> 01:57:21,647
You can’t be a sloppy technician like that.

1270
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:24,360
You can’t drink to excess
like he did.

1271
01:57:24,299 --> 01:57:26,053
This takes discipline.

1272
01:57:26,595 --> 01:57:29,383
It’s a science of a thousand details.

1273
01:57:29,302 --> 01:57:33,209
The planning. The execution.
The cleanup.

1274
01:57:33,838 --> 01:57:38,492
I’m sure I don’t have to tell you
you’re going to make quite a mess.

1275
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:43,591
Let me ask you something.

1276
01:57:43,549 --> 01:57:45,735
Why don’t people trust their instincts?

1277
01:57:46,999 --> 01:57:50,596
They sense something’s wrong - someone’s
walking too close behind them -

1278
01:57:51,428 --> 01:57:53,837
You  knew something was wrong -

1279
01:57:53,773 --> 01:57:58,329
but you came back into the house.
Did I force you? Did I drag you in? No.

1280
01:57:59,410 --> 01:58:02,709
All I had to do was..
offered you a drink.

1281
01:58:03,467 --> 01:58:05,676
You’d never think the fear of offending
can be stronger

1282
01:58:05,619 --> 01:58:08,622
than the fear of pain -
but you know what?

1283
01:58:08,533 --> 01:58:10,290
It is.

1284
01:58:12,128 --> 01:58:14,396
They always come willingly.

1285
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:17,095
And then they sit here.
They know it’s over like..

1286
01:58:17,015 --> 01:58:18,391
you do - But somehow..

1287
01:58:18,369 --> 01:58:20,998
they still think
they have a chance.

1288
01:58:20,924 --> 01:58:24,872
<i>“Maybe if I say the right thing -
Maybe if I’m polite - </i>

1289
01:58:25,127 --> 01:58:27,185
<i>or I cry and beg - "</i>

1290
01:58:27,862 --> 01:58:30,256
when I see the hope draining
from their face like it is

1291
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:32,048
from yours right now -

1292
01:58:32,571 --> 01:58:33,875
I feel myself...

1293
01:58:35,062 --> 01:58:36,790
getting hard.

1294
01:58:37,821 --> 01:58:40,051
We are not that different,
You and I.

1295
01:58:39,994 --> 01:58:41,676
We both have urges.

1296
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:46,273
Satisfying mine,
requires more towels.

1297
01:59:07,418 --> 01:59:13,107
It might amuse you to know that while you
were upstairs having mousse with me and Liv -

1298
01:59:14,455 --> 01:59:17,565
who, by the way,
finds me very conventional -

1299
01:59:19,012 --> 01:59:21,474
I had Irina was down here
in the cage.

1300
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:23,466
Who’s Irina, you might ask?

1301
01:59:24,103 --> 01:59:25,645
Just another girl.

1302
01:59:26,586 --> 01:59:31,131
Just another immigrant whore.
Who misses them?

1303
01:59:30,979 --> 01:59:33,079
- Your sister wasn’t.
- What?

1304
01:59:33,432 --> 01:59:37,428
Your sister, Harriet,
wasn’t just another girl.

1305
01:59:38,221 --> 01:59:39,522
You found her?

1306
01:59:41,468 --> 01:59:42,769
What happened to her?

1307
01:59:45,299 --> 01:59:47,069
<i>You killed her. </i>

1308
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,154
You useless fuckin detective.

1309
01:59:59,094 --> 02:00:00,444
Is that too tight to talk?

1310
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:03,182
Good.
I’m tired of talking to you.

1311
02:00:39,387 --> 02:00:41,256
I’ve never had a man in
here, before.

1312
02:00:47,312 --> 02:00:50,084
In fact, I’ve never touched a man.
Except my father.

1313
02:00:52,512 --> 02:00:53,814
But it was our duty.

1314
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:56,783
Harriet’s and Mine.

1315
02:01:27,888 --> 02:01:30,330
There's a gun in the television.

1316
02:01:36,759 --> 02:01:38,090
May I kill him?

1317
02:04:40,297 --> 02:04:45,390
How come a 23 years old
can be a ward of the state?

1318
02:04:49,101 --> 02:04:50,804
I’m mentally incompetent

1319
02:04:50,767 --> 02:04:52,834
and can’t manage daily life.

1320
02:04:55,364 --> 02:05:00,375
- Since when have they said that?
- Since I was twelve.

1321
02:05:02,312 --> 02:05:04,159
Something happened
when you were twelve?

1322
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:10,661
I'm sorry,
That's none of my business.

1323
02:05:13,552 --> 02:05:15,233
I tried to kill my father.

1324
02:05:17,435 --> 02:05:22,988
I burned him alive.
Got about 80 percent of him.

1325
02:05:30,405 --> 02:05:31,706
I'll make some coffee.

1326
02:05:36,393 --> 02:05:38,360
- Who is it?
- It's Harriet.

1327
02:05:39,052 --> 02:05:40,630
I found it in Martin's basement.

1328
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:42,776
Among his souverneers.

1329
02:05:43,402 --> 02:05:45,706
Martin didn’t deny killing anyone.

1330
02:05:46,904 --> 02:05:49,767
But when I mentioned Harriet,
he was confused.

1331
02:05:50,247 --> 02:05:53,742
He was angry - at me - b'cos
I couldn't tell him what happened to her.

1332
02:05:54,484 --> 02:05:55,912
He didn’t kill her.

1333
02:05:57,065 --> 02:06:00,163
And his father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.

1334
02:06:01,758 --> 02:06:05,168
What if she did somehow get away?

1335
02:06:06,167 --> 02:06:07,582
And if...

1336
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,295
she's still alive?

1337
02:06:12,626 --> 02:06:16,178
There’s only one person in this family
who would know where she is.

1338
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:44,951
Fuck me, fuck me.

1339
02:07:04,393 --> 02:07:05,694
Your turn.

1340
02:07:06,271 --> 02:07:07,572
Right.

1341
02:07:08,501 --> 02:07:09,802
Yeah.

1342
02:07:26,461 --> 02:07:27,766
Hi.

1343
02:07:27,746 --> 02:07:30,066
-  I'm Sorry to bother you.
- What do you want?

1344
02:07:30,476 --> 02:07:32,456
- No one’s called you?
- About?

1345
02:07:32,408 --> 02:07:34,195
Your cousin, Martin.

1346
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:36,871
What about him?

1347
02:07:37,772 --> 02:07:41,232
He died in a car accidentlast Thursday.
There's going to be a memorial...

1348
02:07:41,124 --> 02:07:43,548
I’m not interested in any memorial.

1349
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:46,825
- I understand.
- What do you understand.?

1350
02:07:46,757 --> 02:07:49,251
That you don’t care
very much of your relatives.

1351
02:07:49,183 --> 02:07:52,083
-  I just, thought you should know.
- Now, I know.

1352
02:08:01,967 --> 02:08:03,268
How’d it go?

1353
02:08:03,566 --> 02:08:06,437
- Okay.  I think.
- She’s on.

1354
02:08:14,549 --> 02:08:16,208
And she's shopping.

1355
02:08:25,965 --> 02:08:28,173
She’s playing solitaire?

1356
02:08:28,116 --> 02:08:29,836
- And she still hasn’t called anyone?
- No.

1357
02:08:30,383 --> 02:08:31,927
Do we have her cell phone, too?

1358
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,814
I was so she’d lead us to her.

1359
02:08:36,183 --> 02:08:37,831
Put your hand back in my shirt.

1360
02:08:41,377 --> 02:08:43,324
There’s only one reason she
hasn’t call Harriet.

1361
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:46,462
She can’t,
because Harriet is dead.

1362
02:08:48,765 --> 02:08:51,320
- I was just thinking.  What if -...
- Just one second.

1363
02:09:05,658 --> 02:09:07,005
What were you going to say?

1364
02:09:08,093 --> 02:09:10,888
I was just thinking, there could be
one other possibility.

1365
02:09:21,487 --> 02:09:23,865
- What is it now?
- Before he died,

1366
02:09:23,801 --> 02:09:25,898
your brother hung me
from a hook ...

1367
02:09:27,999 --> 02:09:29,437
Harriet.

1368
02:09:32,546 --> 02:09:35,640
- So you send the flowers?
- Yes.

1369
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:40,024
We found in the Swedish General Registry,
Annita was married.

1370
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:42,028
But the family never knew,
did they?

1371
02:09:43,112 --> 02:09:47,329
So, I’m guessing she then came here
on a married name passport

1372
02:09:47,190 --> 02:09:48,536
you followed on her
maiden name passport.

1373
02:09:48,515 --> 02:09:51,386
No, Actually, it was the other way around.

1374
02:09:51,302 --> 02:09:55,393
She thought that it safer for me
to travel with Spencer myself.

1375
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:57,550
What did he think about that?

1376
02:09:57,774 --> 02:10:00,306
Nothing.  Only that he loved her.

1377
02:10:01,226 --> 02:10:02,892
She said, If you love me, you’ll do

1378
02:10:02,857 --> 02:10:05,388
this and not ask why.

1379
02:10:05,318 --> 02:10:06,804
He never did.

1380
02:10:06,777 --> 02:10:08,432
And they both died twenty years ago.

1381
02:10:08,398 --> 02:10:09,969
A car accident.

1382
02:10:10,308 --> 02:10:11,732
You found that, too.

1383
02:10:17,336 --> 02:10:18,637
Is that you?

1384
02:10:25,355 --> 02:10:29,202
I was 14 the first time he raped me.

1385
02:10:29,078 --> 02:10:32,472
- Martin?
- No, my father.

1386
02:10:32,367 --> 02:10:35,550
Martin only started,
after he died.

1387
02:10:36,030 --> 02:10:37,546
Why didn’t you tell someone?

1388
02:10:37,518 --> 02:10:39,490
I did.  My mother.

1389
02:10:39,884 --> 02:10:41,243
Henrik would have done something.

1390
02:10:41,221 --> 02:10:45,416
I almost   told him.  But I was afraid
because of what I've done.

1391
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:47,511
I uh...

1392
02:10:47,458 --> 02:10:49,824
You still don’t understand, Do you?

1393
02:10:51,018 --> 02:10:52,733
A year after the first time -

1394
02:10:53,534 --> 02:10:56,913
There were many times
during that year -

1395
02:10:58,615 --> 02:11:01,453
my father got drunker
than usual one night

1396
02:11:03,105 --> 02:11:04,491
and started bragging...

1397
02:11:05,389 --> 02:11:08,306
about women he’d killed.

1398
02:11:08,972 --> 02:11:11,992
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore off my clothes.

1399
02:11:12,692 --> 02:11:15,543
He tiedd a belt around my neck.

1400
02:11:15,755 --> 02:11:17,119
He
wanted to kill  me.

1401
02:11:19,513 --> 02:11:20,883
I uh...

1402
02:11:20,861 --> 02:11:24,125
I made it out of the house and
I went down to the dock.

1403
02:11:24,386 --> 02:11:26,620
He came staggering
after me -

1404
02:11:28,776 --> 02:11:31,309
I could never fight him off
in a small space,

1405
02:11:31,239 --> 02:11:34,022
but out in the open..

1406
02:11:34,342 --> 02:11:36,997
I was strong enough to deal
with an old drunk.

1407
02:11:40,104 --> 02:11:42,178
When it was over...

1408
02:11:43,293 --> 02:11:48,587
I looked up, Martin was standing there -
looking at me.

1409
02:11:49,066 --> 02:11:53,551
All I’d accomplished was
substitute one for another.

1410
02:11:55,910 --> 02:12:00,399
A couple months later, Henrik sent
Martin to school in Uppsala.

1411
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:06,120
And I thought maybe -
just maybe - the nightmare was finally over.

1412
02:12:07,272 --> 02:12:10,252
And then I saw him.

1413
02:12:10,989 --> 02:12:12,481
across the street -

1414
02:12:13,421 --> 02:12:17,092
And I knew..
It would never be over.

1415
02:12:18,043 --> 02:12:19,961
How’d you escaped?

1416
02:12:19,916 --> 02:12:21,366
Annita...

1417
02:12:22,607 --> 02:12:25,037
She insisted that I leave
everything behind.

1418
02:12:25,898 --> 02:12:29,984
If I took anything, the police
might've suspected that I was still alive.

1419
02:12:30,819 --> 02:12:35,829
While everyone was eating dinner,
I was alone 20 meters away from them.

1420
02:12:36,767 --> 02:12:40,374
I spend the night there,
That's when the set-up started.

1421
02:12:41,148 --> 02:12:43,574
In the morning,
she came to get me.

1422
02:12:44,747 --> 02:12:48,786
I'd grown up with that bridge
as my link to home.

1423
02:12:49,064 --> 02:12:53,545
But all I could think is,
If I could just get away for a moment,

1424
02:12:54,632 --> 02:12:56,774
Just get passed the police.

1425
02:12:57,648 --> 02:13:00,374
I might be safe.

1426
02:13:02,616 --> 02:13:06,537
And I was.
Until, you showed up.

1427
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:09,750
You're safe now.

1428
02:13:12,085 --> 02:13:13,654
How did you got away?

1429
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:17,173
Someone saved me too.

1430
02:13:29,627 --> 02:13:31,212
- How're you feeling?
- I'm fine.

1431
02:13:31,148 --> 02:13:32,449
Thank you, Anna.

1432
02:13:34,329 --> 02:13:36,487
I made you a promise.

1433
02:13:38,563 --> 02:13:41,201
Whether you found anything,
or not.

1434
02:13:45,131 --> 02:13:48,346
So, What do you have to tell me?

1435
02:14:17,376 --> 02:14:18,954
Hello, Henrik.

1436
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:39,964
I don’t even remember Wennerstrom
working here, much less

1437
02:14:39,913 --> 02:14:41,726
- being fired.
- How could you?

1438
02:14:41,685 --> 02:14:43,174
It was a long time ago.

1439
02:14:43,147 --> 02:14:47,442
Which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled to start...

1440
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:49,663
If you're referring to
the statued of limitation...

1441
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:52,548
I had no idea, this was what
Henrik was holding out. If I had,

1442
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:56,490
I never would have let him bring you up here.
He wasn’t trying to deceive you.

1443
02:14:56,326 --> 02:14:57,326
Oh, Come on, he knows you can’t try
somebody after 35 years after the event.

1444
02:14:59,121 --> 02:15:01,004
I like Henrik,
but he knows that.

1445
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:03,153
A man’s reputation used to mean
something -

1446
02:15:03,064 --> 02:15:04,365
he still believes that.

1447
02:15:04,313 --> 02:15:07,252
I’m sure he thought you could destroy
Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.

1448
02:15:07,165 --> 02:15:11,734
The “court of public opinion,”
now celebrates people's bad behaviour.

1449
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:14,587
He promised me
Wennerstrom’s carcass on a plate.

1450
02:15:14,498 --> 02:15:17,774
This isn’t even the plate.
I can’t do anything with this.

1451
02:15:17,673 --> 02:15:19,365
Of course...

1452
02:15:23,081 --> 02:15:24,496
What happened with Wennerström?

1453
02:15:25,223 --> 02:15:26,524
How did he get you?

1454
02:15:27,445 --> 02:15:28,747
I was stupid.

1455
02:15:29,689 --> 02:15:32,131
I got something, I got it from
an anonymous source..

1456
02:15:32,065 --> 02:15:34,245
Who I'm sure, was one of
Wennerström's lakies

1457
02:15:36,528 --> 02:15:39,656
Which
he easily proved in court.

1458
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:42,928
You were emphatic that the way I
looked into your life was illegal

1459
02:15:42,871 --> 02:15:44,545
and immoral.

1460
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:46,417
Would you feel the same
about Wennerström?

1461
02:15:46,372 --> 02:15:47,749
Go on.

1462
02:15:48,055 --> 02:15:50,552
I did some work on my own on him,
before you hired me.

1463
02:15:50,451 --> 02:15:51,998
I haven’t had a chance to look at it all -

1464
02:15:51,968 --> 02:15:55,320
B'cos you and Harriet-fucking-Vanger
have kept me busy ...

1465
02:15:57,101 --> 02:16:00,593
-  but I may have something.
- You may have something?

1466
02:16:01,899 --> 02:16:03,200
Maybe.

1467
02:16:03,298 --> 02:16:05,758
They launder money from arms and drug
sales, and

1468
02:16:05,691 --> 02:16:07,392
crime syndicates in Russia.

1469
02:16:07,356 --> 02:16:10,868
And that money - accounts for all
but 5-percent of his holdings -

1470
02:16:10,758 --> 02:16:13,104
the rest ends up in accounts in the
Cayman Islands.

1471
02:16:13,042 --> 02:16:14,472
How do you know this?

1472
02:16:14,416 --> 02:16:15,940
This time you don’t want to know.

1473
02:16:15,878 --> 02:16:17,226
This time I do want to know.

1474
02:16:18,667 --> 02:16:20,335
I have access to his computer,

1475
02:16:20,705 --> 02:16:22,652
and
his accountants’ and lawyers’.

1476
02:16:22,606 --> 02:16:23,928
And how do you have that?

1477
02:16:23,908 --> 02:16:25,740
I could have gotten it from a source
inside the company.

1478
02:16:25,698 --> 02:16:27,389
- But you didn’t.
- But that’s what you’ll say.

1479
02:16:27,354 --> 02:16:28,894
But what will you say to me?

1480
02:16:29,755 --> 02:16:31,387
That depends on
if you really want to know.

1481
02:16:31,354 --> 02:16:33,636
I do. Mikael,
Who gave you access?

1482
02:16:46,076 --> 02:16:48,365
<i>Financial Journalist Mikael Blomkvist -
who this time</i>

1483
02:16:48,305 --> 02:16:51,219
<i> last year was convicted of libel
in a Stockholm courtroom - </i>

1484
02:16:51,134 --> 02:16:54,381
<i>doesn’t seem to have learned
from his mistakes. </i>

1485
02:16:54,661 --> 02:16:56,241
<i> Or maybe he has -</i>

1486
02:16:56,581 --> 02:16:58,806
<i>In the current issue of Millennium
magazine, </i>

1487
02:16:58,748 --> 02:17:02,862
<i>he now charges the same
company that successfully sued him - </i>

1488
02:17:02,727 --> 02:17:04,028
Before the shit hits the fan.

1489
02:17:06,291 --> 02:17:07,592
What happens now?

1490
02:17:08,035 --> 02:17:10,567
He’ll say i'st a personal vendetta
but it won’t work.

1491
02:17:11,221 --> 02:17:13,285
The police will investigate,
FI will investigate.

1492
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:16,347
Maybe we'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.

1493
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:18,391
Do you think?

1494
02:17:18,633 --> 02:17:21,969
Probably, not.
This guys never do.

1495
02:17:33,997 --> 02:17:36,136
- What’s wrong?
- It’s embarrassing.

1496
02:17:36,082 --> 02:17:37,637
Tell me.

1497
02:17:37,607 --> 02:17:39,191
I need to borrow some money.

1498
02:17:39,938 --> 02:17:41,239
50,000.

1499
02:17:43,107 --> 02:17:45,999
I have a chance to make an investment.
It’s a smart, safe investment.

1500
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,617
I really don't think I've got 50,000.

1501
02:17:48,579 --> 02:17:50,229
Yes, you do.

1502
02:17:50,195 --> 02:17:52,343
You have 65 thousand
in your two accounts.

1503
02:17:53,515 --> 02:17:55,007
I’m sorry that I know that.

1504
02:17:57,114 --> 02:17:58,882
You’ll get the money back.
I promise.

1505
02:18:00,161 --> 02:18:03,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

1506
02:18:04,441 --> 02:18:06,153
You want a coffee?

1507
02:18:09,551 --> 02:18:14,123

ones from this so-called journalist - </i>

1533

1534
02:20:16,791 --> 02:20:18,092
Thank you.

1535
02:20:19,849 --> 02:20:22,615
I have a number of accounts at Bank
of Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands.

1536
02:20:22,536 --> 02:20:25,273
I'd like to transfer those accounts
and convert them to bonds.

1537
02:20:25,194 --> 02:20:27,087
Naturally,
you have the clearingcodes.

1538
02:20:27,043 --> 02:20:28,344
Naturally.

1539
02:20:29,452 --> 02:20:31,321
How many accounts
will you be transferring?

1540
02:20:31,278 --> 02:20:32,604
Thirty.

1541
02:20:33,986 --> 02:20:35,288
This will take some time.

1542
02:20:35,268 --> 02:20:37,798
For which you’ll receive
a 4-percent commission.

1543
02:20:37,728 --> 02:20:40,323

- Then it won’t be a waste of it.

1548
02:21:10,254 --> 02:21:13,179
How many of these would you like to
convert for deposit?

1549
02:21:13,093 --> 02:21:14,745
All fifty.
Into five accounts.

1550
02:21:28,926 --> 02:21:30,795
That looks correct.

I quit.

Was it a good investment?

1566
02:23:27,281 --> 02:23:28,672
It was okay.

What are you doing later?

1568

Okay.

I miss our meetings.

1574
02:24:11,494 --> 02:24:13,363
I’m sure you don’t.
Why would you?

1575
02:24:13,839 --> 02:24:15,521
I was always such a headache for you.

1576
02:24:16,667 --> 02:24:19,097
Never showing up with good news.
Only problems.

1577
02:24:20,991 --> 02:24:23,464
I have some good news now.
I’ve made a friend.
