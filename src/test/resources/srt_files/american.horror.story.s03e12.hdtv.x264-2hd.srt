FIONA: <i>Your highest honor
comes at the greatest price.</i>

17
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,907
<i>Death is not uncommon.</i>

18
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,209
<i>And danger...</i>

19
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,963
<i>...inescapable.</i>

20
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:31,999
<i>Attempting the Seven Wonders</i>

21
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:35,002
<i>can get you killed.</i>

22
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,804
But perform them...

23
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,174
and you are the next Supreme.

24
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,726
(laughs)

25
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:43,460
I don't even need
to read your mind

26
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,179
to know what you're doing.

27
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,431
You want us to perform
the Seven Wonders

28
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:48,799
so that you can find
the next Supreme

29
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,434
and then kill her.

30
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:52,270
(laughs)

31
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:55,740
Poor, sweet, dumb,
paranoid girl.

32
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,858
The awful truth is

33
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,327
I am tired.

34
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,477
Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,780
Where's Marie Laveau?

36
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,999
That's not our business.

37
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,817
It's mine.

38
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:09,153
The only other black witch
in this place goes missing,

39
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,538
I want to know what happened.

40
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,990
She's probably off
in some unholy

41
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,342
nether realm.

42
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,928
Cavorting with that half-baked

43
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,213
Beetlejuice.
(laughs)

44
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:22,466
Papa Legaboo-boo,
whatever the hell his name is.

45
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:23,935
Legba!

46
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,853
He's a deity.
Show some respect.

47
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:28,723
(gasping for air)

48
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,508
Respect is something

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,843
that is definitely lacking

50
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:33,945
around here.

51
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:36,230
I will grant you that.

52
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,733
You will show me respect!

53
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,684
Your Supreme

54
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:42,486
until the moment

55
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:44,071
I am replaced.

56
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,457
(gasping)

57
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,213
So rest up,

58
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:54,548
little girl.

59
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,218
Take your vitamin B-12s.

60
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:00,338
(laughs)

61
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,889
Your trials begin

62
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:04,208
Saturday morning.

63
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,928
You will perform
the Seven Wonders.

64
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,713
Or...

65
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:12,016
you will die trying.

66

67
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,553
Madison?

68
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:17,956
I need your help.

69
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,284
Jesus, Cordelia.

70
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:20,684
You look like shit.

71
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,408
I can't believe
you did that to yourself.

72
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:23,528
I've been in Misty's room

73
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:24,922
trying to see something.

74
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,558
I've held her boots,
hair from her brush.

75
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,943
Nothing.

76
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,236
I hate to be the Debbie Downer,

77
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:31,929
but maybe she's gone.

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,981
Or maybe my gift of the
sight hasn't come back.

79
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,919
Whoa! That was cool!

80
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,924
I did transmutation.

81
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,726
I didn't even have
to think about it.

82
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,682
It just happened.

83
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,476
I wouldn't read
too much into it, Madison.

84
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,150
You can manifest multiple powers

85
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,669
without being the Supreme.

86
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:53,288
Our powers always spike

87
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,173
(cane tapping on ground)
in times of crisis.

88
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,376
This is one of those times.

89
00:05:58,427 --> 00:05:59,961
Madison, I need to touch you.

90
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:03,848
Tell the truth, Cordelia.

91
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,250
You into girls now?

92
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,968
The last time I touched you,
I saw things.

93
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,054
What are you afraid
I might see?

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,691
Nothing stays a secret

95
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,609
for very long
in this house, Madison.

96
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,194
It will come to light

97
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:18,980
whether you want it to or not.

98
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:22,033
I don't have any secrets.

99
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,786
Then walk over here.

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,382
Knock yourself out.

101
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,668
Boom, boom.

102
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,102
Aw.

103
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,077
LAVEAU:
<i>That damn</i>

104
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:08,413
<i>buttermilk biscuit!</i>

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,199
<i>Thinks she can take me down.</i>

106
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:12,951
<i>Hell no!</i>

107
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:16,004
<i>I'm the queen--</i>
<i>I will rise again!</i>

108
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:17,372
<i>Mark my words.</i>

109
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,007
<i>My people gonna come for you.</i>

110
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:20,842
<i>Rip you apart.</i>

111
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:22,010
Marie?!

112
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:55,193
<i>Spiritu duce, in me est.</i>

113
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:58,747
<i>Deduc me in tenebris vita.</i>

114
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:00,965
<i>Ad extremum ut</i>

115
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,251
<i>salutaret 'nferi.</i>

116
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:12,894
(gasps)

117
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,402
Descensum.

118
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:29,160
What you doing, girl?

119
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,746
Give me the box of chicken.

120
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,281
Today, please.

121
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:38,169
Listen, watch
the counter for me.

122
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:39,621
I'm going on break, okay?

123
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,341
(distantly):
What am I doing here?

124
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,342
Been asking myself
the same thing

125
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,593
for 20 years.

126
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,095
Just watch the counter.

127
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:10,935
What the hell?

128
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,770
You're Papa Legba.

129
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,289
You live in a chicken shack?

130
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,291
No, darling.

131
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,443
It's not <i>the</i> hell.

132
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:20,795
It's <i>your</i> hell.

133
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,716
This was the worst time
of your life.

134
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:26,918
Waiting on people
who treated you

135
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,970
like the piece of trash
you thought you were.

136
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,121
No power.

137
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,506
No respect.

138
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,092
And no future
that you could see.

139
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:35,560
Just grease in your hair

140
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:38,062
and the smell of lard
in your nose.

141
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,298
Look...

142
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:42,267
I came to talk to you
about Marie Laveau.

143
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:44,235
I was told
you hang out together.

144
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:47,105
She ain't here. There's this
thing about being immortal.

145
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:48,823
Your hell's on Earth.

146
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,108
Hey, dude!

147
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,327
Just order and get out of line!

148
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:54,112
I've been waiting forever
for my chicken!

149
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,614
And you can wait some more!

150
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,666
Don't make me
put you in the fryer.

151
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,002
Now, go to the back of the line!

152
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,791
See?

153
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,710
Everybody got to pay in the end.

154
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:10,828
He gets to smell
the delicious chicken

155
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,847
and never get a bite.

156
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:16,100
Took some skills to come
down here before your time.

157
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:19,504
Most people be afraid
they couldn't get back.

158
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:21,473
Wait! I'm not done with you!

159
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:22,941
It's almost sun up.

160
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:24,842
Unless you want to
stay here forever,

161
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:27,178
you better hurry and get back.

162
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:28,363
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,847
I've been here five minutes.

164
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,566
Time...

165
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,619
moves differently in here.

166
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:37,539
(deep laughter)

167
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:38,523
WOMAN: <i>I want the jumbo
box with butter corn.</i>

168
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:40,658
<i>No wings, no thighs.</i>

169
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:41,909
Give me only breasts and legs.

170
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:43,628
Yo! You listening to me?

171
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,735
I'm talking to you, bitch!

172
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,700
(sniffs)

173
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:51,920
Ah!

174
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:54,222
You made it back.

175
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,540
I'm impressed.

176
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,926
Now that I've proven my power,

177
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,677
you're gonna give me
some answers.

178
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,313
(screaming)

179
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:03,898
You remember how you told me
you were gonna

180
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,233
cut me up in little pieces

181
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:06,651
and plant me all
over the place?

182
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:07,902
(yells)

183
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,554
I thought that was
a honey of an idea.

184
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:10,488
(screams)

185
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:13,908
There's got to be
a way to kill her.

186
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,245
So long as the
voodoo queen live,

187
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,947
so do Madame LaLaurie.

188
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,915
More marshmallows.

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,733
Then you need
to take Marie Laveau

190
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:23,952
out of the equation for me.

191
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,670
Can't do that.

192
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:27,738
Me and Marie Laveau--
we got a deal.

193
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,173
I thought your deal was
that every year

194
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,959
she needs to perform
a service for you.

195
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,344
So it is.

196
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:35,179
Well, she's not gonna
be doing anything

197
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:36,598
while she's chopped
into 50 pieces

198
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,749
and those pieces are scattered
all over the city.

199
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,468
Technically,

200
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:41,919
you can say she's
already in breach, right?

201
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:44,772
You are one crafty witch.

202
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,810
The elegant
and universally admired

203
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,945
Madame Delphine LaLaurie

204
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,930
was not only a brilliant hostess

205
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:56,367
for high society soirées.

206
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:58,486
But she was also renown

207
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,239
for her remarkable
equestrian abilities

208
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,909
and her tireless
charitable works.

209
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,281
Says here she was
a serial killer.

210
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:08,779
That's a misprint.

211
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,715
When do we get to see
the attic torture chamber?

212
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:14,836
That part of the house is
closed off for renovations.

213
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,888
(clicks tongue) Oh, great.

214
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,923
And there is no torture chamber.

215
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:20,892
The attic was used for storage.

216
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,729
And occasionally for the firm,
but humane correction

217
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:26,681
of Madame LaLaurie's domestics.

218
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,266
These wild tales of barbarity
you've heard

219
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:30,301
are nothing more than lies

220
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:32,937
invented by her many enemies.

221
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:34,305
Madame Delphine LaLaurie

222
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,608
was a woman ahead of her time.

223
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,443
A visionary.

224
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,028
Misunderstood.

225
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,363
And hated for it.

226
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,406
This way, please.

227
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,215
What a total rip-off.

228
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,300
Thank you for coming.

229
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:59,835
(traffic sounds, siren wailing)

230
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:02,188
(sighs)

231
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,443
Psst!

232
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,946
Queenie.

233
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,566
How did you find me?

234
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,317
Wasn't hard.

235
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:17,620
You're a cliché, Delphine.

236
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,873
A dog returns to its vomit.

237
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:23,159
I see you finally got
that makeover.

238
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,544
Guess you figured you could
makeover a little history, too.

239
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,079
On the contrary.

240
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:28,697
I'm here to set
the record straight.

241
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:29,832
(laughs)

242
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,366
This historical site was nothing

243
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,636
but a house of lies
before I came back.

244
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:36,839
This very house, the center
of New Orleans high society,

245
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,475
was also a place
of abject horror.

246
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:43,229
Madame Delphine LaLaurie
earned her place in history

247
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,815
alongside such monsters
as Jack the Ripper,

248
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:47,683
Ed Gein and Jeffrey Dahmer.

249
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,652
She even looks like a monster.

250
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,353
The inhuman LaLaurie

251
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:53,272
is said to have murdered as many

252
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:56,442
as 150 slaves right here.

253
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:58,861
Many times while there were
extravagant parties

254
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,831
going on just below,
the sounds of music

255
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:04,566
and revelry drowning out
the cries of torment.

256
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:06,252
Horseshit.

257
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,403
You don't believe it?

258
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,789
Nobody's gonna waste their
time with some uppity Negro

259
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:13,075
and miss a fabulous party.

260
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,376
It beggars all belief.

261
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:15,594
(door opens)

262
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,746
GUIDE:
Thank you for coming.

263
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:19,014
LaLAURIE:
Excuse me?

264
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,299
(door closes)
Yes?

265
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,852
I seem to have mislaid
my pocketbook.

266
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,772
I think I set it down upstairs.

267
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:28,774
I don't see anything.

268
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,226
Are you certain?

269
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,695
By the way,

270
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:36,265
it wasn't any 150 slaves
that died up here.

271
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,933
I can tell you that.

272
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,368
I'm sorry?

273
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:42,288
It was 62.

274
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,606
I kept a ledger.

275
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:46,625
I-I don't understand.

276
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,296
The information you've been
feeding these people?

277
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,797
(clicks tongue)

278
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:54,133
It's inaccurate.

279
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,418
I want my money back.

280
00:14:57,754 --> 00:15:00,289
Do not touch the display items!

281
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,591
Ma'am, I am gonna have
to ask you to leave now.

282
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,678
My own house?

283
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,682
(body thuds)

284
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,273
(woman moans quietly)

285
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:24,496
You have to let this woman go.

286
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,998
What you gonna do?

287
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:29,501
Offer you a second chance.

288
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:31,370
You don't mean it.

289
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:34,506
You will never be able
to pay for your crimes.

290
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,091
But I'm willing to walk you

291
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,799
into the local office
of the Urban League.

292
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,462
You can offer your
services as a volunteer.

293
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,848
You can help the descendants
of the people you brutalized.

294
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,934
(laughs)

295
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:47,853
Are you out of your simple mind?

296
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:50,439
It's your only chance
for redemption.

297
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,224
Redemption?
(laughs)

298
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,693
I know how redemption works
in this century.

299
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:57,512
<i>I seen it all on the magic box.</i>

300
00:15:57,564 --> 00:15:58,480
REPORTER: ...Paula Deen was
asked, "Have you ever used

301
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,732
the 'N' word yourself?"

302
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:01,116
"Yes, of course," she stated.

303
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,851
"But it's been
a really long time."

304
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:05,571
<i>Agree to be publically</i>
<i>humiliated-- all is forgiven.</i>

305
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,706
Last Friday night I tweeted
a photograph of myself

306
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,076
to a woman in Seattle,
and I'm deeply sorry.

307
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,128
<i>People have gotten soft,</i>
<i>weak, lily-livered.</i>

309
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:17,716
<i>say some words...</i>

310
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,501
It's called repentance.

311
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,303
Oh, repentance my ass.

312
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:25,207
You think a man jack among them
was well and truly sorry?

313
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,226
Not a one.

314
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,012
Sorry they got caught is all.

315
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:31,430
Y'all nothing but a pack
of sniveling hypocrites,

316
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,148
as far as I can see.

317
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,984
Not me.

318
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:37,552
I won't profess to be sorry,
'cause I'm not.

319
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:38,937
I don't believe that.

320
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:40,439
I was getting to you before.

321
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:41,690
I know it.

322
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,159
You made me weep.

323
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:47,329
But not as you would have it
for my supposed sins.

324
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,698
I wept for the state

325
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,917
of this world.

326
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:54,286
A world of lies.

327
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:57,589
A world that makes promises
it cannot keep.

328
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,742
To tell a colored man

329
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:04,129
that he can be equal
to a white man?

330
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:06,882
There's the real cruelty.

331
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,534
I'm not going anywhere.
Actually you are.

332
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:10,386
Ow!

333
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:12,388
Straight to hell.

334
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,522
It's impossible!

335
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,641
I'm immortal.

336
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,925
Wrong.

337
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,527
I don't want to die.

338
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:19,561
Tough shit.

339
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,646
Who does?

340
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,564
(grunting)

341
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:38,580
I want my portrait hung

342
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:41,467
just there.

343
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:45,137
Yes, I knew you'd occupy
a prominent place on the wall.

344
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,755
And I didn't want some garish

345
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,391
paint-by-numbers by a local.

346
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,093
That's why I flew
Claude in from London.

347
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:52,461
He's done everyone.

348
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,229
Margaret Thatcher.

349
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:57,232
Sting.

350
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,460
What are you doing back there?

351
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,686
You have to balance the frame.

352
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,905
The negative space makes
you like more drawn.

353
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,189
Claude trusts my taste.

354
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:05,574
Well, I don't.

355
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,490
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,841
Do you need a break?

357
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:23,876
No.

358
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,295
No, I'll be fine.

359
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,597
Just a minute.

360
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,174
<i>Oh, God.</i>

361
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:42,344
<i>This is the face</i>
<i>they'll be stuck with.</i>

362
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:45,147
<i>I probably have two weeks</i>
<i>left on Earth.</i>

363
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,282
<i>So what the hell</i>
<i>am I doing here?</i>

364
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:56,024
(door opens)

365
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,743
CORDELIA:
Goddamn it, Mother.

366
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,379
What's this I hear
about Queenie performing

367
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:01,713
the Seven Wonders on Saturday?

368
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,584
Cordelia, please.

369
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:07,586
Maybe we could

370
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,339
be kind to one another
for a change, huh?

371
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:16,094
My God, look at you.

372
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:19,731
My beautiful little girl.

373
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,683
Oh. (laughs)

374
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:23,652
Did you really think

375
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,939
self-mutilation would
restore your power?

376
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:28,607
Right up until I tried it.

377
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:32,327
You cannot lose your power.

378
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,246
You never will.

379
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,115
It's inside of you.

380
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,401
And it is not something
I gave to you.

381
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:43,205
As much as I'd like to,
I cannot take credit for that.

382
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,507
It's all you.

383
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:52,931
You are just full of surprises,
Fiona Goode, you know that?

384
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:58,420
Well, I have one more.

385
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:00,088
It's from the vault.

386
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,274
(cane taps on ground)

387
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,275
What is it?

388
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:11,450
It was my mother's.

389
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,604
Her most precious heirloom.

390
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:16,771
(laughs)

391
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:19,291
Grandmother's necklace?

392
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,742
Do you remember?

393
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:24,997
Yes. Of course I do.

394
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:29,001
When I was a little girl,

395
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:32,954
I used to gaze up at her
wearing this necklace.

396
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:36,808
Thinking to myself I
will never grow to be

397
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,311
so transcendent.

398
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,147
Oh, I know the feeling well.

399
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,850
Here, take it.

400
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,354
You're saying good-bye?

401
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,143
Yes, I am.
Hmm.

402
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,446
And I mean it this time.

403
00:20:57,497 --> 00:21:00,282
We both knew it was coming.

404
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,783
Here.

405
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,153
Lift your hair.

406
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:06,788
I want to put it on you.

407
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,691
(distant screams)

408
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,531
(slow footfalls)

409
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,486
(echoing screams)

410
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:46,828
(slow footfalls)

411
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:59,841
(liquid dripping)

412
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:02,144
(footfalls)

413
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,576
(footfalls)

414
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,377
What's the matter?

415
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,581
Nothing.

416
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:41,416
I'm fine.

417
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,684
I just...

418
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:47,589
Wasn't there a ring...

419
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,476
that Grandmother used
to wear with this?

420
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:54,112
I feel so selfish asking.

421
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,115
(chuckles)

422
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,818
Well...

423
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:02,371
if not now, when, huh?

424
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,489
Right.

425
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:05,741
(door creaks)

426
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:11,079
AXEMAN: Just because you
witches can open the locks

427
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,498
with your hocus-pocus...

428
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,052
...it doesn't make it polite.

429
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,424
A man shouldn't be disturbed

430
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,342
when he's playing
with his instrument.

431
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:29,765
You don't have your
mother's features.

432
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:31,650
Oh, you know who I am?

433
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:32,967
Oh, yes, of course.

434
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,903
We spent quite an evening
together.

435
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:41,827
It's not safe to love
my mother, you know.

436
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,812
I speak from experience.

437
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:46,364
She can't love anyone
but herself.

438
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:57,509
I'm sure the transcendence
of my relationship

439
00:23:57,593 --> 00:24:00,212
with your mother is hard for you
to understand.

440
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:04,466
But I'm happy that
she told you about us.

441
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,835
She didn't tell me anything.

442
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:10,522
I saw everything.

443
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:11,840
(whispers):
<i>Everything.</i>

444
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:14,526
And she's gonna kill all of us

445
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,111
and leave you behind, too.

446
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:26,071
Unzip me.

447
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:27,739
AXEMAN:
<i>Sitting on a porch</i>

448
00:24:27,824 --> 00:24:29,624

CORDELIA: <i>She's not going

<i>it's all bullshit.</i>

452
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:56,401
She used you.

453
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:59,387
All she does is use people.

454
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:00,605
It's nothing.

455
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,073
It's just a piece of paper.

456
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:03,892
It's as... as light as air.

457
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:05,660
That flight leaves in two days.

458
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:07,562
You think she might have
let you know

459
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:09,053
that you were leaving town
that soon.

460
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,832
I don't suspect you have
a passport ready.

461
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,501
She's going
to regain her power,

462
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:16,421
and when she does, she's not
going to waste her time

463
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,740
on some halfway decent musician

464

in a $12 suit.

465
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,434
You feel that?

466
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:33,722
That empty...

467
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,473
heartbroken feeling?

468
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:38,860
That's what it feels like
to get close to Fiona.

When the rest of the world

we see a window.

00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:49,489
through your nostrils.

503
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:53,159
I wouldn't sniff around

504
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:56,112
unless you're looking
for a bout of delirium.

505
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,331
Sounds like every Saturday night
since I was 15.

506
00:27:58,398 --> 00:27:59,749
Where is everybody?

507
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,335
Our beloved Cordelia
has regained her second sight.

508
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:06,372
She's off with Queenie
to try and rescue Misty Day.

509
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:10,343
Apparently, the poor girl
has been entombed.

510
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,128
Who would have been
cruel enough

511
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,515
to commit such an atrocity?

512
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:18,751
I have no idea.

513
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,471
I just hope
they get to her in time.

514
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:24,607
I heard people die
after three days without water.

515
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,541
Please tell me
this is a hallucination

516
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:30,813
driven by my bouquet
of <i>Atropa belladonna.</i>

517
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:34,433
Zoe, you can't possibly be
back at the Robichaux Academy.

518
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,235
I won't allow it.

519
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:39,739
You were supposed to spend
your days in romantic splendor

520
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,040
with your true love.

521
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:42,125
You're just like Halston

522
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:44,911
when he sold his brand
to J.C. Penney.

523
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:46,579
You've forsaken your destiny.

524
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,831
No, Myrtle, I've embraced it.

525
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,752
<i>We made it to Florida.</i>

526
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:55,254
<i>What better than</i>
<i>the Sunshine State</i>

527
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:57,473
<i>to cast the darkness</i>
<i>out of our lives?</i>

528
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:59,425
(both chuckle)

529
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:00,893
You bit it off.

530
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:03,146
(both laugh)
Hey, you're in my spot!

531
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:06,849
Get out of here!

532
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:08,818
I want to sleep!
We're leaving.

533
00:29:08,902 --> 00:29:11,437
You, don't talk to me!

534
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,272
Don't talk to me!

535
00:29:17,194 --> 00:29:18,644
Kyle, no!

536
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:20,312
(neck cracks)

537
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:21,614
MADISON:
<i>What a surprise.</i>

538
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:23,499
Your pit bull mauled somebody.

539
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,001
Is that why you came back,

540
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:27,120
because you can't handle him?

541
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:28,704
No.

542
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:31,657
I came back because
there's no escaping what I am.

543
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:35,128
<i>Vitalum vitalis.</i>

544
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,047
(man coughs)

545
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:43,970
<i>I came back</i>

546
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:46,305
because I'm clearly
the next Supreme.

547
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:48,191
(Madison scoffs)

548
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,308
You bitch.

549
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:52,678
Oh!
You thought I was some dumb swamp rat

550
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:54,147
you could leave behind to die?

551
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:55,181
Um, yes.
(laughs)

552
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:56,649
Oh!

553
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,818
Girls, stop these
vulgar fisticuffs at once.

554
00:29:58,869 --> 00:29:59,902
It's beneath us.

555
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,072
MYRTLE: Cordelia?
I'm good.

556
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:04,373
I don't want to waste
my magic on you.

557
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,374
I can do you with my hands.

558
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,860
(Madison screams)

559
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:10,079
You hit like a girl!

560
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:12,498
(grunting, yelling)

561
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,202
(groans)

562
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,753
This is awesome!

563
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:19,589
No, it's not. Stop!

564
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:21,507
Come on. Get up, Hollywood.

565
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:26,929
(grunts)
(yells)

566
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:30,683
(grunting)

567
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:33,236
(shrieks)

568
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:39,909
(gasps)

569
00:30:43,247 --> 00:30:45,114
Ow!

570
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:50,336
(both scream) Enough!

571
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:53,372
You! You must pay
for what you've done!

572
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:55,007
Wow, did you walk
into the wrong house.

573
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:56,292
(yells)

574
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,543
(yelling)

575
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:01,013
Who the hell is this guy?

576
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,414
CORDELIA:
I know that voice.

577
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,267
It's the Axeman.

578
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,886
I thought you banished his soul
to the appropriate

579
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,521
nether realms?

580
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:11,390
CORDELIA: No, he's
on the mortal coil.

581
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,758
I'll kill all of you!

582
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:13,859
Is that blood?

583
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:15,111
Not his.

584
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:16,145
Then whose?

585
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,492
How could you do this to me?

586
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:35,021
This blood is my mother's.

587
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,983
(door closes in distance,
footfalls)

588
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,237
(door creaks open)

589
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,693
(chuckles) It's quiet.

590
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:00,128
I don't remember the last time

591
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,880
I was here when there wasn't
music playing.

592
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,168
You pack your wader boots?

593
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,087
What?

594
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,038
'Cause I want
to take you fishing.

595
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,558
(chuckles) Fishing.

596
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,393
Yeah. Yeah, fishing.

597
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,095
For catfish.

598
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:18,312
Catfish.
Mm-hmm.

599
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,731
Yeah.

600
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,349
When you fry them,

601
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,185
the batter, it has to be
crunchy, never greasy.

602
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,270
I don't like catfish.

603
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:29,323
I loathe all
bottom-feeders.

604
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,359
Well, then I'll take
you boar hunting.

605
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,061
While you're sitting on a porch

606
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:35,413
drinking gin rickeys, huh?

607
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,914
Gin rickeys.
(giggles)

608
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,002
Unzip me.

609
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:48,760
Your daughter...
she paid me a visit.

610
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:50,962
Oh...

611
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:52,580
Please tell me
she's in the bathtub.

612
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:54,748
(short laugh)

613
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,884
She's pretty, but she doesn't
have your cheekbones.

614
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:01,222
She came, I guess, to...

615
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,890
to rile me up.

616
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,526
I imagine she wanted me
to do her dirty work for her.

617
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:07,478
What is the world
coming to, huh,

618
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:10,231
when the Supreme's
daughter... (laughs)

619
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:13,601
...has to outsource
her own killings?

620
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:15,953
(exhales)

621
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:20,274
We had a deal.

622
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:22,776
It wasn't on paper...

623
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:24,462
it wasn't stamped by a notary,

624
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,497
but we had a deal!
(slams glass down on counter)

625
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:29,750
And what, Cordelia has
convinced you otherwise?

626
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:51,272
Why do they insist on always
putting me in seat 1A?

627
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:57,945
Well, I guess the cat
is out of the bag, huh?

628
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:59,914
I mean, I was gonna tell you.

629
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:07,455
You have been the most
delightful distraction.

630
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,657
A life preserver.

631
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,876
But I'm gonna be
on dry land soon.

632
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,879
Can't you at least pretend?

633
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:17,548
Just... just humor
me for a while?

634
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:26,307
I guess I loved you.

635
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,309
Huh.

636
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,177
Although I really don't know

637
00:34:30,229 --> 00:34:32,113
anything about love,

638
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,398
if I'm gonna be honest.

639
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:43,708
But you were the
sweetest of lovers.

640
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,159
(chuckles)

641
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,378
The best I ever had.

642
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,965
And I'll miss that.

643
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,389
Let's be realistic.

644
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,545
When the new Supreme is dead,

645
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:08,549
I'll have 30 years of vitality

646
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,152
until another one comes along.

647
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:13,053
And the doors of every palace

648
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:15,273
are going to open for me.

649
00:35:15,357 --> 00:35:17,057
I mean, hell,

650
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:19,193
I know you've got
all this to offer,

651
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,245
but come on,
you and I both knew

652
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,031
that this
would never... Ah!

653
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:25,333
(grunting) Son of a...

654
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,034
Let go of me!

655
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,036
I love you!
Oh, Jesus...

656
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,338
I know you love me!

657
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,673
I don't!
Christ, I was sick!

658
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,592
I just needed
to feel something.

659
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,093
That was all!

660
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:38,379
Ah. Shit.

661
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,880
Ah...

662
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:42,934
(breathing hard)

663
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:46,587
I made you die
those little deaths

664
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:49,056
for the first time
in your sorry life.

665
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:53,945
I made you sing

666
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,365
when you had no tunes
left in you.

667
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,269
Get off of me!

668
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:04,655
Get off of me, get off of me,

669
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,241
you son of a bitch!

670
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,376
No!

671
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:12,330
Christ.

672
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,081
No tears, old boy.

673
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,716
Huh?

674
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,918
What you're doing is a
crime against humanity.

675
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:21,922
A betrayal...

676
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:23,791
of the true heart of love.

677
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:27,011
Well, I've never been
one for love,

678
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:28,763
true or otherwise.

679
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,231
(panting)

680
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:32,800
I live in a floating world,
you know?

681
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:35,686
Always...
(panting)

682
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,489
...two steps ahead
of heartbreak.

683
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:43,361
(laughs)

684
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:49,367
When I was eight years old...

685
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,318
my mother brought me
a little calico cat.

686
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,454
(gasps)

687
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,672
(grunting)

688
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,296
(Axeman's grunts echo)

689
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:11,439
MADISON:
Holy shit.

690
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:12,556
So she's really gone.

691
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:15,819
Does anyone feel any different?

692
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:18,562
Where's the body?
In the swamps.

693
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,865
He fed her to the alligators.

694
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,519
Jesus.
MISTY: Well, that's it, then.

695
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:29,073
Even I can't bring somebody back

696
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:30,658
once they're gator shit.

697
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,376
Okay.

698
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,046
So who wants to do this?

699
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,798
Somebody's got
to kill this creep.

700
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:40,084
MYRTLE: Oh, bloody-blood-blood
all day in this place.

701
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,202
Is that really necessary?

702
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:43,587
Yeah.

703
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:45,172
He's a psycho mass murderer.

704
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:47,263
Is there anyone here of whom
that could not be said?

705
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:49,543
This poor troubled soul

706
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:50,978
has saved this coven
by doing away with Fiona.

707
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:53,046
And as Cervantes once said,

708
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:55,549
"Where there is music,
there can be no evil."

709
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,485
Cervantes never
meant this asshole.

710
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,521
Come on.
(grunting)

711
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,740
Come on.
(Axeman grunting)

712
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,775
I'm coven guard dog.
I'll kill him.

713
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,694
No.
I'll do it.

714
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,779
(Axeman grunting)

715
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:10,531
(grunts)

716
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,754
We really don't need a man
to protect us.

717
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,582
(grunting, screams)

718
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:29,850
Nobody messes with our coven!

719
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:39,894
LaLAURIE:
Please, no!

720
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,228
(screams)

721
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,780
Let me go!

722
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:43,981
No!

723
00:38:44,065 --> 00:38:47,601
(sobbing):
Wait, please...

724
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:48,903
No...

725
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,771
(LaLaurie screams)

726
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:52,606
God, why this?

727
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:54,458
BORQUITA:
Mother?

728
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:01,799
Borquita, my sweet child.

729
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:05,219
I know I mistreated you
in the past...

730
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,808
...but there's
no greater pain...

731
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:13,177
(man screams in distance)

732
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:14,562
...than being this close

733
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:16,313
and not...
not being

734
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,766
able to reach you.

735
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,568
And to comfort you.

736
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:23,470
Oh, I'm... consumed with regret.

737
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:26,640
BORQUITA: Why are they
doing this to us?

738
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:28,359
Because we can.

739
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:36,283
Behold the kingdom
of the family LaLaurie!

740
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:39,119
BORQUITA:
Please...

741
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,788
I'm so thirsty.

742
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,673
Please have mercy.

743
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,491
LaLAURIE: Give her
something to drink,

744
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:46,177
you animal!

745
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,511
(groans)

746
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:52,183
(sobbing)

747
00:39:57,472 --> 00:40:00,024
Mm...

748
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,610
No, no...

749
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:04,645
(Borquita chokes)
LAVEAU: Are you hungry, too?

750
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:07,565
I'll slice off one of
your mama's fingers

751
00:40:07,649 --> 00:40:09,116
and feed it to you!
(gasps)

752
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:11,485
LaLAURIE:
You monster.

753
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:14,655
Yes, I have sinned.

754
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,991
I gave no quarter.

755
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,411
But torturing a mama's babies
in front of her?

756
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:23,080
Even when I killed

757
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:24,498
that little
high yellah bastard,

758
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:28,135
I spared his mammy
from seein' it.

759
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:30,137
Oh, please, no.

760
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:32,372
Have mercy on my soul!

761
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:34,174
This ain't for you!

762
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,509
But I will let you choose

763
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,178
whether I slide
it down her throat

764
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,064
or up her backside.

765
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:41,482
No, please!
Mother!

766
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:42,766
No! (screams)
LaLAURIE: Oh, no!

767
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:45,019
(Borquita and LaLaurie
screaming)

768
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,188
LaLAURIE: Oh, God,
please, not my baby.

769
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,691
How did I get here?

770
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,871
No, no, no, no.
I don't want to do that.

771
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:58,065
That girl ain't never done
nothing to me.

772
00:40:58,116 --> 00:40:59,583
I don't want to do this!

773
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,086
You will do as you are tasked.

774
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,704
It is your soul's purpose,

775
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,256
because I own it.

776
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,174
Who is this man?

777
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:10,077
What is this place?

778
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:13,681
Congratulations,
Madame Delphine LaLaurie.

779
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:16,884
You have been granted
your sweet release

780
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,019
from the world of the mortal.

781
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:21,272
And as punishment
for your crimes

782
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,556
of murder, torture,

783
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,141
passion, fashion

784
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,926
and being an
all-around no-good

785
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:28,279
miserable bitch, you...

786
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:31,098
will spend all
of eternity here...

787
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,983
in my home.

788
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:35,619
It is <i>my</i> home.

789
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:38,438
No... it's mine.

790
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,041
Welcome to hell.

791
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:42,076
LAVEAU:
No, that can't be true.

792
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,627
I can't die!

793
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:44,995
We have a contract!

794
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,465
One you can no longer fulfill.

795
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,830
LAVEAU: But I was
good to people.

796
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:52,720
I protected so many.

797
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:54,004
PAPA LEGBA:
How many little babies

798
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:55,455
did you bring to me every year?

799
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:57,641
No one gets away with sin.

800
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,727
(chuckles)

801
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,600
Eventually...

802
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,519
everybody pays.

803
00:42:10,138 --> 00:42:11,805
(man screams distantly)

804
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,691
Everybody suffers.

805
00:42:25,153 --> 00:42:27,371
Now get back to work.

806
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:32,042
(laughing)

807
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,011
BORQUITA: No! Please!
Mother! No!

808
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:36,163
(screams)

809
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:37,548
(Papa Legba laughing)
(Borquita screaming)

810
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:39,016
(screams)

811
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,934
(fire crackling)

812
00:42:45,724 --> 00:42:47,029
CORDELIA:
How does she look?

813
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:48,482
MYRTLE:
Magnificent.

814
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,651
I wish you could see it.

815
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:55,379
I can.

816
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:57,541
I can see it through you.

817
00:42:57,626 --> 00:43:00,094
She was so beautiful.

818
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,595
ZOE: She was a great Supreme.

819
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,381
QUEENIE:
A lot to live up to.

820
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:05,633
(sighs) One of the best.

821
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:10,104
She was a force
to be reckoned with,

822
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,606
but she was a horrible Supreme.

823
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,392
She shirked all of
her responsibility,

824
00:43:14,476 --> 00:43:16,394
including the most important:

825
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:17,945
identifying her successor.

826
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,613
So it will be up to us

827
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,232
to find our new leader.

828
00:43:21,316 --> 00:43:24,151
And the only way is through
the test of Seven Wonders.

829
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,237
And since it could
be any one of you,

830
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:27,988
you will all be tested.

831
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,624
The Seven Wonders.

832
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,828
