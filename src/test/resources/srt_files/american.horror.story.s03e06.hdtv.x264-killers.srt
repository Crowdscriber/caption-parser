AXEMAN AND WOMAN:
<i>"on next Tuesday night,</i>

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,366
"I'm going to pass
over New Orleans.

38
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,067
"In my infinite mercy,

39
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,504
"I am going to make a little
proposition to the people.

00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,806
"Here it is.

41
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,708
(woman's voice only):
"I am very fond of jazz music,

42
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,711
"and I swear by all the devils
in the nether regions

43
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:56,879
"that every person
shall be spared

44
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:59,816

is in full swing

45

at the time
I have just mentioned."

46
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,719
This is an outrage.

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,340
This madman
is holding our city hostage

48
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:05,789
to his twisted whim.

49
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:08,758
Millie, do you think playing
the Victrola will suffice?

50
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:11,528
Come Tuesday evening,
a jazz ensemble in New Orleans

51
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,530
will be more precious
than the Hope Diamond.

52
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:16,098
We can choose jazz songs from
my collection of phonographs.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,101
Why should we do anything
to appease this Axeman?

54
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:21,438
Because he kills
women with an axe.

55
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,207
Do I have to remind you?
He says, "One thing is certain

56
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:26,776
"and that is some of those
persons who do not jazz it

57
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,246
on Tuesday night
will get the axe."

58
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:32,382
His prose could use refinement
but we get the point.

59
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,717
If we don't play jazz
music Tuesday night...

60
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:37,620
We're inviting an attack-- it
could not be more clear, Sister.

61
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:40,623
The real question is,
what are we to do?

62
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,794
Ladies, we have been docile
too long.

63
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:46,296
We are powerful,

64
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:48,698
even though none of you
have yet to believe it.

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,967
Not only are we descendents
of Salem

66
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,702
but we are suffragettes.

67
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,338
We're on the verge of
our greatest victory,

68
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,907
giving us the equal right
to vote.

69
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,977
If we embody our feminine might,

70
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:03,480
intelligence with grace,

71
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,482
strength with an iron will,

72
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,418
no man can make us cower
in our home.

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,988
I'm off in a half hour, Joe.

74
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,791
Can you... walk me home?

75
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,293
You scared of the Axeman?

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,594
Everyone is scared.

77
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,995
It's Tuesday night.

78
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,363
He's gonna kill somebody.

79
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,132
Well, he's not gonna lay
a finger on you.

80
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,633
Rumor has it

81
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,668
he's got a thing for jazz,

82
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:30,140
and you've got, uh,
rhythm in your soul, baby.

ZOE:
<i>A hundred years ago,</i>

109
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:44,373
this academy was packed
to capacity. They had bunk beds

110
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,022
and slept eight to a room.
Now...

111
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,850
notice anything?
Yeah.

112
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:50,051
Luke's not here.

113
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,787
His mom keeps slamming
the door on me.

114
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,656
Nan, stay with me.
Look at the pictures.

115
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:58,661
Our numbers have gone down every
year for a century straight.

116
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,172
Witches are dying.

117
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,208
In Salem, there were
hundreds of us.

118
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,310
Now there's three.
Used to be four, until...

119
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,679
Madison went missing or dead.

120
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,948
And no one in charge
has done shit.

121
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,383
We'll go to Fiona.

122
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,352
Last I checked,
she was setting witches on fire.

123
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,260
Okay.

124
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,295
Madison wants us to find her,

125
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:20,264
and we can't afford
to lose a single witch

126
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:21,531
if we want to survive.

127
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:31,141
From now on...

128
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:33,077
we watch each other's backs.

129
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,447
Look, I've been taking care
of myself

130
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,683
for a really long time,
so I'm not sure

131
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,986
I need some white
girl sorority sisters

132
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,220
to cover my ass.

133
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:45,222
And what is this green shit?

134
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,190
It's not a sorority.

135
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,091
It's a coven.

136
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:48,125
And this is absinthe,

137
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:49,726
drink of the divine.

138
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:50,995

Where'd you find
the spirit board?

00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,479
More like it found me.

142
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:10,981
Do you know
what these things do?

143
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,216
Contact the dead.

144
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,150
You don't know shit.

145
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,284
Spirit boards have

146
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,686
two stages: contact and release.

147
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,322
I saw my grandma use one once.

148
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,158
She thought it was cool,
too, till a bad spirit

149
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:23,660
came out, burned her house
to the ground and took

150
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,262
half her face off with it.

151
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,363
There's three of us.

152
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:27,631
You want to find Madison?

153
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:29,599
Witch up.

154
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:30,600
So, what do we do?

155
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:37,307
Ask the questions.

156
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,309
Be polite.

157
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,511
(exhales)

158
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,314
Are we alone?

159
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:57,528
Did you die here?

160
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,602
Were you murdered?

161
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:10,040
Yes.

162
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,575
Who killed you?

163
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:23,554
"You did."

164
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,132
Madison, is this you?

165
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,196
Who are you?

166
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:39,069
Axeman.

167
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:42,272
Wait, stop. Stop, stop!

168
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,408
If survival is
so important to you,

169
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,210
you better find out
who you're talking to.

170
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:52,416
NURSE (over P.A.):
Oncology.

171
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:55,386
Paging palliative services,
extension 3609.

172
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:57,787
Oncology, we're paging
palliative services...

173
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:01,891
MAN:
<i>It's all bullshit.</i>

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,927
<i>Punch a clock.</i>

175
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,528
<i>Scrimp and save?</i>

176
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,896
<i>And for what?</i>

177
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:08,298
<i>I'm taking my sick leave</i>
<i>in Vegas.</i>

178
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,135
<i>Time to play.</i>

179
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:14,138
FIONA: <i>Never had the gift
of mind-reading before.</i>

180
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,740
<i>Is it the medication?</i>

181
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:20,277
WOMAN: <i>It took her so long
to find the right man.</i>

182
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:22,279
<i>Lord, please!</i>

183
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:24,448
<i>Don't let me spoil</i>
<i>my baby's special day.</i>

184
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,050
<i>Just let me walk down</i>
<i>the aisle.</i>

185
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,918
WOMAN 2:
<i>Nothing was ever good enough.</i>

186
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:31,055
WOMAN 1: <i>And I swear, Heavenly
Father, that very night...</i>

187
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,089
WOMAN 2: <i>I picked him
apart every chance I got.</i>

188
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:35,526
WOMAN 1:
<i>...my soul is yours to keep.</i>

189
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:38,862
WOMAN 2: <i>And here he is, week
after week, holding my hand,</i>

190
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,297
<i>cleaning up my vomit.</i>

191
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:42,932
(soft groan, grunts loudly)

192
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:45,402
(whimpers)

193
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:47,204
MAN:
Ms. Goode?

194
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,505
You haven't finished
your treatment yet.

195
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,174
I got to get out of here.

196
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,977
I can't stand it.
It's so noisy.

197
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,411
That'll go away soon.

198
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,313
I put a sedative in your I.V.
to quell your nerves.

199
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,948
But you're doing great,
and you're almost finished.

200
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,984
No, don't patronize me.

201
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,385
I never wanted to be here.

202
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:05,189
Please take a seat
and finish your treatment?

203
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,424
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

204
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:11,095
(panting)

205
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,965
My daughter needs me

206
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,766
as she's never
needed me before.

207
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,202
(sniffles)

208
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,204
I'm doing this for her.

209
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,439
Not... for me.

210
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,408
You understand?
If I do everything

211
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:26,977
you people tell me to...

212
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,179
I'll beat this thing, right?

213
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,216
We've chosen a very aggressive
form of treatment,

214
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,084
and we always hope
for the best.

215
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:35,452
Yeah. So,

216
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,922
when am I gonna lose my hair?
You may not.

217
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:40,024
Everyone responds differently
to the medication.

218
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:43,027
There.

219
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,563
Ugh.

220
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,165
I'm just not...

221
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:53,103
I'm just not ready
to go quite yet.

222
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:55,005
I want one more

223
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:57,241
great love affair in my life.

224
00:13:57,243 --> 00:14:01,579
Now I think what I
really want is just

225
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:04,214
to belong to somebody.

226
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:06,716
It's not too late
for that, is it?

227
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,586
No.

228
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,420
My mom met someone on eHarmony,

229
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:13,257
and they just went
on a cruise to Nova Scotia.

230
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:19,229
Hmm.

231
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:25,669
You're gonna make it
to your daughter's wedding,

232
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:27,404
so you should

233
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,708
go out and buy yourself
a great dress.

234
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:35,112
Blow the bank on it.

235
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:38,682
Is there anyone
that doesn't have a fan site?

236
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,084
(character shrieks)
NAN: I don't.

237
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,086
Did you find anything new?

238
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:44,554
The Axeman killed eight people,

239
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,724
scared the crap out of the
city, never got caught.

240
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,260
Listen to this.
"If women will not dance

241
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,929
"to the sound of my axe,

242
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:53,898
I shall gladly make them dance
with the other."

243
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,632
Do you know a saxophone
is called an axe?

244
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,101
So he chopped women up

245
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:58,768
'cause they wouldn't be
his groupies?

246
00:14:58,836 --> 00:14:59,970
Plus men who protected them.

247
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:03,740
We never got
to ask about Madison.

248
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:07,144
Good. A spirit'll say anything
to get released.

249
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:09,079
They mess with you.

250
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:10,214
Is that why he said
we killed him?

251
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:11,648
No.

252
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:15,052
He thinks we're them.

253
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:20,124
Class of 1919.

254
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,459
The same year the
Axeman disappeared.

255
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:24,061
"This Jazz Killer

256
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,230
"has killed long enough.

257
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,797
"This city is done trembling.

258
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,066
Tonight it ends."

259
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:30,768
Witches killed the Axeman.

260
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:34,738
If there's even a chance

261
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:36,140
he knows where Madison is,
we got to make contact.

262
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,942
No! No.

263
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,809
No way I'm helping you
release the Axeman.

264
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:42,079
Nan?

265
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:44,281
I'm out.

266
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:47,952
(scoffs) You left your lives

267
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:49,286
and came all the way

268
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:51,121
across the country
just to puss out now?

269
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,324
If this is all the fight
we have left in us

270
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:56,233
at the end of our race,
witches deserve to die.

271
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:08,372
(sighs)

272
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:11,375
Where's Madison?

273
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:14,344
Tell me and I'll give you
what you want.

274
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:18,215
I know what you like.

275
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,717
I can give it to you.

276
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,187
Release.

277
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,058
Don't you want release?

278
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,195
"A..."

279
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:37,034
<i>"T..."</i>

280
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,472
<i>"T..."</i>

281
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,243
(hinges creaking)

282
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:49,213
<i>"I..."</i>

283
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,880
<i>"C."</i>

284
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:54,584
(hinges creaking)

285
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,220
(gasps)

286
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,889
(coughs, floorboards creaking)

287
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,336
(creaking continues)

288
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,388
(creaking)

289
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,427
(gasping)

290
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,429
(screaming)

291
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,539
(sniffing, door opens)

292
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,399
She made it up the
stairs on her own.

293
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:00,573
Of course she did.
She's tough.

294
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,183
She's a survivor.

295
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:03,817
<i>She's</i> right here.

296
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,976
Why are there roses in here?

297
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,969
Why, I thought
you might enjoy them.

298
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,125
They're the very last
of your heirlooms.

299
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,472
Roses pull in love and romance.

300
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,095
That's not what I'm
looking for right now.

301
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,565
I need chrysanthemums.

302
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,535
All kinds of them, for
strength and protection.

303
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,604
Well, doctor said, uh, bed rest

304
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,107
for at least a week, hmm?
(gasping)

305
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,576
(Kaylee moaning)

306
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,947
Who is she?

307
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,615
Who is the redhead?
Whoa!

308
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,116
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.

309
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,105
I don't know what
you're talking about.

310
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,056
Enough bullshit!

311
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:45,110
Anything else you want
to tell me now?

312
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,079
Because I will see it
sooner or later.

313
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:54,954
I had to go blind to see things
about you I couldn't see before.

314
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,123
A bad cosmic joke.

315
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,391
It's a different

316
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,260
kind of clarity,

317
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,964
an absolute clarity
I've never had.

318
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:08,901
The images almost vibrate

319
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,903
with light.
FIONA: Thank Christ she's finally

320
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,189
got your number.
She's high as a kite.

321
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:14,229
You know what they gave her

322
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:14,974
before we left the hospital?

323
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,275
I'm high all right,

324
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:18,744
but it's not the drugs,
and rest assured,

325
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:21,080
you will be accountable

326
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:24,817
for every single betrayal,
no matter how deep you think

327
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:26,318
your secrets are buried.

328
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,753
Now get out of here.

329
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,121
(shouting): Get out!
Baby.

330
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,624
Now, you're my...
you're my heart.

331
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,735
(door bangs open)

332
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:36,295
I'd get out
while you still can, jug head.

333
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:44,669
(door slams shut)

334
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:51,310
I wanted to sever his arms
and throw him out the window.

335
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:52,878
I had to stop myself.

336
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:55,381
You've been given the Sight.

337
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:58,017
It comes in bits and pieces.

338
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:59,785
It's the greatest gift to have.

339
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:03,422
And the hardest
one to live with.

340
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:06,892
Let me help, honey.

341
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,363
(gasps)
(Myrtle screaming)

342
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,965
Oh. Why didn't you tell me?

343
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,200
What? What? What
did you see?

344
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:19,038
Auntie Myrtle.

345
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:22,341
(crying softly)

346
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,978
I wanted to tell you, Delia, but
you were in so much pain, and

347
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,847
I didn't want to add to it.

348
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:30,049
Burned at the stake.
Yes.

349
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,018
For what she did to you, yes.

350
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:34,219
No.

351
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:36,856
That cannot be.

352
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:39,992
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way.

353
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,393
Ah.

354
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,228
I think it's best if I...

355
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:45,464
let you be alone for a while.

356
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,833
I'll ask

357
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:49,189
Delphine to come
and check on you.

358
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:52,905
(door squeaks open)

359
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,473
(door shuts)

360
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:56,509
(vehicle driving away)
Fiona's leaving in a taxi.

361
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:03,849
All right, you twisted,
tea-serving necrophiliac.

362
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,050
It's time to fess up.

363
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:07,252
You killed Madison.

364
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,889
What's he thinking?
He's not afraid of children.

365
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:11,257
QUEENIE (chuckles):
Really?

366
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:14,026
Yeah. We all know exactly
how tough he is.

367
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,097
(gasps, screams)

368
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,999
(grunting)

369
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,875
Here's how this works, asshole.

370
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,276
We ask the questions,

371
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:34,046
you think the answers,
she reads your mind.

372
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:35,147
(sucks air through teeth)

373
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:37,950
(sizzling)

374
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,418
(gasping, moaning)

375
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:41,253
(grunts)

376
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:43,122
(Queenie chuckles)

377
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:46,058
Fiona's not here
to help you now, riffraff.

378
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,526
Best be straight.

379
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,461
You killed Madison, didn't you?

380
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,465
SPALDING:
<i>Yes.</i>

381
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,699
Yes.

382
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:57,036
Why?

383
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:01,007
I'm a man of uniquely developed
<i>appetites.</i>

384
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:03,108
Sex.
(Queenie and Zoe groan)

385
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:05,945
Was she your first?

386
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:08,547
<i>Yes. I had to have her.</i>

387
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:11,083
<i>Madison Montgomery,</i>

388
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:13,085
<i>she was so beautiful.</i>

389
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:16,088
<i>The moment we met, I knew</i>
<i>that only by sliding</i>

390
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:18,623
<i>myself into her cold, stiff,</i>

391
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:21,360
<i>unyielding mound</i>

392
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:24,563
<i>would I ever feel</i>
<i>like a real man again.</i>

393
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,498
His first. Yes.

394
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:27,833
<i>Ask yourselves,</i>

395
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:32,772
<i>what will you tough</i>
<i>little witches do now?</i>

396
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:35,841
<i>Turn me in to the authorities,</i>
<i>exposing</i>

397
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,977
<i>the coven, bringing us</i>

398
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:39,411
<i>all to ruin?</i>

399
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:41,346
<i>I think you're smarter</i>
<i>than that.</i>

400
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,015
What's he saying?

401
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,383
That we can't do shit.

402
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:46,151
I can.

403
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,095
(moaning)

404
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:03,469
(Queenie laughs)
That's enough.

405
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:05,805
Fine.

406
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:08,007
We'll wait till he wakes up
to kill him.

407
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,341
(gasps)
I want him to feel it.

408
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,914
We're not going to kill him.

409
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,016
I'm not sure he
really killed Madison.

410
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,984
He admitted it. I read his mind.

411
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,499
He grew up in a house
full of witches.

412
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,855
And he knows how
to keep secrets.

413
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:23,989
Bet he's learned a trick or two.

414
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:26,525
I...
So if he didn't kill her,

415
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:27,526
who did?

416
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:31,864
(insects trilling,
frogs croaking)

417
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:35,434
(Misty humming)

418
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,598
You like my swamp water,
don't you?

419
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,273
Got to have patience.

420
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,843
Won't be long now.

421
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:22,347
(shouts)

422
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,651
Oh, my Lord. It's you.

423
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:29,454
What are you doing here?

424
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,157
Where've you been?

425
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,625
You look like you been
rode hard and put up wet.

426
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:37,262
My daddy used to say that.

427
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:41,033
Oh.

428
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:43,536
You need a bath.

429
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:45,604
(Stevie Nicks'
"Leather and Lace" playing)

430
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:48,741
(Kyle moaning)
(water splashing)

431
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,578
Ooh.

432
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:54,480
(clang)

433
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,284
You smell like a pack
of polecats.

434
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,920
(groaning)

435
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:05,157
(moaning, shouts)

436
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:08,694
Hey. Hey.
(moaning)

437
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,629
Oh, for Christ's sake, Kyle.

438
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:12,331
It's just me.

439
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,001
(moaning)

440
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:16,168
(shouts)

441
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:17,770
Okay...
(shouting)

442
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:20,473
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay.

443
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,775
Come on.

444
00:25:24,677 --> 00:25:27,612
All clean.

445
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,281
Come on.

446
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:37,156
(shouting)
Kyle?

447
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:39,158
Kyle?

448
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:43,195
(screams): No!
Kyle, it's okay.

449
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:45,297
(shouting)

450
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:47,033
Hey! You stop that!

451
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,534
Stop that!

452
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:50,002
You don't want to piss me off!

453
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,037
I could be your only friend!

454
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,706
(shouting)

455
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,043
Kyle!

456
00:25:58,144 --> 00:26:00,412
(shouting)
Hey!

457
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,047
(wailing incoherently)

458
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:03,983
Hey, what's wrong with you?

459
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:06,118
(shouting)
It's okay...

460
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,053
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

461
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:11,056
No! (music stops)
(shouting)

462
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:15,627
(sobbing)
Why would you do that?

463
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:18,063
Why... You...

464
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:19,165
(sobs)
Wh...

465
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:24,036
You're just a big ol' monster.

466
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:26,505
(footsteps approach)
(sobs)

467
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:28,507
Oh, my God.

468
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:30,209
(crying)

469
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:31,877
Get him out of here.

470
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,412
(sighs)

471
00:26:33,513 --> 00:26:36,282
He broke Stevie.

472
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:38,884
I'm taking you both out of here.

473
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:41,020
I need your help.

474
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:42,721
(Kyle crying)

475
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:55,901
We have a problem.

476
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:57,903
(door opens)

477
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:18,546
(grunting)

478
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:20,047
(moans)
It's okay.

479
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:21,916
It's okay.
You're okay.

480
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,751
(sighs)

481
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,288
He likes you.

482
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,490
You two belong together.

483
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:31,525
Not likely.

484
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:33,527
He murdered his mother.

485
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,797
What can you do?

486
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,504
(sniffs)

487
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,308
I can help you dig a hole.

488
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:48,909
She's already rotting.

489
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,312
Plus, she's missing an arm.

490
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,946
I have it.

491
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,082
I can sew it back on her
like I did with Kyle.

492
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,983
Have you seen his scar?

493
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,091
You're not so hot with a needle
and thread. Come on.

494
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,421
We'll find a soft spot
in the yard.

495
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:02,389
No. You have the
power of resurgence.

496
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:04,090
You have to bring her back.

497
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:12,566
Give me some of that mud.

498
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:22,376
(exhales)

499
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,811
(inhales)

500
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:32,453
(blowing softly)

501
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:42,796
I need your help.

502
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,865
Too much death inside
her. Put your hands

503
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,800
on her stomach and push.

504
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,808
(coughing)

505
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,011
(gasps)

506
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:01,815
Keep pushing!

507
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:05,953
(gagging)

508
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,755
Hmm.

509
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:11,292
(gasping, gagging)

510
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,060
(panting softly)

511
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,501
(screaming)

512
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:26,006
(coughing)

513
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,912
(gasping)

514
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:35,081
I need a cigarette.

515
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:37,309
You risk an awful lot coming here,
you know that.

516
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:40,587
You didn't give me much of a choice.
An acid attack?

517
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:41,722
Was that supposed to
speed things along?

518
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:43,691
You just made my job
more complicated.

519
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:45,091
You think I did that?

520
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:47,060
I look like the Taliban to you?

521
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:49,095
If I wanted to blind
your little wifey,

522
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:51,198
I wouldn't have
to leave my room.

523
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,800
Well, something's happened.

524
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,369
She's acquired some kind
of second sight.

525
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:56,804
She's starting to see things.

526
00:29:56,938 --> 00:29:58,172
We have to do something.

527
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,773
"We," <i>mon cher?</i>

528
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,809
I believe I already did.

529
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:05,112
I thought I'd hired me
a professional witch hunter.

530
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,214
Coming here in the light of day.

531
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:09,616
"We got a problem."

532
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,952
I got a problem. You.

533
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,588
Six years in that house
and for what?

534
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,790
Access. You know that.
You said you wanted more

535
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:18,625
than just the witches
at the academy.

536
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,861
You said you wanted all
the Salem descendants.

537
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,663
That's what
I've been giving you.

538
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,966
I'm really glad you decided
to come and see us, Kaylee.

539
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,135
Well, to be honest, I mostly
wanted to see Bourbon Street

540
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:31,672
and eat at Emeril's restaurant.
Mm-hmm.

541
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:33,174
This other stuff?

542
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:34,808
I don't know.

543
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:38,212
Th-This place?
I'm not really sure it's for me.

544
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,847
This isn't a nunnery.

545
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:41,882
It's not a jail.

546
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,384
It's a haven

547
00:30:43,485 --> 00:30:45,819
where you can learn
about who and what you are.

548
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,755
What do you think I am?

549
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,723
I don't think
you're an arsonist.

550
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,859
Which is what
you've been charged with.

551
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:52,793
Twice.

552
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:54,328
But not convicted.

553
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,797
Not yet.

554
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:58,666
Why don't you tell me
about the last fire?

555
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,001
KAYLEE:
<i>You said that you loved me.</i>

556
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,236
I changed my mind.

557
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:04,138
I can't marry you. I'm sorry.

558
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:05,839
(crying):
But why?

559
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,375
Will you just give me
one goddamn reason?

560
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,810
There's something

561
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:11,278
not right about you, okay?

562
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:12,946
You make my friends squirm.

563
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:15,249
My mother says if I married you
I would regret it as long

564
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:16,783
as I live, okay?

565
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:17,918
And I think she's right.

566
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,454
I'm sorry, Kaylee.

567
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,992
(screaming)

568
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,835
I don't really like
to talk about this.

569
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,303
You have genuine power.

570
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:38,672
Nothing to be ashamed of,
but it is something

571
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,374
you need to learn
how to control.

572
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,209
Wouldn't you like
to be surrounded by people

573
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,877
with similar gifts?

574
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:48,716
Truth be told, Mrs. Foxx, I...

575
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:50,817
I really don't want
to be powerful.

576
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:53,687
I just want to
find a good husband

577
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:55,722
and have three kids.

578
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:57,824
I think I have a
really good shot.

579
00:31:57,892 --> 00:31:59,860
I work out, and I play
Fantasy Football.

580
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:02,163
Nine Salem descendants
in just three years.

581
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:04,865
Five of them I never would have
found without Delia's research.

582
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:07,568
Maybe we should take you off
the payroll and put her on it.

583
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,703
Sounds like she doing
all the work.

584
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:11,972
This is what we agreed to!
No.

585
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,675
What we agreed to is
that you would clean house,

586
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:16,277
not <i>play</i> house.

587
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,746
What's that supposed to mean?
What you think it means?

588
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:20,647
She made you hard.

589
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:22,649
You went soft!

590
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:26,186
You're in love
with that sorry witch.

591
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:28,922
Bullshit.
Bullshit is right.

592
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,924
You're supposed to be ridding me
of my enemies. Instead,

593
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:32,493
they're mouthier than ever!

594
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,362
Showing up on my doorstep,
disrespecting me,

595
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,697
digging up my enemies.

596
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:37,831
When I plant

597
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:39,767
a fat-assed cracker bitch,

598
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,702
I expect her to stay planted,

599
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:43,904
not come back up
like goddamned ragweed!

600
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:46,773
And that Fiona--
doing my Bastien like that.

601
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:47,975
Bastien.

602
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:50,211
My poor Bastien.

603
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:51,845
They desecrated you.

604
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:54,948
And I brought you back life,

605
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,751
and she took it away again?!

606
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:01,422
Well, now we take hers and all.

607
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,157
No more nonsense.

608
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:05,759
You go back there,
and you bring me their heads.

609
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,128
All of them.

610
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:08,162
What?

611
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:09,963
Fiona,

612
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:13,700
her daughter and every
witch bitch in that house.

613
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:16,803
You bring me their heads,
all of them.

614
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,972
Then you burn that place
to the ground.

615
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,508
Uh, Marie...

616
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:23,977
You do it, and you do it quick.

617
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:28,449
And I let you live.

618
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,818
QUEENIE: I know you went all Malcolm
X and shit, but this house is

619
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,320
now a carnival of crazy.

620
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:35,789
How are you gonna
explain this to Fiona?

621
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:37,824
I'm not.

622
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,993
No one says a word to Fiona.

623
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:42,996
We have to keep Madison under
the radar until she's better.

624
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,699
And I'll... I'll figure
out what to do with Kyle.

625
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,668
I'm not taking him.

626
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,570
He's a walking tornado.

627
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:52,072
You made him.

628
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,608
He's your problem now.

629
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,480
Okay. Who's taking me home?

630
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:01,448
ZOE: It's late.
Why don't you

631
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:03,150
stay the night, sleep
in a real bed for a change?

632
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:04,818
No, thanks.

633
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:05,953
I need to be alone.

634
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:07,788
I thought you were looking
for your tribe.

635
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:12,593
I was... and I am.

636
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,095
This ain't it.

637
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:16,097
I got bad vibes.

638
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:17,998
Real bad.

639
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:20,801
There's something foul
in this house.

640
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,974
(lock clicks)

641
00:34:56,404 --> 00:34:58,038
(pills clinking on floor)

642
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:02,008
(loud gulping)

643
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:23,564
I always hated this room.

644
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,227
Was I in a car crash?

645
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:37,762
(distorted):
Drink this.

646
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,464
Ginger'll help your stomach.

647
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:41,766
(sighs)

648
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:48,707
(retching)

649
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:50,041
Oh.

650
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:52,644
(coughing)

651
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:57,649
(distorted):
Do you know who you are?

652
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,050
(distorted):
I'm-I'm Madison Montgomery.

653
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:01,886
I... I make $7 million
a picture.

654
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,556
I have two Teen Choice Awards.

655
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:06,109
You died.

656
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:09,494
We brought you back.

657
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:12,697
What's the last
thing you remember?

658
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:17,702
Red.

659
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,787
A-After that, it's all... dark.

660
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:26,528
Did you see a bright light?

661
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:29,397
No.

662
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:32,233
There's nothing
on the other side.

663
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:34,277
It's just black...

664
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:35,553
forever.

665
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,241
Who are you?

666
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:44,879
What do you want?

667
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:46,681
Release.

668
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:48,049
I can't do that.

669
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:49,884
(gasping)

670
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:52,921
Don't think so,
dirty pussy cat?

671
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:55,023
(gasps)

672
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,991
Goddamn witches.

673
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:58,560
They ended me once

674
00:36:58,628 --> 00:37:00,429
right here in this very room.

675
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,930
And for years after,

676
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:04,866
the parties and the music

677
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,268
and the dancing raged
wild outside

678
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:10,071
while I sat trapped

679
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,443
inside these four ugly walls.

680
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:17,378
Now, last night,

681
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:20,682
this sweet young witch
comes along

682
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,384
and offers me my release,

683
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:24,886
and I said,

684
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:26,114
"Oh, yes, ma'am, yes, please.

685
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:27,522
What do you need?"

686
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,524
She asks her favor,

687
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:31,292
and I provide.

688
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:33,795
The thing is,

689
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,364
when the time comes
for her to ante up,

690
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:39,267
bitch lies, leaving me betwixt,

691
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,936
between and ready to pop.

692
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:43,371
Huh?

693
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:45,373
You died.
Uh-huh.

694
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,908
And now you're trapped.

695
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,309
Right here with you.

696
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,311
(panting)
The only way I can help you

697
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,313
is if you let me out of here.

698
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:55,750
No. Nobody leaves this room.

699
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,420
You see, I had
a... a contract.

700
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:02,657
Promises were made,

701
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:06,427
and all you've got to
do is sing and dance...

702
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:10,832
...and call the witches
who owe me my freedom.

703
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,166
And I'll provide the music.

704
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:15,003
(Cordelia screaming)

705
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,005
(screaming continues)

706
00:38:17,106 --> 00:38:19,173
(wooden thudding)
NAN: Cordelia?!

707
00:38:19,274 --> 00:38:20,809
It's locked.

708
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,410
(Duke Ellington's
"New Orleans Low Down" plays)

709
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:24,513
It's the Axeman.
You released him?!?

710
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:26,781
I told him I
would. I lied!

711
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:31,119
This don't end till I get out.

712
00:38:32,254 --> 00:38:33,487
(grunting)

713
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:34,823
(panting)

714
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,994
Get those witches in here
and release me now!

715
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:41,596
Go to Hell!
Ladies first.

716
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,833
(Cordelia screaming)

717
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,836
(Cordelia panting)

718
00:38:48,638 --> 00:38:49,638
(whimpering)

719
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,305
Now dance.

720
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,641
(screaming)

721
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,208
We need a spell

722
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:56,210
to make him move on.

723
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,813
I told you not to mess
with that spirit board.

724
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,682
(screaming continues)

725
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,284
QUEENIE: Yeah, there's a
shit ton of books in there,

726
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:06,888
and not one of them
is written in English.

727
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,223
(screaming continues)

728
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,493
This one's it.

729
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,444
(thudding, screaming)

730
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,413
Give me your hands.

<i>Solvo Liberatum Spirito Malus</i>

734
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:31,212
