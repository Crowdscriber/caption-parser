00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:43,306
Coming!

3
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:55,759
Hey, mom.

4
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,346
Has he told you
how long he's staying?

5
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,847
No, and I didn't ask him.

6
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,116
I didn't want him
to think it was an option.

7
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:19,618
As far as I'm concerned,
I'll find him some money,

8
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,721
and then he can get on his way.

9
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,594
Your toast is done.

10
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:31,097
Yeah.
I know.

11
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,503
I don't suppose
you want some breakfast?

12
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:38,904
Thanks, no.

13
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,811
The bread's gonna get stale.

14
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:56,422
Why are you here?

15
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:00,159
Because that's what
normal people do, Norma,

16
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,695
when they've lost their job,
and they've got no money

17
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:04,830
and no place to stay.

18
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,899
They go home.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,467
Although most normal mothers

20
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:09,889
don't move their home
out of state

21
00:02:09,903 --> 00:02:13,339
and try and hide it
from their own son.

22
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,908
We're out of cream.

23
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,118
He looked like a lost puppy
at the party.

24
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,890
Shh, he's coming.

25
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:40,633
- Hey.
- Hey.

26
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:41,967
So the other night,

27
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,136
why'd you leave the party
so early?

28
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,072
Where did you go?
You hook up with someone?

29
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,774
I'd like to lie to you
and say yes,

30
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,443
but I actually
got my history book

31
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,411
out of your car
and went home and--

32
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,880
And probably studied.

33
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:58,584
Good for you.
I hate studying.

34
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:03,055
- A necessary evil.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:04,857
You wanna actually
study together

36
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,325
for the history test?

37
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:09,328
I mean, not go to a party
this time.

38
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:10,830
I could really use the help.

39
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:14,033
Oh, my God, that guy
must be completely wasted.

40
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,972
That's my dad's car.

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,858
Dad! Dad!

42
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,059
Oh, my God!

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,560
Let me--let me--
let me get it.

44
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:43,762
Hurry up!

45

46
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,734
His name's Jerry Martin.

47
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,537
Owns a warehouse up the road.

48
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:27,606
It looks like somebody
set a fire there.

49
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,074
He was trapped inside of it.

50
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:30,576
Wait, you're saying someone
intentionally

51
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,478
set fire to his warehouse?

52
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,581
That's horrible.

53
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,684
Yes, you're right.
It's horrible.

54
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:40,052
Sheriff!

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,955
There's something here
you need to see.

56
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:55,601
Interesting morning
in White Pine Bay.

57
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,369
Burnt up dude
drives into a ditch

58
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,772
in front of your new hotel?

59
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:02,908
How rude.

60
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,743
You know,
it's a really nice town

61
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,579
you picked here, Norma,

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,913
to start a new life and all,
you know?

63
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:11,050
Stop calling me Norma.

64
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,756
And if you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna pitch in.

65
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,658
I ordered
all-new bed linens.

66
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,959
They're ready to be picked up.

67
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:23,362
I'm gonna get you the car keys.

68
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,863
Mrs. Bates.

69
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,800
Could you come here, please?

70
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:38,077
Yep, that's it.

71
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,782
This is, uh--
this is Keith Summers's truck,

72
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,484
used to own this place.

73
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,986
He hasn't been home
in a couple of nights.

74
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,654
Have you seen him?

75
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:52,558
No.
No, I haven't.

76
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,660
Why would he
leave his truck here?

77
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,795
Well,
that's what we're wondering.

78
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,800
All right, let's get everybody
down here by the truck.

79
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,862
We're gonna search the woods
up here behind the house.

80
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,223
Fine. Let's go!

81
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,813
Well, good luck
with everything.

82
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,055
So I want you to select a poem

83
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,491
from one of these classic poets

84
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:28,060
and prepare a presentation
on why this poem

85
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,029
is still relevant
in today's world.

86
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:31,897
Now this
is a partner assignment,

87
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:33,632
so I want you to figure out
who you wanna work with.

88
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:40,839
Hey.
Wanna do this with me?

89
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,508
Yeah, okay.

90
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:44,910
Good.
We can meet tomorrow.

91
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,646
Cool.

92
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,867
You live at the motel, right?
I'll come to your place.

93
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,450
Oh, well,
maybe we should--

94
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:55,187
11:00. I'll be there.

95
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:16,475
Dr. Klonkin.
Dr. Klonkin.

96
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:30,556
- I'll talk to him.
- Okay.

97
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,362
So why are you here?

98
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,997
I just felt bad about
what happened to Bradley's dad.

99
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,601
- And I was there.
- Yeah, I know.

100
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:44,570
Well, I just wanted
to give her this.

101
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,506
I'll give it to her.

102
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,341
Great.
Yeah, okay.

103
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,510
Yeah, thank you.

- Listen, dumb-ass.

128
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,413
This is not gonna stand.
It's not.

129
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,721
You're not gonna be coming home

130
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,483
in the middle of the night
like this.

131
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:40,986
Okay? I am trying to build
a life here for me and Norman.

132
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,889
You are not going
to be screwing this up.

133
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,924
I got it, okay?

134
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:49,795
I grew up in a house
with you, remember?

135
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:52,931
It was always what you
were trying to do for Norman.

136
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:54,867
Norman is a good boy.

137
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,468
He's a good son.

138
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:59,771
Dylan, would you please
put that on a plate?

139
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:02,674
Well, golly, you know,

140
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,495
I'm sorry if I was
a little annoyed with you

141
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:05,878
after you drove my dad away

142
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,646
by skanking around
with Norman's father.

143
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,515
I wasn't skanking around.
It wasn't my fault.

144
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,483
I was 17 years old
when I met your father.

145
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,784
I had no idea what I was doing.

146
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:14,520
I met Sam, and I fell in love.

147
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:16,054
Oh, yeah?

148
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:18,524
How'd that work out for you?

149
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,526
I hate you.

150
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:21,960
I hate you.

151
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,929
You have never had
an ounce of kindness for me.

152
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,398
Well, I'm sorry
it was a little bit hard

153
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:27,766
to get on the tea party
with you and Norbit.

154
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,547
What are you talking about?
What tea party?

155
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:32,471
He likes me. He just likes me,
so we are close.

156
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,040
That is the normal arrangement
between mothers and sons,

157
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:39,545
not this crap.

158
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:43,582
How'd you get
all this money, Norma?

159
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:47,052
How'd you buy a motel
and a new car?

160
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:49,788
We haven't had a dime
in our life, okay?

161
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:53,158
I've been worried about money
since I was conscious.

162
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,727
What's up with that, huh?

163
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:57,796
Sam's insurance policy.

164
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:02,467
He sold insurance,
and he was well covered.

165
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:06,171
Yeah, I guess so.

166
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:12,044
Good night, Norma.

167
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:14,452
Stop calling me Norma.

168
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,915
I am your mother!

169
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:24,027
Get all the corners and the edges.

170
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,668
I think we're good.

171
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,336
Just 'cause they found his car

172
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,810
doesn't mean
they're necessarily gonna--

173
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:34,510
Don't you two
ever get tired of each other?

174
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:42,618
These are good.

175
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,884
I got it, gang, it's cool.

176
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,086
Don't stop your swiffering.

177
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:58,828
Hi. I'm here
to study with Norman.

178
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:05,769
Hey, Norman,
there's a girl here for you.

179
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:07,570
Come in.

180
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:13,009
Hi, Norman.

181
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,112
Oh, hey, Emma.

182
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,981
This is my mom.
Emma.

183
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,450
We're doing a language arts
project together at school.

184
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:22,085
I guess I forgot to tell you.

185
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:24,554
- I'm Dylan.
- Well, that's okay then.

186
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:27,056
Come on in.
It's nice to meet you.

187
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,793
- You too.
- Where do you live, Emma?

188
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,394
My dad has a shop
in the village.

189
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,430
We live in the space above it.

190
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:34,578
Did we land on a poem yet?

191
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:36,266
What's your last name?

192
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,034
Decody.
No, but I brought some books.

193
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,269
"Decody."
Is that Italian?

194
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,937
No, no, it isn't.

195
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:43,006
We're from the U.K.,
actually.

196
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,375
Hey, mom, uh,
didn't you--

197
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,076
didn't you need me
to go to the grocery store?

198
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:48,511
- Come sit down.
- Do you have that list?

199
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,180
Have a seat.
No, I haven't made it yet.

200
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:51,781
Oh.

201
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:54,217
So how long
have you lived here?

202
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:55,852
About five years.

203
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,987
My dad was a professor
in Manchester.

204
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:00,023
- He was a professor?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,258
But he wanted to spend time
just focusing

206
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:04,427
on taking care of me,
so he retired

207
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,095
and opened the shop.

208
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:07,764
And are you okay?

209
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:10,133
Oh, this?

210
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:12,068
Yeah.
It's my pet.

211
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:15,238
I take it everywhere.

212
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:16,539
I have C.F.

213
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,141
Mom.

214
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,276
Mm.
I have--

215
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:22,545
I have heard of it,
but I don't know

216
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,280
what it is, exactly.
I don't know.

217
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:26,816
Well, cystic fibrosis
is when your lungs

218
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,485
create a lot
of this thick mucous,

219
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,353
and it makes it
really hard to breathe--

220
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,223
some would say impossible.

221
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:35,024
I'm on a list
for a lung transplant,

222
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,460
but that comes
with its own demons.

223
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:40,363
And God knows
if I'll ever get one in time.

224
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:43,399
Well, I hope you do.

225
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,172
What is
your life expectancy, Emma?

226
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:52,208
Maybe 27.

227
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,544
Hmm.

228
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:04,153
Well, why don't you two
go upstairs,

229
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:05,455
do your homework?

230
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:07,490
And you let me know
if you get hungry.

231
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:20,937
Do you think
that she has to take that thing

232
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:22,872
out of her nose
when they make out?

233
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,615
How about this?
<i>The Tiger.</i>

234
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:38,988
It's a classic.

235
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:41,291
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright

236
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:43,526
"in the forest of the night.

237
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,461
"What immortal hand or eye

238
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:49,566
could frame
thy fearful symmetry?"

239
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:54,037
And what does it mean?

240
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:55,505
It's about how could a God,

241
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,774
who made all this beautiful
stuff in the world,

242
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:01,411
also make things
that are scary and evil?

243
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:02,879
It could work.

244
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:04,247
We could talk about it in terms

245
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:05,915
of famous contemporary murders,

246
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:10,019
like O.J. or--
or Charles Manson.

247
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:16,225
"What the hammer,
what the chain,

248
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,828
"in what furnace was thy brain?

249
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:21,898
"What the anvil,
what dread grasp,

250
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,968
dare its deadly terrors
clasp?"

251
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:30,873
What's this?

252
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:33,109
Oh, it's nothing.

253
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,579
I don't care.

254
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,819
Wow, these pictures
are amazing.

255
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,887
Did you draw these?

256
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,796
No. No, I found it
in one of the motel rooms.

257
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,791
I didn't know
what to do with it, so--

258
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,994
Oh, please.
I've read a lot of manga--

259
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:54,130
a lot steamier than this.

260
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,132
Can I borrow it?

261
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:59,102
Sure.

262
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,171
Thanks.

263
00:16:56,994 --> 00:17:00,063
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry to be in a robe.

264
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:01,764
You caught me
getting ready for bed.

265
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,499
Yeah, we need to ask you
some questions.

266
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,202
Sure, sure, ask away.

267
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,440
The other morning
when we were out here,

268
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,076
you said you hadn't seen
Keith Summers.

269
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:15,511
Yes, that's correct.

270
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,781
But we have an eyewitness
who was driving by here

271
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,116
who said he saw him

272
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,218
standing right here
on your front lawn

273
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:25,054
and that you and your son
were talking to him...

274
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:27,023
And it looked a little heated.

275
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:29,058
Well, yes,
I mean, I'm--

276
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:32,061
I didn't know that you had meant
had I ever seen him.

277
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:33,289
I thought you meant recently.

278
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:35,271
Well, some people might think

279
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,768
in the last week
as being recently.

280
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,525
Yeah, some people might.

281
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:42,893
So you're admitting
you did see him?

282
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,929
No, I never said
I hadn't ever seen him,

283
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,731
so I'm not admitting anything.

284
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,666
Did he make any--
any threats to you or--

285
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,469
Threats? No. Why if he had,
I would've called the police.

286
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,405
Because he wasn't too happy
about you waltzing in

287
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,773
and buying his property
at a foreclosure.

288
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,108
Well, you know, the fact

289
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,743
that I bought this property
at a good price

290
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,224
hardly incriminates me
in his disappearance.

291
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:01,883
He disappeared?

292
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,914
I-I don't remember
bringing up a disappearance.

293
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:05,383
No, but you're implying it.

294
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,952
No, I believe
you're inferring it.

295
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,695
That's all the information
I have, so...

296
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,497
- is that it?
- Actually, no.

297
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,965
I'd like to take a look around,
if you don't mind.

298
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,767
Actually, I do mind.

299
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,001
I think you need
a search warrant

300
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,504
for something like that, right?

301
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,972
I mean, based on something

302
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,940
more than just
some meaningless conversation

303
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,553
out on my motel front lawn,
right?

304
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,719
You better work with me, okay?

305
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,756
I'm the last guy
you want on your bad side.

306
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,772
Okay.

Deputy Shelby?

313
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:38,375
Hey, you guys
be safe today, yeah?

314
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,280
- Hello, Mrs. Bates.
- Hello, go ahead.

315
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,083
Slap the handcuffs on.

316
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:48,118
Well, that is Romero.

317
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,254
That's just his style,
you know?

318
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,755
He's a dog with a bone,

319
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,857
so I wouldn't take it
too personally.

320
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:57,094
Yeah, I tell you,
it's a little hard not to.

321
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,097
I know.

322
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:02,232
Well, I'm sorry.
Um...

323
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,335
Hey, would you let me
buy you a cup of coffee,

324
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:09,106
maybe, as a gesture
of goodwill?

325
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,374
Sure.

326
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:16,180
It was horrible for Norman
to lose his father.

328
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,249
And I came here
because I wanted

329
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,851
to clean the slate for him.

330
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,720
You know, I wanted him--

331
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,088
I wanted to give him
a new life.

332
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,223
- I wanted to give him hope.
- Sure, yeah.

333
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,460
And let's just say

334
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,297
that gets
a little bit compromised

335
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,801
when Sheriff Bulldog
is standing on my porch

336
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,104
and he's making all kinds
of accusations.

337
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,073
First of all, to be fair,

338
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,442
I really don't think
he was making accusations.

339
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,379
I do--no, I do think
that you were inferring that.

340
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,781
Oh, no.

341
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,350
Now we're back to that again?

342
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,885
Okay, Romero.

343
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,754
He grew up with Keith Summers.

344
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,889
They were boyhood pals,
you know?

345
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,090
So they spent
a lot of time together

346
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,692
doin' a whole lot of nothing,

347
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:06,063
and you get close
to people that way, so--

348
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,399
so Keith's disappearance,
you know, this is--

349
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,067
it's very personal to him.

350
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,236
I can understand that.

351
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,904
Hey, deputy.

352
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,272
We gonna see you
at the Woodchuck tonight?

353
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,907
Absolutely, yeah,
wouldn't miss it.

354
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,308
- Right on, man.
- All right.

355
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,210
Woodchuck? What on earth
is the Woodchuck?

356
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:23,447
Yeah, the Woodchuck
is this stupid,

357
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,217
but very fun,
local sort of festival.

358
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,853
It's left over from when
this used to be a logging town.

359
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,289
- Sounds charming.
- Yeah, no, it is, actually.

360
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,992
It is.
You should come.

361
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,828
Yeah, okay.
I would love to.

362
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,496
Great.

363
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:41,198
Um...

364
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,937
I just--
I really can't--

365
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,106
I mean, I couldn't take you,

366
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,109
you know, 'cause of the whole
Keith Summers, the whole--

367
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,780
But, I mean,
we could meet there, right?

368
00:21:56,881 --> 00:22:01,118
Because, I mean...
I'm going.

369
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,187
You're going, so...

370
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,358
Just a thought.

371
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:14,832
How does this look?

372
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,200
For what?

373
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,968
I'm meeting
Deputy Shelby in town.

374
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,204
Does this top look like
I'm trying too hard?

375
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:21,972
That depends
on what you're trying.

376
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,007
Ah, I didn't want
to have to tell you this.

377
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,044
I didn't want you to worry.

378
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,449
The police came by last night.

379
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,952
Apparently someone saw us
talking to Keith Summers outside

380
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,419
after I specifically
told the police

381
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:38,122
that we hadn't seen him.
Mom, that's-

382
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,990
I know, it's not good.

383
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,452
I think I dodged it
for the moment,

384
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,695
but I don't think it's over.

385
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,830
Deputy seems to like us,

386
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,299
so I'm gonna go
on a goodwill mission.

387
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,002
I'm meeting him
at a community event in town.

388
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,138
Hmm.

389
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,373
Norman, please.

390
00:22:56,474 --> 00:23:00,310
I'm just doing
what I need to do.

391
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:03,947
This one's better, right?

392
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,228
Lord, Norman, I'm your mother.

393
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:22,199
It's not like it's weird
or anything.

394
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,275
You don't have to do this, mom.

395
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,022
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not "doing" anything.

396
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,845
I ran into him in town,

397
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,013
and I'm just gonna go
hang out for a bit.

398
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,314
No, I don't want you to go.

399
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,449
- Honey, you're overreacting.
- Fine.

400
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:40,951
- It's a community thing?
- Yes.

401
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,152
- I'll go with you.
- No.

402
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,821
- Yeah.
- No.

403
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:47,024
No, you're not going with me,
and you know it.

404
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,826
It's fine, Norman.

405
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,394
It doesn't mean anything.

406
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:54,164
It's not like I'm actually
interested in him.

407
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,802
I don't want you to worry
about this.

408
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,671
I don't want you to worry
about anything.

409
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,673
That's why I'm doing this.

410
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,442
- Okay, mom.
- Okay?

411
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,814
It's all gonna be good.

412
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:29,448
Hey, Gil.

413
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:33,452
This is Dylan Massett.

414
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,321
He's the guy
I was telling you about.

415
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:39,424
So, Dylan...

416
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,527
you know how to use a gun?

417
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,166
Yeah.

418
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:53,472
- What's for dinner, honey?
- Screw off.

419
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,174
And I didn't make it.
Mom made it.

420
00:24:58,177 --> 00:24:59,411
Crap.
We're out of beer.

421
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:06,418
Apparently "the whore"
is calling you.

422
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:13,258
Hi, Norma.

423
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,860
Yeah, I met with the plumber,

424
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:17,062
and I got the quotes
for the new toilets.

425
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:19,498
Yeah, it's in the kitchen.

426
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:23,335
Okay, fine, fine.
Yes.

427
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:25,771
Don't you ever
call our mother a whore!

428
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:29,107
Get the hell off of me!

429
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,109
What do you think you're doing?

430
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,045
You're a damn joke, Norman.

431
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,113
You let that bitch
run you like a puppet.

432
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:36,848
She doesn't run me.
She cares about me.

433
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,884
And she's not a bad person,

434
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:40,852
she's just not perfect!

435
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:43,355
At least she tries,
you son of a bitch!

436
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:46,325
You don't get it,
do you, Norman?

437
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:48,327
She's ruined you.

438
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:50,362
If you hate her so much,
why the hell

439
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:52,297
do you wanna stay here?

440
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,600
Because I've got
nowhere else to go!

441
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:59,905
But don't you come at me again,
or I will hurt you bad.

442
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:03,475
Do you understand?

443
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:53,558
I told you not to do that.

444
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:05,537
She's not a whore.

445
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:32,544
- Great job.
- That's awesome.

446
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:36,215
♪ I can see why you think ♪

447
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:37,716
Great job, man, just awesome.

448
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:40,586
- Look at you.
- Oh!

449
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,388
See, I told you, this is--
it's stupid.

450
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,226
You know, there are
a million reasons

451
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,328
why Keith Summers
could have disappeared.

452
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:52,004
He probably landed
in a ditch somewhere

453
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:56,208
as a result of some bad crap
that he got into.

454
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,210
You mean, illegal stuff?

455
00:27:58,311 --> 00:28:02,481
Let's just say that
he was a train wreck in general.

456
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:03,716
♪ Amie ♪

457
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,184
You know, I had such high hopes

458
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:08,854
when I came here to make a home
for me and Norman.

459
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:12,891
And things just keep happening,
weird things,

460
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,994
you know?

461
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:19,632
It's like this,
but...it's not like this.

462
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,670
Look, nowhere is like this.

463
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,223
I mean,
not all the way through.

464
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:30,009
Have you noticed what
these people do for a living?

465
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,046
Artisanal cheese,
organic pig farms.

466
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:36,815
And yet, most of these people,
somehow,

467
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,884
they're all living
in million-dollar homes.

468
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:41,420
They're driving European cars.

469
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:44,757
The town, it was built
on the logging industry,

470
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:48,494
but all that collapsed
with the tree huggers.

471
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:51,630
I'm just saying
that there are...

472
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:56,035
there's different ways
to produce an economy,

473
00:28:56,136 --> 00:29:01,840
and it's not always
what it seems.

474
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,476
But surely you can't allow
illegal things,

475
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,011
bad things to happen here.

476
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,946
The people in this town,

477
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:10,616
they deal with things
in a different way,

478
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:15,087
but it gets dealt with.

479
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:17,856
And what about the guy
who was burned?

480
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:22,461
It'll be dealt with.
An eye for an eye.

481
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,531
It'll get handled.

482
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,037
The boat sails
for New York in 20 minutes.

483
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,605
- Let it sail.
- Look, Mastermind,

484
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:34,640
the tour is over.

485
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,808
We've been posse-baitin'

486
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:36,975
every town from coast to coast,

487
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,237
and we just ran out of towns.

488
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,212
Norman?

489
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,719
What on earth happened to you?

490
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,788
Oh, Dylan and I just
got into a fight.

491
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,657
It's not a big deal.

492
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:53,258
It absolutely is a big deal.

493
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,694
Look at your sweet face.

494
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,763
This is awful.
What happened?

495
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,031
I don't even know, mom.

496
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:02,101
We just don't get along.

497
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:14,780
He's gonna have to leave.

498
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,615
He can't come into our lives

499
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:17,883
and disrupt them like this.

500
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,618
He can't talk to us
the way he does.

501
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,920
And he can't hurt you.
I will not stand for it.

502
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,556
I won't.

503
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:28,193
Maybe it would be
the best thing.

504
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:35,267
Get some sleep, sweetheart.

505
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:50,075
Oh, hey.
Cool. You came.

506
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:53,612
You said it was important.

507
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:55,981
Holy crap.
What happened to your face?

508
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,750
Oh, I fell down the stairs,
you know,

509
00:31:58,818 --> 00:32:01,253
those long stairs
in front of our house.

510
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:02,921
It's okay.

511
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:05,491
You don't have to tell me.

512
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:09,027
Thanks.

513
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,897
So what's with
all the stuffed animals?

514
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:13,732
Are they real?

515
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,834
They were once.

516
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:17,903
My dad does it.

517
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:20,038
He's one of the best taxidermy
artists on the west coast.

518
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,773
But enough
about stuffing dead animals.

519
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,942
Sit down.

520
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,611
I'm gonna tell you
a little story

521
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:28,814
about real, living things.

522
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,683
Four girls from Shunyi, China,

523
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:34,920
get told that, if they come
to America illegally

524
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,941
and work as housemaids,
they will get citizenship

525
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,457
in seven years.

526
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,559
But they aren't gonna be maids.

527
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,495
They are forced to have sex
with different men every day.

528
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:45,564
One of them
dies from an overdose.

529
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:47,733
They force the other girls
to carry her body

530
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,768
into the hills, dig a grave,
and then bury her

531
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,571
by a shed in the trees.

532
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,007
This is a pretty wild story.

533
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,608
Wild, yes, and not over.

534
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,644
So eventually,
after they have been sampled,

535
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:02,814
they are sold one by one
into sex slavery.

536
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,083
Look at this.

537
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,252
That's Ladyface.

538
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,656
It's a mountain
just outside of White Pine Bay.

539
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:12,057
My dad's shown it to me before.

540
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,560
It really exists.

541
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,228
And?

542
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:19,131
Someone did this
to these girls, Norman,

543
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:22,568
and we can prove it.

544
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,938
We can find the spot
and find the grave.

545
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,942
Then we'll know
if it's real or not.

546
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:38,650
This is all a little peculiar.

547
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:43,221
No.
You know what's peculiar?

548
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:46,975
A 17-year-old boy
using the word "peculiar."

549
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,714

What are you doing?

560
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:16,114
It's the middle of the night.

561
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:19,985
Just having a cocktail
and listening

562
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,726
to some of the previous owner's
old music.

563
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:27,693
You?

564
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,895
Hey, I saw
what you did to Norman.

565
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:34,666
You can't stay here.
You're toxic.

566
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:37,502
You're leaving in the morning.

567
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:42,674
How did Sam die, Norma?

568
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:48,880
You know, it's funny.

569
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:52,984
Because I had to do
a lot of research to find out

570
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:55,220
where you guys had moved to.

571
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:58,090
And I wound up talking
to one of the insurance people,

572
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:00,625
and they talked

573
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:03,862
about how sad it was
that Sam had died

574
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:08,200
and what a wonderful husband
and father he was.

575
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:12,971
And then, I thought,
you know, "Hmm.

576
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,540
"Wouldn't it be interesting

577
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:19,144
if I told them what life
with Sam was really like?"

578
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:23,181
You know, how you guys
got along and all.

00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,537
See? It's real.

588
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:31,640
Let's go.

589
00:38:04,505 --> 00:38:08,243
Crap.
This is a big mountain.

590
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:09,611
Where's that shed?

591
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:14,950
We should take a break
for a second.

592
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:23,959
It's okay for you
to be doing this, right?

593
00:38:24,026 --> 00:38:25,950
Totally.

594
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,733
Fine.

595
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:31,831
I'm okay.

596
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:36,075
It's cool up here.

597
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:42,482
My dad, he taught me
this meditation

598
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,351
where first you imagine
your spirit

599
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:47,587
rising up out of your body,

600
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:49,322
then out of your house,

601
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:52,725
out of your town,
out of the sky,

602
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:55,295
like a golden light
zooming and growing,

603
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:57,697
out into, and even past,
the universe.

604
00:38:57,798 --> 00:39:00,874
And from that point,
you look back

605
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:05,505
and you realize how small
you are in the world.

606
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:07,407
Don't you feel like that
up here, Norman?

607
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:08,829
That you're connected
to something

608
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:11,878
so much larger than ourselves?

609
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:30,697
What the hell is that?

610
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:32,999
Holy crap.

611
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,635
It's one of the pot fields.
I've heard about them,

612
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:37,270
but I've never
actually seen one.

613
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:39,605
What pot fields?
What are you talking about?

614
00:39:39,673 --> 00:39:40,840
Hey! Hey!

615
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:41,941
What the hell
are you doing there?

616
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:43,810
Emma, we need to run.

617
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:45,745
- Hey! Hey!
- We need to run.

618
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:51,317
Come on.
Come on, Emma!

619
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:05,298
Shh, get down.
Don't even breathe.

620
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,899
Sorry.

621
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,614
Aah!

622
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,890
Aah!

623
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:36,562
Norman, it's the shed.

624
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:37,797
From the pictures.

625
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:40,867
We can't stop now.

626
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:54,714
Come on, Emma!

627
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:02,588
Come on, Emma.

628
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:08,961
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

629
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:12,365
Go, go, go!

630
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:13,800
Come on!

631
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,436
Go, go!

632
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:33,986
Keep moving, let's go.

633
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:37,356
Let's go, let's go, come on.

634
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:53,539
Let's go.
Let's go.
