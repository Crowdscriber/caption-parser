1
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,161
- Here.
- Shit.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,482
Come on. Hurry up.

3
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,650
Got it?

4
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,043
Shh.

5
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,803
Let’s go shopping-

6
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,244
I'm a firm believer in karma.

7
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,804
And I think this situation was attracted into
my life as a huge learning lesson for me...

8
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,726
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.

9
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,771
I want to lead a huge charity organization.

10
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,525
I want to lead a country
one day, for all I know.

11
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,084
Girls, time to get up! Let’s go!

12
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,522
Come on, girls.

13
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,441
Oh, my Lord.
You were so out of control last night.

14
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,565
What about you?
You were all over that old manager guy.

15
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,170
Girls!

16
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,882
Time for your Adderall.

17
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,808
What time did you guys get home last night?

18
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,089
- Uh, late.
- Mm-hmm?

19
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,243
- And you know it’s a school night.
- We know.

20
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,368
Yeah? Okay.

21
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,769
Well, let's do our morning prayer, okay?

22
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,890
And then, at 8:00, we’ll meet
in the living room for today’s lesson.

23
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,770
Okay? Does that sound good?

24
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,161
- Mm-hmm.
- Let’s go.

25
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,765
Okay-

26
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,571
My chief aim in life
is to continually strive...

27
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,009
to be the best person that I can be
for the greater good of the planet...

28
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,765
and everyone who walks on it.

29
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,569
And so it is.

30
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,563
- And so it is.
- Whoo!

31
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,571
- Have a good ﬁrst day, Marc.
- Thanks.

32
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,120
- Hope you like it here.
- Thanks.

33
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,842
- Oh, my God.
- Who’s that?

34
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,649
- Yeah.
- Really.

35
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,089
I told her.

36
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,208
What did I tell you?

37
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,527
Whatever.

38
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,886
Take a seat.

39
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,884
Soldier boy. No, he’s just a soldier.

40
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,727
I don’t know what that is.

41
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,609
What?

42
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,368
Watch it. Loser.

43
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,285
Bye.

44
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,405
- Hey, new kid.
- Hey.

45
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,006
- You got Jamis for English?
- Yeah.

46
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,566
He’s the worst. He’s a real perv.

47
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,961
Oh, okay. I'll watch out. Thanks.

48
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,805

52
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,806
How'd you end up in the dropout school?

53
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Well, l got kicked out of my last school
for having too many absences, so-

54
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,762
You know. What about you?

55
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,089
For having substances
you’re not supposed to have at school.

56
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,804
See you around.

57
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,405

- That’s crazy.
- I know.

114
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,161
People leave 'em open
with credit cards and cash.

115
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,322
Look, Marc. We got, like, 400 bucks.

<i>How did you meet Rebecca?</i>

118
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,290
I met Rebecca in school after
I'd moved back and went to Indian Hills.

119
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,045
Um, I went there
'cause I had a lot of absences.

120
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,570
I didn’t want to go to school. I had
a lot of self-loathing and anxiety issues.

121
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,689
- I thought that I was ugly.
- You’re not ugly.

122
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,362
I know I'm not ugly. I just-

123
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,881
I don’t know. I never saw myself
as an A-list-looking guy.

124
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,971
Um, but I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers.

125
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,441
But I was always self-conscious that I wasn’t,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

126
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,288
Want a ride?

127
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,728
Hey, where we going?

128
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,848
Wherever we want.

129
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,809
Okay-

130
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,286
Do you know anybody that’s out of town?

131
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,964
Um-

132
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,761
Yeah, this kid Evan.
His family went to Jamaica. Why?

133
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,329
I went into an unlocked house
a few weeks ago...

134
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,721
- found a bunch of cash.
- Oh, shit.

135
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,370
- Where does Evan live?
- Woodland Hills.

136
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,088
How well do you know Evan?

137
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,126
I mean, we met up a few times.

138
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,127
He’s pretty hot.

139
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,322
It's a nice place.

140
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,003
Fuck. We need to get out of here.

141
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,560
It's fine. Don't freak out.

144
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,602
Lindsay has this one.

145
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,728
I think we need to get out of here.

146
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,724
Oh, yeah.

147
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,802
What is it?

148
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,930
No way.

149
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,769
What the fuck?

150
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,370
Get in.

151
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,165
Fuck!

152
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,922
Where’d you get the keys?

153
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,002
I got them on the way out.

154
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,406
How long's Evan in Jamaica?

155
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,770
This is so cute.

156
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,604
Yeah.

157
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,521
- You need a pair of these.
- Perfect.

158
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,124
Would this be good on me?

159
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,929
This would look so good on you.

160
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,287
What do you think about this?

161
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,523
Oh, my God. That looks so cute.

162
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,329
Oh, no.

163
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,920
- That’s disgusting.
- How about this?

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,081
That’s amazing.

165
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,806
- Right?
- Yeah. Look at 'em.

166
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,608
Perfect.

167
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,645
Picture.

168
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,324
Hurry UP-

169
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,802
Yo, Rob! What’s up?

170
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,121
- Hey, Chloe. Chloe, come on in.

171
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,487
- Yeah, yeah. He should be around.
- For sure.

172
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,090
When’s he coming?

173
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,527
- Yo, sluts!

174
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,886
What’s this?

175
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,200
- My homey Marc.
- Hey.

176
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,203
- Hi, |’m Nicki. This is Sam.
- Hi.

177
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,681
- We used to go to school with them.
- Are they sisters?

178
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,206
No, they’ve known each other
since they were, like, three.

179
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,045
They took Sam in.
I don’t know what happened to her mom.

180
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,886
Oh, my God.
Jude Law totally keeps texting me.

181
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,530
I'll probably meet him later.

182
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,285
Yeah, I bet you’re really
gonna hesitate on that one.

183
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,045
- Bitch, you’re just jealous.
- Suck my dick.

184
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,844
You did text him, like, 50 times.

185
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,127
- I did not!
- Yeah, you did.

186
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,804
Really?

187
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,128
That’s Kirsten Dunst.

188
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
Come on, Chloe.
Where’s that bottle service?

189
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,082
- Let’s get that going.
- Working on it, bro.

190
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,723
Girls.

191
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,689
- Ricky.
- Hey, baby.

192
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,328
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,641
- You guys have everything you need?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,929
Hey, Nicki. There’s some photographers
out here for fashion week.

195
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,207
- I think you might want to meet them.
- For sure.

196
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,410
And we got some huge music manager coming,
some executive producer from Entourage.

197
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,847
It's gonna be a real party salad
tonight, right, so...

198
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,440
- let me know if there’s anything you need.
- Check with you later.

199
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,363
Okay-

200
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,723
Oh, my God. That’s Paris Hilton.

201
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Yeah. She’s here a lot.

202
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,128
- Take a picture.
- Sure.

203
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,721
- Hey. Ready?
- Right.

204
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Yeah.

205
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,928
- Come on!
- Come on!

206
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,242
Look at Sam.

207
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,207
- What is she doing?
- I don’t know.

208
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,923
Drinks up.

209
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,168
I literally thought I was gonna die.

210
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,810
- Homey.
- Yo, bitches.

211
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,803
- Dog, what’s up?
- Thought you might want one.

212
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,202
Oh, you’re the best. I love your shirt.

213
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,805
Thank you.

214
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,768
I'll see you later, okay?

215
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,447
<i>I loved her.</i>

216
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,522
<i>I really did.</i>

217
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,444
<i>She was the ﬁrst person
I felt like was my best friend.</i>

218
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,162
<i>I loved her almost like a sister.</i>

219
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,561
<i>That's what made this situation so hard.</i>

220
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,128
Okay, this morning’s lesson
is on character development.

221
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,603
So in The Secret,
we talk about the law of attraction...

222
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,971
and how we need to be really careful about
who we surround ourselves with...

223
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,284
because we wind up being
the average of those people.

224
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,409
So we are going to make vision boards...

225
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,609
about people who are demonstrating
good character...

226
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,489
like Angelina Jolie.

227
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,531
So, what qualities do you guys
admire about Angelina Jolie?

228
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,281
Her husband.

229
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,203
Mm-hmm. Okay.

230
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,011
- Anything else?
- Her hot bod.

231
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,765
Okay. Okay.
Well, the hot bod is not a characteristic.

232
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,969
- But- Okay?
- How long do we have to do this for?

233
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,804
Well, we’re gonna do it until we ﬁnish...

234
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,769
and then we’re gonna move on
to the ﬂuorescence work.

235
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,690
Got it.

236
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,364
Okay-

237
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,242
Water delivery.

238
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,610
Come in.

239
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,160
- Where do you want this?
- Hi. The kitchen.

240
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,527
Okay. Back to work.

241
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,048
Mischa Barton got a DUI.

242
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,726
Really? Wow.

243
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,091
Paris Hilton's hosting
a party in Vegas tonight.

244
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,130
Where does she live?
Can you ﬁnd her house?

245
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,725
Um-

246
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,211
2342 Briar Summit Circle.

247
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,083
Let’s go there.

248
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,208
Do you think we could ﬁnd a way in?

249
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,365
Uh, looks like you get in
going up this hill by her house.

250
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,807
I bet she’d leave her keys under her mat.

251
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,724
Awesome!

252
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,767
Oh, my fucking gosh!

253
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,128
It's her pet monkey. Hi, little guy.

254
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,649
Okay. Come on.

255
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,005
Holy shit.

256
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,250
- Marc.
- Huh?

257
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,080
That’s amazing.

258
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,642
Let’s go upstairs. Come on.

259
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,083
- Come on.
- Okay.

260
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,130
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right?

261
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,685
No way.

262
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,650
Wow.

263
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,485
Wow.

264
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,208
- Becca, I don’t-
- Oh, my God.

265
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,047
Wow.

266
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,404
- Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here.
- it's fine.

267
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,562
Let’s keep going.

268
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,569
Come on.

269
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,963
Come on.

270
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,042
Look at her sunglasses.

271
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,487
These are Alexander McQueen.

272
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,645
Come on.

273
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,764
Whoa.

274
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,569
Oh, my God.

275
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,120
I know, right?

276
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,123
She has so much stuff.

277
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,928
It's amazing.

278
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,367
- We gotta go.
- Take a picture ﬁrst.

279
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,847
- Come on.
- Then we’re leaving.

280
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,446
Fine. Ready?

281
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,487
That’s cute. Let’s go.

282
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,765
All right.

283
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,610
- It's her nightclub room.
- Come on. Let's go.

284
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,047
Don't trip out. it's fine.

285
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,370
Oh, my God! No way.
I totally want to go to Paris’s.

286
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,568
Yeah, it was sweet.
We hung out in her nightclub room.

287
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,404
I got this.

288
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,926
- Oh, my God!
- isn't that beautiful?

289
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,368
That’s so ill! OG motherfucker!

290
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,363
- Damn!
- No way. How did you get in?

291
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,523
Dude, her key was under the mat.
We just walked in. It was so fucking chill.

292
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,409
- Under the fucking mat.
- You just walked in?

293
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,090
- Just walked right in.
- Holy shit!

294
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,889
- Just right in.
- To Paris Hilton's house?

295
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,725
Yeah.
And the best part is we can all go back.

296
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,962
We just have to check
when she’s going out to something.

297
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,449
Lindsay got another DUI.

298
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,646
- Wow.
- Really?

299
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,085
- Yeah.
- Surprising.

300
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,926
- Let me see.
- Ooh!

301
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,603
Try this with it.

302
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,085
Yes!

303
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,761
What do you think?

304
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,082
Try it with your hair back.

305
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,883
Oh, yeah. That looks classy.

306
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,601
I wouldn’t go that far.

307
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,251
- Leopard and zebra?
- What?

308
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,091
Yeah, you can’t have leopard and zebra.
You gotta choose one.

309
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,482
Okay, ﬁne. Whateves.
At least I don’t look like l’m 35.

310
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,245
- Oh! Damn.
- Harsh.

311
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,687
Come on. Let’s go to Paris’s.

312
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,887
I want to rob.

313
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,042
<i>I didn’t know what they were doing.</i>

314
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,041
I thought they were my friends.

315
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,526
It all comes back to, like, bad choices...

316
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,126
who you have as your friends.

317
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,771
And I know the truth will come out.

318
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,090
See? Look.

319
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,765
Okay. So, these are her sunglasses,
and that’s her bathroom...

320
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,444
and there’s her closet.

321
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,170
Um-

322

324
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,571

- Wow.

331
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,083
Whoa!

332

Look at all her Louboutins.

334
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,523
I know. What size is this? 11?

335
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,285
- These are amazing.
- Seriously?

336
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,442
Oh, my God.
Do you think they'll fit?

337
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,841
Not me. Probably you.

338
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,570
Oh, my God!

339
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,961

Ooh, leopard. Ah! Move.
No,no,no,no.

343
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,363
Oh, baby, I'll take these.
I'll take the Loubies.

344
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,761
- Oh. That's right.
- Can't wear 'em though.

345
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,808
Ladies. Excuse me.

346
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,041
Oh, my God!

Wait.

It's so cute. Oh, my God.

376

- Oh, my God. I love it.

379
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,971
She’s got leopard. Yes. Yes! Yes!

380
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,962
- That’s really hot.
- Leopard.

381
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,405
- Oh, my God.
- No. That’s mine.

382
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,170
- Yes, yes. No, it’s mine.
- Mine.

383
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,208
- Green doesn’t look good on you.
- You won’t ﬁt in here.

384
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,009
You know it doesn’t look good on you.

385
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,287
- Oh, my God. There’s another one.
- Good. Then take it.

386
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,805
Why does she have two?

387
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,848
- Oh, my God. Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!
- What? What?

388
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,647
Come on.
Let’s get the fuck out of here.

389
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,643
All right. In a second.

390
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,166
Wait. We have to show them
the nightclub room ﬁrst.

391
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,287
Rebecca, I don’t think-

392
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,328
Maybe not this type of pole.

393
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,243
" Oh!
" Oh!

394
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,482
Wait. Go down, go down, go down.

- Yes!
- Whoo!

396
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,491
Oh!

397
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,001
Party foul!

398
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,885
That was a mistake.

399
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,361
- Nice. That was hilarious.
- Fill it up, and we’re-

Shh, Shh.

403
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,522
- Fuck.
- Careful. Careful.

404
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,807
- Everybody. Hey.

405
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,321
Let’s toast this to-

406
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,324

<i>Whom.!</i>

408
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,804
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

409
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,047
No. I'm just driving.

410
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,451
l- I don’t know.

411
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,369
- Dude, just keep going.
- Where are we going?

412
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,647
- Just keep going straight. We’ll ﬁnd it.
- The car is a mess.

413
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,291
- Stop messing with the car.
- It opens and closes.

414
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,641
- Oh, God. Just go straight.
- Shut up.

415
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,088
You’re blind to everything.

416
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,449
You got your own little
dance party going back there.

417
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,010
I know. it's awesome.

418
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,241
<i>Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well</i>

419
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,921
My level was off the charts.
It was crazy.

420
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,685
They didn’t know how I was driving,
let alone still alive.

421
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,445
- That’s fucked-up.
- Yeah.

422
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,761
I have to pick up trash for fuckin’ forever.

423
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,049
- That sucks.
- What are you guys doing later?

424
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,771
I don’t know.
There may be a party at Madison’s.

425
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,530
- <i>I'll</i> let you know.

428
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,964
- You can’t take her dog.
- But he likes me...

429
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,883
and I could get, like, 500 for him.

430
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,849
Come on, Becca. You can’t take her dog.

431
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,844
- It'd be too noticeable anyway.
- Okay. I guess.

432
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,843
Bye, Peter Pan.

433
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,644
- Shit!
- Security. Shit.

434
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,120
Maybe over by the garbage can.

435
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,928
Damn it.

436
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,650
Keep going. Keep going.

437
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,331
Fuck!

438
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,485
- Oh, my God.
- I got nothing over here.

439
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,481
No, negative. Come on, man.

440
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,611
Go around the corner.
I'm gonna check the street.

441
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,682
- Are they gone?
- Shh.

442
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,684
Come on. Come on.

443

Shit.

What are your favorite hot spots in LA?

460
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,767
Hot spots. We love Lola's. We go there
all the time. it's a martini bar.

461
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,650
And I like the Dime. I like, um-

462
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,291
We always go to Les Deux,
just 'cause all our friends are there.

463
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,681
Like, the spot to go to.

464
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,650
And that’s- We always go to those places.
Those are our favorite.

465
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,485
So have you toned down the partying
now that you have a relationship...

466
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,369
or are you still going out?

467
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,410
Um, I've toned down a little bit.
I used to go out almost every night.

468
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,402
Oh, my God. I literally
love Audrina’s style.

469
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,242
Can you see where she lives?

470
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,569
She's going to Demi and Ashton's
Oscar party on Sunday.

471

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,168
I don’t need the glasses.

477
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,248
I like it. Oh!

478
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,765
Oh!

479
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,365

480
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,848

483
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,050
Come on.

- Can you fit through here?
- I'll see.

485
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,122
- What’s up?
- Hi.

486
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
Sweet.

487
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,441
Oh. Damn.

488
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,443
Okay-

489
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,122
I'm gonna stay on lookout.

490
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,760
Gross.

491
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,604
Did you guys hear that?

492
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,411
- It's fine.
- No, no. I think I heard someone.

493
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,324
There’s no one outside.
Calm the fuck down.

494
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,690
I hear helicopters.

495
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,201
We’re in LA.
Of course there are helicopters.

496
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,328
Don’t be such a little bitch.

497
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,561
- Well, that’s-
- I like this Rick Owens jacket.

498
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,008
Wait. What’s alprazolam?

499
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,209
- Xanax.
- Oh. Good.

500
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,968
Can we speed it up?

501
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,683
Oh, my God.

502
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,731
- Sam.
- Yeah?

503
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,442
- Look what I found.
- Oh-ho! No way.

504
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,602
Let me see that.

505
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,321
- Oh, careful.
- Wow. Where’d you ﬁnd it?

506
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,970
- Under the bed.
- Really?

507
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,485
- Whoa.
- Don’t- Don’t-

508
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,325
- Babe.
- You’re good. You’re ﬁne. You’re ﬁne.

509
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,562
- You're fucking crazy.
- No, I'm not.

510
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,291
- Holy shit. Be careful with that.
- What?

511
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,567
ls it loaded?

512
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,404
I don’t know.

513
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,084
Maybe.

514
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,050
- Dude, what the fuck? No.
- Maybe. ls it loaded?

515
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,724
I don’t know, and I don’t want to know.

516
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,450
- So just put it away.
- it's kind of heavy.

517
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,284
- VVhere'd you get it?
- it's kind of heavy.

518
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,681
It's a real gun. Of course it's heavy.

519
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,046
Really?

520
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,686
- Does it- Does it make you nervous, Marc?
- Sam.

521
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,570
- Does it make you nervous, Marc?
- Fucking stop. Please.

522
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,168
“Please”? Did you just beg me? Dude.
it's all- it's chill. Don't touch me.

523
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,044
Okay?

524
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,681
- Just put the gun down.
- Why? I actually like it a lot.

525
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,683
Oh, yeah.
What are you gonna do with a gun?

526
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,569
I don’t know. What?

527
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,610
- You’re not gonna shoot me with it.
- Can you not grab me, brother?

528
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,608
That’s good.

529
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,251
- Stop it.
- Did you just push a girl?

530
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,363
- Hi, Robbie.
- What the fuck are you doing?

531
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,681
- What’s up?
- What’s happening?

532
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,728
- I got you a present.
- You got me a present?

533
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,531
- Yeah, I did. You like it?
- Let me see. Let me take a closer look at that.

534
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,807
You want to see it?
Ready? it's right there. Right there.

535
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,448
Shit! Shh, Shh.

536
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,166
If I ever became not your friend
anymore, would you rob me?

537
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,888
I would never do that to you.

538
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,923
<i>Orlando Bloom is shooting
a mo vie in Ne w York.</i>

539
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,485
He’s there with Miranda Kerr.

540
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,689
I want to get some
Victoria’s Secret model clothes.

541
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,650
- Look, dude. Check it.
- What? What?

542
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,690
- It's a love letter.
- That's cute.

543
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,285
Aw.

544

545
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,090
Fuck.

Holy shit. Guys.

547
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,010
Sweet.

548
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,447
They’re all Rolexes. Guys.

549
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,441
Let’s go.

550
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,971
Well, it wouldn't work in the first place,
so don't worry. it's fine.

551
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,570
Shit.

552
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,802
Put it... there.

553
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,209
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Got a new room at my dad’s in Vegas.

554
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,886
I need some stuff to decorate it with.
Here.

555
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,681
- You fucking serious?
- Come on.

556
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,728
- Marc?
- One second, Mom.

557
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,362
It's time for dinner.

558
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,363
Be right there.

559
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,728
- <i>Hey, Chloe.</i>
- <i>Yo, home sk/Y/e t'. I/Vhat is going on ?</i>

560
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,007
Not much. Hey. Did you ever, uh-

561
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,526
Did you ever talk to Ricky
about the Rolexes?

562
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,809
<i>Yeah, yeah-
He is got' connects- Bring 'em b y la fer.</i>

563
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,042
Okay. Thanks.

564
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,763
- How'd your audition go today?
- It was all right.

565
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,127
I think it went really well.
They said they want to do a test shoot.

566
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,282
- Oh, good. That’s good.
- Yeah.

567
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,244
- What’s it for?
- Uh, Axe body spray.

568
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,361
Oh.

569
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,808
And we have a “go see”
for the BCBG runway show.

570
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,089
Oh, that’s huge. Good job.

571
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,171
And that’s a cute dress.
Did you get a new dress?

572
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,801
Mm-hmm.
Our friend Marc- he’s a stylist.

573
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,042
He let us borrow some stuff
for the auditions.

574
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,043
- That’s nice.
-Mmm.

575
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,090
His dad has a production company
that he helps style for.

576
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,083
What’s it called?

577
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,967
I don’t remember. Like-

578
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,283
- Something... “International.”
- Mmm.

579
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,531
Uh, Mom, we actually have to get going...

580
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,288
because we’re meeting this manager tonight
who could be really helpful.

581
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,160
Yeah, he knows a lot of
photographers and producers, so-

582
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,005
- A manager?
-Hmm.

583
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,528
I'd totally do that singer guy.

584
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,524
- But did you see how small his hands are?
- No. Ew.

585
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,602
Yeah, that could be gross.

586
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,930
Dude, we have to get in that video.

587
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,241
- I know.
- Does this look good?

588
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,566
Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in that?

589
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,563
I want to be hot but not desperate.

590
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,210
Totally.

591
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,722
- I think it looks cute.
- Yeah?

592
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,802
- Show me a different top.
- All right.

593
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,568
My butt look good in these jeans?

594
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,927
Your butt looks awesome.

595
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,405
Come on.

596
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,651
Hey, Ricky. You remember Marc.

597
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,007
Sure. Sure, I do.

598
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,881
So, Marc, what can I do for you?

599
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,041
Um-

600
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,327
I was wondering if you could, uh-

601
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,847
could sell these for me.

602
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,611
- Where’d you get them?
- Uh, we found them.

603
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,166
I see.

604
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,842
Well, what do you think?
Can you take them?

605
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,921
I don’t know.

606
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,728
I could see.

607
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,123
Tell you what.
I'll give you five grand for them.

608
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,884
Aren’t they worth a lot more?

609
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,689
Not stolen ones.

610
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,691
Okay. Sweet. Thanks.

611
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,210
Eva, I love those shoes!

612
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,330
Thank you.

613
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,604
Sure, kid.

614
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,647
Ooh.

615
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,920
Oh!

616
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,206
<i>When we went out, we got in everywhere,
and everyone loved us.</i>

617
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,005
<i>We had so many
beautiful, gorgeous things.</i>

618
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,450
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye now.

619
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,010
Thanks.

620
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,922
How many times
have you guys been up here?

621
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,049
- This is, like, our ﬁfth time.
- And she never noticed?

622
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,761
We never take enough for it to be obvious.
I mean, come on. it's Paris Hilton.

623
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,046
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

624
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,122
- She’s got so much stuff.
- I know, right?

625
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,680
- It's great.
- it's chill.

626
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,202
I don’t know.
You’d never wake up though.

627
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,045
- You’d sleep in all day.
- Here we go.

628
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,890
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit!

629
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,122
- Come on. Let’s get the fuck out of here.
- What?

630
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,725
- Let’s go. Let’s go.
- Hey, Sam.

631
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,767
- What?

632
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,523
Let’s go.

633
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,003
Okay. Let’s try it with this.

634
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,482
Now ﬁx your hair.

635
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,802
Oh, yeah.
You could totally pull this off.

636
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,161
You’re like an off-duty supermodel.

637
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,483
- Really?
- Yeah.

638
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,526
These Chloé sandals could work with it too.

639
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,886
- For, like, a day look.
- Yeah, deﬁnitely.

640
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,122
- Right?
- Here. Try 'em on.

641
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,689
- Hello?
- <i>Turn on K TLA.</i>

642
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,922
- What?
- <i>Now.</i>

643
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,446
<i>- After a break-in earlier this year-
- Oh, my God.</i>

644
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,040
<i>Audrina Patridge posted

645
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,326
Shit.

646

649
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,085
- Shit. Fuck. One second, Rebecca.
- Just chill out.

650
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,009
I can’t talk.

651
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,569
- Everything all right in here?
- Yes, Mr. Hall.

652
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,642
We’re sorry for making too much noise.

653
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,087
Everything’s ﬁne, Dad.

654
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,650
All right.

655
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,447
You’re stressing me out.

656
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,483
Carly keeps texting me.
it's so annoying.

657
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,927
Ew. She’s so grimy.

658
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,490
I know.

659
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,561
I think I'm gonna go to Sagebrush later.

660
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,648
Cool. Who’s playing?

661
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,564
I don’t know. A couple local bands.

662
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,801
I want to go to Rachel Bi|son’s.

663
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,087
She’s in Paris for fashion week.

664
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,682
Don’t you think you should
chill out a little bit?

665
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,411
Yeah. That news thing
totally freaked me out.

666
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,087
Nothing happened.
There’s no way of telling who it is anyway.

667
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,443
Come on.
Can you ﬁnd her house for me, please?

668
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,887
I want some Chanel.

669
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,887
- I don’t know.
- Come on. You’re my best friend.

670
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,924
Please? Let’s go get some stuff.

671

We’re going to Rachel Bi|son’s.
Wanna come?

672
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,770
<i>Hells yeah. Text me where.</i>

673

<i>Is she still dating Hayden Christensen?</i>

674

I don’t know.

675
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,723
Marc thinks so.

676
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,009
Come on.

677
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,490
<i>I think the biggest problem was
after the Audrina thing, nothing happened.</i>

678
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,122
<i>It gave Rebecca that self-boast that,
“Oh, this is okay. I can get away with this.”</i>

679
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,250
<i>And I think her projecting that onto me
made me think that it was gonna be okay.</i>

680
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,249
- Yo, Becca.
- Hey. What’s up?

681
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,970
I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.

682
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,929
- Yeah.
- And you took some stuff?

683
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,129
- Yeah.
- Oh, that’s so cool. Paris Hilton.

684
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,123
We’re gonna go get a drink. Lates.

685
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,641
I can't believe she went to
Paris Hilton's house.

686
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,806
What up?
Where have you guys been tonight?

687
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,168

- Yeah. She’s in Paris at fashion week.
- Shut the fuck up.

691
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,043
We just went in.

692
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,881
Yeah, look at their chill-ass
Chanel purses, dude.

693
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,169
What the fuck are you doing? Come on.

694
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,208
- Come on now.

695
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,406

<i>Rebecca’s, like, biggest conquest

<i>Her attorney addressed
the matter for the ﬁrst time.</i>

701
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,040
This is the dress she wore
to the Cosmopolitan opening.

702
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,242
Oh, my God. Let me see it.

703
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,288
I want to try it on. it's amazing.

704
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,444

Yeah.

706

until things calm down with my mom.

708
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,370
- I'll call you from there?
- Okay.

709

some of my stuff for me?

710

from the night of March 23,
when her house was burglarized.

719

Comparing the clips...

720
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,923
it looks like these are the same burglars...

721

01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,731
Crystal, shh! Crystal.

785
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,807
Crystal. Chloe.

786
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,882
Then Rebecca wanted
to go to Orlando Bloom's.

787
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,203
We knew he was away, from the Internet.
You know, you Google his name...

788
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,126
and it says Orlando Bloom’s shooting a movie
in New York, and he’s with Miranda Kerr.

789
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:05,486
So we just walked in.
The door was unlocked. There was no alarm.

790
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,244
The door was unlocked?

791
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,523
I'm really sorry about what I did.

792
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,648
Did you know Rebecca
was leaving the state?

793
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,205
l- I just knew that she was
going to stay at her dad’s...

794
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,806
because she wasn’t getting along
with her mom and her stepdad.

795
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,048
You didn’t know she was taking
stolen property...

796
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,930
across state lines
and leaving you holding the bag?

797
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,200
I thought she was just
gonna go see her dad.

798
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,480
- Metro Police. Are you Rebecca Ahn?
- Yes.

799
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,881
We have a warrant to search
the premises. Step aside.

800
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,644
Move back.

801
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,242
Bobby. Downstairs.

802
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,607
Jeff, upstairs. See what you ﬁnd.

803
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,845
Here’s your warrant.

804
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,048
Do you know why we’re in your home,
serving you a search warrant?

805
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,327
- Yes.
- Why do you think we’re here?

806
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,761
My friend Marc was arrested.
He called me from jail...

807
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,241
and said the police had done
a search warrant on his home.

808
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,840
- Do you know why?
- I've been watching <i>TMZ.</i>

809
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,890
They've been saying I'm a person of interest
in these burglaries.

810
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,251
Were you involved in these burglaries
of these celebrities?

811
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,970
No, I wasn’t.

812
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,563
ls there going to be any property
from those burglaries in this residence?

813
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,449
- No.
- Have you ever been...

814
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,000
to these celebrity homes
that were burglarized?

815
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,081
No.

816
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,050
Could any of your fingerprints or DNA
be found in any of the victims' homes?

817
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,848
No.

818
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,929
You boys having fun?
Find something interesting? What?

819
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,731
- Yeah, we got a few things on the list.
- Right on.

820
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,848
Anything else?

821
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,970
- Yeah, we also came up with these.
- Nice.

822
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,203
We found a jacket and jeans
that match a description by Lohan...

823
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,402
and some personal photographs
of Paris Hilton.

824
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,326
If I tell you where everything is,
would you let me go?

825
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,051
Hypothetically, let’s say I can help you
locate this property...

826
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,646
and tell you who has it,
how would that help me?

827
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,847
<i>Rebecca Ahn, thought
to be the ringleader, was arrested...</i>

828
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,571
<i>and awaits her hearing
with the other members.</i>

829
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,962
Stay tuned for the latest on the Bling Ring.

830
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,327
Did you speak to any of the victims?

831
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,368
I've spoken to all the victims.

832
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,125
Really? What did Lindsay say?

833
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,844
- Nicki. Nicki.
- Nicki. Nicki.

834
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,810
- How was it in there?
- It was not good.

835
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,484
Okay, thank you.

836
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:20,205
Nicki. Kate from Vanity Fair is here.

837
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,364
Can I get you something to drink?

838
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,841
So how is Sam related?

839
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,288
- We have adopted her.
- I was friends with her mother.

840
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,125
- Mom, this is my interview.
- Okay.

841
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,720
Yeah. So, she has been living with us.

842
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,485
Um, we met when my parents divorced...

843
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,040
and now my mom homeschools all of us.

844
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,408
<i>Based on the philosophy of The Secret...</i>

845
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,450
which is based on the laws of attraction.

846
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,251
- Can I talk, please?
- Sure.

847
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,924
I'm sorry.

848
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,049
The reason that we related so well...

849
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,330
is that my dad is a recovering alcoholic...

850
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,528
- and Sam's mom-
- She's a practicing-

851
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,810
is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.

852
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,451
And our moms became, like, best friends.

853
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,320
- We were, and she went off the deep end.
- Please!

854
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,210
- So, basically you took her in.
- Yes.

855
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,931
We took her in about six years ago.

856
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,243
But let’s, uh-
Let’s- Let’s get back to Nicki, okay?

857
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,170
Uh, so Adam here told me
that you do charity work.

858
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,005
Yes. We do a lot of stuff
through our church.

859
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,890
- Mm-hmm.
- it's called the Agape Church.

860
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,169
- Right.
- it's the religious science philosophy...

861
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,242
<i>beneath The Secret.</i>

862
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,450
Um, my other sister, Gabby,
is on a trip with them building homes.

863
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,649
And they do a yearly trip to Africa...

864
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,929
where they build wells and schools for kids.

865
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,122
Which country?

866
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,601
Um, I can’t remember exactly
which country...

867
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:06,847
but we do bake sales and, like, feeding
the homeless and that kind of stuff.

868
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,241
Okay. So there’s a little bit
of a disconnect...

869
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,971
between your positive pursuits
and what’s happening now.

870
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,042
Nicki, I don’t want you
to answer that comment.

871
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,601
Well, I think that I am-

872
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,603
Don’t.

873
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,160
I have,Hke,
a good statement to say about this.

874
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,049
She could speak generally.

875
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,843
I think this situation
was attracted into my life...

876
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,242
as a huge learning lesson for me...

877
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:36,167
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.

878
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,403
I believe that I am an old soul.

879
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,244
You are, honey. She is.

880
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,243
We’ve gotten to know Nicki and her family...

881
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,961
and we believe that she is an extremely
focused and honest young woman...

882
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,168
who has a lot to offer the community.

883
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,244
And we agree that there
has not been a disconnect-

884
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,288
that there were circumstances
that happened...

885
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,682
but Nicki herself
has continued to stay on her plane...

886
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,810
despite the tumultuous
experiences happening.

887
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,406
What’s your goal,
or life plan, if you have one?

888
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,529
I do. I think it’s myjourney...

889
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,047
to push for peace
and the health of the planet.

890
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,846
Nicki's expressed to me
a lot of her humanitarianism.

891
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,321
It's my main goal.

892
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,561
I... want to be a leader...

893
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,884
and do things that people really notice.

894
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,127
That's why I'm taking business-

895
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,443
so that I can be a leader...

896
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,444
and- and take a stand for people.

897
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,765
But I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers...

898
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,448
but I was always self-conscious that I wasn’t,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

899
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,170
And now you’re a star.

900
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,324
Yeah- On my Facebook page recently...

901
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,051
I had over 800 friend requests.

902
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,447
I accepted them all.
I mean, I didn’t even look at them.

903
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,524
And then I noticed someone
had created a fan page for me.

904
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,687
It's just kind of awkward
that so many people are loving me...

905
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,842
for- for something
that’s so looked down on in society.

906
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,402
If it had been, you know, something that
were to benefit the community...

907
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,562
or something like that, I'd love it.

908
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,851
But it’s kind of showing America has this-

909
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,845
this sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.

910
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,088
Does this look good?

911
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,121
ls this conservative?

912
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,601
If you like a secretary-style hooker.

913
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,129
Bite me.

914
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,842
Maybe with a jacket?

915
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,289
Well, it looks better.

916
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,001
Right?

917
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,407
Ah, you need lower heels.

918
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,291
Yeah.

919
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,488
Where are my kitten heels?

920
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,690
You’re so lucky
you weren’t on that video.

921
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,807
I know. Sucks.

922
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,645
Yeah. It does.

923
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,241
Maybe I need to wear something longer.

924
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,041
Do you own anything longer?

925
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,645
No.

926
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,410
Mom does.

927
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,085
- Can I have a ﬁve-milligram Adderall?
- Mm-hmm.

928
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,964
Okay, just remember what
we went over with Shannon.

929
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,964
They can’t prove that you were
in any of those houses, okay?

930
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,122
- I know, Mom.
- All right?

931
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,409
Do you want to just ground ourselves
really quick? Nicki?

932
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,050
I know there is one mind,
one presence and one power.

933
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,009
- Mom, shouldn’t we go?
- Emily.

934
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,808
What?

935
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,370
- Stop talking.
- She’s praying.

936
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,804
I know I'm always protected,
and karma cleanses myjourney.

937
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,724
Thank you, Lord, so much for this truth.

938
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,723
- And so it is.
- And so it is.

939
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,168
So it is. And you rock, girl. Okay?

940
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,169
Right here. Right here. Nicki. Nicki.

941
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:46,084
- Okay, Nicki.
- Hey, Nicki. Can we get a comment? Nicki.

942
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,207
Nicki.

943
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,246
- Nicki.
- Nicki.

944
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,731
Nicki.

945
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:57,002
This has been a very difﬁcult time
for myself and my family.

946
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,447
Thank you for respecting my privacy.

947
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,602
I look forward to my day in court.

948
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,086
Chloe!

949
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,121
- Marc.
- Marc.

950
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,281
Right here. Right here.

951
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,966
Hey, Marc.
How does it feel to be a rat?

952
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,041
Okay-

953
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,006
Remain seated. Come to order.

954
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:47,007

Judge Patricia Henley presiding.

956
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,690
Are all parties ready?

972
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,611
We’re here with Nicki Moore...

973
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,002
who just served 30 days for her
involvement in the Bling Ring...

974
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,971
and shared a cellblock
with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.

975
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,771
There were reports that Lindsay was crying.

976
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,050
With you being next to her,
did you actually hear any of this?

977
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,249
Yeah. I could hear her
crying the ﬁrst day...

978
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:06,211
which is really hard
when you’re just trying to be strong.

979
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,171
But I just really kept to myself...

980
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,289
and just tried to get through the day.

981
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,921
It's hard when you're
woken up at, like, 5:30.

982
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,843
And how'd she look?

983
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,241
She got to keep her extensions in.

984
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:25,530
A lot of the girls were talking-
“Oh, I had to take my weave out,” or whatever.

985
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,161
But, um, she was in orange like all of us.

986
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,567
Now, were you nervous being next to her?

987
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,440
Because you actually were accused
of being a part of the group...

988
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,409
that allegedly robbed her house.

989
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,407
Yeah. I mean, it was scary for me.

990
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,485
They were showing the surveillance video.

991
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,201
They were showing the story on TVs inside...

992
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,443
and, you know, little do people know...

993
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,808
that when that ﬁrst video came out...

994
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,282
I was actually in contact
with her manager...

995
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,331
to tell her who I believed
the people were who robbed her house.

996
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,001
I mean, when I get to tell
my side of this story...

997
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,923
people are gonna know the truth.

998
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,162
So, that’s nerve-racking.

999
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,647
She could think you robbed her house.

1000
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,485
Yeah. She could have.

1001
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,726
But, you know, anyway...

1002
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,566
you can follow everything about me
and myjourney...
