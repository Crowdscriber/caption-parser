1
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,827
Dad...

2
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:33,940
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:36,193
Port side, stick.
Starboard side, stick.

4
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,612
Move fast and clear
those mortar holes.

5
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:41,448
I want to see plenty
of beach between men.

6
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:45,410
Five men is an opportunity.
One is a waste of ammo.

7
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,788
Keep the sand
out of your weapons.

8
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,623
Keep those actions clear.

9
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,750
I'll see you on the beach.

10
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,828
Open mortar holes!

11
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,555
Over the side!

12
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,147
Port and starboard, over...

13
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,928
Jesus.

14
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,347
Thank you...

15
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,119
I said, what the hell
do we do now, sir?

16
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,663
Captain Miller!

17
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:32,749
Captain Miller!

18
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,752
Captain Miller!

19
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,671
Sergeant Horvath!

20
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,924
Move your men off the beach!

21
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,634
Go!

22
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,678
OK, you guys!

23
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,722
Get on my ass! Follow me!

24
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,558
What's the rallying point?

25
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,685
Anywhere but here!

26
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:05,658
The sea wall!

27
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:07,284
Move up to the sea wall!

28
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,161
Sir, I'm staying!

29
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:12,331
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

30
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,709
This is all we got!

31
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:18,796
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

32
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,467
You stay here, you're dead men!

33
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:37,399
Mama!

34
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:39,109
Mama!

35
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:46,408
Stay down! Stay down!

36
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,581
What are you guys?

37
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:55,626
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

38
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,170
Here to set up field operations!

39
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,089
Get rid of that crap!

40
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,426
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

41
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,684
I'm hit!

42
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,935
Briggs!

43
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,317
Get me out!

44
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,028
I'm hit low. God!

45
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,613
Medic!

46
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,657
Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

47
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,576
I gotta clear these obstacles
for the tanks.

48
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,121
All the armour's
foundering in the Channel.

49
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:32,455
Orders, sir.

50
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,167
You go somewhere else.
I'm clearing this one!

51
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,418
Come on, Briggs!

52
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:42,758
Medic!

53
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,339
Move! Move!

54
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,475
Move! Come on!

55
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:32,935
Move!

56
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,416
Shore party.

57
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,418
No armour has made it ashore.

58
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,587
We got no DD tanks.

59
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,674
Dog One is not open.

60
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:05,218
Who's in command here?

61
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,303
You are, sir!

62
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,140
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

63
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,434
You recognise where we are?

64
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:15,937
Right where we're supposed to
be, but no one else is!

65
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,607
Nobody's where
they're supposed to be.

66
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,359
Shore party.

67
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,028
First wave, ineffective.

68
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:28,534
We do not hold the beach. Say
again, we do not hold the beach.

69
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,787
Sir, we got the leftovers
from Fox Company,

70
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,747
Able Company
and George Company!

71
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,043
Plus we got some Navy Demo guys
and a Beachmaster!

72
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,670
Shore party.

73
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,089
Shore party.

74
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,556
Cat-F, Cat-F, C...

75
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,062
- Reiben here, sir!
- Anybody else?

76
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
Jackson, but that's about it.

77
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,066
Mellish here.

78
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,277
Caparzo!
DeForest's back with Wade.

79
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,655
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

80
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,866
Wade says he's all used up.

81
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,659
Find somebody you can help.

82
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,080
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

83
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,876
Get his attention.

84
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,961
Wade!

85
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,003
Yo, doc!

86
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,464
Wade!

87
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,474
Get him off the beach.

88
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,768
I got it!
We stopped the bleeding!

89
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,395
We stopped the bleeding!

90
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,939
Fuck!

91
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:41,859
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

92
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,903
Son of a fucking cocksucker!

93
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,489
Come on, Wade! It's Mellish!

94
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,366
Wade!

95
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:53,288
We found Miller!
Let's move! Let's move!

96
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:56,416
Oh, God. Oh, God.

97
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,590
This is all?
This is all that's made it?

98
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,425
We got scattered
pretty bad, sir.

99
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,386
There's bound to be more.

100
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:10,097
Not enough. This is not enough.

101
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,390
Dog One exit...

102
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:13,851
On the right.
Or is it left? Shit!

103
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:17,730
No, Vierville is west of us.
This is Dog One.

104
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,231
They're killing us!

105
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:22,610
We don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

106
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,945
Gather weapons and ammo!

107
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,657
Gather weapons and ammo!

108
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,826
Come on,
drag 'em in off the sand!

109
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,254
Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,

110
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:42,839
where's your BAR?

111
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:45,717
Bottom of the channel, sir.
Nearly drowned me.

112
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,761
Find a replacement.

113
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:52,682
Bangalores!
Bring up some bangalores!

114
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:55,936
Grenades, grenades!

115
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,688
Get 'em over here!

116
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,150
Bangalores up the line!

117
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,319
Bangalores up the line!

118
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,697
Heads up!
Bangers coming your way!

119
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,991
Come on, come on, come on!

120
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:10,159
Jackson here, sir!

121
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:11,452
Reiben back, sir!

122
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,420
One more. Give me one more.

123
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,635
Oh, my God, it hurts!

124
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,053
I'm gonna die!

125
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:31,556
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

126
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:32,765
Oh, my God!

127
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,852
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

128
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,645
Almost got it.

129
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,730
Jesus!

130
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,566
Lucky bastard.

131
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,944
Keep it moving. You got it?

132
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:47,614
God! God, help me!

133
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:50,033
You're not gonna die.

134
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:52,869
You're fine. Don't look at it.

135
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:56,707
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

136
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,003
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

137
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,686
We're in business! Defilade!

138
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,688
Other side of the hole!

139
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,370
That's it! Let's go!

140
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,875
Inspected. Morphine.

141
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,839
Routine.

142
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,721
Priority.

143
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:55,392
He's gone.

144
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:10,658
Son of a...

145
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,827
Get in there.

146
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,287
Fuck. I can't move.

147
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,414
Mellish, give me your bayonet.

148
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,896
Two MG-42s and two mortars.

149
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,106
Add 20, left 30.

150
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,402
There's a little defilade,

151
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:48,739
but it's the perfect position
if we get some armour.

152
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:51,700
We gotta open up this draw!
Get this draw open.

153
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:53,786
Reiben, Mellish,
let's get into the war!

154
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,956
Grab some cover and put
some fire on that crew.

155
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,002
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk,
get ready.

156
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,505
Covering fire!

157
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:10,386
Go, go, go!

158
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:25,569
Goddamn firing squad.

159
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:28,905
It's the only way
we can get everybody out.

160
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,450
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!

161
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,368
You're next!

162
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:37,831
- Why not hand out blindfolds?
- All we'll do here is die.

163
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:39,750
Covering fire!

164
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:44,171
Go, go, go!

165
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:45,256
Come on!

166
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,174
Come on! Come on!

167
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,676
Go, Goddamit!

168
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,607
Jackson.

169
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,691
Sir.

170
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,401
See that impact crater?

171
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,611
Yes, sir.

172
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:10,824
That should give complete
defilade from that machine gun.

173
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:13,159
Wait for my command.

174
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:19,499
Go!

175
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:34,181
Captain, if your mother
saw that, she'd be very upset.

176
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:36,892
I thought you were my mother.

177
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:40,438
Be not thou far from me,
O Lord.

178
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,904
My God, I am sorry
for offending Thee.

179
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:53,826
I detest my sins for having
offended Thee, O Lord.

180
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,036
Listen to me, Lord.

181
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,211
All my strength...

182
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,171
haste Thee to help me.

183
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,024
Dog One exit! Right here!

184
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,818
We're in business!

185
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:29,071
Move! Move!

186
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,198
Reiben.

187
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:13,742
- Let's go, sarge. Go!
- Reiben.

188
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:43,440
Come on, Doyle!

189
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:46,484
Sarge.

190
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,158
Flame!

191
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,035
Doyle, do it!

192
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:02,376
Don't shoot! Let 'em burn!

193
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:26,651
"Comrade?" You son of a bitch!

194
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:29,696
Lie down!

195
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,185
Cease fire! Cease fire!

196
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,228
Cut it out!

197
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:03,814
Cut it out! Cease fire!

198
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:06,400
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie Three.

199
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:09,570
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

200
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:13,241
I'm waiting
to tie in my flanks. Over.

201
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:14,867
What?

202
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:21,249
What? I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

203
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:31,635
What'd he say? What'd he say?

204
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:34,638
"Look, I washed for supper."

205
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,486
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

206
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,198
Look at this.
A Hitler Youth knife.

207
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:55,659
Now it's a Shabbat challah
cutter, right?

208
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:07,463
Keep it moving!

209
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:09,819
That's quite a view.

210
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,655
Yes, it is.

211
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:16,159
Quite a view.

212
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,634
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

213
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,469
"no doubt you have
received information..."

214
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:55,762
"Dear Mrs Jensen..."

215
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:57,430
"...the death of your son."

216
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,224
"...no words
can relieve the grief..."

217
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:01,601
"We have felt his loss
tremendously."

218
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:04,646
"He was a fine soldier..."

219
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:06,356
"We were involved

220
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:09,609
"in one of the most important
operations of this war."

221
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:11,653
"Al held us all together.

222
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:13,447
"He was always
first to volunteer..."

223
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,240
"...came to a clearing

224
00:29:15,324 --> 00:29:16,992
"where 4,000 troops had passed."

225
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:19,578
"Your husband served in a unit

226
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:22,206
"whose dangerous duty is
to place itself beyond..."

227
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,209
"...we all cherish
and hold so dear.

228
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:29,213
"The loss of Lee and others
like him is a distinct blow."

229
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:31,382
"I understand your desire

230
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:35,219
"to learn about circumstances
leading to his death."

231
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:30,568
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

232
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,657
These two men died in Normandy.

233
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,659
This one at Omaha beach.

234
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,119
Sean Ryan.

235
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:42,455
This man at Utah.

236
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:45,292
Peter Ryan.

237
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,257
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

238
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:56,428
Daniel...

239
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:57,804
Ryan.

240
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:59,681
The three are brothers, sir.

241
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:01,683
I've just learned
that this afternoon

242
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:04,228
their mother will get
all three telegrams.

243
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:10,818
That's not all.
There's a fourth brother.

244
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:14,655
He parachuted in the night
before the invasion.

245
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,615
He's somewhere in Normandy.

246
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:19,994
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

247
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,998
Come with me.

248
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,484
'Goddamit.'

249
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:15,864
All four were in the 29th
Division, but we split them up

250
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:18,908
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

251
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:21,202
Any contact
with the fourth son, James?

252
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:25,624
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

253
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,626
That's still deep
behind German lines.

254
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:31,630
There's no way to know
where the hell he was dropped.

255
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:36,218
First reports out of SHAEF said
the 101st is scattered to hell.

256
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:38,262
There's misdrops
all over Normandy.

257
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:41,974
Assuming Ryan survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.

258
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:44,602
In fact, he's probably KIA.

259
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:48,606
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

260
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:51,484
flat-hatting through swarms
of German reinforcements

261
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,235
along our axis of advance,

262
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,112
they're gonna be KIA, too.

263
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:20,263
I have a letter here...

264
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:25,644
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

265
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:27,854
So bear with me.

266
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,900
"Dear Madam,

267
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:35,904
"I have been shown in the files
of the War Department

268
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:39,283
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

269
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:42,661
"that you are the mother
of five...

270
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:48,292
"sons who died gloriously
on the field of battle.

271
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:56,426
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

272
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:59,554
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

273
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:03,641
"of a loss so overwhelming.

274
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:06,227
"But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you

275
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:09,648
"the consolation
that may be found

276
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:14,277
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.

277
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,616
"I pray that
Our Heavenly Father

278
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,619
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

279
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:27,082
"and leave only the cherished
memory of the loved lost...

280
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,835
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours

281
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,254
"to have laid so costly
a sacrifice

282
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,215
"upon the altar of freedom.

283
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,677
"Yours very sincerely
and respectfully...

284
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,178
"Abraham Lincoln."

285
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,451
That boy is alive.

286
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,412
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

287
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,209
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

288
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,294
Yes, sir.

289
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:26,102
We expected 32 tanks,
27 didn't make it.

290
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,563
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go in, Captain.

291
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,858
If we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

292
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,570
we'll have an entire division
stuck at Carentan

293
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,613
with its pants
around its ankles.

294
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,657
Well, you let me know.

295
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:43,411
Have Charlie Company hold
Vierville until we get there.

296
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,705
Yes, sir. Runner!

297
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,548
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door for us.

298
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,467
They misdropped, scattered
everything into the wind.

299
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,635
What's your situation?

300
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,221
Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

301
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,559
We took out towed 88s

302
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,395
here, here... and here.

303
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,147
They'd already gotten
four Shermans

304
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,232
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

305
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,652
These two minefields
are one big one.

306
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,153
We tried going through,

307
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:19,240
but it turned
into a high-density field...

308
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,658
little bit of everything.

309
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:23,452
Spreng mine 44s,
pot mines, A-200s...

310
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:27,665
the wooden bastards that the
mine detectors don't pick up.

311
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,627
This road here...
they placed Teller mine 43s,

312
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,463
I guess for our tanks...

313
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:36,591
from here
to the edge of the village.

314
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:39,302
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

315
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:40,678
Resistance?

316
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:42,639
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

317
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:45,267
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

318
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,520
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
von Luck Kampfgruppe.

319
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,647
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

320
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,899
We turned them over to MPs.

321
00:37:56,737 --> 00:37:58,697
What about our casualties?

322
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,908
Well...

323
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,659
the figures...

324
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:05,245
were 35 dead...

325
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,622
times two wounded.

326
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:11,669
They just...
didn't wanna give up those 88s.

327
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:14,630
It was tough,
that's why you got it.

328
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,257
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,634
John...

330
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,890
I've got another one for you.

331
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:27,060
- Yes, sir.
- Straight from the top.

332
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,654
We're taking a squad to Neuville
on a public relations mission.

333
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:39,698
You leading a squad?

334
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:44,661
Some Private lost three brothers
and got a ticket home.

335
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:46,038
How come Neuville?

336
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:49,666
They think he's part
of all those airborne misdrops.

337
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,545
It won't be easy finding one
particular soldier.

338
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:56,298
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

339
00:38:56,382 --> 00:38:57,841
What about the company?

340
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:01,637
We take our pick,
the rest get folded into Baker.

341
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,305
Jesus Christ.

342
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:05,683
They took away your company?

343
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:09,896
It wasn't my company. It was
the army's. So they told me.

344
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:13,649
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

345
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:15,443
Beasley's dead.

346
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:18,738
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

347
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,282
Not that I know of.

348
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,617
What about Talbot?

349
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,036
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

350
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,664
I'll try to dig up
another interpreter.

351
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:29,833
Assemble
at battalion motor pool.

352
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,876
Yes, sir.

353
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,253
- What we doing?
- Listen up... What?

354
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:34,629
What we gonna do?

355
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:38,467
You're going home with a hunk
of cheese in your ass, Caparzo.

356
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,303
You like it in the ass.

357
00:39:41,386 --> 00:39:43,263
Attention!

358
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,681
As you were.

359
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:46,475
I'm looking for Corporal Upham,

360
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:48,727
- Timothy E.
- I'm Upham, sir.

361
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:51,397
- You speak French and German?
- Yes, sir.

362
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,439
Accent?

363
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,401
A slight one in French.
My German's clean, sir.

364
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:58,070
You're reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

365
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:01,032
We're going to Neuville.
When was this updated?

366
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,950
As of 0830, sir.

367
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,494
Uh, sir...

368
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,245
These two axes advance south...

369
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,247
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

370
00:40:08,331 --> 00:40:13,837
- Yes, Corporal.
- Sir, a LOT of Germans.

371
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,421
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

372
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:19,801
No, I've never been in combat.
I make maps, translate...

373
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,804
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

374
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,139
My guys were killed.

375
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:27,142
But I haven't held a weapon
since training, sir.

376
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:30,562
- Did you fire the weapon?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:33,148
- Then get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:36,485
Sir, may I...

379
00:40:41,198 --> 00:40:43,576
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

380
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:48,998
Yes, sir.

381
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:55,171
Thank you very much, sir.

382
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:57,757
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

383
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,467
Take your time, Corporal.

384
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,557
Look on the bright side,
Corporal.

385
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,808
Yes, sir.

386
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:10,812
For one thing...
you don't need to carry those.

387
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:12,230
You'll need that.

388
00:41:12,314 --> 00:41:15,150
Need this. Yes, sir.
Don't need that...

389
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:16,088
You want your head blown off?

390
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:19,132
Don't fuckin' touch me
with those little rat claws.

391
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:21,468
Get the fuck back in formation.

392
00:42:22,636 --> 00:42:25,347
I was wondering
where you're from, that's...

393
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:32,146
Caparzo, is it?

394
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:33,731
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

395
00:42:33,814 --> 00:42:34,940
Got you.

396
00:42:35,024 --> 00:42:39,529
And saluting the captain
makes him a target for Germans.

397
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:42,990
So don't do it, especially
when I'm next to him.

398
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,744
Corporal, what's
your book about?

399
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:49,372
- Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

400
00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:52,083
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

401
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,127
that develop between
soldiers during war.

402
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,212
Brotherhood?

403
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:58,089
What do you know
about brotherhood?

404
00:42:58,173 --> 00:43:00,675
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

405
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:03,011
Ask the captain where he's from.

406
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:04,554
Yeah, ask the captain.

407
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:06,640
He'll tell you everything
you wanna know.

408
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:09,518
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

409
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:14,148
Why risk the lives of the
eight of us to save one guy?

410
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:16,900
20 degrees.
Anybody wanna answer?

411
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:20,654
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

412
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:22,531
I got a mother, all right?

413
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:25,117
I mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

414
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:28,412
Shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

415
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:31,541
Well, not the captain,
but the rest of us.

416
00:43:31,624 --> 00:43:35,044
"Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do and die."

417
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:40,717
What does that mean?
We're all supposed to die?

418
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,720
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

419
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:45,096
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,766
We have orders to follow.
That supersedes everything,

421
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:49,225
including your mothers.

422
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:50,602
Thank you, sir.

423
00:43:50,685 --> 00:43:53,104
Even if you think
the mission's fubar, sir?

424
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:55,857
Especially if you think
the mission's fubar.

425
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:57,442
What's "fubar"?

426
00:43:57,526 --> 00:44:00,237
Oh, it's German. Yeah.

427
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,573
Never heard of that.

428
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,116
Sir...

429
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:06,493
I have an opinion
on this matter.

430
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,538
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

431
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,749
Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,

432
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:14,543
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation

433
00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:16,545
of valuable military resources.

434
00:44:16,629 --> 00:44:18,339
Yeah. Go on.

435
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,508
Well, it seems to me, sir,

436
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,970
that God made me
a fine instrument of warfare.

437
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:28,099
Reiben, pay attention.
This is the way to gripe!

438
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:29,142
Continue, Jackson.

439
00:44:29,225 --> 00:44:30,518
What I mean, sir,

440
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:35,648
if you put me and this rifle
within one mile of Adolf Hitler

441
00:44:35,732 --> 00:44:38,151
with a clear line
of sight, sir...

442
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:41,613
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

443
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,156
Oh, that's brilliant,
bumpkin.

444
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:46,535
So, Captain, what about you?
You don't gripe at all?

445
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:49,538
I don't gripe to you,
Reiben. I'm a captain.

446
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,791
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down.

447
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:57,629
You gripe to me, I gripe
to my superiors and so on.

448
00:44:57,713 --> 00:45:01,592
I don't gripe to you
or in front of you.

449
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:03,552
I'm sorry, sir, but, uh...

450
00:45:03,636 --> 00:45:08,140
Let's say you weren't a captain.
What would you say then?

451
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:09,558
Well, in that case,

452
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:12,520
I'd say this is
an excellent mission, sir,

453
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:14,522
with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,

454
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:17,149
worthy of
my best efforts, sir.

455
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:19,735
Moreover... I feel
heartfelt sorrow

456
00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:22,530
for the mother
of Private James Ryan

457
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:26,910
and will lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

458
00:45:26,993 --> 00:45:30,079
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

459
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:33,667
- He's good.
- I love him.

460
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:45,137
Right.

461
00:46:27,013 --> 00:46:28,723
Thunder!

462
00:46:28,807 --> 00:46:30,141
Flash!

463
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:31,518
Upham, over there.

464
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,603
Reiben, you four go.

465
00:46:43,238 --> 00:46:44,865
Go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:46:50,246 --> 00:46:51,914
You're a welcome sight.

467
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:53,499
Our relief showed up.

468
00:46:53,582 --> 00:46:55,126
How many are you?

469
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:57,628
Just eight. We're not
your relief. Sorry.

470
00:46:57,712 --> 00:46:59,505
What do you mean, sir?

471
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:01,549
We're here for a Private Ryan.

472
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:03,342
Who? Ryan? What for?

473
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:05,845
- Is he here?
- I don't know.

474
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:11,893
Maybe on the other side of town.
The Germans cut us in two.

475
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:15,730
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

476
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:17,148
He dropped in with 101st.

477
00:47:17,232 --> 00:47:19,943
- Goldman, get me a runner.
- Runner!

478
00:47:20,026 --> 00:47:21,361
Come on.

479
00:47:25,615 --> 00:47:27,576
Jonesy, make a hole there!

480
00:47:29,077 --> 00:47:32,539
We got stopped by intense rifle
action from the eastward.

481
00:47:32,623 --> 00:47:35,501
The Germans have been
reinforcing regiments all day.

482
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:38,003
It's been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

483
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:41,507
Most of the German fire
is concentrated to the westward.

484
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,133
Who's on the loudspeaker?

485
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:44,552
That's Dagwood D�sseldorf,

486
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:47,304
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

487
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:49,515
The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.

488
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:53,144
"The Statue of Liberty
is kaputt."

489
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:54,770
That's disconcerting.

490
00:47:58,024 --> 00:47:59,525
Take the second left...

491
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:03,530
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

492
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:06,533
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with 101.

493
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:08,535
- Got that?
- Cover!

494
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,377
Go!

495
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:42,820
Those sadistic fuckin' animals!

496
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:43,863
Get down.

497
00:48:43,946 --> 00:48:47,116
They know we're not in contact,
they'll get the runners.

498
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,701
Why keep shooting him?

499
00:48:48,785 --> 00:48:51,537
Long as he lives,
he carries the message.

500
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:54,123
- We'd do the same.
- We wouldn't!

501
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:57,794
- Get ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:48:57,877 --> 00:49:01,172
Try again to let Captain Hamill
know we're coming.

503
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:02,549
What's the rest
of Neuville like?

504
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:06,511
Uh, next block's got
two-storey buildings both sides.

505
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:09,890
A lotta windows
and a square on the left.

506
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:12,434
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

507
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:13,560
Yes, sir.

508
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:21,110
Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

509
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:24,154
Try a left hook.
Two of yours, two of mine.

510
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:26,282
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

511
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:28,951
Reiben, Caparzo.

512
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:30,870
Fundamentals. Short runs.

513
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:33,372
High and low at the corners.

514
00:49:33,456 --> 00:49:35,750
Be prepared for close contact.

515
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:39,128
Go. Upham,
stay with Sergeant Horvath.

516
00:49:39,212 --> 00:49:40,338
Stay right here.

517
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:42,131
I'll wear him like underwear!

518
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:43,299
Stay with me.

519
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:54,728
Past the end
are the gates to the square.

520
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:55,812
Good.

521
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:05,322
Reiben,
where's the Captain from?

522
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:08,158
Figure that out,
you got yourself a prize.

523
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:09,576
300 bucks, I heard.

524
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,288
Company's got a pool.
Five bucks gets you in.

525
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,085
Easy.

526
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:23,466
It's around this corner.
Defilade up to those gates.

527
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,428
Somebody must know
where he's from.

528
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:30,932
Been with him since Kasserine
Pass, and I don't know.

529
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:32,558
My ankles are killing me.

530
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:35,520
I'll need a wheelchair
before this is over.

531
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:38,147
Ow! That's it. Oh, my God.

532
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:40,149
Got ankles like an old woman.

533
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:41,526
Like an old...

534
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:45,947
Reiben.

535
00:50:46,031 --> 00:50:48,158
So you don't even know
where he went to school?

536
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:50,160
Captain didn't go to school,

537
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:53,079
they assembled him
out of GI body parts.

538
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:54,539
Pay attention to detail.

539
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:58,126
I know where he's from 'cause
I pay attention to detail.

540
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,544
Hey, Upham...

541
00:50:59,628 --> 00:51:02,256
careful you don't step
in the bullshit.

542
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:08,512
Do it.

543
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:09,555
Thunder!

544
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:12,141
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

545
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:24,529
Upham, tell them
to show themselves.

546
00:51:37,459 --> 00:51:40,337
Ask where the Germans are.

547
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,134
What's he saying?

548
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:47,511
The children.

549
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:48,678
Take the children.

550
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:51,265
No, we can't take the kids.

551
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:55,352
We can't take the kids! No!

552
00:51:57,604 --> 00:52:00,524
They think
they'll be safe with us.

553
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:03,319
It's not gonna be safe with us!

554
00:52:03,402 --> 00:52:06,113
Are you nuts?!
Listen to the Captain!

555
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:08,616
They think
they'll be safe, sir.

556
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:10,576
Not gonna be safe anywhere.

557
00:52:12,328 --> 00:52:13,537
Put that kid back!

558
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,960
Put that little girl back!

559
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,129
Caparzo,
give that kid back now!

560
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:23,965
Upham, how do you say
"It's OK"?

561
00:52:24,048 --> 00:52:26,176
She reminds me of my niece, sir.

562
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:28,136
Get the kid back up there!

563
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:32,057
Captain, we could take her
down the road to the next town.

564
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,558
We're not here
to do the decent thing!

565
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:35,268
We're here to follow
fuckin' orders!

566
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,354
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

567
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,483
Cover! Cover!

568
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,200
Come on. No!

569
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:52,244
Goddamit!
Where'd that come from?

570
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:56,999
He was on the ground
before we heard.

571
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:04,382
That's where I'd be.

572
00:53:06,634 --> 00:53:07,927
I didn't see it.

573
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,555
450 yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

574
00:53:10,638 --> 00:53:12,557
I wouldn't venture
out there, fellas!

575
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,018
This sniper's got talent!

576
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:23,151
Please don't cry. I'll take you
back to your parents.

577
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:25,195
Please don't cry. Come on.

578
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:42,004
Captain.

579
00:53:42,087 --> 00:53:44,381
Hold on, Caparzo.

580
00:53:44,465 --> 00:53:45,549
Help me up.

581
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,301
I can walk. I can walk.

582
00:53:47,384 --> 00:53:49,094
Caparzo, stay still!

583
00:53:57,019 --> 00:53:58,396
All right.

584
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:03,401
Two clicks, left wind.

585
00:54:15,664 --> 00:54:18,833
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

586
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:21,127
Wade, you stay put.

587
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:22,629
Where's he shot, Captain?

588
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:27,592
- Can you see him?
- Stay there!

589
00:54:27,676 --> 00:54:30,137
Damn it, stay down!

590
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,555
What's up with you?

591
00:54:31,638 --> 00:54:34,975
What if you get hit? Huh?

592
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:37,019
Fish, come over here.

593
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:38,938
Carpy, put your head down.

594
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:40,773
Put your head down.

595
00:54:49,282 --> 00:54:52,326
O my God, I trust in Thee.

596
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,371
Let me not be ashamed.

597
00:54:55,455 --> 00:54:58,499
Let not my enemies
triumph over me.

598
00:55:07,676 --> 00:55:09,552
Copy it.

599
00:55:09,636 --> 00:55:12,013
Copy it and send it for me.

600
00:55:12,097 --> 00:55:14,516
You're gonna send it.
Put it down!

601
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:16,935
- It's got blood!
- I see it.

602
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,776
It's... It's to my dad.

603
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,445
It's got blood on it.

604
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:56,100
We got him.

605
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,227
Stay down.

606
00:56:05,235 --> 00:56:07,112
How bad is it?

607
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:09,489
Chest, maybe lung shot.

608
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,633
Get that 30 up the street!

609
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:34,140
Detail!

610
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:35,558
Clear up!

611
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:37,226
Clear down!

612
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,035
That's why
we can't take children.

613
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,171
Sergeant Horvath,
do an ammo check.

614
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,965
Upham... canteens.

615
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,300
Fill 'em up.

616
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,594
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

617
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:15,057
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the north-west corner.

618
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:20,104
Mellish, check the tower.

619
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,605
Right now. Go!

620
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,827
Fuck Ryan.

621
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:48,174
- Thunder!
- Flash!

622
00:57:48,258 --> 00:57:49,593
Come on in.

623
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,767
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

624
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,602
Somewhere across the square.

625
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:00,187
Across the square.

626
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,564
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

627
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,650
Take it easy. Sit down.

628
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:24,212
Jimmy T, find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

629
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:25,546
What? Up there?

630
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:28,591
How should I know?
Would you go look, please?

631
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,009
Thank you, you moron.

632
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,596
All right.

633
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,308
You guys just flake out
here for a while.

634
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:41,646
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

635
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:51,782
Jesus!

636
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:53,992
Drop your weapons!

637
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:55,202
Drop 'em now!

638
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:56,578
Drop the fucking weapons!

639
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:02,418
I'll shoot you! I'll shoot!

640
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,044
Drop! Drop! Drop 'em!

641
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:08,924
Now! Put 'em down!

642
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:25,608
Clear up!

643
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:31,781
Shit.

644
00:59:31,865 --> 00:59:33,408
Shit!

645
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:34,826
Clear up!

646
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:37,621
Clear down!

647
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,719
Enough to make you old.

648
00:59:52,886 --> 00:59:54,263
Let's hope so.

649
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:05,566
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.

650
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,568
John Miller, 2nd Rangers.

651
01:00:07,652 --> 01:00:09,695
Thank you.

652
01:00:09,779 --> 01:00:12,031
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

653
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:15,910
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance you policed him up?

654
01:00:15,994 --> 01:00:19,205
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

655
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,291
We lost most of our ammo.

656
01:00:21,374 --> 01:00:23,543
And one of our men.

657
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:26,963
Lieutenant, redeploy that
bazooka to the right side.

658
01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:28,173
Yes, sir!

659
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:30,175
And get Ryan up here.

660
01:00:31,677 --> 01:00:33,136
Ryan!

661
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,556
Ryan, front and centre!

662
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:37,307
Ryan!

663
01:00:40,686 --> 01:00:42,146
Here comes our boy.

664
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:51,614
Told you he was an asshole.

665
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:55,576
Sir, Private Ryan reporting.

666
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,161
At ease.

667
01:00:57,245 --> 01:01:00,748
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

668
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,585
This way.

669
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:06,170
All right.

670
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:07,630
Take a knee.

671
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:19,392
Private, I have some bad news.

672
01:01:27,776 --> 01:01:31,905
Well, there isn't any easy
way to say this, so, uh...

673
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:37,578
so I'll just say it -
your brothers are dead.

674
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:43,417
We have, uh, orders
to come get you...

675
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:45,002
'cause you're going home.

676
01:01:59,434 --> 01:02:01,936
Oh, my God.
My brothers are dead.

677
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:12,030
I was gonna take 'em fishing
when we got home.

678
01:02:27,254 --> 01:02:28,756
I'm so sorry, James.

679
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:31,300
I can't tell you how much.

680
01:02:31,383 --> 01:02:34,178
How... how did they die?

681
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:37,139
They were killed in action.

682
01:02:37,223 --> 01:02:41,352
No, that can't be.
They're both...

683
01:02:41,435 --> 01:02:43,563
That... that can't be.

684
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:47,608
My brothers are still
in grammar school.

685
01:02:49,235 --> 01:02:51,279
You're James Ryan?

686
01:02:51,362 --> 01:02:53,031
Yeah.

687
01:02:53,114 --> 01:02:56,326
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

688
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:59,204
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

689
01:03:04,876 --> 01:03:08,255
Well, does that... does that
mean my brothers are OK?

690
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:10,173
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

691
01:03:10,257 --> 01:03:12,217
Are you sure they're OK,
though?

692
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:15,262
We're looking for
a different Private Ryan.

693
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:17,139
How do you know?

694
01:03:17,222 --> 01:03:19,391
How do you know the foul-up

695
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:22,019
isn't that his brothers
are OK and that...

696
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,313
Lieutenant,
I'm sorry for the trouble.

697
01:03:24,396 --> 01:03:29,235
I just wrote them a letter...
I got to get home.

698
01:03:29,318 --> 01:03:32,989
I got to get home right now.

699
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:34,699
Shh, take it easy.

700
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:37,118
- Where's our Ryan?
- I don't know.

701
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:38,870
You in touch with your CO?

702
01:03:38,953 --> 01:03:41,664
- That figures.
- What unit's he in?

703
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:43,249
Baker Company, 506.

704
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:46,544
- The guy with the broken foot?
- Charlie, I think.

705
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:47,837
You think? Yeah.

706
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:50,674
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

707
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:52,926
Where was your drop zone?

708
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:54,386
Just inside of Vierville.

709
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:57,389
Vierville?
How did you end up here?

710
01:03:57,472 --> 01:03:58,598
You got me, sir.

711
01:03:58,682 --> 01:04:00,559
C-47 took heavy fire.

712
01:04:00,642 --> 01:04:03,645
Pilot tried to get out,
turning every which way.

713
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:07,733
Took more fire in the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

714
01:04:07,816 --> 01:04:11,195
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

715
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:14,865
Anybody there have a big mouth,
say where the drop was?

716
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:18,536
No, sir, but they had
the same rally point as us.

717
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:20,496
Show me.

718
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,123
My men are beat.

719
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:26,252
We'll hold up for three hours
then pull out after dark.

720
01:04:26,335 --> 01:04:30,256
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

721
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:33,176
Something with clean sheets
and room service?

722
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:35,178
How about a nice comfy church?

723
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:37,597
- We'll take that.
- Any news?

724
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,182
How's it all falling together?

725
01:04:39,265 --> 01:04:41,142
Well, we got
the beachhead secure.

726
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:43,979
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

727
01:04:44,062 --> 01:04:46,606
We can't pull out
till he's ready, so...

728
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:47,691
That guy's overrated.

729
01:04:47,774 --> 01:04:49,067
No argument here.

730
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,903
You got to take Caen
so you can take Saint-Lo.

731
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:53,989
Take Saint-Lo to take Valognes.

732
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:55,616
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

733
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:57,159
And Cherbourg, you got Paris.

734
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:59,578
Paris, you get Berlin.

735
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:01,663
Then that big boat home.

736
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:06,752
We sure could
use you around here,

737
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:08,629
but I understand
what you're doing.

738
01:05:08,712 --> 01:05:09,880
You do?

739
01:05:09,964 --> 01:05:13,217
Yeah. I got a couple
of brothers myself.

740
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,636
- Oh.
- Good luck.

741
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,846
Thank you.

742
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:18,598
No, I mean it.

743
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,225
Find him. Get him home.

744
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,694
What's with your hand?

745
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:34,072
I don't know.

746
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,494
It started when they brought
us down for embarkation.

747
01:05:39,578 --> 01:05:41,037
It comes and goes.

748
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:44,332
You may have to get
yourself a new job.

749
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:47,628
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

750
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:54,009
What?

751
01:05:57,846 --> 01:06:00,057
- What?
- Nothing.

752
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,060
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

753
01:06:03,144 --> 01:06:06,147
He was always walking around
on his hands,

754
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:10,151
and singing that song about
the man on the flying trapeze?

755
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:19,994
Yeah, Vecchio.

756
01:06:20,078 --> 01:06:22,455
He was a goofy kid.

757
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:26,751
Remember he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket,

758
01:06:26,835 --> 01:06:28,920
for Vecchio.

759
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,297
For victory.

760
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,715
Vecchio.

761
01:06:34,551 --> 01:06:35,927
He was so short.

762
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:39,890
- Wasn't he a midget?
- How did he become a Ranger?

763
01:06:42,517 --> 01:06:44,770
Got shot in the foot once.

764
01:06:44,853 --> 01:06:47,272
He could walk faster
on his hands.

765
01:06:49,274 --> 01:06:51,902
He could run faster
on his hands than...

766
01:07:07,668 --> 01:07:14,217
You see, when... you end up
killing one of your men,

767
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,387
you tell yourself it happened

768
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:24,603
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

769
01:07:24,686 --> 01:07:26,646
Maybe a hundred others.

770
01:07:29,816 --> 01:07:33,904
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

771
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:37,282
- How many?
- 94.

772
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:41,036
But that means
I've saved the lives

773
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,372
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?

774
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:46,458
Maybe even 20, right?

775
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,918
20 times as many?

776
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:55,927
And that's how simple it is.

777
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:59,180
That's how you...

778
01:07:59,263 --> 01:08:02,433
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

779
01:08:02,517 --> 01:08:05,687
between the mission and the men.

780
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,731
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

781
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:14,613
This Ryan better be worth it.

782
01:08:17,657 --> 01:08:20,577
He'd better go home
and cure some disease

783
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,581
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

784
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:29,545
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

785
01:08:29,628 --> 01:08:31,463
Amen.

786
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:35,718
Look. There it goes again.

787
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:37,136
Sir...

788
01:08:37,219 --> 01:08:40,139
are you all right?

789
01:08:44,644 --> 01:08:47,563
Look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

790
01:08:47,647 --> 01:08:49,440
Why don't you get some sleep?

791
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:52,235
I don't know how he does it.

792
01:08:52,318 --> 01:08:53,611
What's that?

793
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:56,322
Falls asleep like that.
Look at him.

794
01:08:56,406 --> 01:08:59,242
He's lights-out
the minute his head's down.

795
01:08:59,325 --> 01:09:00,660
Clear conscience.

796
01:09:00,743 --> 01:09:05,373
What's that saying? "If God's
on our side, who's on theirs?"

797
01:09:05,457 --> 01:09:08,710
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

798
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:10,212
Yeah, what did I say?

799
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:11,713
Well, actually,

800
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:15,175
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

801
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:17,135
How is that, Wade?

802
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,890
My mother was an intern,
she worked late nights,

803
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:23,851
slept through the day,

804
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:28,147
so the only time we got to talk
was when she'd get home.

805
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:32,818
So I used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake,

806
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:36,322
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

807
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,449
the faster I'd fall asleep.

808
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:41,702
That wouldn't have
mattered in my house.

809
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:45,123
My ma would've shook me awake,
chatted till dawn.

810
01:09:45,206 --> 01:09:48,209
That woman
was never too tired to talk.

811
01:09:48,293 --> 01:09:51,754
Probably the only time
she could get a word in.

812
01:09:55,467 --> 01:10:00,430
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

813
01:10:00,513 --> 01:10:02,933
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

814
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:05,769
Who? You... your mom?

815
01:10:05,852 --> 01:10:07,020
Yeah.

816
01:10:09,147 --> 01:10:12,025
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.

817
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,654
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

818
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:21,994
I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

819
01:10:22,077 --> 01:10:23,871
that she came home early...

820
01:10:26,207 --> 01:10:28,959
just to talk to me.

821
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:32,421
And I still wouldn't move.

822
01:10:32,505 --> 01:10:35,049
I'd still pretend
to just be asleep.

823
01:10:42,724 --> 01:10:46,311
I don't know why I did that.

824
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:02,286
We only got a couple hours.
Go to sleep.

825
01:11:10,753 --> 01:11:14,215
Captain? Sir?

826
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:17,218
Corporal?

827
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:25,601
How you doin' there?
You all right?

828
01:11:25,685 --> 01:11:30,023
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

829
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:32,483
Really?

830
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:34,611
How is that?

831
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:40,408
"War educates the senses,

832
01:11:40,492 --> 01:11:42,494
"calls into action the will,

833
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:45,664
"perfects the physical
constitution,

834
01:11:45,747 --> 01:11:48,708
"brings men into such
swift and close collision

835
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:52,087
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

836
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,881
Yeah, well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

837
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:56,967
of finding the bright side.

838
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:01,346
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

839
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,647
So where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

840
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:13,275
What's the pool up to?

841
01:12:16,988 --> 01:12:20,700
You know, I think
it's around 300, sir.

842
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:23,244
Well, when it gets up to 500,

843
01:12:23,328 --> 01:12:27,624
I'll tell you and we'll split
the money, how about that?

844
01:12:27,707 --> 01:12:31,669
Well, sir, I feel it's my duty
under your command

845
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:35,799
to suggest we wait until
it gets to a thousand, sir.

846
01:12:37,676 --> 01:12:40,345
What if we don't
live that long?

847
01:12:42,723 --> 01:12:46,268
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

848
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:47,311
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:47,394 --> 01:12:48,770
Yeah.

850
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:52,649
Get some sleep, Corporal.

851
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:53,776
Yes, sir.

852
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,804
Who's got sulphur powder?

853
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:07,226
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!

854
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,645
He needs a tourniquet!

855
01:14:08,728 --> 01:14:10,730
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

856
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,233
- Do what you can.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,734
Hold on, fellas.

858
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,319
It won't be much longer.

859
01:14:16,403 --> 01:14:18,905
How we doing here?

860
01:14:18,989 --> 01:14:20,365
All right.

861
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:22,826
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

862
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:24,911
Doc's in town.

863
01:14:24,995 --> 01:14:26,329
It's all right.
It's all right.

864
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:30,334
The 29th Infantry's breaking
through, they'll be here soon.

865
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:32,753
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

866
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:36,799
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, want to fill me in?

867
01:14:36,882 --> 01:14:38,634
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

868
01:14:38,717 --> 01:14:41,971
99th Troop Carrier Squadron
carrying 327th Glider Infantry.

869
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:45,808
This one was mine.
I was the pilot. 22 dead.

870
01:14:45,891 --> 01:14:50,021
I ended up without a scratch.
Took my co-pilot's head off.

871
01:14:50,104 --> 01:14:51,939
Well, who are these people?

872
01:14:52,023 --> 01:14:56,319
The guys we came with,
they headed off first night.

873
01:14:56,402 --> 01:15:00,448
Other guys keep showing up.
One, two, half-dozen at a time.

874
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:03,493
Then some officer'll
patch together a mixed unit,

875
01:15:03,576 --> 01:15:05,870
head off to make trouble, sir.

876
01:15:05,954 --> 01:15:07,872
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

877
01:15:07,956 --> 01:15:10,166
Baker Company, 506 of the 101st.

878
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,668
No, you got me, sir.

879
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:13,003
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

880
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,171
Check that squad.

881
01:15:15,255 --> 01:15:19,092
- See if Ryan's in it.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:15:20,344 --> 01:15:24,640
Smell that leg right there.
Is it south of cheese?

883
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:32,147
What?

884
01:15:37,695 --> 01:15:40,156
Keep moving. Keep moving!

885
01:15:42,325 --> 01:15:44,160
I'm Juden, you know?

886
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:46,662
Ju-den.

887
01:15:46,746 --> 01:15:49,749
Yeah, I couldn't
pry him out of there,

888
01:15:49,832 --> 01:15:52,043
- I'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

889
01:15:55,588 --> 01:15:56,589
Stars.

890
01:15:56,673 --> 01:15:59,801
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,

891
01:15:59,884 --> 01:16:02,679
Deputy Commander, 101st.

892
01:16:02,762 --> 01:16:05,181
Some fucking genius
had the idea

893
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:07,184
of welding steel plates on

894
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:10,187
to keep the general safe
from ground fire.

895
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,481
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me

896
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:14,399
until we were getting airborne.

897
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:16,485
That's like flying
a freight train.

898
01:16:16,568 --> 01:16:17,694
OK?

899
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,112
Gross overload.

900
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:21,907
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

901
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:24,994
I nearly broke both my arms
keeping her level.

902
01:16:25,077 --> 01:16:26,996
And when... and when we released,

903
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:31,083
I cut as hard as I could,
tried to gain altitude

904
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:33,127
and still keep from stalling.

905
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:35,171
Came down like a fucking meteor.

906
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:38,090
Here's how we ended up.

907
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:40,218
And the others,

908
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,845
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

909
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:46,891
We were just... we were
just too damn heavy, you know?

910
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,269
The grass was wet.

911
01:16:49,352 --> 01:16:51,688
Downward slope and all.

912
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:54,607
22 guys dead.

913
01:16:56,818 --> 01:16:58,653
All that for a general?

914
01:16:58,737 --> 01:17:00,864
One man.

915
01:17:02,657 --> 01:17:05,869
- Lot of that going around.
- Fubar.

916
01:17:05,952 --> 01:17:07,287
Fubar.

917
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:08,747
Fubar.

918
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,165
Fubar.

919
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:12,334
Y'all got that right.

920
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:16,630
I looked in a German dictionary.
There's no "fubar" in there.

921
01:17:16,714 --> 01:17:17,798
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

922
01:17:17,881 --> 01:17:20,551
There's more paratroops.
Find out if one's Ryan.

923
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:21,677
Yes, sir.

924
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,764
You might want
to check these out, sir.

925
01:17:24,847 --> 01:17:26,640
Dog tags.

926
01:17:26,724 --> 01:17:30,311
More than I really
want to count, sir.

927
01:17:30,394 --> 01:17:33,439
I've... l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

928
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,650
Jackson...

929
01:17:35,733 --> 01:17:37,235
start going through those.

930
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:38,319
Yes, sir.

931
01:17:39,862 --> 01:17:41,739
I'll help.

932
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:45,702
What do you think? He in there?

933
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:47,996
If he is, I'll find him.

934
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:49,873
I bet he is.

935
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:53,001
10 bucks says I nail him first.

936
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:56,713
- Who we got...?
- You don't stand a chance.

937
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:00,300
- You think he's in here?
- Just keep looking.

938
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,594
All right. Gary lanico.

939
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,929
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

940
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,265
All the Guineas
are buying it, huh?

941
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,684
Oh, come on,
not the right name.

942
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,936
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's your buddy.

943
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,230
We gotta find this prick.

944
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:19,737
Where is this sonofabitch?

945
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,949
Don't mix them up?
Keep them in your pile.

946
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,951
How will I know who's here?

947
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,829
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

948
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:29,247
Everybody be friends.

949
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,915
Cranky there, huh?

950
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,710
I got a winner.

951
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,170
What you talking about?

952
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:36,629
Ryan.

953
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:37,756
Ryan?

954
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:39,674
Look at that, Mellish.

955
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:43,428
You're a genius, you really are.
R- l-E-N-N-E.

956
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:46,890
That's Rienne. That's French.
You know what that means?

957
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:48,266
It means nothing.

958
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:52,646
- Three of a kind.
- All from New York.

959
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,231
Do you need
a hand with that?

960
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,732
I got a full house.

961
01:18:55,816 --> 01:18:57,734
Got you beat. Straight flush.

962
01:18:57,818 --> 01:19:01,238
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

963
01:19:01,322 --> 01:19:02,406
Ryan.

964
01:19:02,489 --> 01:19:04,116
Fuckin' unreal, this guy.

965
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,618
Do you need a hand with that?

966
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:06,994
Can you read that shit?

967
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:09,413
Jesus, look at
this poor bastard.

968
01:19:09,497 --> 01:19:11,165
They're not bulletproof, huh?

969
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:12,667
Guess not. All right?

970
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,168
What's between his ears?

971
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:17,672
Sort of what you
fellas got between your legs.

972
01:19:17,755 --> 01:19:20,216
We got to give him that.

973
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:22,135
Not bad, Jackson.

974
01:19:22,218 --> 01:19:26,681
What the hell are you doing?
The whole Airborne's watching.

975
01:19:26,764 --> 01:19:27,891
These aren't chips.

976
01:19:27,974 --> 01:19:31,561
- All right, all right.
- Put 'em back in!

977
01:19:55,502 --> 01:19:57,171
He's not here.

978
01:19:59,924 --> 01:20:01,258
Put 'em back.

979
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:04,178
Maybe we should split
into groups, huh?

980
01:20:04,261 --> 01:20:06,889
Wander the woods,
calling his name.

981
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:09,559
He'll hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!

982
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:13,354
That might be a little hard
to do, Captain.

983
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:16,649
Maybe the locals... Hey, you
know... uh, excusez-moi.

984
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,693
Parlez-vous Ryan, James Ryan?

985
01:20:18,776 --> 01:20:20,361
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

986
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:22,405
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

987
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:24,616
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?

988
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:26,534
Private James Ryan from lowa?

989
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:29,371
Anybody know a Ryan?

990
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:30,497
James Ryan?!

991
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:34,334
Hey, Joe, doesn't,
uh, Michaelson

992
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:37,462
pal around with a Ryan
from "C" Company?

993
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:38,630
I think so.

994
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:40,841
Bring him up here, would you?

995
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:50,810
You know Private Ryan?

996
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,353
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir.

997
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:55,022
Speak up, sir!
My hearing's not good!

998
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:56,357
It comes and goes!

999
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,568
A grenade went off by me!

1000
01:20:58,693 --> 01:21:02,280
Got it, got it.
Do you know Private Ryan?

1001
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:03,406
Who?

1002
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:07,160
- Private Ryan? James Ryan?
- Jimmy Ryan?

1003
01:21:07,243 --> 01:21:10,246
James. James Francis Ryan.

1004
01:21:10,371 --> 01:21:13,124
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

1005
01:21:13,249 --> 01:21:16,211
Get me a pencil,
something to write on.

1006
01:21:16,294 --> 01:21:18,171
Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1007
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:22,300
A small one, sir.

1008
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:24,428
Write this down.

1009
01:21:24,553 --> 01:21:26,263
James Francis Ryan,
question mark.

1010
01:21:26,346 --> 01:21:28,640
Iowa, question mark.

1011
01:21:28,765 --> 01:21:30,851
Do you know know him?

1012
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:32,144
Read the message. Look.

1013
01:21:34,813 --> 01:21:36,940
Yeah. Of course
I know him, sir.

1014
01:21:37,066 --> 01:21:38,567
Where is he?

1015
01:21:42,112 --> 01:21:43,113
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:46,242
We missed our drop zone
by 20 miles,

1017
01:21:46,367 --> 01:21:49,245
ended up by Bumville
or some damn place.

1018
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:52,498
We were coming here
to the rally point,

1019
01:21:52,582 --> 01:21:55,835
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1020
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:59,213
- to go to, uh... Ramelle...
- Ramelle.

1021
01:21:59,297 --> 01:22:02,091
Babysitting a bridge.
That's all I know, sir.

1022
01:22:02,175 --> 01:22:03,843
Great! Great!
Thank... thank you.

1023
01:22:03,968 --> 01:22:06,012
Write "thank you."
Read, and thank you.

1024
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:07,347
You're welcome!

1025
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:08,598
Assemble on me.

1026
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,394
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1027
01:22:15,522 --> 01:22:17,733
Ramelle.

1028
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:21,111
We're here. There.

1029
01:22:21,194 --> 01:22:22,279
Ramelle...

1030
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:26,325
is on the Merderet river,
just south-west of us.

1031
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:30,120
You know anything about
this bridge, Captain?

1032
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:33,582
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1033
01:22:33,707 --> 01:22:37,378
We can't push on Paris
without a deep water port,

1034
01:22:37,503 --> 01:22:39,046
Rommel knows that,

1035
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:43,593
so he's gonna try to get
his armour across the river.

1036
01:22:43,676 --> 01:22:48,639
Then he can hit us in the flank
when we turn to Cherbourg.

1037
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:53,853
That makes any village with a
bridge solid-gold real estate.

1038
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:16,168
Let's go.

1039
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:26,762
Captain.

1040
01:24:05,052 --> 01:24:06,678
What the hell is that?

1041
01:24:08,472 --> 01:24:11,642
A radar site.
Must be out of action.

1042
01:24:11,767 --> 01:24:13,852
Looks like there's
something in that...

1043
01:24:13,977 --> 01:24:16,397
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1044
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:18,440
See it?

1045
01:24:18,524 --> 01:24:20,401
Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1046
01:24:22,069 --> 01:24:24,447
What is it?

1047
01:24:24,572 --> 01:24:26,824
Machine gun. Probably MG-42.

1048
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:29,202
Jesus. Is that
what got those guys?

1049
01:24:29,327 --> 01:24:31,788
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1050
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:34,290
No, their patches are 82nd.

1051
01:24:34,415 --> 01:24:37,251
I don't know
how fast you guys are,

1052
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:41,130
but let's detour this way,
they'll never know we were here.

1053
01:24:42,298 --> 01:24:46,261
So, Captain,
let's just go around it.

1054
01:24:46,344 --> 01:24:50,056
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't.

1055
01:24:50,182 --> 01:24:53,268
I'm with Reiben
on this one, sir.

1056
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:57,064
- We left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1057
01:24:57,189 --> 01:25:01,151
The Air Force won't spend
ordinance on one machine gun.

1058
01:25:01,235 --> 01:25:03,362
Uh, Captain...

1059
01:25:03,487 --> 01:25:06,448
We skip it and still
accomplish our mission.

1060
01:25:06,573 --> 01:25:09,118
I mean, this isn't
our mission, right?

1061
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:12,746
That's what you want to do,
just leave it here?

1062
01:25:12,872 --> 01:25:14,874
Let them ambush
the next company?

1063
01:25:14,999 --> 01:25:19,420
No, sir, I'm simply saying, it
seems like an unnecessary risk

1064
01:25:19,503 --> 01:25:20,755
given our objective, sir.

1065
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,132
Our objective is to win the war.

1066
01:25:26,094 --> 01:25:30,598
Sir, I just, uh, I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1067
01:25:32,225 --> 01:25:35,770
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1068
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,462
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1069
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:02,506
Mellish, you hook to the right.

1070
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,383
I'll go up the middle.

1071
01:26:04,466 --> 01:26:06,260
Who's going left?

1072
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:14,143
Who's going left?

1073
01:26:18,356 --> 01:26:20,441
I'll do it.

1074
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:21,776
I'll go left.

1075
01:26:21,859 --> 01:26:23,486
All right.

1076
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:27,157
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1077
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:28,783
Yes, sir.

1078
01:26:28,908 --> 01:26:32,662
We keep pressure on till
he has to change his barrels.

1079
01:26:32,746 --> 01:26:36,458
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1080
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:40,545
- I should take the middle, sir.
- The way you run?

1081
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:45,008
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1082
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:48,053
Reiben, base of fire.

1083
01:26:56,228 --> 01:26:59,190
Mags and clips where
you can reach 'em, and...

1084
01:26:59,273 --> 01:27:01,942
and extra grenades
for the base runners.

1085
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:28,782
Hill's clear!
Four down and dead!

1086
01:28:28,907 --> 01:28:32,202
Upham, grab the gear.
Get up here!

1087
01:28:32,286 --> 01:28:34,246
We need water
and extra dressing now!

1088
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:36,332
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1089
01:28:36,457 --> 01:28:39,376
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1090
01:28:50,137 --> 01:28:51,639
Son of a bitch!

1091
01:28:51,764 --> 01:28:53,599
Get some sulphur on there.

1092
01:28:53,724 --> 01:28:54,851
Move my legs up.

1093
01:28:54,976 --> 01:28:56,728
More sulphur, Mellish.

1094
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:59,105
You're gonna be all right, doc.

1095
01:28:59,188 --> 01:29:00,607
How's it look?

1096
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,859
Wade, you're going
on a hospital ship.

1097
01:29:02,984 --> 01:29:04,319
More sulphur!

1098
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:07,030
Put my legs up.
Put my legs up.

1099
01:29:07,155 --> 01:29:09,866
I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em.

1100
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:11,785
Upham, give me your canteen!

1101
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:15,622
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1102
01:29:15,747 --> 01:29:16,915
Put some pressure on it.

1103
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,668
- You'll be OK.
- How's it look?

1104
01:29:19,793 --> 01:29:22,588
- Give him morphine.
- How's it look?

1105
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:25,299
- All right.
- How's it look?

1106
01:29:25,382 --> 01:29:26,842
Here comes the morphine.

1107
01:29:26,967 --> 01:29:30,554
Am I shot in the spine?

1108
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:32,306
You're OK, Wade.

1109
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:33,849
Am I shot in the spine?

1110
01:29:33,933 --> 01:29:35,768
Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.

1111
01:29:35,851 --> 01:29:37,311
Put some pressure on him.

1112
01:29:37,395 --> 01:29:38,729
Easy, easy.

1113
01:29:38,813 --> 01:29:40,147
Lift him up.

1114
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:45,403
It's OK, doc. It's all right.

1115
01:29:45,486 --> 01:29:47,989
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1116
01:29:48,072 --> 01:29:49,741
It's in the small of your back.

1117
01:29:49,866 --> 01:29:52,410
How big... how big's
the hole in the...

1118
01:29:52,493 --> 01:29:54,287
It's about the size of an acorn.

1119
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:55,538
You're fine.

1120
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:00,460
Put some pressure on it.

1121
01:30:00,585 --> 01:30:03,922
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1122
01:30:04,005 --> 01:30:05,131
It's all right.

1123
01:30:05,257 --> 01:30:08,093
Put some more pressure on it!

1124
01:30:08,176 --> 01:30:11,221
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1125
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:13,181
Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1126
01:30:13,265 --> 01:30:14,474
No.

1127
01:30:14,558 --> 01:30:16,935
Here. I'll put your hand on it.

1128
01:30:17,019 --> 01:30:18,937
Pressure on there.

1129
01:30:19,063 --> 01:30:20,981
Right there. OK? That's the one.

1130
01:30:21,065 --> 01:30:25,236
Oh, my God, my liver!
Oh, my God! It's my liver!

1131
01:30:25,361 --> 01:30:28,697
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1132
01:30:28,781 --> 01:30:31,534
What can we do?
Tell us what to do.

1133
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:33,327
Oh, shit.

1134
01:30:33,452 --> 01:30:37,832
I could use... I could use
a little more morphine.

1135
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:41,169
More morphine, sir?

1136
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:49,177
Give it to him.

1137
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:52,514
Give it to him.

1138
01:30:57,269 --> 01:30:58,270
I don't wanna die.

1139
01:30:58,353 --> 01:31:01,857
Here you go, Wade. Here you go.

1140
01:31:01,982 --> 01:31:03,483
There you go. There you...

1141
01:31:06,403 --> 01:31:08,739
Give him another one.

1142
01:31:15,913 --> 01:31:17,414
Mama?

1143
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,877
Mama?

1144
01:31:21,961 --> 01:31:25,715
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

1145
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,385
Mama! Mama! Mam...

1146
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:16,559
Reiben, hold him!

1147
01:32:37,622 --> 01:32:38,915
Not yet.

1148
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:44,713
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1149
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:49,718
Same thing for
those paratroopers down there.

1150
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:51,887
Strip that stuff.
Check for intelligence.

1151
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:55,140
Ask if he's the one
who shot Wade.

1152
01:32:55,265 --> 01:32:58,102
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

1153
01:33:01,772 --> 01:33:04,483
Shut up with that
filthy Pig Latin.

1154
01:33:06,318 --> 01:33:07,570
Jackson, you're hit.

1155
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:12,283
Shut up.

1156
01:33:12,408 --> 01:33:15,495
- It just skinned me, sir.
- Get it dressed.

1157
01:33:15,578 --> 01:33:18,206
You and Sarge
watch the perimeter.

1158
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,044
He says please don't shoot.

1159
01:33:23,127 --> 01:33:25,130
I don't care, Upham.

1160
01:33:26,673 --> 01:33:29,718
Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?

1161
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:34,973
- This is not right, sir.
- Help him with the bodies.

1162
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:39,394
What is happening?

1163
01:35:29,675 --> 01:35:31,677
American.

1164
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,097
I like American.

1165
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:44,565
Steamboat Willie.

1166
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:46,442
Steamboat Willie.

1167
01:35:46,525 --> 01:35:49,320
Yeah, Steamboat Willie.
American.

1168
01:35:59,831 --> 01:36:01,666
He's says he's not finished.

1169
01:36:01,749 --> 01:36:03,209
That's what you think.

1170
01:36:14,388 --> 01:36:15,681
Please...

1171
01:36:15,806 --> 01:36:19,184
I like America.

1172
01:36:19,268 --> 01:36:21,562
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1173
01:36:21,687 --> 01:36:25,232
Go fly a kite! Cat got
your tongue! Cool beans!

1174
01:36:27,693 --> 01:36:31,906
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1175
01:36:31,989 --> 01:36:34,158
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1176
01:36:41,374 --> 01:36:43,751
I say can you see...

1177
01:36:44,127 --> 01:36:47,505
I say can you see...

1178
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:49,424
I... I say...

1179
01:36:55,972 --> 01:36:58,016
Fuck Hitler.

1180
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,103
Fuck Hitler.

1181
01:37:08,735 --> 01:37:12,114
Sir, he says
he's sorry about Wade.

1182
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,992
He says he's sorry
about Wade, sir.

1183
01:37:15,117 --> 01:37:17,077
Captain!

1184
01:37:17,202 --> 01:37:19,330
Captain, this isn't right!

1185
01:37:19,455 --> 01:37:21,665
You know this. He's a prisoner.

1186
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,292
He surrendered.

1187
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,419
He surrendered, sir!

1188
01:37:35,972 --> 01:37:37,849
Tell him...

1189
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:44,314
To march a thousand paces, then
he can take off the blindfold.

1190
01:37:44,439 --> 01:37:48,193
We'll be gone, and he turns
himself in to Allied patrols.

1191
01:37:48,276 --> 01:37:51,488
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1192
01:37:51,613 --> 01:37:53,365
Can't take him with us.

1193
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:55,826
Our guys'll pick him up.

1194
01:38:06,503 --> 01:38:09,173
If he isn't picked up
by the Wehrmacht,

1195
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:11,216
then thrown back
into circulation.

1196
01:38:13,552 --> 01:38:15,930
Captain, you just
let the enemy go.

1197
01:38:16,013 --> 01:38:17,681
This is such bullshit.

1198
01:38:17,807 --> 01:38:19,100
Y'all got that right.

1199
01:38:19,183 --> 01:38:21,769
Bullshit? This is bullshit?

1200
01:38:21,894 --> 01:38:25,022
Shooting prisoners is OK?
It's against the goddamn rules!

1201
01:38:25,147 --> 01:38:28,109
The rules just walked
off with your friend.

1202
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:32,989
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do,

1203
01:38:33,114 --> 01:38:34,073
huh, Captain?

1204
01:38:41,706 --> 01:38:44,209
Get your gear. Let's go.

1205
01:38:46,586 --> 01:38:48,797
You heard him. Gear up.

1206
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:51,007
The Captain
just gave you an order.

1207
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,386
Yeah. Like the one
to take this machine gun.

1208
01:38:54,469 --> 01:38:56,763
That was a real doozie, sarge.

1209
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:58,348
Soldier, you're outta line.

1210
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,935
Yes, sir, one hell of a call,
to take this nest.

1211
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:05,356
But, what the hell,
we only lost one guy.

1212
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:09,026
I hope mama Ryan's happy
knowing that little Jimmy's life

1213
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,195
is more important than our guys!

1214
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,323
But then, we haven't
found him yet, have we?

1215
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:17,451
Get the hell off me!

1216
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:18,911
Reiben, get up.

1217
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:24,000
Gear up. Fall in.

1218
01:39:29,506 --> 01:39:31,424
I'm done with this mission.

1219
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:40,684
Sir.

1220
01:39:40,809 --> 01:39:44,730
Don't walk away from your
Captain, get back in line.

1221
01:39:44,813 --> 01:39:47,608
I'll go to the stockade
if I have to.

1222
01:39:47,691 --> 01:39:50,027
- I won't ask again.
- Captain!

1223
01:39:50,152 --> 01:39:51,403
This is bullshit!

1224
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:52,488
Fall in!

1225
01:39:52,613 --> 01:39:56,075
- You'd shoot me over Ryan?
- No, I don't like you.

1226
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,077
Just let him go!

1227
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,995
Are you letting this happen?

1228
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,914
Captain! You see this?

1229
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:05,793
- Captain? Sir? Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1230
01:40:05,918 --> 01:40:10,256
- Sir, we have a situation.
- I have a sixth sense, I know.

1231
01:40:10,339 --> 01:40:13,426
You don't kill Krauts,
but you shoot me, huh?

1232
01:40:13,509 --> 01:40:17,889
- He's better than you.
- Do it. Put one in my leg...

1233
01:40:17,972 --> 01:40:20,225
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1234
01:40:20,308 --> 01:40:22,101
Put your money where your...

1235
01:40:22,227 --> 01:40:24,938
You don't know when to shut up.

1236
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:26,064
Captain, please!

1237
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:28,525
What's the pool on me up to?

1238
01:40:28,608 --> 01:40:29,734
What?

1239
01:40:29,859 --> 01:40:33,029
- You coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, sarge.

1240
01:40:33,113 --> 01:40:36,533
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to now?

1241
01:40:36,658 --> 01:40:39,036
What... what's it up to?

1242
01:40:39,161 --> 01:40:41,622
What is it, $300?
Is that it, 300?

1243
01:40:41,705 --> 01:40:43,749
I'm a schoolteacher.

1244
01:40:47,711 --> 01:40:50,714
I teach English composition

1245
01:40:50,798 --> 01:40:53,342
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1246
01:40:53,425 --> 01:40:56,137
The last 11 years,

1247
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,723
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1248
01:41:01,142 --> 01:41:04,103
I was the coach
of the baseball team.

1249
01:41:06,898 --> 01:41:09,484
I'll be doggone.

1250
01:41:09,567 --> 01:41:13,154
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1251
01:41:13,238 --> 01:41:17,033
they'd think,
"Well, that figures."

1252
01:41:17,117 --> 01:41:20,954
But over here, it's a...

1253
01:41:21,037 --> 01:41:24,541
a big...

1254
01:41:24,624 --> 01:41:26,334
a big mystery.

1255
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:31,548
So I guess I've changed some.

1256
01:41:31,673 --> 01:41:35,344
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much,

1257
01:41:35,469 --> 01:41:40,057
my wife will even recognise me
whenever I get back to her.

1258
01:41:41,558 --> 01:41:46,772
And how I'll ever be able to...

1259
01:41:46,856 --> 01:41:49,567
to tell her
about days like today.

1260
01:41:52,194 --> 01:41:55,615
Ah, Ryan...

1261
01:41:55,698 --> 01:41:59,077
I don't know anything
about Ryan. I don't care.

1262
01:41:59,202 --> 01:42:04,958
The man means nothing to me,
just a name. But if...

1263
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:08,253
If finding him
so he can go home,

1264
01:42:08,378 --> 01:42:10,922
lets me get back to my wife,

1265
01:42:11,047 --> 01:42:15,176
well, then...
then that's my mission.

1266
01:42:16,845 --> 01:42:18,722
You want to leave?

1267
01:42:18,847 --> 01:42:22,726
You want to go off
and fight the war?

1268
01:42:24,519 --> 01:42:26,980
All right.

1269
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:30,067
All right, I won't stop you.

1270
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,403
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1271
01:42:33,988 --> 01:42:38,951
I just know, every man I kill,
the farther from home I feel.

1272
01:44:04,164 --> 01:44:07,334
By memories

1273
01:44:07,459 --> 01:44:11,213
Of days gone by

1274
01:44:11,296 --> 01:44:13,924
In my solitude

1275
01:44:14,049 --> 01:44:16,260
You taunt me

1276
01:44:16,385 --> 01:44:17,553
With memories

1277
01:44:17,678 --> 01:44:21,015
That never die

1278
01:44:21,098 --> 01:44:23,768
I sit in my chair

1279
01:44:23,893 --> 01:44:26,062
Filled with despair

1280
01:44:26,145 --> 01:44:27,980
There's no one

1281
01:44:28,105 --> 01:44:31,484
Could be so sad

1282
01:44:31,567 --> 01:44:33,402
With gloom everywhere

1283
01:44:33,528 --> 01:44:35,696
I sit and I stare...

1284
01:44:49,502 --> 01:44:51,254
Half-track! Cover!

1285
01:45:07,479 --> 01:45:11,442
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1286
01:45:31,296 --> 01:45:33,172
Move on their left flank!

1287
01:45:33,298 --> 01:45:34,507
Take their left flank!

1288
01:45:34,632 --> 01:45:37,260
Hold on, make sure they're down!

1289
01:45:58,365 --> 01:46:01,493
101st! We're coming out!

1290
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:11,087
That was a recon element,
second SS.

1291
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:15,383
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1292
01:46:18,219 --> 01:46:21,556
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1293
01:46:21,639 --> 01:46:23,641
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, Five-o-first.

1294
01:46:23,725 --> 01:46:25,393
Ryan, First
of the Five-o-sixth.

1295
01:46:25,476 --> 01:46:27,770
PFC Toynbe,
Third of the Five-o-sixth.

1296
01:46:27,854 --> 01:46:29,939
James Francis Ryan?

1297
01:46:30,064 --> 01:46:32,776
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1298
01:46:44,288 --> 01:46:47,541
Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1299
01:46:47,624 --> 01:46:51,211
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1300
01:46:53,339 --> 01:46:56,592
They beat the hell
out of us with 88s.

1301
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:07,061
Sir, if you're our relief,
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1302
01:47:07,186 --> 01:47:08,980
I wouldn't blame you.

1303
01:47:09,063 --> 01:47:12,066
Who's your CO?

1304
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:15,028
It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1305
01:47:15,153 --> 01:47:18,406
The best we can muster now
is a corporal.

1306
01:47:19,574 --> 01:47:22,076
So, what are you guys
all about?

1307
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:26,706
We're here for him. Ryan.

1308
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:28,333
Me, sir?

1309
01:47:37,843 --> 01:47:41,388
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1310
01:47:41,513 --> 01:47:44,099
Yes, sir.
Payton, lowa, that's correct.

1311
01:47:44,183 --> 01:47:46,769
What is this about?

1312
01:47:48,646 --> 01:47:51,524
Your brothers
were killed in combat.

1313
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,449
Which... which ones?

1314
01:48:02,535 --> 01:48:04,370
All of them.

1315
01:48:10,585 --> 01:48:15,965
Uh... On... on the level?

1316
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,969
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1317
01:48:19,094 --> 01:48:23,515
Uh... You might want
to take some time with this.

1318
01:48:23,598 --> 01:48:26,601
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1319
01:48:35,819 --> 01:48:39,323
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1320
01:48:39,448 --> 01:48:42,076
- Which one?
- All of them.

1321
01:48:46,497 --> 01:48:47,873
You...

1322
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:53,212
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1323
01:48:55,173 --> 01:48:57,216
Well, you're...
you're going home.

1324
01:48:58,968 --> 01:49:01,638
Our orders are
to bring you back.

1325
01:49:04,808 --> 01:49:06,518
Bring me back?

1326
01:49:08,645 --> 01:49:12,857
Corporal Henderson... I don't
mean to leave you short-handed,

1327
01:49:12,983 --> 01:49:15,193
but orders are orders.

1328
01:49:15,318 --> 01:49:16,987
When are you being relieved?

1329
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:19,614
Sir, we have no way to tell.

1330
01:49:19,698 --> 01:49:23,035
My orders don't include me
abandoning my post.

1331
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:26,079
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1332
01:49:26,163 --> 01:49:28,499
I don't see that it does, sir.

1333
01:49:30,042 --> 01:49:33,963
The Chief of Staff for the
United States Army says it does.

1334
01:49:34,088 --> 01:49:36,298
Sir, we have
to hold this bridge.

1335
01:49:36,382 --> 01:49:40,177
The 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the Merderet

1336
01:49:40,261 --> 01:49:42,555
except two,
at Valognes and here.

1337
01:49:42,638 --> 01:49:46,017
If the Germans take 'em,
we'll have to displace.

1338
01:49:46,142 --> 01:49:50,438
Private, your outfit stays,
but your party's over here.

1339
01:49:50,563 --> 01:49:52,774
Sir, I can't leave
until reinforcements...

1340
01:49:52,899 --> 01:49:55,151
You got three minutes.

1341
01:49:55,276 --> 01:49:57,195
Sir, what about them?
There's barely...

1342
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,155
Hey, asshole!

1343
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:03,785
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1344
01:50:08,123 --> 01:50:10,041
Sir?

1345
01:50:10,167 --> 01:50:11,418
That's right.

1346
01:50:20,844 --> 01:50:22,763
What were their names?

1347
01:50:22,888 --> 01:50:25,557
Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1348
01:50:27,268 --> 01:50:29,270
Wade and...

1349
01:50:30,771 --> 01:50:32,314
Caparzo.

1350
01:50:44,827 --> 01:50:47,413
It doesn't make any sense.

1351
01:50:48,748 --> 01:50:52,961
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why do I deserve to go?

1352
01:50:53,086 --> 01:50:56,339
Why not these guys?
They fought just as hard!

1353
01:51:01,011 --> 01:51:04,181
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1354
01:51:04,306 --> 01:51:07,684
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1355
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,111
Tell her that when you found me,

1356
01:51:17,152 --> 01:51:20,823
I was here with the only
brothers I have left,

1357
01:51:20,906 --> 01:51:25,077
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1358
01:51:25,202 --> 01:51:27,872
I think she'll understand that.

1359
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:30,082
There's no way
I'm leaving this bridge.

1360
01:52:13,419 --> 01:52:15,004
What are your orders?

1361
01:52:17,089 --> 01:52:21,135
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1362
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:24,555
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1363
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:27,225
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1364
01:52:27,308 --> 01:52:31,354
I don't know. What do you think?

1365
01:52:31,479 --> 01:52:34,524
You don't want to know
what I think.

1366
01:52:36,568 --> 01:52:38,570
No, Mike, I do.

1367
01:52:40,405 --> 01:52:43,700
Well... part of me
thinks the kid's right.

1368
01:52:43,783 --> 01:52:46,036
What's he done to deserve this?

1369
01:52:46,119 --> 01:52:50,499
If he wants to stay here,
fine, let's leave him.

1370
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:53,001
Yeah.

1371
01:52:53,085 --> 01:52:55,337
But another part
of me thinks...

1372
01:52:55,462 --> 01:52:58,590
what if by some miracle we stay

1373
01:52:58,674 --> 01:53:01,635
and actually make it
out of here?

1374
01:53:01,719 --> 01:53:04,054
Someday we might look
back and decide

1375
01:53:04,138 --> 01:53:08,601
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1376
01:53:08,726 --> 01:53:15,441
we were able to pull out of this
whole God-awful, shitty mess.

1377
01:53:15,525 --> 01:53:19,696
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1378
01:53:19,779 --> 01:53:22,490
Like you said, Captain,

1379
01:53:23,658 --> 01:53:28,037
if we do that... we all earn
the right to go home.

1380
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:33,543
Oh, brother.

1381
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:39,591
This is everything.

1382
01:53:39,716 --> 01:53:41,927
Two.30-calibre machine guns,

1383
01:53:42,052 --> 01:53:43,637
17 grenades,

1384
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,056
11 Hawkins mines.

1385
01:53:46,181 --> 01:53:49,476
You got two bazookas,
but only eight rounds left,

1386
01:53:49,601 --> 01:53:51,437
and assorted small arms.

1387
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,356
An arty round took out
our.60 mortar.

1388
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:57,985
Might as well be spit wads
if they use tanks.

1389
01:53:58,068 --> 01:54:01,572
- Which they're sure to.
- What you thinking, sir?

1390
01:54:01,655 --> 01:54:02,823
Well...

1391
01:54:02,948 --> 01:54:06,953
I think they're going to try
to whip around the flanks...

1392
01:54:10,581 --> 01:54:14,168
Unless we draw them up
here between these buildings,

1393
01:54:14,252 --> 01:54:17,755
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1394
01:54:17,839 --> 01:54:20,049
- Disable him?
- If we can.

1395
01:54:20,175 --> 01:54:23,636
Make the tank a 60-ton
roadblock, we'll have a chance.

1396
01:54:23,762 --> 01:54:26,348
Yes, sir,
don't let them mass anywhere.

1397
01:54:26,431 --> 01:54:29,309
Hit hard and fall back
to the bridge.

1398
01:54:29,392 --> 01:54:33,855
Machine gun moving, number two
up high to piss on their heads.

1399
01:54:33,981 --> 01:54:36,441
That would be the idea.

1400
01:54:36,567 --> 01:54:38,694
Jackson?

1401
01:54:38,777 --> 01:54:40,946
If we can, I'd like to get
you up in that bell tower.

1402
01:54:41,029 --> 01:54:44,241
- Yes, sir.
- Give you company if need be.

1403
01:54:44,366 --> 01:54:46,243
Yes, sir. Company couldn't hurt.

1404
01:54:46,327 --> 01:54:50,539
I'd say a.30 with about
1,000 rounds would be OK.

1405
01:54:50,664 --> 01:54:52,416
Parker, job opportunity.

1406
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,627
Not the worst idea, Captain.

1407
01:54:54,752 --> 01:54:58,506
But it all depends on knocking
out the tank here, right?

1408
01:54:58,589 --> 01:55:01,509
So how do you
plan on doing that?

1409
01:55:01,634 --> 01:55:03,094
Reiben's right.

1410
01:55:03,177 --> 01:55:06,180
As our esteemed colleague
from the Airborne pointed out,

1411
01:55:06,306 --> 01:55:11,352
what we got here is spit wads,
so how do we stop the tank?

1412
01:55:11,478 --> 01:55:13,146
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1413
01:55:13,271 --> 01:55:16,816
We could hit the tank
in the tracks.

1414
01:55:16,942 --> 01:55:18,777
Yeah, but with what?

1415
01:55:21,154 --> 01:55:23,448
We could try a sticky bomb.

1416
01:55:23,532 --> 01:55:25,075
Sticky bomb, sir?

1417
01:55:26,201 --> 01:55:31,206
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. It's in the field manual.

1418
01:55:31,331 --> 01:55:34,042
Well, we're out
of field manuals, sir.

1419
01:55:34,168 --> 01:55:36,170
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1420
01:55:36,295 --> 01:55:39,757
Right, you have demolition -
some TNT or composition B?

1421
01:55:39,882 --> 01:55:43,844
I got that bridge wired
with enough to blow it twice.

1422
01:55:43,928 --> 01:55:45,763
You can spare some, then.

1423
01:55:45,888 --> 01:55:49,350
You take
a standard-issue GI sock,

1424
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:52,770
cram it with as much
Comp' B as possible,

1425
01:55:52,895 --> 01:55:55,106
rig up a simple fuse,

1426
01:55:55,231 --> 01:55:58,109
then coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1427
01:55:58,192 --> 01:56:00,778
When you throw it,
it should stick.

1428
01:56:00,862 --> 01:56:03,656
It's a bomb that sticks.
A sticky bomb.

1429
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:08,828
You know a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, tell me.

1430
01:56:08,912 --> 01:56:12,833
This is good. Now we got
to surrender our socks.

1431
01:56:26,722 --> 01:56:28,349
Haul away.

1432
01:56:41,946 --> 01:56:46,033
Select the field of fire.
Cross with the bell tower.

1433
01:56:46,117 --> 01:56:48,536
I can cover 12 to nine here.

1434
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:55,376
- Easy!
- I got her!

1435
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:30,705
Here are the mines.

1436
01:57:41,674 --> 01:57:44,469
For being the best we can do,

1437
01:57:44,594 --> 01:57:48,723
that forward machine gun is not
in a terrible firing position.

1438
01:57:51,142 --> 01:57:53,144
And this position right here...

1439
01:57:55,772 --> 01:57:57,899
this is the Alamo.

1440
01:57:57,983 --> 01:58:01,778
They push us back here,
last man blows the bridge.

1441
01:58:01,903 --> 01:58:04,406
We only got a 30-second fuse,

1442
01:58:04,531 --> 01:58:08,911
so that last man better hurry,
or he won't be alive long.

1443
01:58:10,037 --> 01:58:11,705
Captain?

1444
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:14,208
Where am I during all this?

1445
01:58:14,333 --> 01:58:18,379
Never more than two feet from
me, and that's not negotiable.

1446
01:58:19,755 --> 01:58:22,007
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1447
01:58:25,011 --> 01:58:26,262
- Upham.
- Yes.

1448
01:58:26,387 --> 01:58:28,431
- Listen, all right?
- Yeah.

1449
01:58:28,556 --> 01:58:30,016
- Listening?
- Yes.

1450
01:58:30,141 --> 01:58:34,604
All right, we'll be displacing
and falling back like crazy...

1451
01:58:34,729 --> 01:58:38,733
So be Johnny-on-the-spot
with ammo or we're dead.

1452
01:58:38,858 --> 01:58:40,693
- Right.
- Understand?

1453
01:58:40,777 --> 01:58:43,780
- Johnny-on-the-spot.
- You all right?

1454
01:58:43,863 --> 01:58:45,198
Yeah.

1455
01:58:46,324 --> 01:58:48,493
When we shipped out of England,

1456
01:58:48,577 --> 01:58:51,830
I told the supply sergeant
handing out cigarettes,

1457
01:58:51,955 --> 01:58:53,498
"I don't smoke."

1458
01:58:53,623 --> 01:58:55,584
"I don't smoke."

1459
01:58:57,210 --> 01:58:59,379
Quite a situation, huh?

1460
01:58:59,463 --> 01:59:01,548
Unbelievable.

1461
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,591
Here.

1462
01:59:02,674 --> 01:59:07,137
Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1463
01:59:07,221 --> 01:59:09,181
Yeah, you got that right.

1464
01:59:11,851 --> 01:59:13,060
Fubar.

1465
01:59:16,564 --> 01:59:18,649
- Yeah, well...
- Fubar.

1466
01:59:18,733 --> 01:59:21,360
It'll be a real show, huh?

1467
01:59:28,993 --> 01:59:30,745
Take it easy.

1468
01:59:32,038 --> 01:59:33,414
Fubar.

1469
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:12,997
Who's that singing, sir?

1470
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:16,042
Edith Piaf.

1471
02:00:18,086 --> 02:00:20,463
What's she so upset about?

1472
02:00:21,589 --> 02:00:22,966
Her lover left her,

1473
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:26,594
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1474
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:29,806
That would do it.

1475
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:00,254
"Even life itself

1476
02:01:00,338 --> 02:01:01,922
"only represents you.

1477
02:01:05,051 --> 02:01:07,887
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1478
02:01:08,012 --> 02:01:11,474
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1479
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:13,226
The chorus.

1480
02:01:13,351 --> 02:01:16,312
"And you speak softly
in my ear...

1481
02:01:18,106 --> 02:01:20,316
"and you say things

1482
02:01:20,442 --> 02:01:22,569
"that make my eyes close,

1483
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,324
"and I find that marvellous."

1484
02:01:27,449 --> 02:01:30,577
Uh, again... Upham, uh...

1485
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:34,498
to be honest, I... I find myself
curiously aroused by you.

1486
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:39,628
Marvellous. No, it's...
it's a melancholy song.

1487
02:01:39,753 --> 02:01:43,674
At the beginning, she says,
"And then one day, you left.

1488
02:01:43,757 --> 02:01:47,553
"You left me, and, uh...
I've been desperate ever since.

1489
02:01:47,678 --> 02:01:50,973
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the earth."

1490
02:01:51,057 --> 02:01:55,227
Any more of this, the Krauts
won't have to shoot me.

1491
02:01:55,353 --> 02:01:57,605
I'll just slit my own wrists.

1492
02:01:57,688 --> 02:02:00,108
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1493
02:02:00,233 --> 02:02:02,151
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1494
02:02:02,276 --> 02:02:05,113
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1495
02:02:05,196 --> 02:02:08,658
What Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
said when I left for Basic.

1496
02:02:08,741 --> 02:02:11,202
What, "Don't touch me"?

1497
02:02:11,286 --> 02:02:14,039
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1498
02:02:14,164 --> 02:02:19,586
She tries things on in my mom's
shop, and she's, like, a 44-EE.

1499
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:22,381
- Double-E?
- These things are massive.

1500
02:02:22,506 --> 02:02:23,632
Those are big.

1501
02:02:23,757 --> 02:02:27,302
I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42-D.

1502
02:02:27,386 --> 02:02:30,639
So she's trying to squeeze
into this side-cut,

1503
02:02:30,722 --> 02:02:32,433
silk-ribboned,
triple-panel girdle

1504
02:02:32,558 --> 02:02:34,268
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1505
02:02:34,351 --> 02:02:37,521
And it's beautiful,
she's just pouring out of it.

1506
02:02:37,646 --> 02:02:39,648
It's beautiful, and she can tell

1507
02:02:39,773 --> 02:02:43,861
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

1508
02:02:43,986 --> 02:02:45,988
And she says,
"Richard, calm down."

1509
02:02:46,113 --> 02:02:48,532
And says,
"When you're over there,

1510
02:02:48,658 --> 02:02:51,536
"if you see anything
that upsets you,

1511
02:02:51,661 --> 02:02:56,332
"just close your eyes and think
of these. You understand?"

1512
02:02:58,167 --> 02:03:00,169
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1513
02:03:13,266 --> 02:03:15,519
Are you all right, sir?

1514
02:03:15,644 --> 02:03:17,854
Yeah, just keeping the rhythm.

1515
02:03:24,069 --> 02:03:27,990
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1516
02:03:28,073 --> 02:03:29,491
Yes.

1517
02:03:29,575 --> 02:03:31,994
See, that's something
I could never do

1518
02:03:32,077 --> 02:03:36,499
Not after the way we treated
our teachers. No, sir.

1519
02:03:39,168 --> 02:03:42,088
I had a thousand kids like you.

1520
02:03:47,677 --> 02:03:50,054
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1521
02:03:51,264 --> 02:03:54,392
I've been trying,
and I can't see them.

1522
02:03:54,476 --> 02:03:56,686
Has that ever happened to you?

1523
02:03:56,770 --> 02:03:59,731
You gotta think of a context.

1524
02:04:01,233 --> 02:04:03,401
What does that mean?

1525
02:04:03,485 --> 02:04:07,364
Well, you think about
something specific...

1526
02:04:07,489 --> 02:04:09,032
something you've done together.

1527
02:04:12,995 --> 02:04:16,498
When I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1528
02:04:16,582 --> 02:04:20,419
I think of my hammock
in the backyard or...

1529
02:04:20,544 --> 02:04:25,716
my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1530
02:04:29,303 --> 02:04:32,682
Well, this one night,
two of my brothers came

1531
02:04:32,807 --> 02:04:36,477
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1532
02:04:36,602 --> 02:04:39,897
and they said they had
a surprise for me.

1533
02:04:39,981 --> 02:04:43,651
They took me to the barn,
into the loft, and...

1534
02:04:43,776 --> 02:04:45,945
there was
my oldest brother Dan...

1535
02:04:47,572 --> 02:04:50,909
with Alice... Alice Jardine.

1536
02:04:53,245 --> 02:04:57,791
I mean... picture a girl who took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1537
02:04:57,916 --> 02:05:00,210
and hit every branch
coming down.

1538
02:05:02,421 --> 02:05:05,132
And... and Dan's
got her shirt off.

1539
02:05:05,215 --> 02:05:08,177
So he's working on this bra,

1540
02:05:08,302 --> 02:05:11,889
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out...

1541
02:05:12,014 --> 02:05:15,017
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1542
02:05:17,728 --> 02:05:20,147
And Alice Jardine screams,
and jumps up,

1543
02:05:20,272 --> 02:05:25,319
and tries to get out,
but this shirt's over her head,

1544
02:05:25,403 --> 02:05:28,990
and she runs into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1545
02:05:29,115 --> 02:05:32,994
So now Dan is so mad,
he starts coming after us,

1546
02:05:33,077 --> 02:05:37,040
but Alice is there unconscious,
he's gotta wake her up.

1547
02:05:37,165 --> 02:05:40,335
So he grabs her leg,
and he's dragging her.

1548
02:05:40,418 --> 02:05:43,964
And he picks up a shovel
and goes after Sean.

1549
02:05:44,047 --> 02:05:49,261
Sean says, "Why are you trying
to hit me? I did you a favour."

1550
02:05:49,344 --> 02:05:53,765
And this makes Dan more angry.
He tries to swing this thing.

1551
02:05:53,849 --> 02:05:58,020
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1552
02:05:58,103 --> 02:06:01,982
The thing explodes, and
the whole barn almost goes up.

1553
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:21,085
That was it... Dan went
to Basic next day.

1554
02:06:21,169 --> 02:06:25,131
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1555
02:06:25,214 --> 02:06:27,258
That was two years ago.

1556
02:06:32,055 --> 02:06:35,850
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1557
02:06:37,227 --> 02:06:38,228
No.

1558
02:06:39,688 --> 02:06:43,400
No. That one I save just for me.

1559
02:07:47,925 --> 02:07:49,551
Enemy from the east.

1560
02:07:51,178 --> 02:07:53,889
He sees Tiger tanks, two of 'em.

1561
02:07:53,973 --> 02:07:55,850
Panzer tanks, two of 'em.

1562
02:07:55,933 --> 02:07:57,893
Infantry,

1563
02:07:57,977 --> 02:07:59,478
50 plus change.

1564
02:08:08,196 --> 02:08:12,200
Disperse! You know what to do!
Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1565
02:08:12,325 --> 02:08:14,035
Upham, get some cover.

1566
02:08:14,118 --> 02:08:16,287
Mellish and Henderson,
lock and load!

1567
02:08:16,371 --> 02:08:17,956
Everybody check your ammo!

1568
02:08:19,165 --> 02:08:20,542
Good luck, Reiben.

1569
02:08:20,667 --> 02:08:23,086
I was born lucky, sarge.

1570
02:08:36,809 --> 02:08:38,102
One in five tracer?

1571
02:08:38,185 --> 02:08:40,229
Yep, and tracers
point both ways.

1572
02:08:40,312 --> 02:08:43,732
Yeah? Check her head space
and she should run.

1573
02:08:52,033 --> 02:08:54,535
Upham! Hustle up!

1574
02:09:44,295 --> 02:09:46,422
- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir.

1575
02:09:46,505 --> 02:09:48,966
We don't have
a.30-calibre here.

1576
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:52,011
Either Mr Mellish
or Mr Jackson needs that.

1577
02:09:52,136 --> 02:09:53,179
Yes, sir.

1578
02:09:54,305 --> 02:09:55,682
Upham! Jackson's fine.

1579
02:09:55,765 --> 02:09:56,766
Turn around to Mellish.

1580
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:21,959
I don't know if they
took the bait, Captain.

1581
02:10:46,985 --> 02:10:49,362
You got any more of that?

1582
02:11:34,992 --> 02:11:36,953
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1583
02:11:42,083 --> 02:11:45,086
Infantry's moving to the left.

1584
02:11:45,211 --> 02:11:48,548
Half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.

1585
02:13:29,027 --> 02:13:31,196
Displace!

1586
02:13:52,176 --> 02:13:54,011
Do it now! Light it!

1587
02:13:54,094 --> 02:13:55,929
You! Light it!

1588
02:14:07,233 --> 02:14:09,277
30 infantry on the right flank!

1589
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,946
Get over there and stop 'em!

1590
02:14:12,071 --> 02:14:13,197
Displace!

1591
02:14:25,126 --> 02:14:26,169
Upham!

1592
02:14:41,852 --> 02:14:42,978
Clear!

1593
02:14:45,230 --> 02:14:46,273
Krauts!

1594
02:14:48,275 --> 02:14:49,401
Right flank!

1595
02:15:01,831 --> 02:15:03,583
Sanitater!

1596
02:15:26,231 --> 02:15:29,234
Get down! Get down!

1597
02:15:35,616 --> 02:15:38,619
Upham! Upham!.30-cal! Hurry!

1598
02:15:38,744 --> 02:15:42,331
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1599
02:16:37,138 --> 02:16:39,515
Reversing!
He's still in this fight!

1600
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:44,061
No, no, Ryan, get down!
Get down!

1601
02:17:20,432 --> 02:17:22,434
- Ryan.
- Get off me!

1602
02:17:22,559 --> 02:17:25,020
- You all right?
- Get off me!

1603
02:17:25,145 --> 02:17:27,106
I'm fine, too, Captain(!)

1604
02:17:27,231 --> 02:17:29,775
OK, both sides!

1605
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:31,819
Get a grenade in there!

1606
02:17:35,531 --> 02:17:36,908
Grenade!

1607
02:17:38,951 --> 02:17:41,871
- 20-mil!
- 20-mil!

1608
02:17:41,954 --> 02:17:43,790
Flak gun. Take it out!

1609
02:17:57,178 --> 02:18:00,515
Heavy weapon below!
I ain't got a shot!

1610
02:18:05,228 --> 02:18:07,022
Pincer move, Parker!

1611
02:18:07,105 --> 02:18:08,565
Targets eight o'clock low!

1612
02:18:08,649 --> 02:18:09,608
Shit!

1613
02:18:09,691 --> 02:18:11,235
God grant me strength.

1614
02:18:25,207 --> 02:18:27,168
Come on! Displace!

1615
02:18:27,251 --> 02:18:28,252
Come on!

1616
02:18:44,811 --> 02:18:46,354
Cover, Upham! Cover!

1617
02:18:46,479 --> 02:18:47,897
Cover!

1618
02:19:04,248 --> 02:19:06,375
I'm out of.30-calibre.

1619
02:19:08,961 --> 02:19:11,672
Blessed be the Lord,
my strength,

1620
02:19:11,755 --> 02:19:14,091
which teaches my hands to war.

1621
02:19:23,059 --> 02:19:25,645
My goodness and my fortress...

1622
02:19:25,728 --> 02:19:27,939
my high tower
and my deliverer...

1623
02:19:31,276 --> 02:19:34,028
my shield
and He in whom I trust.

1624
02:20:02,141 --> 02:20:03,559
Parker, get down!

1625
02:20:25,582 --> 02:20:27,876
Captain, that 20-millimetre's
killing us.

1626
02:20:28,001 --> 02:20:30,462
We gotta try to flank it.

1627
02:20:30,587 --> 02:20:34,132
Well, let me get over
for the top shot.

1628
02:21:20,346 --> 02:21:23,016
Upham, ammo, Goddamit!

1629
02:22:05,518 --> 02:22:08,271
I'm jammed! I'm jammed!
Got any.30-cal?

1630
02:22:08,354 --> 02:22:10,106
- I'm out.
- Shit.

1631
02:23:50,501 --> 02:23:54,214
I'm out! I need a bandolier!
Anybody got a bandolier?

1632
02:24:19,656 --> 02:24:23,202
God! God!

1633
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,289
You stupid...

1634
02:25:12,795 --> 02:25:15,547
Let's stop. Listen to me!
Listen to me! Stop!

1635
02:25:15,631 --> 02:25:18,008
No! D-d-d-d... Stop. Stop.

1636
02:25:53,378 --> 02:25:56,048
Son of... son of a bitch!

1637
02:25:56,131 --> 02:25:58,842
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1638
02:25:58,926 --> 02:26:00,427
Son of a bitch!

1639
02:26:01,512 --> 02:26:03,430
Son of a bitch!

1640
02:27:22,387 --> 02:27:23,763
I'm out.

1641
02:27:23,847 --> 02:27:25,265
Those.60 rounds.

1642
02:27:27,183 --> 02:27:28,518
We can use them
without the tube.

1643
02:27:28,601 --> 02:27:30,103
How?

1644
02:27:30,186 --> 02:27:33,523
Fuse-arming wire, set back,
heave it!

1645
02:27:48,455 --> 02:27:49,748
Panzer schreck!

1646
02:28:24,659 --> 02:28:26,661
We're going to the Alamo.

1647
02:28:36,713 --> 02:28:38,549
Alamo! Alamo!

1648
02:28:58,528 --> 02:29:00,530
We'll take it! You fall back!

1649
02:29:00,655 --> 02:29:02,115
You be right behind us!

1650
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:04,200
Soon as we're in business!

1651
02:29:08,288 --> 02:29:09,497
Displace.

1652
02:29:12,834 --> 02:29:13,835
Reload.

1653
02:30:03,303 --> 02:30:04,888
All right, go.

1654
02:30:06,097 --> 02:30:08,892
We're blowing the bridge!
Clear the bridge!

1655
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,294
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1656
02:30:35,419 --> 02:30:39,340
- I just got the winded.
- Get out of here!

1657
02:30:39,423 --> 02:30:41,509
We're gonna blow this bridge!

1658
02:30:43,594 --> 02:30:45,221
Come on, come on!

1659
02:30:49,892 --> 02:30:52,270
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1660
02:32:40,089 --> 02:32:41,049
Captain.

1661
02:32:44,761 --> 02:32:47,847
Captain, where are you going?
Get back here!

1662
02:35:13,498 --> 02:35:15,291
Hang in there, Captain.

1663
02:36:00,505 --> 02:36:01,547
Medic!

1664
02:36:05,134 --> 02:36:06,177
Medic!

1665
02:36:06,302 --> 02:36:07,887
We got a medic?

1666
02:36:13,977 --> 02:36:16,688
They're tank-busters,
sir. P-51s.

1667
02:36:17,981 --> 02:36:19,775
Angels on our shoulders.

1668
02:36:26,031 --> 02:36:27,115
What, sir?

1669
02:36:32,913 --> 02:36:36,917
James... Earn this.

1670
02:36:41,672 --> 02:36:43,340
Earn it.

1671
02:37:12,537 --> 02:37:15,874
My dear Mrs Ryan,

1672
02:37:15,957 --> 02:37:18,418
it's with a
profound sense of joy

1673
02:37:18,543 --> 02:37:23,298
that I write to inform you
your son Private James Ryan

1674
02:37:23,424 --> 02:37:25,884
is well and,
at this very moment,

1675
02:37:25,968 --> 02:37:29,138
on his way home
from European battlefields.

1676
02:37:29,221 --> 02:37:33,267
Reports from the front indicate
James did his duty in combat

1677
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:37,146
with great courage
and steadfast dedication

1678
02:37:37,271 --> 02:37:39,899
even after informed
of the tragic loss

1679
02:37:40,024 --> 02:37:43,820
your family has suffered
in this great campaign

1680
02:37:43,903 --> 02:37:47,115
to rid the world
of tyranny and oppression.

1681
02:37:47,198 --> 02:37:50,660
I take great pleasure in joining
the Secretary of War,

1682
02:37:50,785 --> 02:37:52,579
the United States Army

1683
02:37:52,704 --> 02:37:55,290
and the citizens
of a grateful nation

1684
02:37:55,373 --> 02:37:58,668
in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness

1685
02:37:58,793 --> 02:38:01,755
with James at your side.

1686
02:38:01,838 --> 02:38:06,551
Nothing, not even the safe
return of a beloved son,

1687
02:38:06,635 --> 02:38:11,098
can compensate you or the
thousands of other families

1688
02:38:11,181 --> 02:38:14,601
who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.

1689
02:38:14,726 --> 02:38:17,438
I share with you
some words which sustained me

1690
02:38:17,563 --> 02:38:21,859
through long, dark nights
of peril, loss and heartache.

1691
02:38:21,984 --> 02:38:24,987
And I quote,

1692
02:38:25,112 --> 02:38:26,989
"I pray that
our heavenly father

1693
02:38:27,114 --> 02:38:30,034
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

1694
02:38:30,159 --> 02:38:32,286
"and leave you only
the cherished memory

1695
02:38:32,411 --> 02:38:34,205
"of the loved and lost

1696
02:38:34,330 --> 02:38:37,166
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours

1697
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:39,961
"to have laid
so costly a sacrifice

1698
02:38:40,003 --> 02:38:42,338
"upon the alter of freedom.

1699
02:38:42,422 --> 02:38:44,465
"Abraham Lincoln."

1700
02:38:44,549 --> 02:38:47,135
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully,

1701
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:50,096
George C Marshall,
General, Chief of Staff.

1702
02:39:41,316 --> 02:39:44,444
My family is with me today.

1703
02:39:44,569 --> 02:39:46,821
They wanted to come with me.

1704
02:39:49,032 --> 02:39:50,617
To be honest with you,

1705
02:39:50,742 --> 02:39:54,454
I wasn't sure how I'd feel
coming back here.

1706
02:39:56,874 --> 02:40:00,544
Every day I think about
what you said to me

1707
02:40:00,627 --> 02:40:02,671
that day on the bridge.

1708
02:40:03,839 --> 02:40:09,011
And I've tried to live my life
the best I could.

1709
02:40:09,136 --> 02:40:12,264
I hope that was enough.

1710
02:40:12,390 --> 02:40:15,434
I hope that,
at least in your eyes,

1711
02:40:16,852 --> 02:40:20,648
I've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1712
02:40:33,995 --> 02:40:35,288
James.

1713
02:40:37,624 --> 02:40:39,793
Captain John H Miller.

1714
02:40:48,260 --> 02:40:51,054
Tell me I've led a good life.

1715
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:52,264
What?

1716
02:40:53,390 --> 02:40:55,809
Tell me I'm a good man.

1717
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:04,527
You are.
