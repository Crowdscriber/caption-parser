So we have a dirty section

tapes Abbott's confession

I think something else
could be going on here.

What? What's he after?

39
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:16,600
The reason Bourne went
to Moscow was to see the

What's your point, Pam?

41
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,605
Maybe he was
retracing his steps.

42
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:23,447
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

43
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,682
Maybe he hasn't found
it yet and we need
to know what it is.

44
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,588
Are you telling me he's not
a threat to this agency?

45
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:32,593
I think if he wanted
to hurt us, he could
have sent the tape to CNN.

46
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:34,458
Maybe he still will.

the best, plan for the worst.

48

Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.

483
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:18,661
Bourne? You're still looking
for Bourne? I thought that
case was closed.

484
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:21,571
No, some people are convinced
he's still a threat.

485
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,109
I disagree, but to find out
I need to talk to him.

Hold on, Nicky.

487

What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to send
him a message.

488
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:32,049
You don't think Bourne
is a threat? He just took
out two more of my men.

489
00:41:32,118 --> 00:41:33,710
The only way this has
a happy ending, Noah,

490
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:35,015
is if we bring him in alive.

491
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:37,022
He is going after Daniels.

492
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,819
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the only realistic way

493
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:40,917
to end this is to
eliminate the threat.

You can't outrun
what you did, Jason.
