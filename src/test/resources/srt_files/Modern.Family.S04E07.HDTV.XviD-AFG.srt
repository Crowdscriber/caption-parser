1
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:05,410
- Night.
- No.

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:07,472
- Middle of the phone. I got it.
- Get it.

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:09,220
- Oh! My arm's asleep! My arm's asleep!
- Get the phone.

4
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:10,846
- Phil, get the phone.
- Oh!

5
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:12,872
That's me. Hello! Hi.

6
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:14,242
Yes, this is she.

7
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:15,206
Who is it?

8
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,657
Okay.
Oh, God.

9
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:17,800
Tell me what's happening here!

10
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,437
Haley has been arrested.

11
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:20,871
What?

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,195
Phone! Phone.
I bet that's mama.

13
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:25,685
I was just dreaming
it was raining chickens!

14
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:27,515
Mitchell, answer the phone!

15
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:29,498
Look what I am doing.
Look what I am doing, huh?

16
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:30,922
- Hello?
- Hey, Mitchell.

17
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,534
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but Haley got arrested.

18
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:36,204
Oh, God.
Haley got arrested.

19
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,284
That explains the chickens.

20
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:38,844
It does. It adds up.

21
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:40,303
What did she get arrested for?

22
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:42,972
Oh, she got caught drinking
at some party.

23
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:45,224
Look, could you drive up
to the college with us?

24
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:47,096
- I think we're gonna need a lawyer.
- Yes, of course.

25
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:49,451
And Cam and Lily can come over
and stay with Alex and Luke.

26
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:50,777
- I'll guard them with my life.
- Yeah, yeah.

27
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:52,321
I hate to bother him.

28
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:54,327
No, no, don't be silly.
He's happy to do it.

29
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:56,410
Okay, we'll be over in a little bit.

30
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,610
- Okay.
- Oh, I get it.

31
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:59,709
When you told Claire I would
come over and watch the kids,

32
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,555
she was resistant

33
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,848
because she doesn't trust
my parenting skills.

34
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:04,904
No. Don't be silly.
She just didn't want to put you out.

35
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:06,169
She's got a daughter behind bars

36
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,483
and she's got the nerve
to say I'm a bad parent?

37
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,637
- You didn't defend me.
- Because she didn't say anything.

38
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,758
Why are you protecting her?

39
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,790
Why is no one protecting me?

40
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,880
No.

41
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:20,117
Ay! Answer! Answer!

42
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,072
This better be good.

43
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:26,865
Haley got arrested for drinking.

44
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,102
We gotta go bail her out.

45
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,007
Do you still have a connection
to that judge upstate?

46
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,343
- He died.
- Ay! Who died?

47
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:32,336
An old friend of mine.

48
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:33,790
Ay, Jay, I'm so sorry.

49
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,435
He died five years ago.

50
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,516
Then why are they calling us
in the middle of the night

51
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:38,507
to wake us up?!

52
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,492
Nobody died.
Haley's in jail.

53
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:41,668
Okay. That makes more sense.

54
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,932
Claire has to go bail her out.

55
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,540
Okay. Give me that.

56
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:46,628
Claire, listen to me...

57
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,301
Take a lot of cash.

58
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:50,004
And when you flash it to the police,

59
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:52,571
do not speak about it.

60
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:55,517
Let the eyes
do all the talking, okay?

61
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,495
I heard the phone. Who died?

62
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:58,515
Jay's friend.

63
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,105
Oh, Jay, I'm so sorry.

64
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,672
Okay. I can't do this again.

65

67
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,146
It's breakfast

68
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:17,464
It's breakfast time

69
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,410
It's breaky breaky time

70
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,099
Uncle Cam.
I thought I heard your voice.

71
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,520
What are you doing here?
Where are my parents?

72
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,408
Well, the school called,
and your sister won a big award.

73
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:26,470
Nice try. The only person

74
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,137
who would believe that
would be Haley.

75
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,776
She's in jail.

76
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:30,525
Jail?

77
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,572
Lily, what did I say?

78
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,249
That it was only a matter of time.

79
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,512
Okay, no. Didn't say that.

80
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,547
Okay, so here's the truth.

81
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,120
Your sister was caught drinking.

82
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,254
But it's no big deal.

83
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,354
Your parents are there
taking care of it right now.

84
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:41,057
So...

85
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,460
This is so awesome!

86
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,507
I hope she hits the weights

87
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,476
so she's totally ripped
when she gets out.

88
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:46,486
Okay. Let's change the subject.

89
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,965
Have a seat. Have some breakfast.

90
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,826
See if there's anything
on that plate you like a lot.

91
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:54,950
Is this bacon?

92
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,132
Of course it is, silly.

93
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,593
Been on a little bit
of a health kick lately,

94
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,681
so I took a vegan cooking class,

95
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,752
and my new thing is "fakon."

96
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:04,860
It's like real bacon.

97
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:06,853
Except for the look,
the texture, and the taste.

98
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,778
Maybe the store-bought kind.

99
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,687
But I make my own,
so it's not even real fakon.

100
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:12,635
It's faux-fakon. "Faux-kon."

101
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,664
It's faux-kon disgusting.

102
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:15,931
You can't tell the difference.

103
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:17,194
And guess which one's the real one?

104
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:18,330
That one.

105
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,811
That one.

106
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,821
Still that one.

107
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,065
This is the best bacon
I've ever had.

108
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,604
Oh, well.

109
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,910
I can't wait to tell your Uncle Mitchell
that you love it.

110
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:30,909
Why would Uncle Mitch care?

111
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,926
Because, my dear,

112
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,577
that bacon you're eating
isn't bacon at all,

113
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:35,280
no, no, no.

114
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,108
It's made entirely of soy.

115
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,552
Luke's allergic to soy!

116
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,333
His throat closes!
He can't breathe!

117
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,882
- Hello?
- Never mind!

118
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:42,527
Okay, okay.

119
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,539
We have to, uh,
get you to the, uh, hospital!

120
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,245
- Lily! Come on, baby.
- Okay, Luke! Put the fakon down!

121
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,783
I'm using it to scratch my throat!

122
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:50,740
Okay. Okay. Let's go.
Come on. Go.

123
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,101
Cam? C-Cam?

124
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,652
That was weird.

125
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:56,227
Hey, Claire, do you wanna
pick it up a little bit?

126
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:58,427
Since when do you drive
the speed limit?

127
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,290
My daughter has been
arrested for drinking.

128
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,640
I would like her to sit in jail
and think about that.

129
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,590
As a matter of fact, I might stop

130
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,277
and do a little outlet shopping.

131
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,448
Who wants a pair
of last year's sunglasses, huh?

132
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,761
Honey...

133
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:10,719
Try to relax.

134
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,144
I don't feel like relaxing, Phil!

135
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:14,116
She has been
in college for six weeks.

136
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:16,410
Yeah, and everyone
goes a little crazy at first.

137
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,936
I remember one night freshman year,

138
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:19,487
a bunch of us
on the frisbee golf team

139
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,561
got a case of zima.
Enough zaid.

140
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,381
More than enough.

141
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:25,759
I'm not gonna lie.

142
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,974
Sometimes it bothers me how calm
Phil is under pressure.

143
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:29,961
It's like...

144
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:32,165
Like I'm the one
who's overreacting.

145
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,671
That's good. Let it out. It's g...

146
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,637
I'm going to kill you.

147
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,123
Jay, do you have some time today?

148
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:40,693
We need to go and
pick out a stroller.

149
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,769
Just get whatever you want.

150
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,256
I mean, it's what
you're gonna do anyway.

151
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:44,299
What I want is a husband

152
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,309
who likes to go shopping
for a stroller with me.

153
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,971
If you had a husband
who liked picking out strollers,

154
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,888
you wouldn't be having a baby.

155
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:51,793
So who wants to come with me

156
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,706
to the spoken word festival
this evening?

157
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,679
I only have two tickets,

158
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,236
so somebody's gonna be disappointed.

159
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:57,138
I think it's gonna be you.

160
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,187
Ay, Manny, I would go with you,
but I'm so tired.

161
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:00,624
You just woke up.
How are you tired?

162
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,548
Maybe because I'm turning
food into a human!

163
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,275
Jay will take you.

164
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,472
Sorry, I would love to go
to the spoken word festival,

165
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,613
but I'm already going to the

166
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:11,399
I'd-rather-blow-my-brains-out jamboree.

167
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,425
I can't believe this.

168
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,007
I'm living in a cultural wasteland.

169
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:15,341
With a heated pool.

170
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:17,915
Manny, vamos.
You're gonna be late for school.

171
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,531
Oh, jeez.

172
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:26,729
Hello, DeDe.

173
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,021
Good morning, Jay. Namaste.

174
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,090
Let's not do this.

175
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,930
Oh, fine, silly.

176
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,769
I'm on my way to a retreat in Ojai,

177
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,438
and since I'm passing through town,

178
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,568
I thought I'd pick up
that photo album.

179
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,364
You know, it's really
not a good time.

180
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,332
Oh, please.

181
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,081
All right.
I'll meet you on the street.

182
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,692
Drive by slow with the window open.

183
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,831
I was dreading DeDe finding out
that Gloria's pregnant.

184
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,798
It's the one thing
DeDe's hung on to,

185
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,585
that she's the mother of my kids.

186
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,771
And considering their history...

187
00:05:58,178 --> 00:05:59,360
I-I wanna...

188
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,006
rip your head off!

189
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,236
- No! Please stop it!
- Whoa!

190
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,434
Eh? No! DeDe!

191
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:10,723
I wasn't exactly looking forward
to round four,

192
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:14,780
especially now that Gloria's
a bigger, slower target.

193
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:17,937
I'd normally be
having breakfast right now.

194
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,504
Hi, dad.

195
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,853
Hey, Claire. Any updates?

196
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,249
Not yet, but we're almost there.

197
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,554
Last time you were
over at the house,

198
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:26,885
you were looking
at that photo album.

199
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,883
What'd you do with it?

200
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,502
Oh, dad, that was me.

201
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,638
I think I put it on the shelf 
behind the bar.

202
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,708
What are you doing there?

203
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:33,786
They asked me to come along

204
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:35,199
in case they needed a lawyer.

205
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,599
Shouldn't they have a real lawyer?

206
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,799
Oh, God. Should we?

207
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,272
I am a real lawyer, people.
Environmental law is a thing.

208
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:42,730
Don't get all sensitive on me.

209
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:44,643
I mean someone who
doesn't defend pandas.

210
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:45,999
Yeah, dad, 'cause that's what I do.

211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,722
I-I defend pandas in court.

212
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:48,891
That's adorable.

213
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:49,805
You know what I'm talking about.

214
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,371
Haley needs somebody
who knows criminal law,

215
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:52,471
like Perry Mason.

216
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:55,909
Okay, so I'm not a real lawyer,
but Perry Mason is?

217
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,576
Oh, hell.

218
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:01,452
Hello, DeDe. How you doing?

219
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,403
Oh, mostly fine.

220
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:07,341
I have something called
a telescoping uterus.

221
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:09,957
- Long story.
- Aw, jeez.

222
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,277
Out of my way!

223
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,178
- Out of my way!
- I can't breathe!

224
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,262
This boy can't breathe.

225
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:15,943
He's having a severe
allergic reaction.

226
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,536
No. You're squeezing me.

227
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,369
He needs medicine.
His throat is closing up.

228
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,913
Okay. Hold on.

229
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:22,742
We have an allergic reaction.

230
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,232
A young boy.
Obstructed breathing.

231
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,317
What happened?

232
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,945
Well, somebody gave him
some soy bacon...

233
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,386
That was so good,
he couldn't tell the difference.

234
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,424
Mitchell, I can't talk right now.

235
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,903
Cam, it's Claire.
My phone died.

236
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,714
I just wanted to make sure
the kids got to school okay.

237
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,085
Oh, yeah, of course they did.
Why wouldn't they have?

238
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:39,276
- I hear we got a boy who can't breathe?
- Right here.

239
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:40,236
What was that?

240
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,036
Oh, I'm just watching
an original lifetime movie

241
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:42,946
called "The boy who can't breathe."

242
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:43,827
That sounded like Alex.

243
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:46,462
Nope. Just Amanda Bynes.
Okay, gotta go.

244
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,082
Cam. Cam?

245
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:51,726
That's weird.

246
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,117
Can you believe how many
waffle places we passed?

247
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:55,706
I can't believe how much
dad belittles me.

248
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,166
What were there? Five? Six?

249
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,505
I edited the law review.

250
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:00,089
I passed the bar on my first try.

251
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,298
I have a briefcase.

252
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,324
I'm counting them
on the way back.

253
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:03,778
Can we focus?

254
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,479
Uh, hi.
We're here for Haley Dunphy.

255
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,836
I'm Mitchell Pritchett.
I'm miss Dunphy's attorney.

256
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:09,284
She won't be needing a lawyer today.

257
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,890
Oh, I think I'll be
the judge of that.

258
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,029
I'd like to confer with
my client now. Thank you.

259
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,217
All you have to do is post bail,
and she's all yours.

260
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:18,648
Really?
Oh. That...that's fantastic.

261
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,863
Sir, I am in no mood

262
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,252
- to defend my daughter today, believe me.
- Okay.

263
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,385
But do you think it is
the best use of resources

264
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:26,300
to lock up college kids
who've had a few drinks?

265
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,768
Ma'am, your daughter
was charged with resisting arrest

266
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,669
and assaulting a police officer.

267
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,608
- What?
- Oh.

268
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,783
You probably should have
called a real lawyer,

269
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:38,349
- 'cause I don't... I'm not...
- Shh!

270
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,604
Look, this has gotta be
some kind of mistake.

271
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,442
Our daughter's tiny.

272
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,062
There's no way she assaulted anyone.

273
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,431
Insulted, maybe.

274
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:52,948
Was...was the cop wearing
white socks and dark shoes?

275
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,281
'Cause that really sets her off.

276
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:56,199
Maybe you should watch this.

277
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,529
Stop!

278
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,452
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

279
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,943
Okay.
Now that's very blurry footage.

280
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:05,093
How can we be sure
that that's Haley?

281
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:06,896
Don't you move.

282
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,042
Don't hurt me!
I'm just a student!

283
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:09,770
I'm Haley Dunphy!

284
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,606
So hot.

285
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,996
Hot in here... no.

286
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:20,889
How long is this gonna take?

287
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,481
I should be in school.
I'm missing biology right now.

288
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:25,259
You're in a hospital.
Just step out into the hallway.

289
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,401
Listen to the nurses and doctors talk.

290
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,311
You'll learn more about
science and humanity here

291
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,943
than you would in a classroom
in an entire semester.

292
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,479
Attention!

293
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,058
If there's a yogurt in the fridge
that says "Theresa,"

294
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,700
then only Theresa gets to eat it!

295
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,902
Drama. Soak it in.

296
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:41,779
- Oh, good God.
- Okay, Luke,

297
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,628
the opening is supposed
to be in the back.

298
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:45,638
No way.
I don't want people to see my butt.

299
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,102
Do I have to get another shot?

300
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,531
Are you going to cry again?

301
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:50,029
- Should she be here?
- Okay. You know what?

302
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,415
Nobody's getting any more shots.

303
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,019
We just have to wait
for the swelling to go down.

304
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,539
All right? I'm gonna go
check on a little paperwork.

305
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,279
I'll be right back.

306
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,980
But if it doesn't go down,

307
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:02,002
that leg might have to come off.

308
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,739
Sweet. Take them both.

309
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,258
Then I could get
some of those blade legs

310
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,845
and finally be able to dunk.

311
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:07,939
How you feeling, champ?

312
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,780
What do we got here?

313
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:11,076
The patient presents
bronchial inflammation,

314
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,505
dermal pruritus,
and minor angioedema.

315
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,299
Who can tell me the cause?

316
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,819
It's an allergic reaction to soy.

317
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:22,588
Very good.

318
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,152
The rest of you have a lot to learn.
Let's keep moving.

319
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,926
Stay with Luke.

320
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:32,918
What is taking so long?

321
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,446
Well, in my experience,
these things can take time.

322
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:38,943
So... settle in.
This...this could be a while.

323
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:39,839
There she is.

324
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,817
Damn it.

325
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:42,517
Oh, thank God.

326
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,659
- You're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, mom.

327
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,018
Oh! What the hell
were you thinking?

328
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:46,832
What happened?

329
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,233
It's not a big deal, okay?

330
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,160
There was a party,
and people were drinking...

331
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,576
- Mm.
- So the police showed up,

332
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,653
and everybody ran, so I did, too.

333
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,993
And I started climbing down
this fire escape...

334
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,908
And then I heard a cop
yell to put your hands up,

335
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,900
so I did and I fell... onto him.

336
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,252
You could have been killed.

337
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,202
Haley, you're supposed
to be an adult.

338
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:05,211
How could you do
something so childish...

339
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,779
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- And so stupid?

340
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,872
Let's calm down.
We're all a little tired and cranky.

341
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,229
Best thing we can do right now

342
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,223
is get out of here,
go get some waffles...

343
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,356
I don't want waffles, Phil, okay?

344
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,836
I'm upset and
I want to deal with this.

345
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:18,009
All right, I got
some bad news here.

346
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,439
Um, this afternoon,

347
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,846
Haley has to appear
before a disciplinary board,

348
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,353
which will decide whether or not
she gets kicked out of school.

349
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:25,489
- What?
- Ohh.

350
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,079
Oh, wait. Wait, no.
I got that wrong.

351
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,034
Oh, no, I got it right!

352
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:32,854
Yes! Score.
1 for me.

353
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,741
It's what it sounds like.

354
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:36,886
It literally telescopes.

355
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:39,032
- You see, what happens is... 
- DeDe, I hate to rush this,

356
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,503
- but I'm late for a meeting.
- Oh.

357
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:42,671
And it's been great seeing you,
but can I walk you out?

358
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,810
Okay. Sure.

359
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,291
Ay, Jay, it's so weird.

360
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,947
The moment I came through the door,

361
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,625
the baby started kicking like crazy,

362
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:55,043
like it's trying to claw
its way out of me.

363
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,459
Bruja!

364
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,449
Oh, my God.

365
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,322
What is she doing here?

366
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,467
You're going to have a baby?

367
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:02,693
I don't believe it.

368
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,657
Uh, DeDe, don't get
all crazy about this.

369
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,551
What's happening?

370
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,406
Her brain. It snapped.

371
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:13,883
Oh! You're going to be
a father again at your age.

372
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:15,128
And here you were thinking

373
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,811
you would just sail off
into the sunset

374
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:20,069
with your beautiful young wife,

375
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,889
not a care in the world.

376
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,233
This is fantastic!

377
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:28,200
I think my uterus just fixed itself.

378
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,803
Don't ask.

379
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:34,958
Who lives like this?

380
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,656
When I had a dorm room, it was...

381
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,719
Oh...it was spotless.

382
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,758
Can we just agree that
girls are dirtier than boys?

383
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,124
- What should we do?
- Well, I'd like to start

384
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,309
by picking up some of these clothes.
Then...

385
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,879
I meant about the hearing, Felix.

386
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,944
Do we have a game plan?

387
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,121
I think the best thing we can do
is walk in there as a family

388
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:49,999
and let them know we support
Haley no matter what.

389
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,919
At this rate, we are going
to be supporting Haley

390
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,117
for the rest of our lives.

391
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:54,246
Okay. Oh, I...

392
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,160
I just sat on half a peach,
so I... no.

393
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:58,576
I can't do this.
I'm...I'm waiting outside.

394
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,429
Disgusting.

395
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,719
What are you wearing?

396
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,712
What? What's wrong with it?

397
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:04,950
Honey, you are fighting
for your future

398
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,189
in front of a disciplinary committee,

399
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,090
not entertaining
the secret service.

400
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,152
In "Legally blonde,"
Elle won her case

401
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:12,087
because she was true to herself
and dressed cute.

402
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:14,326
Haley, this is real life,
not an excellent movie.

403
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,137
Honey, just put on something else,

404
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:17,205
and take down the makeup.

405
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,859
Why are you guys
acting like this is my fault?

406
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,936
Everybody was drinking,
everybody ran.

407
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:24,654
I just got caught.
If anything, I'm the victim here.

408
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:28,734
What?! Just stop...
just stop talking, Haley.

409
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,372
You're not the victim here.
You're the one who screwed up!

410
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,227
You made one
bad decision after another,

411
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:34,419
and now you're about
to blow everything

412
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,315
your mother and I worked
so hard to give you.

413
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,875
And the worst thing is,
you don't seem to care.

414
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:40,404
We all got up
at 3:00 A.M. this morning

415
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:42,458
to bail you out of jail!

416
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,296
We haven't eaten a thing,

417
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,713
and you know what
I haven't heard from you yet?

418
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:47,172
"I'm sorry, mom. I screwed up, dad.

419
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,500
Please forgive me."

420
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,302
Now put on some real clothes.

421
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:53,181
We'll see you at the hearing.
Do not be late!

422
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,352
Come on.

423
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:55,314
Where are you going?

424
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,651
To get that man a waffle.

425
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:05,654
There. There.
Did you feel it kicking?

426
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:08,811
Oh, yes! Oh, I remember those.

427
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:12,454
Yeah, Claire kicked me
as soon as she grew legs,

428
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,453
and she didn't stop until she was 4.

429
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:16,884
Not Manny.

430
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:20,954
He was so calm, I think
that he was reading in there.

431
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:21,761
This is beautiful.

432
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,232
Look at you two, having
a conversation like old friends.

433
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:27,418
Well, it's easier to talk to her
when she's not choking me.

434
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,661
I'm sorry.

435
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:30,654
I went through a bad patch there

436
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,523
when I was trying to find
the right balance with my meds.

437
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,298
I recently discovered
my cat Frances

438
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,127
buried in the backyard.

439
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,607
I'm just praying
that she died first.

440
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:44,893
Maybe you can dogsit
for the shoe-eater one day.

441
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:48,921
Oh, well, she is a...
funny-looking thing.

442
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,854
Don't listen to them.
You're beautiful.

443
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,329
Turns out Gloria being pregnant

444
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,321
somehow made DeDe think of her
as less trophy, more human.

445
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,730
And all the animosity
she had for Gloria

446
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,641
just wafted up in the air...

447
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,849
I hope you're hiring a nanny,

448
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,631
because this one
won't lift a finger.

449
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,951
And landed right on top of me.

450
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,439
I don't remember him
changing a single diaper.

451
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,864
What's that supposed to mean?

452
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,879
You can't even remember
killing your cat.

453
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,493
Oh, I don't think I did.

454
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:23,649
But I'm sure that you never
changed any diapers.

455
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,597
It's just that you were
better at it than I was.

456
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:28,964
Oh, so I guess I was better
at late-night feedings

457
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:31,089
and cleaning spit-up, too.

458
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,581
You know what?

459
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,593
He wouldn't help me
pick up a stroller

460
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:37,497
or a blanket or a bouncy chair.

461
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:41,366
Oh, well, I had to get
that stuff on my own.

462
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,648
He was just useless.

463
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,658
You poor thing.

464
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,998
Makes all sense now
why you became so crazy.

465
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,529
Right?

466
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:52,595
Listen to me, Jay Pritchett.

467
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:55,249
If you don't change
your useless ways,

468
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,645
you're gonna make me crazy, too!

469
00:15:57,646 --> 00:15:58,761
Like DeDe!

470
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,148
Gloria. Gloria.

471
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:05,007
I just love our little visits.

472
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,166
Mom, I'm home!

473
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,167
Oh, hi, Manny.

474
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,890
DeDe. How are you?

475
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:13,339
Good.

476
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:16,097
DeDe. It's me.

477
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:17,788
How are you really?

478
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:19,823
I'm on a better path.

479
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:21,395
It's a journey.

480
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,516
Thank you for asking, Manny.

481
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,044
And thank you for your letters.

482
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:27,213
It's a lost art.

483
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:29,684
No one puts pen to paper anymore.

484
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:31,568
Haley Dunphy?

485
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,784
Yes, that's me.

486
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:33,873
I'm Dean Miller with admissions.

487
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,516
- This is Professor Williams.
- Hi.

488
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:37,167
And this is
our student representative,

489
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:38,709
- Aidan Feldman.
- Nice to meet you.

490
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,064
Seriously?

491
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,933
We sit next to each other in Econ.

492
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,069
- Oh, right. You... 
- Don't.

493
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,815
It insults both of us.

494
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:46,857
Mostly me.

495
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:47,971
Move it along, Aidan.

496
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:51,052
This is a disciplinary hearing,
not JDate.

497
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,123
You are charged with
public drunkenness,

498
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:55,774
resisting arrest,
and assaulting a police officer,

499
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,660
all of which obviously violate
our school's code of conduct.

500
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,984
Sir, if I may speak
on behalf of my client...

501
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,619
- Who are you?
- I'm Mitchell Pritchett,

502
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,738
I'm miss Dunphy's attorney.

503
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,930
We require students
to speak for themselves.

504
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:10,085
There are no attorneys allowed.
You shouldn't even be here.

505
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:11,802
What if I just sat in this chair
and I was really super quiet

506
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:12,590
and I just listen?

507
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:13,696
I'll allow it.

508
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,511
Knock it off, Aidan.

509
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,988
Miss Dunphy, is there anything

510
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,604
you would like to say
in your defense?

511
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,633
Actually, I have no defense.

512
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:24,905
I was drinking.
I am underage.

513
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:26,719
I ran from the police.

514
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,892
And even though
it was an accident,

515
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,412
I injured an officer.

516
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:32,342
I am very, very sorry.

517
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,826
I've made a lot of bad decisions
since I've been here,

518
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:37,704
and it's time I take
some responsibility.

519
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,381
Like sometimes in the dining hall,

520
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,835
I slip my pinky under the scale
when they weigh my salad.

521
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:46,222
Also, I've missed more
morning classes than I've been to.

522
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:48,781
- She's kidding. - I don't know
what the policy is on dating T.A.S,

523
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,864
- but I think I broke it.
- Huh?

524
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:51,974
- Twice.
- Oh, man.

525
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:54,067
Oh, and if we're gonna be
completely honest,

526
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,487
on my application to get in here,

527
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:58,325
- I lied about the fact that I was...
- Uh, objection!

528
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:00,560
- On what grounds?
- Oh, he gets to say it?! He gets to...

529
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,222
Miss Dunphy, miss Dunphy,

530
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:05,330
we appreciate your... candor.

531
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:07,960
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

532
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:10,380
Go, Wildcats?

533
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,017
Oh, boy.

534
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:14,640
That's not even our mascot.

535
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,441
What does this do?

536
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,226
I don't know, but thanks to Obama,
you're paying for it.

537
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,781
Hey. You're looking a lot better.
How you feeling?

538
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:24,778
Better than kidney stones over there.

539
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,193
Yeah, you know what?
Now that you're doing better,

540
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:28,935
I think I should call your mom
and tell her what happened.

541
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:31,029
You know, I know it was a bit
of a rough ride in the beginning,

542
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,147
but the important thing is,
is I handled it.

543
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:36,265
- And everybody's okay.
- What happened to her?

544
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,933
- Hello?
- She passed out watching a C-Section.

545
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:39,998
Cam?

546
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,734
Never mind!

547
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,525
What are you looking for?

548
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:51,759
Nothing! I am making a lot of noise
because I'm angry!

549
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,862
Gloria, I'm gonna help you
with the baby.

550
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,726
I am not young like with Manny.

551
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,137
I am tired already,

552
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,512
and it's gonna get harder from here!

553
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,178
I can't do this on my own,

554
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:02,644
and you did this to me,

555
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:04,764
so you're going to be
here this time!

556
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:07,459
Back then, we were living
paycheck to paycheck.

557
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,254
The reason I wasn't around
is I was working all the time.

558
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,985
Believe me, DeDe
wasn't the only one

559
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,317
having sleepless nights.

560
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,933
But now it's different.

561
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,995
Now I can help you with everything.

562
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:20,202
Really?

563
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:22,964
Let's start right now.

564
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,647
I like that one. Which one?

565
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:25,961
That silver stroller.

566
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,694
No, we're going to get
the green one.

567
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:28,369
Great. What's next?

568
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,471
How about I pick out
the wrong crib?

569
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:32,176
How you doing, Alex?

570
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:33,708
I'm fine, except for the crushing blow

571
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,413
of knowing I'll never be a doctor.

572
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:37,068
Or have a baby.

573
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:38,642
I wonder what's going on with Haley.

574
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:39,418
I don't know.

575
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,510
I've been so petty about your mom
judging my parenting,

576
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:44,050
I haven't even thought about
what she's going through today.

577
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,053
I feel awful. You know what?
I should call her.

578
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,773
What are you talking about?
Mom thinks you're a great parent.

579
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:49,639
She does?

580
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,877
Yeah, she just thinks
you can't bake.

581
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:52,830
Hello?

582
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,489
Never mind.

583
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,047
Making a child is the easy part.

584
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:02,131
The hard part is everything
that comes after.

585
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,154
Keeping them safe...

586
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:05,263
Well, you can tell your mother
that my scones

587
00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:06,915
are appropriately crunchy
on the outside

588
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,089
while delightfully dense on the ins...

589
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:10,669
Saw that. Saw it.

590
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,871
Making sacrifices for them...

591
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:14,427
Hey, kid.

592
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,747
I'll take you to that poetry
reading thing tonight.

593
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,072
Actually, DeDe and I
were just talking.

594
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,956
She's a huge fan of spoken word...

595
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:24,174
And I would love to escort him.

596
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,790
- Please.
- Go.

597
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:29,708
And standing by them,
even when they let you down.

598
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,142
I really am sorry.

599
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,586
We appreciate that.

600
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,098
It's good that
you stepped up today.

601
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,538
Yeah. Sometimes it's healthy
to get a fresh start.

602
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:43,371
Ugh. I can't believe this.
What am I gonna do?

603
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,515
Well, they said
you could reapply next year.

604
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:47,359
In the meantime,
you're gonna get a job

605
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,035
and you're gonna take some classes.

606
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,952
Well, I'm gonna buckle down
and get a lot more serious.

607
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:53,449
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

608
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,432
Where are my keys?

609
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,454
Oh, they're right there
on the makeup table.

610
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,720
Oh, honey...

611
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,650
That's a desk.

612
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,534
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

613
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,651
I got kicked out.

614
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,200
So go ahead, make your jokes.
Get it out of your system.

615
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,825
No, that's horrible.
I'm so sorry.

616
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,883
It'll be fine. I'm sure of it.

617
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,460
Thank you.

618
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:21,983
Ew, what did you do to my room?!

619
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,700
Well, it's not exactly your room.
It's...it's mine.

620
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,286
This goes. This goes. I hate that.

621
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,102
- This is ugly.
- Haley, stop!

622
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,148
- Mom!
- Mom!

623
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:31,124
What is this? A solar system?

624
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,252
It's molecules.

625
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:33,476
They're nerdy balls.

626
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:35,152
Alex, don't fight with her.

627
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,030
She might have a shiv.

628
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,662
We cool?

629
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:47,962
