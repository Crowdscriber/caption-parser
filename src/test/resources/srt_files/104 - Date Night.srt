3
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,100
- Yeah?
- It's game day, baby. Wake the fuck up.

4
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,400
- What?
{y:i}- We're opening today.

5
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,700
We got hot little teens walking into theaters
on the East Coast...

6
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,900
to support our boy. Why aren't you awake?

7
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,000
What time is it?

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's time for you to wake up.
I've already shot a 72, bitch.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
- What, on the front nine?
- Yeah, that's funny, cunty.

10
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll call you with the midday numbers,
get ready. That's not a gimme.

11
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,300
- What?
- It's Emily.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm headed up your block. Open up the gate.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
- You're coming here?
{y:i}- Yeah, I'll be right there.

14
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,200
- Big day.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Ari's freaking.
He gets crazy before a client's movie opens.

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,400
- Fan mail.
- Thanks.

17
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,700
- What about you? Are you nervous?
- Yeah. A little bit.

18
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,000
I called the psychic hotline.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,300
They said Vince's moons were all aligned.
We're looking pretty good.

20
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,200
- What did they say about your moons?
- I don't know, I was too cheap to ask.

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Do you guys have any big plans for tonight?

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
We're not gonna do anything.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,900
Vince doesn't want to make a big deal
about it. We'll lay low.

24
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,400
That is way too normal.

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,600
- Ari has clients who do crazy stuff.
- Like what?

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,400
One of them bought
$3 million worth of tickets...

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,700
just to make sure
his movie opened at number one.

29
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,000
- Come on.
- I swear.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
- Who was it?
- I can't tell.

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,700
Yes, you can. Tell me.

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,900
He was in {y:i}Ocean's Eleven.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,700
All right, good luck.

34
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,200
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
- Bye.
- See you.

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
- Eric?
- Yeah?

37
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,500
Since you don't have any plans tonight...

38
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,200
would you maybe want
to go to dinner with me?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,900
Are you asking me out?

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,700
I could've sent a messenger with that stuff.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Morning, guys. Fan mail.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,700
What the fuck you smiling about?

43
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,400
Who's smiling, douche bag?

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Big night tonight, Vince.
I feel good about it, I do.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Yeah? That's good.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
- Anybody know how to work this thing?
- No. Just Johnny.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,600
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs. He got a girl.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Really? Who?

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,300
I don't know. He must've ordered
in late night. Woke me up at 4:30.

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
Sounded like a couple of baboons fucking.

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,300
Yeah, he better hurry up, too,
'cause I'm getting hungry.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Picture request.

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,300
Nice enough to send
the money for the stamp.

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,300
Relax. I'll send the picture.

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,500
- Fuck me.
- Let me see.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,700
- Look at that.
- Not bad.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,400
- Not bad? She's on fire.
- Let me see this.

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
"Vincent.

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,800
"I believe we were together in a past life.

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,400
"I believe we were destined
to be together in this one."

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
You should call her, Vince. It's destiny.

62
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
- Besides, she's got a great ass.
- That's a great idea, Turtle.

63
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,700
Have her catch a ride out here...

64
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,800
with the Kevorkian guy from Michigan
who wants Vince to kill him.

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,400
He's right. We don't need another psycho.
Look, better keep this, just in case.

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Tanya, this is my brother, Vince.

67
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,500
- Good luck tonight.
- Yeah. Me and him, both.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
See? These are the other guys.

69
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,100
What's up, guys?

70
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,400
- Want a creatine shake?
- No, I got a case of LUNAbars in the car.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,700
- Show the guys.
- Stop it.

72
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,100
Come on, baby, just once.
Show the guys, please?

73
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
What's up, body?

74
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,700
Look at these pythons.
She'll whip all your asses.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,000
- True.
- Come on, baby. I'll walk you out.

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Give me a call.

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,800
What?

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,700
Where'd you meet her, Drama?
Barry Bonds hearing?

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
Please. Tanya's all natural.

80
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,300
I met her at the Vitamin Expo.

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,200
- She's booming, huh, Vince?
- She's got a pretty face.

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,300
She gave me the ride of my life.

83
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,300
I just hung onto those lats
and surrendered all control.

84
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,800
You know, if I was holding onto those lats,
I'd think I was fucking Evander Holyfield.

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,200
Fuck you guys.

86
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,700
I ain't cooking shit for any of you.
Let's see what you do about that.

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,200
We should hit Encino first.
It's playing at the Galleria at 6:15.

88
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Check out the Valley girls.
Then we head over the hill.

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Good call.

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't want to see the movie.
I can't watch myself again.

91
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
I love watching myself.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Too bad the audience doesn't.

93
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Vince, you gotta see it with live crowd.

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,600
Especially the midnight show
at the Westwood Mann.

95
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,100
It's all hot UCLA ass.

96
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,900
- I don't know. What do you think, E?
- I don't know.

97
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,100
I didn't know
we were thinking about doing this.

98
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,000
- What's to think about?
- I made plans.

99
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,100
On the night my movie's opening
you made plans?

100
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,700
- Bullshit.
- You said you didn't want to think about it.

101
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
I didn't want to think about it together.

102
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,100
- What kind of plans did you make?
- Nothing.

103
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,500
I have a date.

104
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
You have a date?

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah. Emily asked me to go to dinner.

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,700
- She asked you?
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

107
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,000
He's fucking a guy.
You're getting asked out like a little bitch.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,700
I'd say it's a very big deal.

109
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,300
- Touché.
- Thank you.

110
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,900
Douche bag.

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,200
I haven't been on
a real date since high school.

112
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,300
That's because nobody dates in L.A., Vince.
It's a waste of time.

113
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,800
- And money.
- L.A. Lives between 2:00 a.m. And 5:00 a.m.

114
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
You take a lap through the talent pool.
Catch and release.

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Online's even better.

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,700
You get the small talk out of the way
so when they show up, they're good to go.

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,900
Name one girl
you ever pulled off the Internet.

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,500
There are confidentiality agreements
with these sites.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,700
I ain't telling you shit.

120
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,000
- Why don't we all grab dates tonight?
- No, don't grab anybody.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,900
- You can bring Tanya.
- You guys aren't coming with me.

122
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,500
It's opening night, it's a work night.
I need you.

123
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,400
- Fuck that, man.
- Come on, I'm serious.

124
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,900
No, you're not.
I want to get to know this girl.

125
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
- Will you give me a fucking break?
- So do we.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,900
Make sure you don't get another lemon.

127
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,600
Just relax. It's not such a big deal.
It'll be fun.

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,100
- It'll be like prom.
- I guess you won't have a date then.

129
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,200
I told you 10,000 fucking times.
She had food poisoning.

130
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, right.

131
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,800
{y:i}Power 106, blazing hip hop and r & b.
{y:i}Big Boy's neighborhood...

132
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Fuzzy Fantabulous, Joe Grande,
Luscious Liz, up in here...

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but you know what?

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,500
- We're not alone.
- No, not at all.

135
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,100
Vincent Chase is in the house.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
{y:i}Head On. That's the movie.

137
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,900
We've been hearing
some beautiful things about this.

138
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,300
When it comes to
an opening weekend for you...

139
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,000
do you have those rituals
that everybody else go through...

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,500
like, you got to pack dirt on your face
or sacrifice a goldfish?

141
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
No, I'm not superstitious.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
- At all?
- No.

143
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,500
I heard...

144
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,100
that Mel Gibson carried a cross up
Temescal Canyon before {y:i}Passion opened.

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,300
- It must have worked, huh?
- It sure did work.

146
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,200
Vince would've been a gorgeous Jesus.

147
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,000
What's going on?
What you got planned for tonight?

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
My buddy E. Got asked out on a date.

149
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,400
That's nice.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,200
So me and the other guys
are gonna join him.

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,500
Wait. Hold on. So your boy got asked out?

152
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
- Here we go.
- Relax. It's fine.

153
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
His ex-girl crushed him.
So he's looking to get laid.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Eric, sit down. Don't fuck with his rhythm.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is embarrassing.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,100
He's telling the world
about my personal life.

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,500
Relax. The world could give
a shit about your life.

158
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,700
What are you doing?

159
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,200
- You got some hot celebrity, some model?
- Right. Some hot chicks.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
- I don't have a date yet.
- What?

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
Vincent Chase doesn't have a date?

162
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,700
I find that hard to believe.

163
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,400
We got a lot of females
out there listening right now.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,700
Can we bring somebody up in here? Not Liz.

165
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,100
We gonna take a phone call for you, Vince.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
Christy, what do you got tonight?

167
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Stop hitting on my assistant, Turtle.
Besides, she'd never go out with you.

168
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
What, she can't speak for herself?

169
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,100
You can speak.

170
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
I'd never go out with you, Turtle.

171
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Ouch.

172
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
What?

173
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,200
You won't believe who we got on the phone.

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
- Who?
- Justine Chapin.

175
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,300
White virgin in the house.

176
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,600
- Justine Chapin. She's fabulous.
- She's not a virgin.

177
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,100
You know she's on
that Pure Tour right now.

178
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,400
- Justine, you there?
{y:i}- I'm here, Big Boy.

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,100
{y:i}How you doing, baby girl?
{y:i}We got Vince right here, also.

180
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,800
You can't find a date tonight, Vince?

181
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm having a little trouble, Justine.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm leaving San Diego right now.
I'll be back in L.A. For the night.

183
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,100
I'd love to go out with you.
You look hot on the billboard.

184
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you gonna sing for me?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,200
- Singing is all you're going to get.
- That's right.

186
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Big Boy's right. So do you still want to go?

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Of course.
I'm just looking for someone to cuddle with.

188
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,200
- He's definitely fucking her, right?
- Definitely.

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm calling Cindy Adams.

190
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Cuddle.

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,300
Vince is gonna be there, too.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
It's gonna be a nice time, honey.

193
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,300
When did you move away?

194
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,000
What about that cute roommate of yours?

195
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,200
Married?

196
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,100
Yeah. Congratulate her.

197
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah. I'll call you if I ever get to Oregon.

198
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
What do you think, Arnold?

199
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Baby, I know you like my hair natural.

200
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,200
But I'm gonna
put a little product in it, okay?

201
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,500
Don't be so controlling.
All right, I'll talk to you later.

202
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,500
{y:i}- Am I 21st century or what?
- Yes, you are, Ari. What's up?

203
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,700
{y:i}I had video sex
{y:i}with an Ecuadorian girl this morning.

204
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,100
I hope she was 18. Federal offense if not.

205
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,400
{y:i}She had big teeth and a sarong.
{y:i}That's all I remember.

206
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,500
What's going on?

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
{y:i}Seriously, here's the deal. Don't panic.

208
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,600
{y:i}The matinees were less than stellar.

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
- Fuck.
{y:i}- I just said don't panic.

210
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
- I'm not panicked.
{y:i}- This is a date movie.

211
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,700
{y:i}This Pixar squirrel is killing us.

212
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,900
{y:i}'Cause all the mommies
{y:i}who want to fuck Vince...

213
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,200
{y:i}are taking their kids to see The Squirrel.

214
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
{y:i}We're gonna be fine, though.

215
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,500
{y:i}Where are you guys gonna be?
{y:i}I want to meet.

216
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,300
Vince is tired. We're staying in.

217
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,100
{y:i}Why are you so dressed up, then?

218
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I hate that you can see me. You know that?

219
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
{y:i}I love that I can see you.
{y:i}It's why I bought the thing for you.

220
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,100
{y:i}- Show me a little nipple.
- Bye.

221
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
- Hello?
- So, who is she?

222
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,300
Who's who?

223
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,500
My friend told me they heard
you on Power 106 this morning.

224
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Yeah?

225
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,700
Since when do your friends
listen to rap music?

226
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,000
You're taking your first date out
with the guys?

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,400
I guess you don't want
this one to work out either.

228
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,700
What do you care?
You broke up with me, right?

229
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,300
In case you'd forgotten, we just had sex.

230
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,900
You said it was break-up sex.
What do you want from me?

231
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,500
You want me to just
keep chasing you around?

232
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,200
Maybe I don't know what I want.

233
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Maybe you should figure it out
and then call me.

234
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
What the fuck is this?

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
- What's with the limo?
- Turtle thought it'd be funny.

236
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,900
- I'm taking my own car.
- You're not taking your own car. Move.

237
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes, I am. This girl will think I'm an idiot.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Tell her it was my idea
and let her think that I'm the idiot.

239
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,000
You're cock-blocking me so bad
right now and you know it.

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,500
What are you talking about?
You think I like Emily?

241
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,600
No, I think you think I like Emily
and you're trying to shut it down.

242
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Why would I do that?

243
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,200
You don't like it when I get a girl
and you get stuck with the retards.

244
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
You know what?

245
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,800
I'll get a girl
and leave you with the two retards.

246
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
See how you like it.

247
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,500
Bro, you just broke up with Kristen.

248
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,300
Fuck around a little bit.
Have a little fun before you get serious.

249
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,400
What are you talking about, serious?
It's a first date.

250
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,900
Emily's not the kind of girl
you just play with.

251
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Fine, I'm going.
But if you guys fuck around, I'm out.

252
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Who's gonna fuck around?

253
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,100
Did you talk to Ari?

254
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,000
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
- It's all good.
- Yeah?

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
- Yeah. It's cool.
- Good.

257
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,500
Smile, biatches.

258
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,900
What's with him? Is he still trying to bail?

259
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,900
- Did you even get a date yet, Turtle?
- Of course I got a date.

260
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,700
We have to pick her up
from the Burbank airport in one hour.

261
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,600
- What is she? A Russian mail-order bride?
- No, dick. She's a hottie from Flagstaff.

262
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,100
- From Flagstaff? Who?
- An old friend. Don't worry about that.

263
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,600
Where're we going tonight?

264
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,300
Tanya needs to know
so she can dress accordingly.

265
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,500
Dolce. You called, right, Turtle?

266
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,600
No. Me and Vince decided...

267
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,400
we don't want to watch Demi cutting
Ashton's steak all night into tiny pieces.

268
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,600
- Where are we going?
- I got us a couple of lanes at Lucky Strike.

269
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
- Bowling?
- Nice.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
I'll get my ball.

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,300
That's gonna go.

272
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Take it easy, baby.
You're making me look bad.

273
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,300
- This is totally fucked right now.
- What are you talking about?

274
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,200
- Your friends are so cool.
- Yeah?

275
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,200
- My ex-girlfriend hated hanging out with us.
- No wonder she's your ex-girlfriend then.

276
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Eric, you're not paying
enough attention to me.

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,700
- You're bad.
- The worst.

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,900
- Leave him alone.
- Turtle, how'd you guys meet?

279
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,800
JDate.

280
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,900
Isn't that for Jews?

281
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,800
- So?
- She's wearing a cross.

282
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,800
She's reformed. Joanne's up.
Give her a hand, everybody.

283
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
It's not polite to stare, E.

284
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Vince.

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Watch me.

286
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,900
How do I know her?

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

288
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
Jesus Christ. Come here, you sick fuck.

289
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,600
You out of your mind?

290
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
If you didn't have Emily,
you wouldn't have called?

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,900
This girl is psychotic.
You understand what I'm saying?

292
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,200
The girl just wanted to meet Vince.
Let's not unfairly label people.

293
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,100
This is a bad night for this shit.
I don't need this tonight.

294
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,800
What are you so stressed out about?

295
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm stressed
because the movie's not doing good.

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,300
E., the movie's huge. Relax.

297
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,400
Joanne says it's destined to be a classic.

298
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,200
She says it's destined to be a classic?

299
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,500
She's destined to be
in a fucking insane asylum.

300
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Keep her under control.

301
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
God, you eat like a little bird.

302
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,600
Stop it.

303
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,700
Tweet, tweet.

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
Vince, I saw your movie today.

305
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah? What'd you think?

306
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,300
- I loved it.
- Really? You see?

307
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,100
- Another satisfied customer.
- I heard. Was the theater crowded?

308
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
Not really.

309
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,700
- I was the first in line, 10:15 a.m.
- Really?

310
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,100
I loved it so much, I went to the 12:30 also.

311
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,500
- You were beautiful.
- Thank you.

312
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
He is beautiful.

313
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,400
So, Justine, if you lose your virginity...

314
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,200
doesn't the whole Pure Tour
thing become, like, a sham?

315
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,400
Who said I'm gonna lose my virginity?

316
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,700
Turtle said that these guys
don't even believe you are a virgin.

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,600
- I never said that.
- Check, please.

318
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
- Look at that.
- Told you, baby, we got a monster.

319
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,800
Yo, you cats going to see {y:i}Head On?

320
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,100
No. We're going to see
that talking squirrel thing.

321
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,500
Fuck that movie. I saw it this morning.
The mother squirrel dies in the end.

322
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,800
See {y:i}Head On.

323
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,400
- Yo, good looking, kid.
- You like that, right?

324
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
Fucking cartoons.
They got an unfair advantage.

325
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
They get to draw everything.

326
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,900
I'm not worried.

327
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,100
- Are you worried?
- Fuck, no.

328
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,800
- Let's go to Prey.
- We're not worried. Let's go to Prey.

329
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,200
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

330
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,700
- Did you get the numbers?
- I got the numbers.

331
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
- Ari, I can't hear you.
- Where are you?

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
It's Friday night. You at Prey?
Sounds like Prey.

333
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
Ari, you get the numbers?

334
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Hello? Shit.

335
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Hello. Can you hear me? Hey? Fuck.

336
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm coming over. That was Vince. I gotta go.
I gotta go do this.

337
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,400
What are you talking about?
This is our night.

338
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,500
It's {y:i}24l7 with this shit, baby.
I love you, don't wait up, okay?

339
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,700
Ari, could I have the car keys, please?

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
Come on. There's a cab stand
at fucking Yucca.

341
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Give me the fucking keys.

342
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Can you drop me off?

343
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
I can't get a signal.

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,800
Eric, it's gonna be fine. Enjoy the moment.

345
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,300
See, E., I like this girl.
Nice, positive attitude.

346
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,000
- What about my attitude?
- You?

347
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Come on, you have the best attitude.

348
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Slut.

349
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,500
Joanne, wait.

350
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000
Vince is my best friend.
I love that guy like a brother.

351
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,200
- But if he doesn't see how special you are...
- Nice try, Tortoise.

352
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,400
- Is that Jason Bateman?
- What?

353
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,700
Get the fuck out of here.

354
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,700
- I saw your movie today. You were great.
- Yeah?

355
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,200
- Thanks. What's your name?
- Take a hike, honey.

356
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,900
Baby, you can't talk to the fans like that.

357
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,500
- Don't be a faggot, Johnny.
- Don't call me a faggot.

358
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
What are you gonna do? Get tough?

359
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm gonna go get a beer.

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,300
So you played tennis in high school,
you were saying?

361
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,600
Tennis, yeah.

362
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,700
I think I want you to be my first.

363
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,400
But you're really gonna have to work for it.

365
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,100
Work? Come on.

366
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,200
I got into this business
so I don't have to work.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You are not ready for this, are you?

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,500
I am tonight.

369
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm not.

370
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,500
At least you're honest.

371
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
And gorgeous.

372
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,300
I'll call you from the road.

373
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Just so you know.

374
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,100
Tonight, I would have given you
the best head you ever had.

375
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,300
Who's got the number one movie
in the country, motherfucker?

376
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
We beat {y:i}The Squirrel?

377
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,700
The number one live-action film
in the country, $18.6 million.

378
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,300
Yeah.

379
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,700
What the fuck is she doing here?

380
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,900
Just having some drinks
with some friends, Ari.

381
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,600
- Yeah? You fucking my assistant?
- No.

382
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,300
The last thing I want to do is fire one
of your fuck buddies. You know that?

383
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,200
No tequila? Tara Reid steal it?

384
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Let's get into it. We gotta celebrate.
Come on. I'll get a bottle.

385
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,700
Can you relax?

386
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,200
- Yeah.
- Good.

387
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,700
I can't. Not with my boss here.

388
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,400
I know. That's totally fucked up.

389
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I didn't even know he was coming.
He shouldn't even be here.

390
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,200
You want to walk me out?

391
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,700
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.

392
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,600
I'll be right back.

393
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,200
Sorry about tonight.
I know it wasn't a great first date.

394
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
This was a great first date.

395
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

396
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Don't tell Ari about this.

397
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,400
Is this crazy?

398
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
Maybe a little bit, yeah.

399
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Good.

400
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,500
You're on fire, baby.
We gonna get you your next movie.

401
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,500
Wanna do {y:i}Hindenburg? Script's coming in.
It's like {y:i}Titanic on a blimp.

402
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,800
Why don't we save the business
for Monday?

403
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,000
You got it, baby. No problem. Big weekend.

404
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Where's Tanya?

405
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,300
Doing pushups in the men's bathroom,
for all I know.

406
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm done with that girl.

407
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,800
Where's the exhibitionist?

408
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,000
She's out there cutting it up with Teen Wolf.

409
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,800
Michael J. Fox is here?

410
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,500
No, the guy from the sequel.

411
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,700
Opening night of a hit,
and none of us are getting any action.

412
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,800
All I know is I'm here
with my best friends in the entire world.

413
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,200
- And Ari.
- And Ari.

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,900
- And there's no place I'd rather be.
- I'll drink to that.

415
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,300
Here you go, baby.

416
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Vince, hi. You go to my gym.

417
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

418
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,700
I'll catch you guys later.

419
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,000
There you go, daddy.

420
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,100
God, I just want to be him
for like a fucking hour.

421
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,600
You think my assistant's hot?
I don't know. I can't tell.

422
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,800
Yeah, I do.

423
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm thinking about hitting that.

425
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,122
