00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:50,703
Where are you?

3
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:54,479
Oh, yeah.
All right, all right, later.

4
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,813
You all right, Alisa?

5
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,471
You girls coming
to my party, yeah?

6
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,102
It's gonna be wicked,
everyone's gonna be there.

7
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:08,272
So, I was, like, Listen, yeah, brush
your teeth after you lick me out...

8
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:09,936
don't try and kiss me,
you get me?

9
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,823
- That's proper grimy.
- I know, proper ghetto.

10
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,007
Moony's buff,
you know.

11
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:17,482
- Have you got a spare cigarette?
- No, I'm giving up.

12
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,970
Shaneek and Carleen are over there.
They're watching us.

13
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,207
Did you finish the coursework
for them?

14
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:24,421
No.

15
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:25,962
Katie!

16
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,932
You girls gotta come to my party.
It's gonna be heavy.

17
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:32,296
- Who's gonna be there?
- Everyone's coming.

18
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,948
Mum and dad are away,
so anything goes.

19
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:36,457
Anything.

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,500
- Please come.
- Safe, yeah?

21
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,937
Hey, pussyhole,
seen Claire around?

22
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,807
You like this,
isn't it, Charlotte?

23
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,596
Why you calling me that?
You know my name's Claire.

24
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:58,818
So that if anyone else hears, they don't
think that you're, you know, Sam's girl.

25
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,719
- You scared of him, Jay?
- Of Sam? No.

26
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,263
All right, girls.
Wanna come to my party?

27
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,651
Are you gonna come? Surely your mum
can low you, it's Friday night.

28
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:21,154
I don't know,
I'm not feeling too good.

29
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,842
And I ain't got nothing to wear.

30
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:26,277
Okay, if I score some money to get us
something to wear, will you come?

31
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,764
- Where you gonna get that much money?
- Don't watch that.

32
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:31,929
What go on, bitch?

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,692
- You seen Claire anywhere?
- No.

34
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,683
- What?
- No.

35
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,101
What the fuck you looking at,
you fat bitch? You know me?

36
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,271
Have you seen Claire?

37
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:44,376
Can't we kick, man?
I'm not your fucking security guard.

38
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:15,003
- Yes, Moony.
- Yo, Trife.

39
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,530
- Where you been, man?
- I had a couple things to do, man.

40
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:20,755
What's wrong with these batty holes,
man. Always fucking playing football.

41
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,963
Come in the class,
stinking it up afterwards.

42
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,953
Hey, just light the zoot, man.

43
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,785
Come on, Becky.
Let's go.

44
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,087
You know what? Them two girls
over there are fucking weird, blood.

45
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,040
I know. What the fuck
she's looking at, man?

46
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:39,986
How can you make her watch you
like that, blood?

47
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,906
See me now, if that was me,
I wouldn't have it.

48
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:44,560
You should spark
in her fucking face.

49
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:47,127
Yeah, you watch.
I'm gonna mash her up.

50
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:49,623
- Hey, come on, let's go, Jay.
- All right, man.

51
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,568
- Ring me tonight, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, course I will.

52
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:53,266
- Come on.
- Yes, man, there...

53
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,185
- and that Claire's pussy is live, man.
- You're gonna be late.

54
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,671
Let's get inside
before the second bell.

55
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,830
Come on.

56
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:05,204
Oi, Alisa's looking tit, boy.

57
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:06,641
Why you split up with her?

58
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,619
I don't know, man.
I dashed it, isn't it?

59
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,925
She just... I don't know.

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,099
- Boy, you're a fool, Trife man.
- Hey, fuck off, man.

61
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,569
You're brave, blood...
I would never leave that, man.

62
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:19,246
- I'd fuck that everyday.
- Everyday, blood, standard.

63
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,160
- What you talking about?
- Rub them titties all night, blood.

64
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,806
What you uniform pussyholes know about
titties and pussy and all them thing?

65
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:29,614
And what you doing chatting about Alisa?
I fucked that girl a few weeks ago, blood.

66
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,980
Everyday for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

67
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,361
Think you're so bad, isn't it?

68
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:43,789
What did I tell you before, huh?
When I call you, you must come.

69
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,751
Beat her, Shaneek star.

70
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,565
- What did I tell you your name was?
- Big bird.

71
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,113
Leave me alone, please.

72
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:56,488
Get up.

73
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,948
Fucked her hard, blood,
you understand me?

74
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:00,710
Bareback, no rubber smutting.
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

75
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,104
- What you gonna do, man?
- Leave us alone, blood, man.

76
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,372
Who the fuck you talking to?
Hold this fool.

77
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,099
Low it, man, low it,
low it, low it, man.

78
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:09,227
What you got for me, blood?

79
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:10,536
- Got nothing, blood, man.

80
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,075

00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,701

- Got nothing, man.

82
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,590
Fuck you talking to, blood?

83
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:18,175
- Yeah, Tribal two.
- Hi, that's my sister's, blood, man.

84
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,385
Hey, leave him, blood.
Who told you to pick him up?

85
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:22,727
What you doing?

86
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:27,554
No-one fucking likes you,
virgin fool.

87
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,709
Didn't she tell you before?
Don't answer her back.

88
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:34,308
So what are you?
Slag then?

89
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,699
Go on, bitch,
tell everybody you're a virgin.

90
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,106
What?

91
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:43,483
Pick up my ring
and tell everyone you're a virgin.

92
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,147
Pick it up, man!

93
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:49,597
Well?

94
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,844
I'm a virgin.

95
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,109
You know what, blood. Hug him up like
the fucking batty hole you are.

96
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,287
Hug him up, blood!

97
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:03,996
Hey, what you doing, man?

98
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:07,003
What, you can't fuck with mans
your own age? You gotta trouble us?

99
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,697
Who the fuck you talking to?

100
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,175
Hey, where you going, blood?
Where you going?

101
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,387
Where you going?
Where?

102
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,214
Fucking idiot.

103
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,774
- Smack her up.
- Beat her up, Shaneek. Beat her!

104
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,609
Look at her just fucking
sitting there. Fool.

105
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,805
Go on, fuck off
and clean your duty self up, man.

106
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:36,670
And none of you lot better say nothing
or else you'll get the same...

107
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:38,645
as that bitch did
with her virgin self.

108
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,183
She ain't no virgin.

109
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,231
How the fuck would you know?

110
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:48,124
Because me and her fucked
the day I turned you down.

111
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,205
- Is there gonna be girls there, though?
- Yeah, Jay, everyone's coming.

112
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,162
Hey, don't be on no hype,
you know.

113
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,240
Trife.

114
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,682
- You reaching that?
- I don't know, man.

115
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:07,578
- Hey, what are you...
- Billy.

116
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,338
- Go on.
- What, you out of here, yeah?

117
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,970
- Safe.
- Bless, man.

118
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,358
Laters, Jay, man.
All right, Moon.

119
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,118
Hey, hey, wait up, wait up.

120
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:22,513
Don't say anything.
Hang on a minute.

121
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,486
- You all right?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:28,844
- Look, why aren't you speaking to me?
- I am, man.

123
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,405
You ain't chatted to me in, like,
three weeks.

124
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,160
I've been doing
better things, isn't?

125
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:36,877
- I need to speak to you about something.
- Come on, Alisa.

126
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:38,282
Call me later, yeah?

127
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,343
Listen, hear what, right.

128
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:10,862
If you say anything to your fucking dad,
I'll kill you, you understand?

129
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,974
I can make things so easy for you,
you know that?

130
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,583
- Hi, poppet.
- Hey.

131
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,402
Who's that boy you were with?

132
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,482
I thought maybe
it was the one from before.

133
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:44,971
No, I fell.
He was helping me up.

134
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,285
Oh, right. Only I saw him giving you
a peck on the cheek.

135
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,611
- I thought maybe it was him.
- No.

136
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,678
How was biology?

137
00:08:58,154 --> 00:08:59,364
Katie?

138
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,464
Katie, what the hell's happened
to your face? Look at me.

139
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:03,744
I fell.

140
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:07,485
You all right?

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,054
Hello?
Yeah, I'm Dan Fineal.

142
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:17,309
Yeah, Arthur. No, you were supposed
to be there two hours ago, mate.

143
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:22,717
Trevor.

144
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,085
Get in.

145
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,654
School finish at four.
Why you take so long?

146
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,574
I had to chat to one girl,
isn't it?

147
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,934
This here is Andreas.

148
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:41,251
Nice to meet you, bruv.

149
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:44,415
- This is my nephew Trevor.
- Trife.

150
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,094
You have the thing?

151
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:00,567
You see...

152
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,965
if you don't drill
the replica good...

153
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,254
the bullet won't leave and pop!

154
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:10,491
Is it okay?

155
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:14,229
The last boy used to do this
for me, was shit.

156
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,205
Guns always used to blow up.

157
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,575
But this looks good.

158
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,977
But I will have to test it.
Saying?

159
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,036
So, listen, come see me
when you finish school tomorrow...

160
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,206
and we can discuss business,
all right?

161
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:30,648
- Cool.
- Yeah.

162
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,484
Now get out.

163
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:42,579
Me just a joke with you.

164
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,151
Me see you tomorrow, yeah?

165
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,612
- Don't be late, you know.
- I won't, I won't.

166
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:50,032
- Later.
- All right, Trevor.

167
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,246
My little gun driller.

168
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:55,700
Hi, Katie.

169
00:10:58,136 --> 00:10:59,564
- Hi, love.
- Hi.

170
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,491
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine.

171
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,797
Oh, that.
She fell over at school.

172
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:09,174
Christ, Arthur's really fucked up
my day.

173
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:17,641
Under the seat.

174
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,889
Oh, shit.

175
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:39,311
Curtis, I've forgotten the change, man.
I've left it back at my place.

176
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:42,506
I'm really sorry. I'll bring it round
to yours later, yeah?

177
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:48,588
Fuck it, I fuck, I fucked up. Look,
take it back, we'll sort it out tomorrow.

178
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:51,499
Cool. Cool.

179
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:53,740
You sure?

180
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,368
Go on.

181
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:57,933
Cool. Cheers, man.

182
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,382
- See you tomorrow.
- Cool, man. Cheers.

183
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:09,228
I think she's being bullied
at school.

184
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,399
- Did she say that?
- No. But...

185
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,388
Well, don't worry about it.
She's a bright kid, she'd tell us.

186
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,757
Have you seen
my address book anywhere?

187
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,680
Don't worry about it?
What sort of thing is that to say?

188
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,915
Aren't you worried about
your own daughter?

189
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,100
Have you asked her?

190
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,973
There you go.
She's fine.

191
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,570
Lenny, could you get your sister
to turn that shit off, please.

192
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,701
- It's been playing for ages.
- Doesn't bother me.

193
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:17,685
Fine.

194
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,759
Katie! Katie!

195
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,776
Katie! Katie!

196
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:25,392
Katie!

197
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:46,966
We are number one for hip-hop
and in London.

198
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:52,332
And around the country, Sky Digital,
Telewest and Digital DAB Radio.

199
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:56,720
Billy-Bob Thornton,
Angelina Jolie's ex-husband...

200
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,395
has said that she's not
that good in bed.

201
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,088
Hey, mum, I got it, yeah.

202
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:06,924
- What go on, coz?
- Yes, blood.

203
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:09,424
- What's happening, man?
- Like the trim still, man.

204
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:12,618
- Hey, what you want, though?
- Hey, come say hello to my mum, blood.

205
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,887
- Morning, Jason.
- Morning, Mrs. Hector.

206
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,878
I hope you two boys use this day
to remember that poor girl...

207
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:22,022
and not for foolishness.

208
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,262
- Yes, mum.
- Course, Mrs. Hector.

209
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,707
Go on.

210
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,481
That's right, blood,
do what your mum says.

211
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:31,111
Shut up, man.

212
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:34,120
Yeah, blood...
school called here this morning.

213
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,702
Told my mum the whole year
had the day off.

214
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,291
- This is proper sad, man.
- I know, man.

215
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,549
I was just about to leave my yard,
like had my uniform on and everything.

216
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:47,627
Listen, blood, Sam and them girls
always picking on her.

217
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:49,676
Yeah, but Sam
troubles us too, blood...

218
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:51,651
and we ain't committing suicide
over it, are we?

219
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:54,375
If anyone should fucking die,
it's him man.

220
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:57,157
Can't believe someone
I pressed is dead.

221
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:58,467
So why didn't you tell me
then, man?

222
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,512
She asked me
not to say nothing, isn't it.

223
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:02,440
Thought people would call her
sket and thing.

224
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,250
Plus her dad caught us...
Hey, you got a zoot?

225
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:08,646
No, I got a roll up, though.
Jacked it off my mum.

226
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,567
Spark that, man.

227
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:19,460
Blood, weird thing is, though...

228
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,398
her dad came by late last night.

229
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:25,281
That's how I found out
she was dead.

230
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:29,635
In her suicide note, she said
something about Sam troubling her.

231
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:32,446
- But I was always nice to her.
- A note?

232
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,293
Well, did she mention me?

233
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,108
I never see you chat to her
anyway, man.

234
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:40,515
Blood, don't watch
what I do, man.

235
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,653
You ain't always with me, and
you never knew I pressed her either.

236
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,827
You come like some secret agent
or something, man.

237
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,256
Let me have two draw
of that, man.

238
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:50,395
Hey, listen bell Moony.
I wanna duck out quick.

239
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:52,864
The whole day?

240
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:55,863
Don't lie, blood.

241
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:59,487
Yeah, I'll have
to take a cab still.

242
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,272
Moons, just hurry up though, man.
All right, bless.

243
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:06,968
- Hey, blood, you see Katie, yeah?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,622
Do you reckon
she would have banged me, like?

245
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:11,034
No, man.

246
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,670
Why not?

247
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,431
I think I'm buff.

248
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,984
Blood, I beg you,
play the fucking game, man.

249
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:22,681
Oh, fuck's sake.

250
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,723
Hello?

251
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,187
- Yeah, who's that?
- It's me.

252
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,877
You didn't call me.

253
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:36,818
Did you hear?
Sad, isn't it?

254
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:41,624
- Look, what are you doing today?
- Gonna jam with Moons and Jay.

255
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:46,095
Might go up West End later.
Gotta check my uncle, why?

256
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:49,977
- No, just tell me now, man.
- I'd rather see you.

257
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,272
You don't need to see me,
you ain't my girl no more. What is it?

258
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:57,145
What the fuck do you mean
you're pregnant?

259
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,521
Oh, my days!

260
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:00,462
You can't be fucking pregnant. I thought
you'd get the morning after pill?

261
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,899
It's not just up
to the girls, you know.

262
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:05,875
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

263
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,485
I've been taking tests all week.

264
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:12,113
Look...

265
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:14,543
I want us to get back together.

266
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:17,390
Later, fuck that.
After you fucked Sam a few weeks ago?

267
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:19,728
Yeah, he told me he bare backed you.
That's even worse man.

268
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:21,780
- You never knew I knew that, did you?
- But we do know!

269
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:23,433
Hey, and don't bother trying
to explain, man.

270
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,363
You know what,
for all I know the baby's his.

271
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,346
Fact now that I think of it,
I know it is, and you know it too.

272
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,450
Yeah, blood, she's loose, man.
Cut her off, man.

273
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,887
What?
I slept with Katie last year.

274
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:34,355
Me and you weren't even together,
so fuck off!

275
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,038
Standard, blood. You get me. I told you
about that girl, man, she's a sket.

276
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:41,576
Pregnant, though.
It's a bit deep, still.

277
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:45,421
- So what you gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

278
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,111
Fuck it, it can't be mine.

279
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,031
I just don't need
this shit today.

280
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,198
So what, can man's come
and reach your uncle with you, blood?

281
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:57,259
No, I think he wants
to see me alone, still.

282
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,484
So, what did he say?

283
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:02,793
He said he's going out.

284
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:05,933
And that fucking Sam told him
we slept together.

285
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:07,751
So why didn't you tell him
what happened?

286
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:09,479
He didn't give me
a fucking chance.

287
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,127
You know what, yeah,
fuck him and this fucking baby.

288
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,196
- All right, girls?
- Mum, don't you knock?

289
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,817
Oi, none of your lip.

290
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:21,798
I know you're upset,
but that's no reason to be cheeky.

291
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,100
- Do you want a drink, Becky?
- No, thanks.

292
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,568
Right, I'm off to work.
Lis, I want you back by midnight.

293
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,651
- Oh, mum!
- One, then, on the dot.

294
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,890
And if you think you can't get back here
call your dad and he'll pick you up.

295
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:33,061
- All right?
- Okay.

296
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:34,945
Alis...

297
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,928
I know you're upset, but there's
nothing you could have done.

298
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,427
Now, I'm sad for
that other girl's parents...

299
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:47,138
but all that really matters
is that you're all right.

300
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,091
Are you all right?

301
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:51,685
I'm...

302
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,446
I'm fine.

303
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,356
Good.
See you later, darling.

304
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,914
- I love you, Lis.
- Love you.

305
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:07,612
Yo, D. Guess what, man,
I got the day off school.

306
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:09,853
And I'm going to that party
tonight as well.

307
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,772
Yeah, I know.
Your school belled a while ago.

308
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,173
Hi, Lenny.

309
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,181
I'm sorry about your sister, bro.

310
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,811
Tell your mate Trevor
I said thank you.

311
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:22,745
See you.

312
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,534
So, you gonna help me or what?

313
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:28,736
Yeah.

314
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,144
I still can't believe
Katie killed herself.

315
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,380
So, what do you wanna do?

316
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:38,814
You know what...

317
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,599
I wanna get fucked up.

318
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,971
I wanna go shopping for tonight,
that'll make me feel better.

319
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:45,556
And if Trife don't want me,
I'm sure someone else will.

320
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,614
I meant about the baby.

321
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:49,311
Lose it, if I'm lucky.

322
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,390
Well, at least
you're thinking straight.

323
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,214
We've got the whole day off,
we might as well do something...

324
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:54,814
constructive with ourselves.

325
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,854
I know where we can score
some wicked draw.

326
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,463
I'd get so fat if I kept this.

327
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,109
Taxi!

328
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,473
What the fuck, man?

329
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:18,933
What's fucking taking him
so long, man?

330
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,503
Taxi!

331
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,231
Fuck off!

332
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:26,965
Fucking hell, man!

333
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:28,371
Come on.

334
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,121
Fuck, man.

335
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,518
Look at this girl's pussy. Looks like
her guts are hanging out and shit.

336
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:41,998
Man, that's nasty, man.
I hate that shit, ugly pussy.

337
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:44,401
- Still poke it, though.
- No, that's not for me, star.

338
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:47,150
I won't fuck no girl, yeah,
unless she's got a DV?

339
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:48,721
DV?

340
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,894
Designer vagina, man.
Neat tucked in lips and shit.

341
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,071
It's the way forward, blood.

342
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,237
So, who's this guy again?

343
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,828
Rupert. I met him at some rave.
He gives me weed and shit for free.

344
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,454
Is it? Safe.

345
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:10,191
Finally.

346
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:12,778
Let's roll, man.

347
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:17,165
Yes, Jay, what's cooking, bruv?

348
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:19,913
- Yeah, like the trim, rude boy.
- Bye, mum.

349
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,751
- What took you so fucking long, man?
- There weren't no cabs, isn't it.

350
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:34,087
I've been having a good week, actually.
Come on in.

351
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:38,437
So, Rebecca,
who's your lovely friend?

352
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:41,572
- I'm Alisa.
- Alisa? What a pretty name.

353
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,854
Ladies, this is my friend
Hamish.

354
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,097
Hi.

355
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:48,577
Go and take a seat on the sofa, take
your coats off, make yourselves at home.

356
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:53,479
How much do you want this time?

357
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,674
- As much as you wanna give.
- Not a problem.

358
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:01,478
But I want some E's today
and maybe some coke.

359
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:05,031
The weed I can do for free, but,
coke and E's is gonna cost.

360
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:10,051
I haven't got no money on me.

361
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,097
Who needs money?

362
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,453
- Get your knickers off then.
- In your fucking dreams.

363
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:38,212
- What, you're not gonna let me fuck you?
- No.

364
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:41,539
- What about a blow-job then?
- Fuck off.

365
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,384
- Wank?
- Keep talking and you'll get a smack.

366
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,071
Oh, come on, Al,
we'll make dollars when we sell it.

367
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,413
Do you wanna shop or what?

368
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,489
- Yeah, but...
- Stop being such a boring bitch then.

369
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,821
But I'm not gonna suck it, okay?

370
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,776
What is that?

371
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,548
- How old are you?
- I'm old enough, blood.

372
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:20,823
"Blood", you're too young
to buy these beers.

373
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:24,054
- What? Oh, shut up, man.
- Oi, come back.

374
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,732
- Come back!
- Come back or what, man? Shut your mouth.

375
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,516
- I'll have you arrested!
- You ain't gonna do shit, man.

376
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:31,613
- Get out of my shop.
- What?

377
00:24:31,614 --> 00:24:33,597
- You're banned!
- Man, I'll leave when I wanna leave, man.

378
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:34,742
What? Come.

379
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,593
- Dickhead.
- Fuck off.

380
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,535
Bastard!

381
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:44,950
I ain't fucking with her no more, man,
after she got banged by Sam.

382
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,600
Fuck that, you get me?
She's any girl to me now. Fuck her.

383
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:51,251
Bloods, I wouldn't care whose baby
it is, yeah, but I'd still bang that.

384
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,778
Hey, bloods, where's yours?

385
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,538
Had to dash it at that guy,
isn't it, man.

386
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,228
- He was shook, though.
- You're a bad man.

387
00:24:58,425 --> 00:24:59,504
Let's dust, man.

388
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:01,397
I ain't standing on the corner like
a fucking rent boy all day.

389
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:04,209
- So what, which way are we going, bruv?
- Let's roll this way, isn't it.

390
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:10,863
What's wrong, man?
What are you looking at?

391
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:12,974
Sam lives over there.

392
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,943
- You wanna get your GameBoy back?
- Yeah.

393
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:20,886
Yeah that, I'm on that, man,
let's do it. Come, come.

394
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,741
Let's not be stupid, man.

395
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:27,539
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Sam's gonna be at school, blood, yeah?

396
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,077
Only our year's got the day off.

397
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:30,229
We'll just go up there,
say we're his friends...

398
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,020
and we're picking it up,
isn't it? Simple.

399
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,059
Or, we ding the bell,
get through the main door...

400
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,723
and boot down his fucking
front door, isn't it.

401
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:39,188
No, man.
That's some police shit.

402
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:40,627
Look, blood, there's three
of us alie...

403
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:42,960
we'll just go up there, yeah,
ask for it back.

404
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,294
And if he's gets brave, blood, we'll
handle it at school together, isn't it.

405
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,888
- Standard, let's roll.
- But he rolls deep, man!

406
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,293
- Hey, fuck it, man, let's do it.
- Oh, shit.

407
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:01,384
What the fuck is he doing at home,
man? He's gonna kill us.

408
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,300
- Hey, don't worry, man, he's gone.
- What if he comes back, though, like?

409
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,022
He won't, man. What's wrong with you?
What you scared for, man?

410
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,069
I'm not, man.
I think we should just duck, man.

411
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:10,126
- Just shut up, man, you're scared.
- I'm not.

412
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

413
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:17,764
We're Sam's friends. We've just come
here to pick something up.

414
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:20,932
Sam's not here.
He's just gone to the shop for me.

415
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,718
Yeah, we saw him downstairs, he told
us to come up and wait for him.

416
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,509
He just left, right?

417
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,050
Hey, that must be his room.

418
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,866
- That's where your GameBoy is.
- Is that my GameBoy, bloods?

419
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:43,912
Oh shit, shit, oh shit.

420
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:45,795
What if he comes back now?

421
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:47,400
What the fuck
are you lot doing here?

422
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:50,211
Sam jacked my sister's GameBoy,
yeah, I'm just here to take it back.

423
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,579
- Hold this boy.
- Hey, Moons, hold him. Hold him, man.

424
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:55,174
He told me he bought that,
he's such an arsehole.

425
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:56,552
Yo, what's out there?

426
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:58,722
Balcony, where he stashes
his weed and shit.

427
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:00,771
Come and take this boy
outside, man.

428
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,405
If he's such an arsehole,
why are you with him?

429
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:05,380
I don't know, he's older,
more mature.

430
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:07,581
Then why you cheat him?

431
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:11,493
- Blood, you can't take his weed, man.
- Fuck that, man.

432
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:13,664
- Hey, Jay, man, we got him.
- Just give me one minute, man.

433
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,797
I don't even know
why you're with that boy, man.

434
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:19,869
Look...
you could be my girlfriend.

435
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:24,474
It's just, he said if I leave him,
he'll tell everyone I was a shit fuck.

436
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:28,380
No, no, I know you're not shit,
I bet you're cold in bed, man.

437
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,691
I don't know...

438
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:32,322
He says I'm not that good
and I've only slept with him, so...

439
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:33,859
Yeah, well, let me be the judge
of that then, isn't it.

440
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,840
What?

441
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,710
- What, has he got any rubbers in here?
- Yeah, in that drawer. Why?

442
00:27:38,977 --> 00:27:41,943
Not now, Jay, man, his mum said
he only went down the road.

443
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,693
- Maybe you lot should go.
- You know what, don't watch that, man.

444
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,444
Oh, no, no, no, low it, man.

445
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:03,993
- I'm sorry, yeah, this don't normally...
- It's okay.

446
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,485
It's because you're so buff,
yeah, and like you're good, man.

447
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:11,836
In fact, yeah, you should leave
that pussyhole and be my girlfriend.

448
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:14,939
- What do you think, yeah?
- What if he beats me up or something?

449
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,663
No, he ain't gonna do that.
Look, you know what, darling.

450
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,867
- Come with me. Come.
- Are you done?

451
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,237
- One minute.
- You fucking know about it.

452
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:24,379
You let the side down!

453
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:26,394
What's up, man? You don't even know
about sex live, man.

454
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:28,598
What the fuck you lot doing
in my yard?

455
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:32,433
Look, blood, you took
my GameBoy, man, I just...

456
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:35,534
Are you dizzy, blood? You're gonna
come up here like you're bad.

457
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:37,743
You see, yeah,
I'm gonna fuck you up, blood.

458
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:41,359
And you, see, you, Claire, I'm gonna
shove this bat so far up your pussy...

459
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:42,796
Shit.

460
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,787
Hey, fuck you, you fucking prick.

461
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,283
- Fucking idiot!
- Hold on, hold on, man.

462
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:48,720
Oh, shit!

463
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,823
Come on, lets go.

464
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,371
Run, blood!

465
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,003
I can't believe
what you lot just done.

466
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:26,608
Hey, fuck him, man,
he deserved it.

467
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:28,974
Hey, you know
he fucked Alisa, isn't it?

468
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,346
No, I didn't.

469
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:32,560
Sam's gonna kill me.

470
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:34,382
He ain't gonna do shit to you, man.
You know why?

471
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:36,004
Because you're my girl now,
you get me?

472
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:38,476
Yeah, man, let him come, man.
You see my uncle I'm checking today?

473
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:41,669
He's a proper bad man. And if Sam
thinks about doing anything...

474
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:43,461
my uncle will murk him
on the spot, standard.

475
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:45,801
You keep talking about your uncle
that's gonna do this and that, yeah?

476
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,404
But we ain't even met him, man.
I mean, what...

477
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:49,069
are you sure my man
even exists, like?

478
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,797
He comes like the invisible man
or something, blood.

479
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:52,902
- Yeah. Hollow Man, rude boy.
- I'll slap you, you know that, Moons?

480
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:55,401
Just wait till we need him
and he'll be here.

481
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,311
If he's there, I'm there. I'll jook
some up, blood. I don't business.

482
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,231
Shut up, Moons man,
you ain't gonna do shit, man.

483
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:04,492
I can't believe you swallowed
that guy's spunk.

484
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:07,307
I hate it, it tastes like
salty egg whites.

485
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,477
Yuk, but what
if he's got something?

486
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,842
You can't catch nothing like that.
All the acids in your stomach kill it.

487
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,079
- Did you like wanking that guy?
- No.

488
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:16,767
Was you wet?

489
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:19,040
- Yeah, a little bit.
- A little bit?

490
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:22,438
- Yeah, but his thing's so small, man.
- I bet you was mad wet, I was.

491
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:24,265
Well then, why didn't you
just fuck that Rupert friend...

492
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:25,475
and I wouldn't have had
to wank him.

493
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:28,868
You just said you liked it.
Anyway only my man gets the pussy.

494
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:31,169
Unlike you, obviously.
You sure you know whose baby it is?

495
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,540
- Don't try it, Becky.
- Yeah, well, I couldn't have that in me.

496
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,839
If I was you, I'd want to rip it out
with a coat-hanger.

497
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,936
- Fucking hell, man!
- What, blood?

498
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:17,505
Didn't I tell them no onions?

499
00:31:17,505 --> 00:31:19,446
Yeah, you did, man,
you did say no onions, blood, man.

500
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,503
Didn't I say no onions?

501
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:26,615
Fool.

502
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:49,468
- Oi, what's going on?
- We got money, relax yourself.

503
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:50,929
Drive, man.

504
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:52,724
So, what, are me and you on
or what now?

505
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:55,443
- Yeah, yeah, I'm your girl.
- Yeah?

506
00:31:56,763 --> 00:31:58,039
Yeah.
Come here.

507
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:03,930
Well, I gotta go home.
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

508
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,718
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, take care, yeah.

509
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:32,692
Coke head baby.

510
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:36,180
Whatever, man,
it'll be gone soon.

511
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:38,068
God, I ain't changing
no fucking nappies for it.

512
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:41,392
Look, yeah, there's an abortion clinic
number here, do you wanna bell it?

513
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:44,751
Not now, man. Not today.
Look, can I use your toilet?

514
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:46,738
Are you gonna do a shit?
Because if you are, then, no.

515
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,200
That's loose, man, I don't do that
in other people's houses.

516
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:52,273
Well, hurry up, we need to get
the money for the garms.

517
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:36,868
Yeah, she's banged up, babes.
Yeah.

518
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:39,743
All right, see you soon.

519
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:43,587
- Who was that?
- My man.

520
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,652
- Listen, lads, where you off to?
- Oxford Street, man.

521
00:33:51,882 --> 00:33:53,823
Well, why don't you walk?
It's only down the road.

522
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,241
Because we wanted
to catch a cab, man.

523
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,062
Why don't you shut your mouth
and mind your own business, blood?

524
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:59,395
Well, to be honest might have
to drop you off at Marble Arch...

525
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,973
- because the traffic's...
- What's wrong with you?

526
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:05,637
Yeah, man, yeah, Trife
and them two little pussyholes.

527
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:09,093
Yeah, man, yeah. No, no, don't reach,
don't reach, I'm cool, yeah.

528
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:11,206
Listen I swear down, blood,
if I see them before you see...

529
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:12,581
I'm gonna bang them up.
I'm gonna bang them up.

530
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:14,716
I'm gonna bust their heads,
do you understand me?

531
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,470
Listen, if you eye them, yeah if you
see them, you just ding me, yeah.

532
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:31,780
- Can we go and get something to eat?
- No, I don't wanna look fat for Mark.

533
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,746
- But I'm starving, though.
- We'll get a pizza when we get to his.

534
00:34:47,714 --> 00:34:49,568
- Cheers, mate.
- That's nine pound twenty, mate.

535
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:53,113
You know what, mate, I got passed
by five black cabs today.

536
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:55,352
- Well, that ain't my fault, mate.
- Just because I'm black.

537
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,485
Ain't that ironic, though, like?
Black cab don't take black man.

538
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,055
- So, what's your point?
- My point is that...

539
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,877
it becomes a vicious circle.

540
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:05,077
- Well, what's that mean?
- It means...

541
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,505
Come back!

542
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,594
- Come on.
- You little black bastard!

543
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:46,639
Now I'm hungry.

544
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,297
Why did you bring me here again?

545
00:35:49,912 --> 00:35:52,813
We give him some dope and he gives us
money for our dresses.

546
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:54,030
Can we get it and go, please,
because I'm really tired...

547
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,957
of listening to you two fuck.
Look...

548
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:58,993
I didn't know he was gonna be so old.

549
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,045
He's twenty-eight. He's an actor.

550
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,662
That's almost twice our age.

551
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,414
I know, but he thinks I'm eighteen,
though, so...

552
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:10,513
You were good, baby.

553
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,867
You lot want anything else?

554
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:15,915
No.

555
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:23,730
Hang on, hang on,
I thought she was pregnant?

556
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,618
Yeah, she is right now,
but she's getting rid of it.

557
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:28,455
- Go on, Lis, it's good.
- Okay.

558
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,780
So how much do you want for all this?
Three hundred?

559
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:34,447
Yeah.

560
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,094
All right, I'll go get it.

561
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,829
Right, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?

562
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,126
So, you like what you see, huh?

563
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:50,886
No.

564
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,034
So what do you
come upstairs for then?

565
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,587
- I wanted to see if she was all right.
- She was fucking great.

566
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:59,048
- I bet you are as well.
- Fuck off!

567
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:00,803
You're sick.

568
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,719
- You know she's only fifteen?
- Yeah, of course I do.

569
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,738
I found her student card.

570
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,842
She thinks
it's her little secret.

571
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,848
Do you know
what my little secret is?

572
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,597
Go on, have a guess.

573
00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:16,551
I'm a fucking bastard.

574
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:23,075
You know, I've never fucked
a pregnant girl before...

575
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,639
but, with you,
I think I'd make the exception.

576
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:27,458
How about you fuck yourself?

577
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:31,047
You should take the chance
while you can, you little slag.

578
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,379
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a fucking little slag...

579
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:36,103
because you're fifteen years old
and you're pregnant.

580
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:38,470
Probably some little black fellow
who hasn't hung around.

581
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:43,422
But that's cool,
because I like you.

582
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:47,110
So when you've decided
to dump it...

583
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:49,691
why don't you come back
and see me?

584
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:51,589
You won't have to get jealous of me
fucking your mate...

585
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,477
because I'll probably
fuck you too.

586
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,139
You know...

587
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:01,122
- you're not right about everything.
- What's that, then?

588
00:38:01,924 --> 00:38:03,712
You're not a bastard...

589
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,286
you're a cunt.

590
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:15,480
Right, ready for round two, baby?

591
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,296
Boy! This shop is heavy.

592
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,140
Good afternoon, sirs.
Can I help you?

593
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:40,570
- Yeah. Where are your hats, rude girl?
- Downstairs, sir.

594
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,976
- It's here?
- It's over there.

595
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,058
This is what you want, isn't?

596
00:38:53,437 --> 00:38:54,778
What do you think?

597
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:02,999
You know what,
blood fuck that guard, man.

598
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:04,155
You know what,
can we kick, man?

599
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:06,042
I'm sure they've got better stuff
down the road anyway.

600
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:19,761
Hey!

601
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,430
Wait.

602
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:24,848
Come on, come on.
Come with me. Come on.

603
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:27,793
Get the fuck off me, man!
What you doing?

604
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:29,366
- You're in a lot of trouble, mate.
- For what?

605
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,952
- Stealing that hat.
- I had it on when I come in, man.

606
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:34,997
- What's he taken?
- The cap.

607
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:36,630
He had it on
when we came in, bro.

608
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,222
Hey, pipe down, please.
And I'm not your bro.

609
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:40,341
Oi, fuck off, blood, about pipe down.
Get off me, man!

610
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:41,998
Listen, I told you,
I fucking had that when I come in.

611
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:43,919
- Don't swear at me.
- And what the fuck you gonna do?

612
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,460
You better watch it,
the police have been called.

613
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:46,922
Hey, call them, man.
I don't give a fuck.

614
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,596
I'll tell them, too.
I had the hat when I come in.

615
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:49,523
Hey, check your cameras, man.

616
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:51,060
Nisha, would you call
the police, please.

617
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,710
This young man has taken this hat
and is now causing a commotion.

618
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,663
- Is that all he's taken?
- Yeah.

619
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,897
But he was wearing that cap
when he came in.

620
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,114
- Are you sure?
- Yes, because I greeted him.

621
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,259
Thank you!

622
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:03,465
- I'm not sure that he was.
- I am sure. Sorry.

623
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:05,901
Move out the fucking way
and let us out, man! Yo, blood.

624
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:09,098
- Are you gonna fucking apologise, coz?
- Just leave, please.

625
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,898
- Hey, hold up, man.
- What?

626
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:18,155
Do you know what?
You want your hat so much, take it.

627
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:21,484
Fucking prick!

628
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:28,522
I'm stinging. Were you watching?
I bet you could hear, isn't it?

629
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,997
So, three hundred squids, yeah, babes.
We'll split it down the mids.

630
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,750
You got shoes, right?
We can't be looking like no tramps.

631
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:36,588
Yeah.

632
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:38,476
You are looking forward
to tonight, yeah?

633
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:39,852
I don't know, yeah, probably.

634
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:41,739
What's the matter, then?
You look like someone just...

635
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:45,608
Exactly. Look,
I've been thinking about stuff.

636
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,799
Me like this,
Katie killing herself.

637
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:52,128
I mean, that is why
we got the day off.

638
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,153
I don't know, maybe
we shouldn't go to the party.

639
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:55,401
What?

640
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:58,696
I don't know.
It's like, it's weird. It's strange.

641
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:02,499
She was so tall and pretty...
I wish I was that tall.

642
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:06,944
You know, I reckon
she could have been a model.

643
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,256
I knew she was troubled, but...

644
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:11,879
I never thought it was that bad
that she'd have to kill herself.

645
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,952
Well, it's done now.
Nothing we can do.

646
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:17,276
- I could have stuck up for her.
- So why didn't you?

647
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,342
I don't know.

648
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,061
Well, she's dead now.
Get over it. I am.

649
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,782
Don't you ever think about anything
but yourself?

650
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,531
Yeah.
Clothes, shoes, money, sex.

651
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:29,059
Wait, sex involves me
though, don't it?

652
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,738
Do you think Moony likes me?

653
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:33,762
- I don't know.
- He's so fine.

654
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:35,908
I won't fuck him
unless he eats me out.

655
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:38,308
- Do you think he will?
- I don't know.

656
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:39,900
So when you gonna get rid
of this baby?

657
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:43,006
- Lis?
- Just leave it, Becky, yeah?

658
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:53,912
Saint Martin Girls.
What you lot saying?

659
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:57,046
Oi, do you hear about that big bird
girl that committed suicide?

660
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:58,393
Proper sensitive, isn't it?

661
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:01,721
She got so upset.
We was only joking with her.

662
00:42:01,984 --> 00:42:03,871
- Didn't look like a joke.
- Lis, shush.

663
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:07,292
She just got a bit feisty, that's all.
She needed a little bit of slapping.

664
00:42:07,488 --> 00:42:10,836
But we was only playing with her.
We never meant her to slit her wrists.

665
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,580
- She hung herself.
- Whatever. She's dead.

666
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:18,586
- Because of you.
- What?

667
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:20,541
She killed herself because you
and your friends bullied her...

668
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,034
till she couldn't take it
no more.

669
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:24,316
- You killed her.
- Shut up, you sket.

670
00:42:24,317 --> 00:42:25,625
- You killed her.
- Fucking shut up.

671
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:26,748
You killed her.

672
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:29,394
Listen, right, if you don't fucking
shut up, you're gonna join her.

673
00:42:29,628 --> 00:42:32,082
Look she don't mean it, yeah. Please,
don't beat us up. She's pregnant.

674
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:35,697
You're that girl
that Sam fucked.

675
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:38,418
Wait till I tell everyone
about this ho.

676
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:39,802
You know what?
Yeah, tell them.

677
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:42,552
Tell them Alisa's pregnant
and she's keeping the fucking baby.

678
00:42:42,906 --> 00:42:45,239
- What?
- I ain't scared of you.

679
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,732
If you're gonna do something
to me, then do it.

680
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,120
Go on.

681
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:54,957
I got bigger things to worry about
than what you can do to me.

682
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:09,490
What's the matter?

683
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,743
- You should bang her up, star.
- I should, shouldn't I?

684
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,443
What the fuck were you thinking,
Alisa? They could have beat us up.

685
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:21,162
- So?
- You're so selfish.

686
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:23,785
What if my face got scarred
or something?

687
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:25,875
And what the fuck are you talking about
"keeping the baby"?

688
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,899
You're not gonna have
an abortion now?

689
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,965
- Just leave it, Becky.
- So, what, are you like pro-life now?

690
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,301
No, but a girl we both
knew just died...

691
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:34,320
and I didn't do anything
to stop it.

692
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:37,265
- But I can do something about this.
- So, okay...

693
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,537
what about school?

694
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,657
What if you'd have got raped?
Would you have an abortion then?

695
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:43,085
- I don't know. Yeah, probably.
- You have to get rid of it.

696
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:45,801
- Who's gonna help you?
- I don't need any help.

697
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:51,273
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's morning sickness.

698
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:55,436
- It's not morning though.
- Look, I need to speak to Trife.

699
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:59,176
Let's go and buy our garms.
And then we'll find him, okay? Come on.

700
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,339
Curtis lives up there.

701
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:12,361
- What, is that it?
- I think so.

702
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,884
You think so?

703
00:44:16,204 --> 00:44:17,927
You think...
you think so?

704
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:22,528
Do you think I've got time
for what people think now, Del?

705
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:24,933
- Is this the place, bro?
- Yes, it's the place.

706
00:44:25,547 --> 00:44:27,815
But you gotta do this
on your own, bruv.

707
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:29,929
I'll wait for you back at mine.

708
00:44:30,186 --> 00:44:33,284
- You're gonna go now, is it?
- I can't be seen here, man.

709
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:41,277
What would you do, man?

710
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,974
What would you do, man?

711
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:00,994
- That was a forty five pound hat, bloods.
- So?

712
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,258
You could've give it to me
for tonight, like.

713
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:06,077
Blood, it wouldn't have fit
your big African head anyway, man.

714
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,160
Oh my days!

715
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:11,523
You man, you man, you man,
check that gash over there, blood.

716
00:45:11,524 --> 00:45:14,589
- Shit, check the back of, rude boy.
- She's bathing as well, you know.

717
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,506
See, that's what I want, blood.
I want a rich bitch like that.

718
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:19,608
Yeah, so, so what, who's on it?
Me, yeah?

719
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:21,820
No, blood, that's me, man.
I saw her first, isn't it?

720
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,318
My size.

721
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:25,720
My size.
Hey, darling, I'm...

722
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,663
Hey, girl,
I'm talking to you, man.

723
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,846
I'm chatting to you!

724
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:34,710
I don't think she's on it.

725
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:37,816
Blood, can't chat to a girl
like that, man.

726
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:39,608
You think you're nang, blood? Why
don't you show him how to do it, then?

727
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,332
Fuck it.
Let's duck, man.

728
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:44,826
He don't wanna check for that
because he's still on Alisa, isn't it?

729
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:48,572
Man, I'll show you now
I can chat to that girl, man.

730
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,451
Go on then.

731
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:56,786
- Why is he always on our hype, man?
- He thinks he's big, man.

732
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:59,827
- Hey, can I help you?
- Do you work here?

733
00:46:00,028 --> 00:46:01,937
No, sorry,
just making conversation.

734
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:04,882
I wouldn't buy
these trainers, though.

735
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:07,828
- Seriously, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

736
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:09,658
Well, the front always comes off.

737
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:11,927
Plus, those are the old ones.
New ones are upstairs.

738
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:15,797
Trevor.

739
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,158
Stella.

740
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:27,860
- Want a zoot, blood?
- Yeah. Come, we get out of here, man.

741
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:30,328
You know I could have got
the number though, isn't it?

742
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:32,182
- So could I, blood.
- I don't think so, blood.

743
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:35,437
You look smart...
What do you do?

744
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:39,053
Smart. That's a new one.
What... like smartly dressed?

745
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:41,904
- No, clever, intelligent.
- Thank you.

746
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:45,232
I'm an architect.

747
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,148
Rings? You married?

748
00:46:49,493 --> 00:46:50,899
Yeah, my...

749
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,329
husband's been away
a while.

750
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:56,106
If I was your husband,
I'd never leave you.

751
00:46:56,308 --> 00:46:58,314
And I don't need Viagra,
you know.

752
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,627
Thank you...

753
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:02,025
that's useful to know.

754
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:05,385
Don't you get lonely
by yourself?

755
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:07,755
Yeah.

756
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:10,191
Yeah. I do.

757
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:14,473
Actually, sometimes I could use
a bit of company.

758
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:17,071
- I'd keep you company.
- I bet you would.

759
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:23,789
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

760
00:47:24,336 --> 00:47:25,829
Twenty-six. You?

761
00:47:26,063 --> 00:47:28,844
- I'm twenty-three.
- You're not twenty-three.

762
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:31,142
All right, I'm twenty-two,
but I'm mature, man.

763
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:33,895
- Twenty-two? Really?
- All right, I'm twenty, I swear.

764
00:47:35,182 --> 00:47:37,261
It's not like I'm trying it on
or anything.

765
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:38,505
Good.

766
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,471
Because I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

767
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,363
My girl puts onion in my burger.

768
00:47:56,363 --> 00:47:57,834
But, blood, man, you shouldn't have
thrown it, though, isn't it?

769
00:47:57,835 --> 00:47:59,049
She didn't do what I asked.

770
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,298
You should have gave
the burger to me, blood, man.

771
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:04,127
- Man, I don't like onions.
- Hey, what happened, man?

772
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:06,979
She's a cock tease, man. She's on it,
and then she ducked, isn't it?

773
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:09,697
That's a bit weird. White girls
usually fuck you for a browns.

774
00:48:09,897 --> 00:48:11,879
- I knew you wouldn't get that, rude boy.
- Standard.

775
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,076
Shut up, man. I'm still gonna bang
that when I go see her.

776
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:17,191
How are you gonna bang her, blood
and go see her when she kicked out.

777
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:19,207
Are you stupid or something?

778
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:20,254
No.

779
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:22,079
I got this,
and I'm gonna bring it to her.

780
00:48:22,311 --> 00:48:23,110
Hey, blood, hold him,
hold him, hold him.

781
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,030
Jay, I beg you, pass it back, man.
Hey, Moons, Moons, Moons. Hey, Jay.

782
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:27,965
Blood, she got plenty dollars in here,
you know. And she's a...

783
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:32,867
Boy! What the fuck are you doing, man?
Where are you going?

784
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:34,725
- Leave it. Leave it out, he's a youth.
- Or what, coz?

785
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:37,244
Or else I'll bust you in your head
you fucking white pussyhole!

786
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:38,909
What? Blood, you think because
I'm white, I won't knock you out?

787
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:40,449
Is that right, blood?
Yo, let me take my hat off.

788
00:48:40,676 --> 00:48:41,984
How about white boy,
skinhead nutter, mate?

789
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:43,902
Does that work better for you,
dickhead?

790
00:48:46,595 --> 00:48:47,772
Oi.

791
00:48:53,218 --> 00:48:55,192
- Shit.
- That's really good though, cousin.

792
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,871
What, man,
you think that scares me?

793
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:01,909
Man, you don't even know me.

794
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:04,954
Low it low it, come on, come on.

795
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:07,322
Just get out of here, man.
You men got murked, like.

796
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:14,461
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- What are you talking about?

797
00:49:14,655 --> 00:49:17,174
You! Starting fights
in the middle of the street, man.

798
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:18,302
I was backing you up, blood.

799
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:19,764
That's not what
I'm talking about, blood.

800
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:21,722
If we plan something together,
that's cool.

801
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,421
But that was under control
until you started, man.

802
00:49:23,422 --> 00:49:25,118
You can't just start arms house
in the middle of the street.

803
00:49:25,118 --> 00:49:27,037
- What's wrong with you, blood?
- Just cool it, Jay, man.

804
00:49:27,038 --> 00:49:28,957
All right, man.
So where's the purse?

805
00:49:28,957 --> 00:49:31,509
Wait, blood. I told you, yeah,
I want the fucking cards, isn't it.

806
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,179
No, man, who fucking took it?
Give me the purse!

807
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,292
Blood, man, you want,
you want the cards, yeah?

808
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:35,735
- Yes, I want the fucking cards.
- You want the cards.

809
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,458
- Hey, Moons. Moons.
- Hey, blood, don't fuck about.

810
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,349
So what, you can share
your girl with Sam...

811
00:49:39,516 --> 00:49:40,540
and you can't even share
the purse with us, blood.

812
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,100
You fucking prick.

813
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,242
- Get the fuck off me!
- Fuck is wrong with you, blood?

814
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,863
We're gonna split that or not?
All right, that's what it's got to?

815
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:50,447
You know what, take your fucking
purse, you like it so much.

816
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:51,891
You're a dickhead, man.

817
00:49:51,994 --> 00:49:53,717
Hey, blood,
don't take it out on us...

818
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:55,863
because your girl
got pressed by next man.

819
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:57,880
If you was somebody else, I would have
stabbed your claret, rude boy!

820
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:00,400
Stab me then, blood!
My uncle'll kill you!

821
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,217
You and your fucking uncle, man!
If my man's even real.

822
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:05,836
You know what, blood, if he is real,
yeah, you better go to him, isn't it?

823
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:08,496
Because, blood, you ain't got no-one
no more, man. You ain't got Alisa.

824
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:10,221
You ain't got that sket no more.

825
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:13,105
And we ain't backing you no more.
Come, Moons, man.

826
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:17,262
Hey, who the fuck you chatting to, man?
Without me, you two ain't shit!

827
00:50:17,462 --> 00:50:19,283
And Alisa, I can have her if I want,
but I don't need her.

828
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:21,205
I don't need pussyhole friends
like you, either.

829
00:50:21,206 --> 00:50:22,961
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that, blood.

830
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:26,676
Remember, we might call you Trife
but your name's Trevor.

831
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:28,944
- Remember that, blood.
- Come, we jet, blood.

832
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,905
Claire, honey,
Sam's here to see you.

833
00:51:03,439 --> 00:51:05,162
Thanks, Mrs. Parkinson.

834
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:07,428
I'll leave you kids to it.

835
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:14,444
- Where are they?
- Who?

836
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:17,957
Don't try to boy me off,
them three little pussyholes.

837
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:19,301
I don't know.

838
00:51:20,332 --> 00:51:22,436
I'm only gonna ask you this
one more time.

839
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:24,424
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

840
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:25,796
Jeez.

841
00:51:27,755 --> 00:51:29,738
Listen, yeah.
My mum nearly broke her arm.

842
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:32,007
You better start talking,
or I'm gonna bang you up, you hear me?

843
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,584
When we get to school, I'm gonna tell
everyone what a rubbish fuck you are.

844
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:38,567
And how bad you smell.
If you know what I'm saying.

845
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:41,313
Please, don't, I really don't know
where they are.

846
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:44,545
All I know is that they're going to
that party tonight.

847
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,492
That's where they're gonna be.

848
00:51:49,032 --> 00:51:50,941
So why weren't I invited?

849
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:53,697
Because no-one
that's going likes you.

850
00:51:56,743 --> 00:51:59,393
Sam, stop, please.
I'm sorry.

851
00:52:00,294 --> 00:52:00,959
Claire?

852
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:03,141
Claire, baby, are you all right?

853
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:06,274
Yeah, mum, I'm fine.

854
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:09,657
Me and Sam are just talking.

855
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:10,460
Okay.

856
00:52:11,205 --> 00:52:13,059
Use a condom,
sweetheart.

857
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:16,196
That brings me
to my next question.

858
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:18,625
Whose girl are you?

859
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:20,800
Because I don't even know
why I bother with you.

860
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:24,706
You're ugly, you're a shit fuck, and
you're with me, like sixth-form top boy.

861
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:27,576
If it weren't for me,
who would even look at you?

862
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:28,987
I don't know.

863
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:33,314
- Why did you sleep with Alisa?
- Why'd you fuck that fucking Jay?

864
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:35,223
In my drum as well!

865
00:52:35,617 --> 00:52:37,274
I don't know. I'm sorry.

866
00:52:38,272 --> 00:52:39,765
It's all right, it's all right.

867
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:44,476
It's just... I do everything you want,
whenever you want me to.

868
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:48,019
So why are you mean to me
and all that? I don't understand.

869
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:52,219
Come here.

870
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,868
Okay, so Plaza, yeah?
In an hour.

871
00:53:27,097 --> 00:53:29,169
- All right, then. Bye.
- Right, see you then. Bye.

872
00:53:34,936 --> 00:53:36,397
Come fuck on, man.

873
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:42,193
Look, what you need is
some retail therapy, yeah?

874
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:45,269
Alisa says to meet her in the cafe thing
downstairs in one hour.

875
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,414
What, did you tell her
that Trife ain't here?

876
00:53:47,415 --> 00:53:48,363
No.

877
00:53:48,598 --> 00:53:49,622
Are you a fool or something,
blood?

878
00:53:49,622 --> 00:53:51,797
You don't think she really wants
to chat to you, do you?

879
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:52,812
I don't know.

880
00:53:53,014 --> 00:53:55,829
You know, fuck it isn't it, I'll tell her,
I'll give her a piece of my mind, man.

881
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:56,756
You get me?

882
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:04,169
Oh my God, that dress looks dark
on you. Is that the one you want?

883
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:05,713
Yeah, I think so.

884
00:54:05,908 --> 00:54:07,849
Well, I got all these.
I can't make my mind up.

885
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:09,458
We are gonna be the hottest girls
there tonight.

886
00:54:09,555 --> 00:54:11,561
Everyone else is gonna look like
tramps compared to us.

887
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:14,514
Hi, madam, can I help?
Is that the dress you like?

888
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:15,855
- Yeah.
- It looks great on you.

889
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:18,578
Well, if you pull your
hair back like this...

890
00:54:18,578 --> 00:54:20,682
it will accentuate
your fabulous figure.

891
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,765
- Thank you.
- Nice figure?

892
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:24,560
Not for long.
She's knocked up.

893
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,079
Congratulations.
My wife is pregnant.

894
00:54:27,504 --> 00:54:30,318
- Wife? I thought you were a batty man.
- Excuse me?

895
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,200
- Ain't you gay?
- No.

896
00:54:32,432 --> 00:54:34,536
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- I know, I'm just saying.

897
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,741
- All right, calm down, Yankee.
- I'm Canadian.

898
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:39,113
- Same thing.
- Excuse me, how much is this one?

899
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,737
This one is a hundred
and thirty pounds.

900
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,358
Becks?

901
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:54,373
Well, I want this one.
How much is it?

902
00:54:58,732 --> 00:55:00,836
This one is two hundred
and ten pounds.

903
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,769
Lis, can you not find another one?
I really want this one.

904
00:55:04,939 --> 00:55:07,272
- We've got three hundred between us.
- Yeah, and you said you'd split it.

905
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:09,091
Look, who got the money?

906
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,006
I'm doing you a favour
in the first place by getting you one.

907
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:14,024
Come on, soon you'll have
a big fat belly anyway.

908
00:55:14,025 --> 00:55:15,453
You won't be able to wear it.

909
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:18,470
You've still got ninety quid.
I'm sure you can get something nice.

910
00:55:18,664 --> 00:55:19,560
Don't worry, honey.

911
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:22,048
I'll find you something to make
you look even more fabulous.

912
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,212
- Trevor?
- Yeah.

913
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,256
He'll be with you in a sec.

914
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,036
You're a handsome one,
aren't you?

915
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:00,113
Trevor.

916
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,766
- What happen?
- You told me to reach.

917
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:06,357
Debbie look after you?

918
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:08,143
Yeah.

919
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:14,543
Come.

920
00:57:15,447 --> 00:57:18,129
Me like the work you did
on that thing.

921
00:57:20,918 --> 00:57:21,932
This...

922
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,627
is for you.

923
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:29,683
See, I told you I would, man.

924
00:57:29,877 --> 00:57:31,028
If you want me to do
anything else, I'm...

925
00:57:31,028 --> 00:57:33,002
Just cool yourself, man.

926
00:57:41,363 --> 00:57:42,824
What's that?

927
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:45,136
Heroin.

928
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:49,323
- You want some?
- I'm cool, man.

929
00:57:50,418 --> 00:57:51,530
Go on...

930
00:57:53,394 --> 00:57:54,670
take some.

931
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:09,160
You grow fast, man.

932
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:11,946
Anyway...

933
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:15,146
me like the work
you did on the gun.

934
00:58:15,214 --> 00:58:17,701
- It's easy, I can...
- Don't speak, just listen.

935
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:23,234
You know...

936
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:27,051
all you need in this world
is money...

937
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:31,103
and if you know how to get it,
you laughing.

938
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:34,665
- You seen that nice TV in my front room?
- Yeah.

939
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:38,436
You got one? No? But you'd like one,
of course you would.

940
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:41,247
Curtis, I've got Keith
on the phone. He wants you to...

941
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:43,620
Tell him that I talk to my nephew.
Tell him wait.

942
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,086
But he's already on the phone.
He says he's...

943
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:48,552
Me said tell him wait.

944
00:58:57,224 --> 00:58:58,172
Anyway...

945
00:59:01,063 --> 00:59:05,470
why you don't come work for,
with me?

946
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:09,602
Trust me, I want to, man.
Fucking had enough of everything else.

947
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:14,500
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Just a few little things.

948
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:16,634
That sounds like something
you can do?

949
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,617
Sounds live, man.
I'm there.

950
00:59:19,812 --> 00:59:21,502
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

951
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:24,448
Me did sell the last
of the bad guns to some youth.

952
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,481
Me have more of the replicas
for you to drill in the back.

953
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:29,057
In the meantime...

954
00:59:31,555 --> 00:59:35,351
you did so well with this one
that me think you should have it.

955
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,671
- So where is he?
- I told you.

956
01:00:00,191 --> 01:00:03,005
When he switched, yeah,
we just kicked out and left him, man.

957
01:00:03,262 --> 01:00:05,530
And don't bother trying to call him,
because his phone's off.

958
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:07,001
Look, I really need
to speak to him.

959
01:00:07,197 --> 01:00:08,571
Listen up, everybody.

960
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:10,901
Me say listen up.

961
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:15,313
This is my nephew Trevor.

962
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:19,536
Real family member that will be joining
our family from now on...

963
01:00:19,707 --> 01:00:22,456
so, treat him nice.

964
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:23,957
What going on, bro?

965
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:30,261
What's up with this baby shit, man?
Is this true or something?

966
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,431
Of course it's true.
Who's gonna lie about being pregnant?

967
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:34,967
- Nuff people, man.
- Well, I'm not lying.

968
01:00:35,162 --> 01:00:36,313
All you do is lie.

969
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:38,456
And now you've been caught out, you're
trying to drag Trife back into this.

970
01:00:38,456 --> 01:00:39,884
Try and fuck up his life,
isn't it?

971
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:41,811
Look, I think I should be speaking
to him about this, not you.

972
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:43,469
You are talking to me.

973
01:00:43,672 --> 01:00:45,362
And what exactly
are you gonna say to him?

974
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:48,113
"I'm sorry, Trife I fucked another guy
while I was with you."

975
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:49,974
Because it don't matter
because he knows now.

976
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:51,381
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

977
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:55,347
Listen, Trevor.

978
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:59,374
Come, I want you to handle
something for me.

979
01:01:05,141 --> 01:01:06,766
You're bad, isn't it?

980
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,713
You behave yourselves, yeah?

981
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:20,167
Anything?

982
01:01:20,818 --> 01:01:24,614
You see, this is the reason
me want you to come work for me.

983
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,864
- Curtis.
- Shut up!

984
01:01:27,377 --> 01:01:29,198
You see this fucker?

985
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:32,142
Him take my property,
but my money never come back.

986
01:01:35,088 --> 01:01:37,389
Where the fuck is my money,
nigger?

987
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,468
I can get it for you, man.

988
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:43,214
It's at my place. I told you
I was gonna bring it round later today.

989
01:01:43,214 --> 01:01:44,620
Hey, shut your mouth, blood.

990
01:01:44,847 --> 01:01:47,148
If he wanted it when you decided to
bring it and not when he asked for it...

991
01:01:47,343 --> 01:01:50,059
you wouldn't be tied
to a fucking table, would you?

992
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:56,995
What are you waiting for?

993
01:02:01,037 --> 01:02:03,589
I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry.

994
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:05,162
You know what, boy?

995
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:07,752
I want you
to get my money today.

996
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,223
- I will.
- But before you go...

997
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:12,930
I'm gonna make sure you remember
that you don't fuck with Curtis.

998
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,584
Trevor...

999
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:26,141
I want you to carve a C from the corner
of him eye to the corner of him mouth.

1000
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:30,438
- Me?
- Yes...

1001
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:31,840
you.

1002
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:42,685
I want you
to carve a blood clotline...

1003
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,757
from here to here.

1004
01:02:48,261 --> 01:02:50,267
Carve the fucking line.

1005
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:59,097
No, let him.

1006
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,081
Cut him.

1007
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:02,647
Man.

1008
01:03:03,107 --> 01:03:05,113
Man, please!

1009
01:03:05,474 --> 01:03:06,586
Please!

1010
01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:10,681
No.

1011
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:18,749
No!

1012
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,258
Good.

1013
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:48,698
Trevor... come.

1014
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,517
Come here.

1015
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:52,177
Trevor!

1016
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,149
Please.

1017
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:24,214
The best thing you
could do right now is fuck off...

1018
01:04:24,214 --> 01:04:26,035
and get an abortion of Sam's baby.

1019
01:04:26,198 --> 01:04:28,434
Because he don't want you,
and Trife don't want you either.

1020
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:30,285
What, has he said that?

1021
01:04:30,485 --> 01:04:33,484
- Who wants a sket like you?
- Has he told you he don't want me.

1022
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,921
Yeah.
Now fuck off, isn't it.

1023
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,408
What's up with your girlfriend,
though? Fucking Sam.

1024
01:04:43,572 --> 01:04:45,993
No wonder Trife dashed her, man,
she's a fucking ho like.

1025
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:48,203
I know.
I couldn't be like that.

1026
01:04:48,403 --> 01:04:50,606
Only give my things
to special mans like you.

1027
01:04:50,835 --> 01:04:52,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1028
01:04:52,466 --> 01:04:53,643
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1029
01:04:53,842 --> 01:04:55,434
Becks, can we go?

1030
01:04:55,954 --> 01:04:58,855
- Where, to the party?
- No, I just wanna go home.

1031
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:01,004
Well, I'm not ready.

1032
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:04,711
- Becky, please, can we just go?
- Look, go if you wanna go.

1033
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:08,326
Don't come to the party tonight, be a
boring cow. I'm staying with this lot.

1034
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:13,864
You know what,
just do what you want, yeah?

1035
01:05:17,422 --> 01:05:18,436
Fat cunt.

1036
01:06:58,111 --> 01:06:59,671
I fucked that girl
a few weeks ago, blood.

1037
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:02,485
Every day for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

1038
01:07:02,687 --> 01:07:03,668
Why aren't you speaking to me?

1039
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:25,713
So this party, where is it?

1040
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,107
You're not still gonna go,
are you?

1041
01:08:28,786 --> 01:08:31,785
You saw what they done to my mum.
Where is it?

1042
01:08:34,353 --> 01:08:35,846
Nice invite.

1043
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:38,251
- I don't think you should go.
- Why not?

1044
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,959
I just think this thing with them lot
should stop or someone's gonna get hurt.

1045
01:08:42,192 --> 01:08:44,460
Your mum's all right
and you got me.

1046
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:47,272
Stay here tonight,
we can fuck all night.

1047
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,480
Promise me you'll stay.

1048
01:08:52,846 --> 01:08:54,406
All right, I promise.

1049
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:57,355
I just wanna go home and check on
my mum, make sure she's all right.

1050
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:01,864
- Cool. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

1051
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:09,665
Alisa!

1052
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,394
Alisa!

1053
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:13,544
Wait. Alisa!

1054
01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:20,262
- What you doing?
- I'm going home. I only live over there.

1055
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:23,272
- Your hand's bleeding, are you okay?
- Oh, shit.

1056
01:09:23,466 --> 01:09:24,643
Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:30,367
- Have you been crying?
- No.

1058
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:33,597
You look like you have.

1059
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,287
Are you coming to Blake's party?

1060
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:39,038
Oh, no, I'm really n
in the mood.

1061
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,698
Come on, come with us.

1062
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:43,168
I don't know.

1063
01:09:43,398 --> 01:09:45,733
You look like you need to be around
some friends to cheer yourself up.

1064
01:09:45,734 --> 01:09:46,627
Yeah.

1065
01:09:46,823 --> 01:09:50,270
I promise I'll do anything I can
to get you smiling again.

1066
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:52,091
And how are you gonna do that?

1067
01:09:57,284 --> 01:09:58,690
Come on, come with me.

1068
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:02,211
Okay. Let me just go home
and get changed, yeah?

1069
01:10:02,212 --> 01:10:04,961
But I'm only gonna come, like,
if I can hang out with you.

1070
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:26,588
Hi, this is Alisa.
Please, leave...

1071
01:10:56,636 --> 01:11:00,497
Trife... enter, my friend.
While the parents are away and what not.

1072
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:03,188
Want some of this?
It's Cuban.

1073
01:11:06,747 --> 01:11:07,957
Where's Alisa?

1074
01:11:08,314 --> 01:11:10,768
She's inside.
I think she went into the garden.

1075
01:12:02,834 --> 01:12:03,881
Bruv...

1076
01:12:04,722 --> 01:12:06,215
blood, sorry, man.

1077
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,660
I'll see you later.

1078
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:09,230
Sorry, bruv.

1079
01:12:11,345 --> 01:12:13,832
- What you doing?
- So, what, he's your man now?

1080
01:12:14,033 --> 01:12:16,999
No, but at least he's been nice to me
today. Look, what do you want?

1081
01:12:18,128 --> 01:12:19,720
I wanted to say hello, isn't it.

1082
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:22,058
- Hello.
- How you doing?

1083
01:12:22,575 --> 01:12:24,622
If you wanna say something to me,
then say it and leave me alone.

1084
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:26,891
- Hey, what happened to your hand?
- I got it cut.

1085
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,877
- Are you all right?
- It's fine.

1086
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:31,336
No, are you all right?

1087
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:37,540
- So what do you do today?
- Nothing that would interest you.

1088
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:42,954
Look, Lis, can we go somewhere
a bit more private, please?

1089
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:05,416
So, what, where is he, then?

1090
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:07,303
I don't know, I just saw him
come out here.

1091
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:08,967
I'm going back in, man. This is...

1092
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,072
I don't know why
I come to your party, man.

1093
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:17,856
- So what time you staying till?
- Cool, baby, we just got here, like.

1094
01:13:18,087 --> 01:13:21,053
True, it'll probably
get better later.

1095
01:13:21,254 --> 01:13:22,886
Would be better
if Blake weren't such a chief.

1096
01:13:22,886 --> 01:13:23,998
Look at him trying
to friends up Jay.

1097
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:27,675
I mean... I'd consider this
a success, wouldn't you?

1098
01:13:30,053 --> 01:13:32,092
Jay, did I mention
how sharp you look.

1099
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:35,193
Go away, Blake.

1100
01:13:39,747 --> 01:13:42,528
I know you tried to speak to me earlier
and I didn't want to listen...

1101
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:45,400
but I wanna talk to you now.

1102
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:49,049
Look, don't worry about your little
life, Trevor, I don't need your help.

1103
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:52,438
And I'm sorry you had to hear
what you heard from Sam...

1104
01:13:52,642 --> 01:13:53,852
and I understand
that you don't want me...

1105
01:13:53,921 --> 01:13:55,775
but I thought you ought to know
that I never slept with...

1106
01:13:55,969 --> 01:14:00,278
All right. I know you never meant
to hurt me and blah, blah...

1107
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:02,432
but before you carry on there's some
things I need to get off my head...

1108
01:14:02,432 --> 01:14:04,127
and if I don't,
I'm just gonna forget.

1109
01:14:04,127 --> 01:14:05,719
- Look, Trevor, you don't...
- Wait...

1110
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,700
I'm on that, boy.

1111
01:14:12,222 --> 01:14:14,610
Excuse me, you came with me.

1112
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:17,944
No, there's a difference.
You came with me.

1113
01:14:18,973 --> 01:14:21,143
But don't worry, though,
babes, like...

1114
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:23,067
there's enough Moonies
to go around, isn't it, like.

1115
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:24,472
So safe, yeah?

1116
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:26,680
Yeah, Danielle,
what's going on then, man?

1117
01:14:26,908 --> 01:14:28,696
I see you at school the other day.
I wanted to come and talk to you...

1118
01:14:28,892 --> 01:14:30,418
but you're always with
your friends, man.

1119
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:32,529
- You can still come up to me.
- No, but I don't like...

1120
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:34,039
Please.

1121
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:37,877
Danielle, I'm gonna come
chat to you in a sec, yeah?

1122
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,176
So, with both your little buddies
doing there own thing...

1123
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,104
is there anything
that you wanna do?

1124
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,668
Like what?

1125
01:14:43,802 --> 01:14:45,110
Like me.

1126
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,449
What?

1127
01:14:46,777 --> 01:14:48,718
Do you want to fuck me?

1128
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,501
No, not really, I got a girl.

1129
01:14:51,672 --> 01:14:53,297
So? I won't tell her.

1130
01:14:53,752 --> 01:14:55,060
I thought you liked Moony?

1131
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,166
No, I like you.

1132
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:59,183
He's a bit of a fool.

1133
01:14:59,384 --> 01:15:00,660
That's one of my best friends
you're talking about down there.

1134
01:15:00,727 --> 01:15:02,581
Look, do you wanna fuck or not?

1135
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:08,465
You can put it in my arse as well.
It hurts, but I don't mind.

1136
01:15:09,014 --> 01:15:11,380
No, low it, man.
Hey, Danielle.

1137
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:18,253
What I wanted to say is this.

1138
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,943
I know we were only going out
for a couple of months...

1139
01:15:21,972 --> 01:15:26,194
but it was fun, dred. You made me feel
like feel good, you get me?

1140
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:30,220
I mean, not just sex. I mean, your
things feel good and everything, but...

1141
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:33,069
you.

1142
01:15:35,026 --> 01:15:36,073
It was you.

1143
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:40,267
But I didn't know what to do when you
started wanting hugs and that in school.

1144
01:15:40,465 --> 01:15:43,693
I started thinking about what the boys
would think and them stupidness there.

1145
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:47,753
When I broke up with you,
I realised I was stupid.

1146
01:15:48,528 --> 01:15:50,949
I told everyone, "I ain't going back
out with her", but...

1147
01:15:51,856 --> 01:15:53,164
I wanted to.

1148
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:59,149
When I found out you fucked Sam,
it hurt me.

1149
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:00,971
- Look, Trevor...
- Wait.

1150
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:05,196
That hurt me.

1151
01:16:06,477 --> 01:16:08,451
That's why I said
what I said today.

1152
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:11,910
I've seen some shit today...

1153
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:16,101
makes me think about life.

1154
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,296
You're one of the best things
in mine.

1155
01:16:22,827 --> 01:16:25,281
So even though
it's some next man's baby...

1156
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,802
I wanna be with you.

1157
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:31,871
And I wanna look after
you both.

1158
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,862
I wanna change for you.

1159
01:16:35,945 --> 01:16:37,155
Because...

1160
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:43,811
I love you.

1161
01:16:46,823 --> 01:16:48,838
Why you laughing?
I said I love you.

1162
01:16:48,839 --> 01:16:51,871
- Trevor, I never slept with Sam.
- What?

1163
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,535
I've been trying to tell you.

1164
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:56,613
He lied. He told everyone
I went to his house.

1165
01:16:56,614 --> 01:16:57,573
He said I might as well go...

1166
01:16:57,574 --> 01:16:59,231
because he was gonna
tell everyone he fucked me, but...

1167
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:02,140
I never, I swear.

1168
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,226
So, the baby...

1169
01:17:05,028 --> 01:17:08,027
You're the only one I've slept with.
It's yours.

1170
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:12,222
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

1171
01:17:13,283 --> 01:17:16,315
- My mum's gonna kill me, man.
- Mine too.

1172
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:36,124
Listen, listen, we're gonna work, yeah?
We'll stay together forever.

1173
01:17:37,311 --> 01:17:38,871
I'm not sure we will...

1174
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,362
but we're gonna have this baby,
so, we should try.

1175
01:17:45,598 --> 01:17:47,321
Yeah, pussyhole, what now?

1176
01:17:47,518 --> 01:17:49,110
- You think you're a man? Get up.
- Sam don't!

1177
01:17:49,342 --> 01:17:52,091
No... you think you're bad?
You wanna act like a big man?

1178
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:54,907
I'm gonna beat you
like a fucking big man!

1179
01:17:55,165 --> 01:17:59,255
Where's your two boys? Because you
three pussyholes are finished tonight!

1180
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,195
We can work something out,
I swear to you.

1181
01:18:03,196 --> 01:18:04,220
Fuck...

1182
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,318
- Sam, man, fucking hell, what you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

1183
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:19,922
Moony! Jay, look, Sam's beating up
Trife outside, right now!

1184
01:18:22,009 --> 01:18:25,432
- So, what, are you gonna back us or what?
- No, he's your mate, blood.

1185
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:26,196
You pussy!

1186
01:18:26,488 --> 01:18:27,981
You must have lost
your fucking mind fucking with me.

1187
01:18:28,216 --> 01:18:29,906
We can work something, I swear to you.
Hey, Jay, don't, man.

1188
01:18:29,976 --> 01:18:31,830
Hey, blood,
get the fuck off him, man.

1189
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:37,940
I'm sorry.

1190
01:18:38,775 --> 01:18:40,498
Come on then... Come, come.

1191
01:18:40,726 --> 01:18:41,969
Hey, low it, man, low it.

1192
01:18:44,182 --> 01:18:45,675
Yeah, you are.

1193
01:18:49,685 --> 01:18:52,913
You wanna disrespect my mum?
You wanna fuck my girl?

1194
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:02,954
You're not fucking real,
blood, you hear me?

1195
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:05,323
Stay down!

1196
01:19:05,555 --> 01:19:06,983
All you fucking pussyholes, yeah.

1197
01:19:07,058 --> 01:19:08,912
Any of you fuck with me, this is what
you get, you understand, blood?

1198
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:11,047
Just leave us alone, Sam.

1199
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,233
Everyone knows
you never fucked me.

1200
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,463
What are you gonna do,
beat us all up?

1201
01:19:15,697 --> 01:19:17,104
Who'd wanna fuck you anyway?
Look at you.

1202
01:19:17,105 --> 01:19:19,373
- Shut up.
- Suck my dick, you fucking bitch.

1203

Sam says he's gonna fucking kill me,

1237
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,258
I'm not even... fuck...

Anything's better than here.

Give me one fucking good reason why
I shouldn't fucking blow your head off.

You give me one.
Why you shouldn't die.

Give me one fucking reason

Because he's not worth it.
