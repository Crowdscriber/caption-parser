00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:06,312
<i>Previously on</i> Hannibal...

2
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:08,160
I'm giving my life to death.

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,960
And now Death has followed you home.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,822
I don't think I wanna do chemotherapy.

5
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,775
- Do I have any say in this?
- No.

6
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:17,113
I'm devoting a lot of time to this
mural, Will. I could use your help.

7
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,191
What was the cause of death
in the bailiff's murder? - Bullets.

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,945
- And in Will Graham's victims?
- Mutilation.

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,185
There are clearly two different killers
and two different cases.

10
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:27,854
Will claims someone else committed
the crimes he's accused of.

11
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:30,845
- He said that person was you.
- Perhaps he was half right.

13
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,035
Wrap the leader

14
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:45,739
around the tippet. Four,

15
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:49,209
five, six times.

16
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,995
Tuck the end

17
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:53,997
between the lines.

18
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,882
Tighten.

19
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:58,502
And... trim.

20
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:01,555
It's called a blood knot.

21
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,094
Your father taught you
how to hunt.

22
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:09,763
I'm going to
teach you how to fish.

23
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,465
Same thing, isn't it?

24
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,519
One you stalk,
the other you re?

25
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,521
One you catch,

26
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:19,856
the other you shoot.

27
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:23,143
What are you trying to catch?

28
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,064
The one who caught you.

29
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,866
The one that got away.

30
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:31,868
Catch a fish once

31
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,988
and it gets away, it's
a lot harder to catch again.

32
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,294
(chuckling)

33
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:47,884
Everybody thinks you're lying
about the one that got away.

34
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:50,336
That's why I have to catch him.

35
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:58,729
Last thing before
casting a line:

36
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,114
name the bait on your hook

37
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,349
after somebody you cherished.

38
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,986
To say goodbye?

39
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,988
If the person you name it
after cherished you,

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,374
as the superstition goes,
you will catch the fish.

41
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:13,710
Oh.

42
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:15,796
And what did you name it?

43
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:20,183
Abigail.

44
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,823
(creaking sound)

45
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:48,445
You were right.
Killer was in the mural.

46
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:52,365
Just where you said he'd be.
His name was James Gray.

47
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,367
We found his vehicle
outside the farm.

48
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:56,353
Enough DNA on the bed of his
truck for us to be confident

49
00:02:56,355 --> 00:03:00,340
he's the Muralist. - You found as much
evidence on him as you did on me.

50
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:03,376
I'm glad you said it.

51
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,679
Who stitched him
into the mural?

52
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,449
We don't know.
He may have had a partner.

53
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,318
Another killer. Maybe
they had a suicide pact.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,854
There was no partner.

55
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:17,691
This artist worked alone until he
was stitched into his own creation.

56
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:20,527
- No signs of a struggle.
- No.

57
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:23,530
So, this second killer,
whoever he is,

58
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,066
understood the Muralist
well enough

59
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:29,202
not just to find his canvas,
but well enough to convince him

60
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,571
- to be part of it.
- You have an idea who that might be?

61
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:35,158
- I do.
- Don't say, "Hannibal Lecter."

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,879
- I'm saying Hannibal Lecter.
- Didn't you stop ringing that bell?

63
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:42,549
I'm not asking you to believe anything you
can't prove. I'm just asking you to prove it.

64
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,253
- Hannibal Lecter has no reason-
- That is exactly right.

65
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,454
He has no discernible reason
other than

66
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:50,590
his own amusement and curiosity.

67
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:53,460
That's hard to prove.

68
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:55,762
There will be
a very clever detail

69
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,764
to find on James Gray.

70
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,684
He wouldn't be able
to resist it. Probably something

71
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:04,371
that was overlooked.
Something hidden.

72
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:09,442
I'll look for clever details.

73
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:11,928
But I'm not looking
for Hannibal.

74
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,781
Just as long as you're looking.

75
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,287
You look out there.

76
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,322
I'll look in here.

77
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,994
(bee buzzing)

78
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,768
(buzzing)

80
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:31,799
I'll give you the same deal
I gave Beverly Katz.

81
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,283
I know you know what it is.

82
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,622
You've been recording
our conversations.

83
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:41,244
Or are we pretending
you didn't?

84
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:43,546
What "this" are you
offering in exchange

85
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,848
- for my "that"?
- I'm quite the topic

86
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,686
of conversation
in psychiatric circles.

87
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,672
(chuckling)

88
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:56,325
I shared my diagnosis of you
on the witness stand.

89
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:59,628
Your personality disorders,

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,098
neuroses-- all forgeries.

91
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Even if that were true,
I'd still be a psychopath

92
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,102
- of some interest.
- Mm.

93
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,087
Quite a manipulative
one at that.

94
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:10,940
Poor, confused, wounded bird

95
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:13,993
for Agent Crawford and
Doctors Lecter and Bloom.

96
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,446
And for me, well,

97
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:19,482
I get the psychopath's
triumvirate: charm,

98
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:22,251
focus, and ruthlessness.

99
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,287
The charm being
debateable, of course.

100
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,256
So, either I'm a psychopath

101
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:29,959
or I am delusional.

102
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:33,513
Or I'm right about Hannibal
Lecter. Aren't you curious

103
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:36,666
which one it is?

104
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,253
- Will you allow me to test you?
- Test me?

105
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:43,689
I'll take 'em all.

106
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:47,060
You will be the first
and last word in the mind

107
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:50,897
of Will Graham. God, you could
dine out on that for years.

108
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,283
What about Dr. Lecter?

109
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:56,285
Shouldn't you be

110
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,471
my one and only psychiatrist,
Dr. Chilton?

111
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:01,374
- Ideally.
- Well then,

112
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:03,459
as to your "that"

113
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:06,012
for my "this."

114
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:08,915
Do not discuss me or my therapy

115
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,967
with Hannibal Lecter.

116
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:14,253
Tell him that you've
decided I am no longer

117
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,489
any of his business.

118
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,843
I am now under

119
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,330
your exclusive care.

120
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,919
Lazarus had it good.

121
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:32,238
My social circle
doesn't include a friend

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,358
with power over death.

123
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,560
I suppose I should've
embraced Facebook

124
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:39,946
while I had the chance.
(chuckling)

125
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,876
I never should have
let Jack talk me

126
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:56,429
into taking chemo.

127
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,381
He's trying to
extend your life.

128
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:00,633
He's trying to extend
a quality of life

129
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:02,635
that's not worth the effort.

130
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:05,521
Jack's efforts or yours?

131
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:10,860
I'm vomiting my stomach lining.

132
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:17,183
On a good day, I sleep

133
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:20,770
fifteen to eighteen hours.

134
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:22,972
On a bad day, I don't sleep.

135
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:26,075
My best-case
scenario

136
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:30,129
is prolonged pain management.

137
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:32,498
Jack will help you manage.

138
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:38,554
He loves you, Bella.

139
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:42,041
When you are gone, he will feel
your silence like a draft.

140
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,260
My silence

141
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,696
is inevitable.

142
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:50,132
The war is over.

143
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:54,387
The cancer is
an occupying force.

144
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,323
I want to surrender.

145
00:08:57,325 --> 00:09:00,943
While I still have my dignity.

146
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:07,733
- You are considering ending your life?
- Suicide seems

147
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:11,204
like a valid solution
to my problem.

148
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,858
How does that make you feel?

149
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:22,431
Alive.

150
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,337
How does it make you feel?

151
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:34,293
I've always found the idea
of death comforting.

152
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:37,563
The thought that my life
could end at any moment

153
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:40,566
frees me to fully appreciate

154
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,868
the beauty, and art,

155
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,870
and horror

156
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:46,939
of everything
this world has to offer.

157
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:49,675
A death benefit?

158
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:52,061
Upon taking his
own life, Socrates

159
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:55,214
offered a rooster to the god
of healing, Asclepius,

160
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,233
to pay his debt.

161
00:09:57,235 --> 00:10:00,419
What debt might that be?

162
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,788
To Socrates, death
was not a defeat...

163
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:07,093
...but a cure.

164
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:18,321
Gentlemen...

165
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:21,157
Local police were supposed
to exterminate the bees

166
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,960
so we could work the crime scene.
Apparently, someone shut that down.

167
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,829
- I did. - He did.
- Jimmy?

168
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:29,081
Well, I love bees.

169
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,584
Did you know that the drone

170
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:34,453
is nature's most talented
suicidal swordsman?

171
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,455
When the drone
mates with the queen,

172
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,791
his ejaculation
is so explosive,

173
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,793
it's audible to the human ear.

174
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:42,678
All right.

175
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,714
How long has he been out here?

176
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:47,713
Ah, from de-comp, I'd estimate two weeks.

177
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,019
Which makes sense with how
much honey is being produced.

178
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:54,857
Do bees naturally hive
in human carcasses like this?

179
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,778
No. The victim was purposely
repurposed as a human apiary.

180
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Purposely.

181
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:03,733
Somebody removed
the eyes and part

182
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,402
of the brain to
make room for the hive.

183
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:14,377
Zeller's out in the field, otherwise
I'd ask him to help me with this.

184
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,363
I was a surgeon and
a doctor, yes. Have you found

185
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:19,615
any evidence on
the Muralist's friend?

186
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:22,918
That's what I need your help with.
Might not have been a friend.

187
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Might not have even
been an acquaintance.

188
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:26,989
Whoever killed him,
understood him.

189
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,241
So often you open your mouth

190
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:32,144
and I hear Will Graham's
words come out.

191
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,564
I have an arrangement
with Will.

192
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,517
He's agreed to consult
with me on cases,

193
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,003
if I keep investigating
the murders he's accused of.

194
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:44,390
I'm happy to hear that.

195
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,493
Will needs a champion
now more than ever.

196
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,379
He has you, doesn't he?

197
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:53,449
You think there's a chance he
could be innocent. I know you do.

198
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,503
I believe there is
a possibility.

199
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm just relieved he's not saying
the killer is you anymore.

200
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:04,293
At least not to me.

201
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:08,130
Who does Will believe
killed the Muralist?

202
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:10,116
Doesn't know.

203
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:12,435
He thinks if
James Gray's killer

204
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,437
hid him in the mural, he may
have hid something else.

205
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:17,857
A signature?

206
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,092
What kind of killer

207
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:23,729
seeks to depict the unconscious,
instinctual striving of his victim

208
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:26,982
by sewing him into
a human mural?

209
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,252
It wasn't just for appearances.

210
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:34,123
You have to get to the truth
beneath the appearances.

211
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,043
Only by going deep beneath
the skin will you understand

212
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,796
the nature of this
killer's pathology.

213
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,872
Before I start
asking you questions,

214
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:52,842
I need some confidence that
you will be telling the truth

215
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:55,878
- when you answer.
- What's this?

216
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,314
A consent form.
You're agreeing

217
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:01,350
to a narcoanalytic
interview. You. Me.

218
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,903
And our old friend,
sodium amytal.

219
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:06,021
A little something
to loosen my tongue?

220
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,357
Something lawfully
used in the evaluation

221
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,159
of psychotic patients.

222
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,194
What would you use

223
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:15,114
to induce memory loss in a
patient, psychotic or otherwise?

224
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:18,984
The protein synthesis
that moves memories

225
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:22,755
from short-term to long-term
can be interrupted,

226
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:26,208
but that requires
tools and skills.

227
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,961
And a certain level
of unorthodoxy.

228
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:32,047
Does Hannibal Lecter possess
those tools and skills?

229
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,468
Dr. Lecter has indicated
to me that he is open

230
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,521
to the unorthodox when
it comes to treating patients.

231
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,523
I wonder how that
subject came up...

232
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,642
Sharing stories
of the unorthodox.

233
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:47,480
Sign here.

234
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,429
I want you to draw
a clock for me.

235
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:01,053
(muffled): Did Dr. Lecter
administer any drug therapies

236
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:03,072
during your sessions together?

237
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,391
Sedatives...

238
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,968
The strobe causes neurons
to fire en masse,

239
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,988
like striking many
piano keys at once.

240
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:25,244
<i>The strobe causes neurons</i>
<i>to fire en masse,</i>

241
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:27,830
<i>like striking many...</i>

242
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,369
The dissonance might foster
a change in your mind.

243
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,009
Is something wrong?

244
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:47,616
Will...?

245
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:53,856
He was inducing seizures.

246
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:56,442
He was encouraging them.
The blackouts.

247
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,611
The lost time.

248
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:02,064
It was strategic.
It was planned.

249
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:06,485
You would only see a seizure
response in a brain

250
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,921
afflicted with
photosensitive epilepsy.

251
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:11,757
Or afflicted by something
just as damaging.

252
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,809
Like encephalitis.

253
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:23,302
That would suggest a radically
unorthodox form of therapy.

254
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,162
Yes, it would.

255
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:34,587
Doctor Lecter.

256
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,421
I am so embarrassed.

257
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:41,095
You didn't get my message?

258
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:43,781
I canceled your appointment
with Will Graham.

259
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:46,017
Is everything all right?

260
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,636
I can explain.
Shall we?

261
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,031
Will is at a delicate
point in his therapy.

262
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:58,109
I don't want to confuse him
any more than he already is.

263
00:16:58,345 --> 00:16:59,201
Confuse him?

264
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,903
Isn't it your opinion he's
an intelligent psychopath?

265
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:05,104
It was, but my opinion is evolving.

266
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:08,900
After administering a
narcoanalytic interview,

267
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:12,603
therapeutically vital
information has come to light.

268
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:16,190
- What sort of information?
- What Will Graham suffers from

269
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:19,276
may not be a single condition,
but a continuum

270
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,278
of illnesses, all with different

271
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,981
neurological mechanisms.
Some naturally occurring,

272
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:27,651
- others appear to have been induced.
- Induced?

273
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,153
Induced by whom?

274
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:33,106
Did you ever use any kind
of light stimulation

275
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,125
in your treatment?

276
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:38,212
Light stimulation is a
standard tool for neurotherapy.

277
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:41,481
Evidently, it was overloading
his visual cortex.

278
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:43,917
Creating seizures, time loss,

279
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,119
gaps in his memory.

280
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,672
Almost strategically, it seems.

281
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,644
You're suggesting
it was intentional?

282
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,646
All our conversations
about psychic driving.

283
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:58,348
You were so curious and eager
to hear what I had to say

284
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,268
- while saying very little yourself.
- I had very little to say.

285
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,354
I have been thinking
about the possibility

286
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:07,708
that you may have been psychic
driving Will Graham all along.

287
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:12,613
A bold accusation, Frederick.

288
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,349
You are not the only psychiatrist
accused of making a patient kill.

289
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:22,072
We have to stick together.

290
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:30,847
Last time I did this,

291
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:33,216
this isn't how I did this.

292
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,469
The young man at the dispensary

293
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:38,338
calls this "purple kush."

294
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,284
He says

295
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,736
all his cancer patients

296
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:56,707
love its "deep body stone."
(chuckling)

297
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,993
May I?

298
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:03,380
- Do you still get drug tested?
- Oh, come on, gimme that thing.

299
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,506
I'm supporting my wife.

300
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:22,416
I filled out my advadirect.

301
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:25,402
I added a DNR.

302
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:28,855
Oh, you are harshing
my buzz right now.

303
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:32,609
I read an article the other day

304
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,911
about magnetic hyperthermia.

305
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:38,332
It's looking promising
as a treatment

306
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:41,168
for lung cancer.

307
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:51,128
Come here.

308
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:57,167
I know what to expect
from lung cancer.

309
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:00,070
I am my mother's daughter,

310
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:03,306
and I watched her
go through exactly

311
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:06,309
- what I am going through now.
- I know.

312
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:09,730
Hey... I remember

313
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,532
sitting by her bed

314
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,651
when she woke up
in so much pain

315
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:16,903
that all she could do
was scream my name.

316
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:21,625
I didn't know how to help her.

317
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,660
So I did nothing.

318
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:25,579
There was nothing you could do.

319
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:28,148
And there will be a time
when there is nothing

320
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,634
you can do.

321
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:34,137
And I don't want you
to remember me

322
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:38,425
pleading with you
to make the pain go away.

323
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:42,746
Oh, I'm not going
to remember you that way.

324
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:45,482
First of all,
I'm going to remember you

325
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:48,485
walking along the quays
of Italy in the sunshine

326
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:50,954
with a trail of signori
behind you

327
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:54,357
shouting "bella,
bella, bella."

328
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,927
And I'm going to remember

329
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:00,063
that your hands...

330
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:04,017
that they smelled of thyme when
you came in from the garden.

331
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,036
And garlic and onions

332
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:09,556
every time you left the kitchen.
(laughing)

333
00:21:11,742 --> 00:21:15,479
I'm going to remember you as
beautiful as you are right now.

334
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:20,383
Well, good.

335
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,738
Good.

336
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:41,238
Duncan Halloran,
fifty-two, divorced, bankrupt.

337
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,457
Reported missing
six months ago.

338
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,876
And what do we know
about his death?

339
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:49,129
Considering any post-mortem morphological
changes, this guy's white blood cell count

340
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:51,281
- was through the roof when he died.
- You're telling me

341
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,834
his killer was a fever
and/or a massive infection?

342
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,003
- Lock 'em both up.
- No family. No money.

343
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:59,756
No reason to live.
Alive, dead, or dying,

344
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,975
- who put him under the tree?
- It's possible

345
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:04,978
we're dealing with a highly motivated
religious individual here.

346
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,982
- Explain. - In Hinduism, honey is one of
the five elixirs of immortality.

347
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,985
In Christianity, the bee
is considered to be

348
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:15,739
an emblem of Christ; his
mildness and mercy on one side,

349
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:19,309
- his Old Testament justice on the other.
- OK. The orbital bone,

350
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:22,579
his sphenoid, um, behind where
the eyeballs would usually be,

351
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:25,198
there's tiny punctures.
Something long and sharp

352
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,751
was pushed in his brain.

353
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:31,421
Jack, this guy was lobotomized.

354
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:39,045
- How are you feeling today?
- Not well.

355
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:42,682
My arthritis is killing me.
I can't take much more of it.

356
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:46,052
A course of bee venom
therapy would soothe

357
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,221
the inflammation.

358
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:50,273
I can barely afford
<i>this</i> treatment.

359
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:53,443
That's a problem
for another day.

360
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:55,896
Now,

361
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:59,583
you just quiet your mind.

362
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:02,519
Just live in the present.

363
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,390
- You feel that?
- No.

364
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,376
Good.

365
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:11,945
You feel that?

366
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:14,514
- No.
- Good.

367
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:19,803
Feel that?

368
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:22,889
I can't feel anything.

369
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,976
Good.

370
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:31,431
Then you won't feel this...

371
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:46,029
(whimpering)

372
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,898
Mister, you're not supposed
to stare at the sun.

373
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,701
It'll hurt your eyes.

374
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,140
Multiple holes in this guy.
Over a dozen.

375
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:41,425
Both eye sockets.

376
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:43,594
The-the lesions have severed

377
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,696
most of the nerve tract
in the frontal lobe.

378
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:48,616
He's covered in bee stings
like he got swarmed.

379
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:51,869
Must be floating in apitoxin,
or he doesn't feel a thing.

380
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:54,572
Yeah, the not feeling anything has
got nothing to do with bee stings.

381
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:56,409
Welcome to the world
of the living dead.

382
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,376
There's a pattern.

383
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:01,429
- Hey.
- Hey...

384
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,732
- Look what the cat's dragged in.
- What are you looking at?

385
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:07,318
(both): A pattern.

386
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,755
See, some of the bee stings triggered
an allergic reaction, others didn't.

387
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:13,024
The inflamed bee stings
were all in line

388
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,743
with the body's meridian,
on acupuncture points.

389
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:19,363
The bee stings are
hiding the needle marks.

390
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:20,831
What did you say?

391
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,602
Uh, the bee stings are
hiding the needle marks?

392
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,233
Stitches are hiding stitches.

393
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,956
<i>Only by going deep</i>
<i>beneath the skin</i>

394
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:06,293
<i>will you understand the nature</i>
<i>of this killer's pathology.</i>

395
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,307
He took his kidney.

396
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:23,227
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

397
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:27,648
Tell me if he's real.

398
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,018
- I don't see anyone.
- No, he's right there.

399
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,604
- There's no one there. We're alone.
- You're lying.

400
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:35,823
You came here alone. Do you
remember coming alone?

401
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:38,526
- Please don't lie to me.
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs is dead.

402
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:42,279
- You killed him. You watched him die.
- What's happening to me?

403
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:45,750
Will. Will, you're having

404
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:48,169
an episode. I want you
to hand me over the gun.

405
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:50,788
Will, I want you
to hand me your...

406
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,374
Will...

407
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:14,812
He's had a mild seizure.

408
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:18,449
That... doesn't seem
to bother you.

409
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:21,285
I said it was mild.

410
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:34,498
Are you the man who claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper?

411
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:38,969
Why do you say "claimed"?

412
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:41,439
Because you're not.

413
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,891
You know you're not and
you don't know much more

414
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:46,093
about who you are beyond that.

415
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,514
Are <i>you</i>
<i>the Ripper?</i>

416
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:56,987
A terrible thing,

417
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,924
to have your identity
taken from you.

418
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:26,050
Whoever killed James Gray
didn't just take his leg.

419
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:28,435
Sutures hidden
beneath the stitching

420
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:30,638
that wove him into the mural. One
crime made to look like another.

421
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,891
Like the Copycat.

422
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:37,795
And...

423
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:39,546
the Chesapeake Ripper.

424
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:42,747
Now you're saying Hannibal
Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper?

425
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,652
I'm saying also the Chesapeake Ripper.

426
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,423
Um...

427
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:51,425
were the kidneys
surgically removed?

428
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,840
- Yes.
- Dr. Lecter was a surgeon.

429
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,631
I know he was. I asked him to
consult on James Gray's autopsy.

430
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,919
You what?

431
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,421
If you invited him

432
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:05,982
with an actual agenda,
Hannibal would know it.

433
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:08,439
- He pointed me to the evidence.
- He pointed you

434
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,162
to an absence of evidence.

435
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:13,397
He's baiting a hook, Beverly.

436
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:16,650
He's toying with you.
Go to Jack. Tell him everything.

437
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:20,104
I can't bring this to Jack
until I can back it up.

438
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:23,056
Stay away

439
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:25,559
from Hannibal Lecter.

440
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:30,347
The Chesapeake Ripper
kept surgical trophies.

441
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:34,001
If Hannibal's the ripper, what's
he doing with his trophies?

442
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:45,462
(crows cawing)

443
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:00,477
He's eating them.

444
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,604
***

445
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:30,590
Yes.

446
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:33,151
I'm Special Agent
Jack Crawford with the FBI.

447
00:30:33,153 --> 00:30:35,153
This is Agent Zeller
and Agent Price.

448
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:37,684
We'd like to speak with you about
two of your former patients.

449
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:39,453
Would you like to come in?

450
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:43,332
When was the last time you saw
Duncan Halloran or Lloyd Roat?

451
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:46,018
Whenever our last
appointments were.

452
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,936
- I can check in my calendar, if you want.
- Sure.

453
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:52,432
- Have you found them?
- Yes, we have.

454
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,816
Mr. Halloran is deceased.

455
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:58,436
And Mr. Roat
might as well be.

456
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:00,489
Whew...

457
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,685
- Poor Mr. Halloran...
- What were you treating him for?

458
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:08,822
That man trudged
from disease to disease.

459
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:12,259
He had severe combined
immunodeficiency.

460
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:15,545
Life didn't seem
to be going his way.

461
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:17,580
- Please.
- Thank you.

462
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:23,453
Hm...

463
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:26,106
I find that, uh,

464
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:29,693
people don't get their own way

465
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:32,128
because, um,

466
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,998
they often don't know themselves

467
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,718
where that way leads.

468
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,504
Mr. Halloran,
he couldn't envision

469
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:43,874
a dignified end of life.

470
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:47,294
So, it's much nicer to die,

471
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,897
well, for him,
to die in a meadow,

472
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:54,434
a head full of bees.

473
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:00,674
- Have you tried the honey?
- No.

474
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:03,910
I couldn't bring myself to
either. It seemed

475
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:06,580
too morbid.

476
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:08,665
So you left him in the field

477
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:11,101
- to die?
- I brought him

478
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:14,854
to the field to die.
I didn't kill him.

479
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:17,107
I quieted his mind

480
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,092
so that he could die in peace.

481
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:22,145
And Mr. Roat?

482
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:25,515
- You quieted his mind, too?
- Oh, him.

483
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:27,517
He suffered

484
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,553
crippling arthritis.

485
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:33,390
After he was quieted...

486
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,195
...I saw him walk pain-free
for the very first time

487
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:41,798
in his life.

488
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,385
I can't make pain go away,

489
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:48,939
but I can make it so that
it doesn't matter.

490
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:53,760
I-I protected them.

491
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:56,313
I protected these people

492
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:58,748
from hopelessness.

493
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,685
And that's beautiful.

494
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,995
Please come in.

495
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:13,997
It's a little unnerving,

496
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:17,367
not being able to walk
across the floor.

497
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:21,171
Nothing can be so unnerving
for someone strong

498
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,473
as being weak.

499
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:29,346
I was so weak
after chemotherapy,

500
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:32,482
Jack had to
physically pick me up.

501
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:34,934
It was the second time

502
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,153
he carried me
across the threshold.

503
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,325
I brought you something.

504
00:33:42,327 --> 00:33:44,344
A gift?

505
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:52,686
Paying my debt.

506
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,672
Coq Gaulois.

507
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:58,425
For helping me understand

508
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:01,478
that death is not a defeat,

509
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,464
but a cure.

510
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,643
What have you taken, Bella?

511
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:19,662
My morphine.

512
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:21,698
Every bit of it.

513
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:30,056
I didn't want to die at home.

514
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:32,992
I didn't want Jack to find me.

515
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:38,064
I didn't want him
to make that call...

516
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,771
...to be in the room
with my body,

517
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:48,241
waiting...

518
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:52,345
for it to become
some ceremonial object

519
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:55,348
apart from him,

520
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,718
separate

521
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,921
from who I was,

522
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,891
someone he can only...

523
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:10,997
...hold in his mind.

524
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:21,691
You denied him his goodbye.

525
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:24,944
I denied him...

526
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:28,998
a painful goodbye.

527
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:36,556
And allowed myself
a peaceful one.

528
00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:42,962
Tell Jack...

529
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:51,488
...I love him very much.

530
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,656
Yes.

531
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:03,500
Goodbye,

532
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:06,352
Dr. Lecter.

533
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,679
Goodbye, Bella.

534
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,992
Hey. Have you seen Jack?

535
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,994
Oh. No, no, no,
there was, uh,

536
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,996
some emergency with his wife.
Dr. Lecter called

537
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,716
- from the hospital, asked him to come down.
- Is Mrs. Crawford okay?

538
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,951
I don't know.
He didn't say.

539
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,106
So Hannibal's
at the hospital, too?

540
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,769
(moaning softly)

541
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,846
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

542
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,302
I'm here.

543
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,604
I'm here.

544
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,058
What are you doing here?

545
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,129
I want to apologize.

546
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,934
I couldn't honor
what you asked of me.

547
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,581
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,074
(coughing)

549
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,414
Get out.

550
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:00,607
Gotcha.

551
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,572
(creaking)

552
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,374
Oh, my God.

553
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:24,407
(gunshots)

554
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:38,128
