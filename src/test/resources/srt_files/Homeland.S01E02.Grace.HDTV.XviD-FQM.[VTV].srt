PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces</i> <i>of the United States</i>

<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

REAGAN:
<i>George Herbert Walker Bush...</i>

REPORTER:
<i>The</i> USS Cole <i>was attacked...</i>

8
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,485
This was an act of terrorism.

9
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:31,053
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

10
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:32,820
The next song we're gonna play

11
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:34,688
for you is one
of the good ol' favorites.

12

MAN: That plane crashed into

Running up...

SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

22
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,706
- Everyone misses something.
- Everyone is not me.

<i>"An American prisoner of war</i>

I'm an American.

27

CARRIE:
<i>If he is a terrorist,</i>

28
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:34,959

<i>on Brody from the minute</i>

Out of the question.

31
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,268
How long before you're set up?

32
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:41,736
The feed will be live
by the time Sergeant Brody

33
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:43,071
gets back to his house.

34
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:45,808
VIRGIL:
Hello, Big Brother.

35
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,911
Ready for you, Sergeant
Brody, your debriefing.

36
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:48,979
I want to call my wife first.

37
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:50,815
Jessica, it's me.

38
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,291
Pleased to meet you.

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,495
Hug him, Chris.

40
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:01,496
(crowd cheering)

41
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,431
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

42
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,134
I want to say thank you
to my family

43
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:07,436
for their strength
in my absence.

44
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:09,639
Three days ago, we were
about to tell your kids.

45
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:11,475
He's my husband, Mike.

46
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:14,811
Abu Nazir? Was he present during
any of your interrogations?

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,779
No.

48
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:19,984
I didn't think that this was
any of my business.

49
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,952
Now I'm thinking that it is.
Just tell me

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,454
I'm not out here
risking federal prison

51
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,722
on behalf of a crazy person.

52
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,456
You know, maybe it is
all in my head,

53
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:28,458
but you're in it now, Virgil,
up to your fucking neck!

54
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:31,128
You think for one minute
you get away with this?

55
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,662
I thought that once
I had some proof...

56
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,664
Do you have any?
You've been suggesting

57
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:35,966
that Sergeant Brody's
what you think he is.

58
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:36,966
No.

59
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:38,034
Then get a lawyer.

60
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:39,702
I missed something once before,

61
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,673
I won't... I can't let
that happen again!

62
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,008
It was ten years ago.

63
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,343
Everyone missed
something that day.

64
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,911
It's a pattern.

65
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay, do you see?

66
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,015
He's making contact, Saul.
He's sending

67
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,150

00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:55,688

Dana, can you please help him?

Yeah.

97
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,557
Around 4:00 a.m. this morning.

98
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,859
You were yelling something

99
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,361
that sounded like Arabic
over and over.

100
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:12,565
You grabbed my arm really hard.

101
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:13,899
You wouldn't let go.

102

They're still out there.

107
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:41,724
Do they stay out
there all night,

108
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,526

"Douche" is not a bad word.

Don't answer that!

Third time this week.

Tell 'em I'm not here.

118

He says he's not here.

119
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,689
Hey, I thought
you didn't want to be late.

120
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,393
I know, maybe I should take
another day off.

121
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,927
Hey, all those years

122
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,697

handle one more day.

All right? Go on.

124

Brody, how does it feel
to be free?

137
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,212
Is it true
you're gonna reenlist?

138
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,780
Are you going to reenlist?

139
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,849
Would you ever go back
out there, Sergeant?

140
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,819
How does it feel
to be home again, sir?

141
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:50,454
Sir, are you going to reenlist?

142

<i>I've been going over</i>
<i>Brody's finger tapping</i>

146
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:05,966
with the crypto team,
and I hate to say it, Saul,

147
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,535
but there's little, if any,
repeat pattern combination.

148
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:11,404
Not even a quadratic basis
to work with here.

149
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:14,573
I'll keep trying as long as
you need, but there's nothing

150
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,041
definitive one way
or the other yet.

151
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:18,310
Keep looking.

152
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:20,913
I want to leave no
stone unturned on this.

153

What do you think?

156
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:33,060
Oh, definitely an original...

157
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:36,664
by one of the preeminent
Dutch painters of his time.

158
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,667
Relatively recent acquisition,
if I'm not mistaken.

159
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:41,435
By an artist who,
as it turns out,

160
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:42,903
was not only Dutch

161
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,605
but also Jewish.

162
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:46,006
In a club with
no Jewish members.

163
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:47,774
That was your point, wasn't it?

164
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:51,511
How do you take it?

165
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:53,913
(sighs)

166
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:57,249
Your Honor, I'm not
asking for anything

167
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,818
that hasn't been granted

168
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,086
many thousands of times over
in the last ten years.

169
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:05,024
A surveillance warrant
on an unspecified subject

170
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,961
on American soil-- if this
were a standard request,

171
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,797
you'd go through standard
procedure, Saul.

172
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:13,767
In this case, I don't have time

173
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,970
for a government lawyer
to petition the court.

174
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:19,541
So you're asking me to issue
a FISA warrant directly to...

175
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:22,945
What is it exactly do you do
at Langley these days?

176
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:25,880
Among other things,
pay house calls

177
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:27,816
to those I'd prefer
not to have to...

178
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,284
strong arm?

179
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,287
Disturb.

180
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,961
Are you ever gonna let me off
your hook, Saul?

181
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,064
Well...

182
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:46,135
We both know you're far too fine
a judge for that, Geoffrey.

183
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:49,405
Can we at least act like
this is about the law

184
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:54,076
rather than a brief moment
of weakness in my past?

185
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:57,146
This is absolutely about
the law, Your Honor.

186
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,048
Hmm.

187
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,468
Shit.

188
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,471
(sighs)

189
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:26,243
(turns faucet on and off)

190
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,245
CARRIE:
<i>Hey, Maggie, it's me.</i>

191
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,681
Sorry I haven't called
in a while; I been slammed.

192
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,550
Um, thought I'll come see
you guys for a night,

193
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:34,952
if that's good with you.

194
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,954
Uh... call me back.
Let me know.

195
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,389
Thanks. Bye.

196
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,930
(footfalls) (gasps)

197
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,532
(sighs)

198
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,100
I've got a doorbell, you know?

199
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,601
Well, you think you still have

200
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,637
a right to privacy
with all this?

201
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,739
My God, look at this place.

202
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,043
It's broken--

203
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:02,045
the doorbell.

204
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:03,546
What's that?

205
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,115
This gives you four weeks.

206
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,983
You got a warrant?
A FISA warrant?

207
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:08,418
We're legal now?

208
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:12,055
Legal-ish, but far
from official,

209
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:14,758
and certainly
not Estes-proof.

210
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:17,594
Be very careful not to mistake
this for a stamp of approval,

211
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:18,995
or sanction from me

212
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,164
for you to wage some
sort of personal war.

213
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:23,333
Eyes on Brody makes
complete sense.

214
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,635
It's exactly what you'd have
done in my shoes, Saul.

215
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,970
No, it is not.

216
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,675
You lied to me
about it, Carrie.

217
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:35,578
Then right here in this room,
when I called you on it...

218
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,012
I know what I did.

219
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,481
And I know it was wrong...

220
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,483
and insulting.

221
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,018
Insulting...

222
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:46,021
and barely scratches
the surface of what that was.

223
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:49,991
Four weeks, Carrie.

224
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:51,325
Not a second longer.

225
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,160
I want to show you something.

226
00:12:58,566 --> 00:12:59,666
He has nightmares.

227
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,335
Where he repeatedly begs

228
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,637
someone to kill him, in Arabic.

229
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,374
He's too ashamed or scared
or both to face the press

230
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,876
outside his house or take calls

231
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,477
from the TV news,
so what does he do?

232
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,479
He finds shelter in the
corner of the bedroom,

233
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,715
where he hasn't moved
in over five hours.

234
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,384
All of which makes
complete sense

235
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:17,052
after eight years of captivity.

236
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
But what if it's
more than that?

237
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,059
(sighs)

238
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:26,461
If-if Brody had really
been turned, as you say,

239
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:29,164
you know what he'd more
likely be doing by now?

240
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,899
Talking to the press
outside his house,

241
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,467
doing TV interviews,

242
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:36,470
playing the hero card
for every penny it's worth.

243
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:39,006
Maybe it's not that simple
for him.

244
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:41,842
Get some sleep, Carrie.

245
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,180
No one said becoming a terrorist
was easy, Saul.

246
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:47,149
If you'd been taken prisoner,

247
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,817
tortured for God knows how long

248
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:51,220
and somehow,
finally been turned,

249
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,889
then, one day, you come home,

250
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,759
and suddenly it's real, it's on!

251
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,761
Well, that's one interpretation.

252
00:13:57,828 --> 00:13:59,763
But that's all it is
at the moment.

253
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,165
Clean your apartment.

254
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,900
And eat some real food.

255
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:10,272
(door opens)

256
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,675
(door closes)

257
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,611
(sirens wailing in distance)

258
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:26,420
LYNNE:
Raised in Colorado Springs,

259
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:28,455
attended BYU,

260
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:31,191
interests,
finance, travel, men.

261
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,460
Stacey Moore,
this is Latif Bin Walid,

262
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,796
Majordomo for his Highness,
Prince Farid.

263
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:37,798
Please continue.

264
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:40,734
Would you say you're outgoing,
or more the quiet type, Stacey?

265
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,536
I'd say more outgoing.

266
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,870
Definitely social.

267
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:47,541
I like to party,
if that's what you mean.

268
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:48,575
Do you drink?

269
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:51,878
I'm not a drinker, per se,

270
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:53,647
if that's what you mean.

271
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:56,316
(sighs) Stacey...

272
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:59,319
You are interviewing for a job
that pays, in two years,

273
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,954
more than most people
in this country earn in 20.

274
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,157
If you're successful
in this interview,

275
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:06,559
you'll be required to appear
self-possessed, confident,

276
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:09,496
modest and reticent
all at the same time.

277
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:11,498
So, stop asking what I mean.

278
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,133
Think and answer for yourself.

279
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:17,905
Do you enjoy anal sex?

280
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:20,408
Excuse me?

281
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,913
How about other women?

282
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,949
Sure.

283
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:29,317
Both.

284
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:32,654
Have you ever dated
any famous men?

285
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:36,191
That's none of your business.

286
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,369
You need to wax that, sweetie.

287
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,971
Hair down there's not an option
for His Highness.

288
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,010
Very nice.

289
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:56,012
You're through
the final interview.

290
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,847
We'll contact you
within the next week.

291
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,283
Congratulations,
and you can get dressed now.

292
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,720
(phone beeps on)

293
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,221
Who are you calling?

294
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,723
My aesthetician.

295
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,126
I, too, need a wax
before the prince gets in.

296
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:14,432
Feel free to book the
appointment for me, if you like.

297
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:20,371
Music.

298
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,206
Mm-hmm. On hold.

299
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,508
Kenny G.
Welcome to America.

300
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,144
Gimme.

301
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:30,148
Would you mind selecting the
next girl to come in, please?

302
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,354
Come on, pick up, pick up.

303
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:38,490
Hi. This is Lynne Reed.

304
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:40,025
Two E's.

305
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,028
I was referred by one
of her clients, Carrie.

306
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:44,596
Yes, that's her.

307
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:47,933
I need to book a Brazilian wax
for noon tomorrow.

308
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,769
Right. No-- that's the only time
I can do it.

309
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,204
Okay, noon it is.

310
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:54,006
We'll see you then.

311
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,607
(keypad beeping)

312
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,444
(phone ringing)

313
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,846
Hello.

314
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:02,047
Carrie, it's Yvonne Marshall.

315
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:03,182
I'm the duty officer tonight.

316
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,517
Hi, Yvonne. What is it?

317
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,884
You have an asset
in from the cold.

318
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:07,286
Booked a treatment tomorrow

319
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,854
at the Yara Spa in Georgetown.

320
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:10,957
Lynne Reed?
That's right. She used your

321
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,092
first name as a reference
and made a noon appointment.

322
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,894
Noon?

323
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,729
Ar-Are you sure she said noon?

324
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,264
That was the only time
she could make it.

325
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,200
(sighs)

326
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,601
Okay. Thanks, Yvonne.

327
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,003
(phone beeps off)

328
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,207
(door opens over monitor)

329
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,376
(door closes)

330
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,217
Hi.

331
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,787
Mm. How was school?
Okay.

332
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,657
Is Dad here?
Don't know.

333
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:44,661
JESSICA: If you want to help, you
can start unpacking those for me.

334
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:00,177
Hey.

335
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,779
Hey.

336
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,380
How was your day?

337
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:07,351
Great.

338
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,143
FOSTER: Oh. Hope
you don't mind, Mike.

339
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,046
We helped ourselves
to some of your hooch.

340
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,817
Thought we would
stop by for a...

341
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,320
for a situation report
on Sergeant Brody.

342
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,530
(sighs)

343
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,899
Situation report
on Brody is this:

344
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,735
He's been back three days,

345
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,971
and it's gonna take a little
more time until he's willing

346
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,006
to come out of his shell,
let alone his house.

347
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:02,475
The man represents a significant
victory in the war on terror,

348
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,478
thanks to our friends
at the CIA.

349
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,480
I'm putting aside
for the moment

350
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:08,482
that Sergeant Brody
owes them his life.

351
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,083
These are the facts:

352
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,352
Bin Laden's dead...

353
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,854
and America thinks,
or wants to think,

354
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,756
that this war is
drawing to an end.

355
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,191
Politicians are pushing for a

356
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:19,059
wholesale withdrawal
from Afghanistan.

357
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,228
But as we all know, Captain,

358
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,230
the terrorists
are still out there--

359
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,032
after blood.

360
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,034
We need Brody in the public eye,

361
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,203
reminding America
that this is far from over.

362
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,172
What if he's not up for it...
psychologically?

363
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,774
Fuck it.

364
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,242
Drive on.

365
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,611
Isn't that what
you Marines say?

366
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,680
In combat, where we also shit
in Saran Wrap and shoot to kill.

367
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,348
You want Brody to do that, too?

368
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,518
Don't take that tone
with me, Captain.

369
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,887
Career pencil-pusher, with
his brown nose in my scotch

370
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,889
saying, "Fuck it, drive on."

371
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:53,060
You're a captain in the
United States Marines.

372
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:56,364
You mean to tell me you can't
give a sergeant a direct order?

373
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,866
Is that what you want me
to report up the chain?

374
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,368
Look, Mike, I get it.

375
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,070
You and Brody are
friends, right?

376
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,905
By the way,

377
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,141
how's his wife Jennifer doing?

378
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,609
Jessica.

379
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,383
If not for us, Brody should
at least do it for her.

380
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:15,918
For the kids.

381
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:18,387
And I'm sure you're
more than familiar

382
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:20,389
with their current
financial problems.

383
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:23,492
DOD's offering a very generous
reenlistment package,

384
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,127
plus a promotion,

385
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:28,430
that could pull his family
out of the shitter.

386
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:30,265
(puts glass down)

387
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,669
Give your friend
the correct advice, Captain.

388
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,104
Make it happen.

389
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:38,574
(puts glass down)

390
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,376
(door opens)

391
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:50,186
(indistinct conversation)

392
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:52,622
(video game gunfire
and explosion sound effects)

393
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,426
Where does Mom
keep the pancake mix?

394
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:57,594
The what...?

395
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:58,995
You're toast, asswipe.

396
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:00,296
BRODY:
Found it.

397
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,568
Hey, Dad...

398
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,572
What's it like to kill somebody?

399
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,123
(sighs)

400
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,634
Can I help you?

401
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:42,005
Yeah, just a couple
questions, Sergeant Brody.

402
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,640
Nick. Can I call you Nick?

403
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,508
You got ten seconds
to get off my property.

404
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,711
I'm Alan Quick, channel 10,

405
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:50,046
and technically, I'm standing
on a public easement.

406
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,081
Five seconds.

407
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:52,582
Oh, come on, Nick.

408
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,851
Hey, how about we start
with an easy one?

409
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,520
Tell me, how are your kids
doing with all of the--

410
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,588
(blow lands, Alan groaning)

411
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:01,423
(gagging)

412
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:03,993
(Alan gasping over monitor)

413
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,928
(wheezing, gasping)

414
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:07,363
(Alan coughing)

415
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:09,332
(panting)

416
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:12,936
(Alan coughing)

417
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:18,942
(Alan groaning and gasping)

418
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:32,423
(birds chirping)

419
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:36,228
Fuck.

420
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:38,430
Fuck!

421
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,265
Max, he's heading
through the woods out back.

422
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,767
Uh, less than a minute ago.

423
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,769
I need you to hurry round
to Mansfield Road.

424
00:22:43,836 --> 00:22:45,136
It's about 400 yards north.

425
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:46,905
Okay. Call me back
when you find him.

426
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,739
(sizzling)

427
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,708
Shit.

428
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:56,146
Who left this pan on the stove?

429
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,147
(steam hissing)

430
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:02,151
Chris!

431
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,153
Where's Dad?

432
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:37,320
♪ ♪

433
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,444
(door opens)

434
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:05,947
You know, the whole
reason I left the Company

435
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,115
and went freelance was
so I could have a life.

436
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:10,351
You're becoming my wife's
least favorite person.

437
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:11,952
I've got incoming HUMINT
I got to go deal with.

438
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,953
Who is it?

439
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:13,987
Someone I recruited

440
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:15,989
in Bahrain a few years ago.

441
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,124
Professional girlfriend
of a Saudi prince.

442
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,458
What's she got?

443
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:20,293
We'll find out soon enough.

444
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:23,530
(sighs)
You got anything to eat?

445
00:24:23,598 --> 00:24:25,465
Um... yeah.

446
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,100
There's a yogurt in the fridge.

447
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,003
(water trickling)

448
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,481
Lynne, how are you?

449
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,817
Okay, fine, I guess.

450
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,319
W-What are you doing
here in D.C.?

451
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,221
Prescreening more girls
for the prince's harem.

452
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:50,656
He gets in tomorrow.

453
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,391
12:00 noon appointment.

454
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,227
What's the code red?

455
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:58,399
So, there I am,
five days ago, in Cypress

456
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,401
on Prince Farid Bin Abbud's
yacht...

457
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:02,603
(panting)

458
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:05,539
when the Prince's Majordomo,
Latif Bin Walid,

459
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:09,376
<i>announces that the prince</i>
<i>has a surprise visitor.</i>

460
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:12,379
So, this surprise visitor,
who was he?

461
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,748
You know that they stone
women like me to death

462
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:18,751
<i>if we get caught doing anything</i>
<i>that we're not supposed to?</i>

463
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,260
(sighs)

464
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:30,228
(men speaking Arabic)

465
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,269
Abu Nazir.

466
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,237
I was this far from him.

467
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,309
I really don't want to do this
anymore, and I mean it, Carrie.

468
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,945
I feel like I can't
even breathe now.

469
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:49,980
They're gonna
suspect something.

470
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,650
Lynne, all you have to do now
is keep your eyes and ears open

471
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,886
for the remainder of
your contract with the prince.

472
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,887
That's what you said when
you recruited me in Bahrain,

473
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:59,756
but I never thought that
I would get eight feet

474
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,224
from the most dangerous
terrorist in the world.

475
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,992
You are the only agency asset

476
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,328
to have had eyes on Nazir
in seven years.

477
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,663
Asset?

478
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,731
I am just some girl
from Sandusky, Ohio,

479
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,900
who you talked into
helping out her country.

480
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:12,869
And I won't let
anything happen to you.

481
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:17,273
Don't quit on me now, please.
You can't.

482
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:20,310
Don't think I don't
appreciate what it took

483
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,878
for you to do this, Lynne.

484
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:28,985
(over phone):
Saul Berenson.

485
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,186
Alert the group, Saul.

486
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:31,287
Inform Estes.

487
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:32,755
This is a game-changer.

488
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,090
Can't be more specific?

489
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,958
I don't want to talk
on an open line.

490
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,326
Source protection?

491
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:40,963
It's way past
source protection, Saul.

492
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,432
I've got a visual confirm
on the Sandman.

493
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,133
What?
CARRIE: You heard me.

494
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:47,369
Actual eyes on.

495
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:48,937
How far away are you?

496
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,205
20 minutes.

497
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:52,174
I'll assemble the group.

498
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:08,023
What are you doing here?

499
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,324
Have to talk to Brody.

500
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:10,492
Hey, bud.

501
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,328
What's up?

502
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:13,729
My dad beat the crap
out of somebody.

503
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:15,030
Dana, I asked you to please

504
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:16,532
watch TV with Chris for a while.

505
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,699
She went to her room.

506
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,234
Beat the crap out of who?

507
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:20,835
Can you please go watch TV
for a little while?

508
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,170
I need to talk to Uncle Mike.

509
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:24,072
Can you do that for me?

510
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,573
Yeah.
Okay.

511
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,241
Come in.

512
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:33,681
What's going on?

513
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:35,415
Why aren't the kids at school?

514
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:36,750
You don't know? Isn't
that why you're here?

515
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:37,851
No. What?

516
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,653
Are you okay?

517
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,322
Brody hit a reporter and then
he took off into the woods.

518
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,524
Chris saw the whole thing.

519
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:46,094
Take a breath, Jess.
Come here.

520
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:48,196
Well, hello, Mrs. Brody.

521
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:50,199
MIKE:
When was this?

522
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,900
JESSICA:
About an hour ago, maybe more.

523
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,904
Why didn't you call me
right away, Jess?

524
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:56,373
What the hell is that?

525
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,941
He has nightmares.

526
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,577
Brody did that?

527
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,412
Or flashbacks,
whatever you call them.

528
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,283
I have to make it work
with Brody. I have to.

529
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,553
This is where he tells you
everything's gonna be okay.

530
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,422
It's gonna be okay, Jess.

531
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,891
JESSICA:
Is it really?

532
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,392
Do you honestly think so?

533
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,395
Ugh.

534
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,097
That's disgusting, Carrie.

535
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:24,468
This is the first
confirmed sighting

536
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:25,736
of Abu Nazir in seven years.

537
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,038
And very much to your credit.

538
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,473
Nobody's arguing with that.

539
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,309
But it's not enough
to authorize a task force.

540
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,910
I'm not asking for that.

541
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,280
All I need is a few more bodies
on Sergeant Brody.

542
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:36,783
(sighs) Look, the
circle's small.

543
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:39,086
We keep it that way
till you have more than

544
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,288
just a theory
linking Brody and Abu Nazir.

545
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:43,324
So Abu Nazir's
resurfacing just as

546
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,293
Brody has miraculously
returned home means nothing?

547
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,128
It's just a coincidence?

548
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:50,331
The dots are there, Carrie, but
you haven't connected them yet.

549
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,967
Saul, I understand that
you're still furious with me,

550
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,103
but give me
something here, please.

551
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,271
(sighs)

552
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:57,772
I'm not telling you to stop.

553
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,274
I'm telling you to slow down.

554
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,810
The FISA warrant--

555
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:03,812
that gives you four weeks.

556
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,514
Use it.

557
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:08,450
Carefully, methodically.

558
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:11,320
Look, like it or not, you work
for Deputy Director David Estes,

559
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:13,589
who has career stakes in Brody,

560
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:17,527
whom he and his department
brought home to great fanfare.

561
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:20,163
Want to challenge that,

562
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:23,366
better be damn sure you get
all your ducks in a row first.

563
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:25,769
(sighs)

564
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:28,771
(phone beeps on)

565
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:31,707
Where is he now?

566
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:33,008
I don't know.

567
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:34,943
What do you mean you don't know?

568
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:36,177
He can't have gone far.

569
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:37,812
Listen to me, if Brody has

570
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,315
one 15-second meeting
with one contact,

571
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:41,516
that's all it'll take.

572
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,950
I'm not gonna miss that.

573
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:45,019
Find him and find him fast.

574
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:46,121
Call me back.

575
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:47,656
ESTES:
...last 14 days of

576
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:49,324
air traffic data
from all airports--

577
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:50,392
commercial, cargo.

578
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,196
And the banks.

579
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:56,734
All new patterns and numerical
transactions of any amounts.

580
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,836
Please. Thank you.

581
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:01,005
Let me be the first to say,
Carrie, outstanding work.

582
00:30:01,073 --> 00:30:03,674
All other files on your
desk go on the back burner,

583
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:05,476
as of right now.

584
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:08,012
I want your girl on this prince
Farid like white on rice.

585
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,479
Mike.

586
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,880
First thing you get her to do

587
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:12,715
is upload the data
on his BlackBerry.

588
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:13,983
She's scared out of her mind.

589
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:15,352
Thank you.

590
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,187
I need to be able
to guarantee her protection.

591
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:18,321
Backup.

592
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:20,056
Would a four-man
fire team do it?

593
00:30:21,158 --> 00:30:23,226
Great.

594
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:26,763
For an escort you
recruited in Bahrain?

595
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,698
Don't be a prick, David.

596
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,700
You know damn well if we
put a Quick Reaction Team

597
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:32,368
on the girl in this
short time frame,

598
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:34,370
we have no idea of
knowing who's watching.

599
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:36,706
If Abu Nazir even smells we're
onto the prince, he'll vanish.

600
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:38,274
Into thin air, again.

601
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:40,209
It's the QRT's job
not to be detected.

602
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:41,845
You're saying
you can't trust those guys

603
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:43,346
to protect an asset in danger?

604
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:45,349
It's my job to make the
tough calls, Carrie.

605
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:46,617
The answer is no.

606
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:48,185
Your job is to
control your asset.

607
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:49,820
She needs backup,
you're it. Get it done.

608
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:54,692
Yes, sir.

609
00:30:58,198 --> 00:30:59,698
(P.A. beeps)

610
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:01,233
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Will someone in Lighting

611
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,301
please pick up line three?

612
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,637
Lighting, line three, please?

613
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:17,314
(cell phone ringing)

614
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:19,316
Please let this be good news.

615
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:20,951
He's looking at everything.

616
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:24,422
Lumber, nails, screws,

617
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:25,790
electrical wiring,

618
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:27,158
power tools, you name it.

619
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:28,593
Is he taking notes or anything?

620
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,896
Whatever he's doing, looks like

621
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:32,197
he's doing it all in his head.

622
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,002
Okay, he's on the move.

623
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,938
I'll, uh, I'll call you back.

624
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:39,306
What?

625
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:59,026
JESSICA: I guess we
might as well eat.

626
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:01,128
Is Dad still AWOL?

627
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:03,797
MIKE: Oh, he'll be back,
don't you worry.

628
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:05,799
Hey.
Hey.

629
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,135
Any new developments?

630
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:10,437
I'm telling you,
this guy's got to be wishing

631
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:13,674
that Brody doesn't come back
so he can keep doing the wife.

632
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:15,676
She thought
breaking up was easy.

633
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,448
Any popcorn in there?

634
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:25,286
Well, as a matter
of fact, we have...

635
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,154
pretzels.

636
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:30,023
I love-a da pretzels.

637
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,826
Uncle Mike,
since you're a captain

638
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:35,694
and Dad's only a sergeant, does
that make you the boss of him?

639
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:38,196
Smells delicious.

640
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:40,966
CHRIS: Don't sergeants have
to salute to the captain

641
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,133
and call him sir?

642
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,704
It's Irish stew!

643
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:47,072
Dad's favorite.

644
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,173
Right, Mom?

645
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:50,909
Is Dad in trouble?

646
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:52,978
Trouble? No, no.

647
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:56,048
Like I told you earlier, bud,

648
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:57,416
that reporter out there,
he's the one

649
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:58,783
who should be in trouble,
all right?

650
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:06,324
Wait, there's no
camera in the garage?

651
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:09,193

Yeah.
Huh?

00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,873
This man brought
snakes and lizards

815
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:13,041
and turtles and everything.

816
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:14,242
A snake ate a rat.

817
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,610
Ugh!

818
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:19,314
I missed that? Damn!

819
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:20,782
I forgot your birthday.

820
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:22,116
I'm sorry, Ruby.

821
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:23,384
Oh, but there...

822
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:25,886
is this.

823
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:27,588
(laughs)

824
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,223
I told you, Ruby.

825
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:32,660
You thought I'd forget something
as important as that?

826
00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:34,429
I was working
last Saturday, honey.

827
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:35,664
If I could've come, I would've.

828
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:38,000
I promise.

829
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:41,270
Mom! Mom! Look what Aunt Carrie
got Ruby for her birthday!

830
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:43,239
Wow, that is so cool!

831
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:44,273
Did you say thank you?

832
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:45,274
Thank you.

833
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,609
You're welcome, honey.

834
00:42:46,676 --> 00:42:47,776
Okay, now, you two monkeys.

835
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:49,011
Come on in
and finish your homework.

836
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,213
You can see Aunt Carrie
when you're done.

837
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:56,018
That's impressive!

838
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:57,319
I beat them.

839
00:42:57,387 --> 00:42:58,587
Don't tell the neighbors.

840
00:42:58,654 --> 00:42:59,588
Come on in.

841
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:04,325
Staying for dinner?

842
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:06,294
I can't. I'd--

843
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:08,930
--love to, but you're
slammed as usual.

844
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:10,799
Maggie...
No, don't.

845
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:12,668
You don't have to explain.

846
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,938
(sighs)

847
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:17,840
We worry about you, Dad and I.

848
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:19,675
Yeah.

849
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,344
How's he doing?

850
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:24,280
Considering he has the
same illness you have...

851
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:26,949
Well, now he's under my roof,

852
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:29,785
he goes for regular therapy and
treatment-- that's the deal.

853
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:32,621
So, um... he's good.

854
00:43:33,723 --> 00:43:35,123
Are you finished?

855
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:38,025
Come on, Maggie, ease up a bit.

856
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:40,061
Just once, give me a break.

857
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:47,901
Only seven this time?

858
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:50,471
Raiding my samples cupboard
not only enables you,

859
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:56,010
it jeopardizes my license,
so, uh... seven pills.

860
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:58,913
And we talk again in
a week, not a month.

861
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,581
Or you could just
deal with the problem

862
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:02,650
like any normal person would
and go see a psychiatrist.

863
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:04,852
I keep telling you
to work where I work.

864
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,053
You can't disclose your illness

865
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:07,855
or they'll pull
your security clearance.

866
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:09,323
I understand, Carrie.

867
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:11,726
I'm really good
at what I do, Maggie.

868
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,794
And I'm not just a quack.

869
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:19,200
Dad'll be pissed he missed you.

870
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:21,202
Where is he?

871
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,071
Bill took the day off.
They went golfing.

872
00:44:26,074 --> 00:44:27,909
You said you were
coming tonight.

873
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:29,444
It's not even 6:00 yet.

874
00:44:34,182 --> 00:44:35,950
Next time.

875
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:36,984
Okay.

876
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:39,454
I'll go say good-bye
to the girls.

877
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:51,533
Hello?

878
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:56,071
Please answer.
