1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:03,487
(man):<i>This killer doesn't</i>
<i>think like anyone else, Jack.</i>

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,603
<i>You'll have to find someone who doesn't
think like anyone else to catch him.</i>

3
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:09,727
- There's no evidence I did it.
- Let him go.

4
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:12,193
- You're making a mistake, Jack.
- I know what it's like

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,214
to point at a killer
and have no one listen.

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,836
You pointed in
the wrong direction.

7
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:18,718
Don't lie to me, Dr. Lecter.

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,721
- I believe my brother won't stop.
- If you really want to kill

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,425
your brother, Margot, wait until you can get
away with it or find someone to do it for you.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,260
You're Hannibal
Lecter therapist.

11
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,330
(whispering): I believe you.

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,201
(Hannibal): Which answer is it
you want to hear, Will?

13
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,269
What's happening now

14
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:39,839
and about to happen
is an answer.

15
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,978
I want an admission.

16
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,148
I want you to admit
what you are.

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,517
Must I denounce myself
as a monster

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,954
while you still refuse to see
the one growing inside you?

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,229
(He whistles.)

20
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,538
Why not appeal
to my better nature?

21
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,873
I wasn't aware you had one.

22
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,209
No one can be fully aware

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,478
of another human being
unless we love them.

24
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,284
By that love we see potential
in our beloved.

25
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,254
Through that love,
we allow our beloved

26
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,388
to see their potential.

27
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,332
Expressing that love,

28
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,302
our beloved's potential
comes true.

29
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,039
(He whistles.)

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

31
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,790
I promised you a reckoning.

32
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:12,129
Here it is.

33
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,042
(panting)

34
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:07,950
Mmm, that smells wonderful.

35
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,321
Sacromonte omelet
with liver and sweetbreads.

36
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:17,793
Sacromonte was
the gypsy hood of Granada.

37
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:21,095
I visited Granada
when I was a young man.

38
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,534
- I've never been.
- No?

39
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:29,971
I fell in love with many things,
in particular, this dish.

40
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,576
I remember my time there
so vividly,

41
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,844
like I frescoed
the walls of my mind.

42
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,616
I used to be afraid
of losing my memory.

43
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,585
What I wouldn't give to forget
a thing or two now.

44
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:50,024
Mmm...

45
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,260
My compliments
to the gypsy hood of Granada.

46
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:54,262
Memory gives moments

47
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:58,399
immortality, but forgetfulness
promotes a healthy mind.

48
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,367
It's good to forget.

49
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,505
What are you trying
to forget, Jack?

50
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:06,507
Doubt.

51
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,142
I let doubt in.

52
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:11,612
About me?

53
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:13,714
About Will.

54
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,954
I can no longer discuss
Will's state of mind with you

55
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,024
or anyone else
without his consent.

56
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:28,128
Will's officially my patient.
He employs me now, not the FBI.

57
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:31,799
Well, let's hope
your therapy works.

58
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,701
Therapy only works when
we have a genuine desire

59
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,136
to know ourselves as we are,

60
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,339
not as we would like to be.

61
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,596
(banging)

62
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,298
(roaring)
(man screaming)

63
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,649
(theme music)

64

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

65
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:59,456
Ah.

66
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:16,005
(man gasping and sobbing)

67
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:24,608
Do you have any regrets?

68
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:27,545
With every choice lies
the possibility of regret.

69
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,607
However, if I choose
not to do something,

70
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,666
it's usually for a good reason.

71
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:37,654
I'm...

72
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,856
riddled with regrets.

73
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:45,896
A life without regret
would be no life at all.

74
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,336
I regret what I did
in the stable.

75
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,707
Then, you were lucky
I was there.

76
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,912
Oh, no, no, no.

77
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:04,279
Being lucky

78
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:07,616
isn't the same
as making a mistake.

79
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:14,056
The mistake was allowing you

80
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,058
to stop me.

81
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:19,328
So, it's not pulling
the trigger that you regret...

82
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:24,066
...it's not pulling it
effectively.

83
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:30,106
That would be more accurate.

84
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,009
You must adapt your behaviour

85
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,879
to avoid feeling
the same way again, Will.

86
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:40,449
Adapt.

87
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:45,454
Evolve.

88
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:50,091
Become.

89
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,663
Yes.

90
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,869
I want you to close your eyes.

91
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,838
Imagine a version of events
you wouldn't have regretted.

92
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:30,431
What did you see?

93
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:36,103
A missed opportunity...

94
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:39,740
to feel...

95
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:43,777
like I felt when I killed
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

96
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:48,948
To feel like...

97
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:54,287
...like I felt when I thought
I'd killed you.

98
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:01,160
And what does that feel like?

99
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,896
I felt...

100
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,704
...a quiet sense...

101
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:12,706
of...

102
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,474
power.

103
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,377
Good.

104
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,882
Remember that feeling.

105
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:29,421
I tend to walk out
of this building

106
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,690
in a very similar state.

107
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:33,659
You must be a patient
of Dr. Lecter's.

108
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:35,694
I'm sorry?

109
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:37,730
You look familiar.

110
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,732
I either know you

111
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,734
or I know of you.

112
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,135
I'm the guy who didn't
kill all those people.

113
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,681
We all have a gauge
for humanity that twitches

114
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:58,816
when we see other people.

115
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,489
Tell me, Margot, what twitches
when you see your brother?

116
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:06,924
Not my gauge for humanity.

117
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,697
You don't recognize in
your brother basic human traits.

118
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:15,699
You dehumanize him

119
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,335
as much as he dehumanizes you.

120
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,372
At least, I'll never be
the worst person I know.

121
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,911
The tendency to see others as less
human than ourselves is universal.

122
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:29,546
My brother is less human.

123
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,782
And you are less human for it.

124
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,551
Did you just dehumanize me?

125
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:36,686
Psychiatrists

126
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,522
who dehumanize patients
are more comfortable

127
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,425
with painful
but effective treatments.

128
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,896
I met a patient of yours.
Will Graham.

129
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,467
Wonder what sort of painful
but effective treatment

130
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,102
you prescribed him?

131
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,204
What do you imagine?

132
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,875
You're very supportive
of me killing my brother.

133
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,545
And I appreciate that support,

134
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,580
I really do.

135
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,916
But I can only imagine
what you'd be supportive

136
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,117
of Will Graham doing.

137
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:11,688
What kind of
psychiatrist are you?

138
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:15,058
You already had my reputation
and bona fides verified.

139
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,827
You know what kind
of psychiatrist I am.

140
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,698
I'm beginning to.

141
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,944
(camera clicking)

142
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,917
Since when the FBI

143
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:43,786
get involved
in animal attacks, Jack?

144
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,254
When there's somebody
holding the leash

145
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,256
of whatever it is
that's doing the killing.

146
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,827
Esophagus is destroyed. The
bite almost severed his head!

147
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:55,531
Whatever it was, it's not
afraid of humans. Not anymore.

148
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,633
So I'm thinking
a bear or a wolf.

149
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,702
Wolves or bears don't eat
where they kill.

150
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,836
It'd have dragged him off.

151
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,911
There's no eating here.
We're gonna find everything.

152
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,741
The viscera's exposed,
the belly's laid bare,

153
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,711
but there's no sign
of rutting or gnawing, Jack.

154
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:13,181
A rabid animal attacks victims at random
and doesn't eat any part of them.

155
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:14,983
Found the same wound patterns

156
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,918
on a series of
livestock mutilations

157
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:18,853
in the area. Evisceration,

158
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:21,688
dismemberment,
yet everything accounted for.

159
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:24,158
Livestock mutilations...

160
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,160
that was practice?

161
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:29,397
He's going to kill again.
He's gonna get better at it.

162
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:32,233
And he's urbanizing his animal,

163
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:35,436
moving it closer to the city...

164
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,173
adapting it for bigger prey.

165
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:41,409
And he's not denying
its natural instincts,

166
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,644
he's evolving them.

167
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:47,164
It's blood sport.

168
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,244
A wolf or a bear?

169
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,513
Oh...
(laughing)

170
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:13,348
Hey, hey, this is

171
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:15,250
K-Kevin. Uh,

172
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:17,218
try not to stare.

173
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,954
They'll... Or they'll
take him away from me.

174
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:22,924
Oh, sorry.

175
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,893
It's OK.

176
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:35,636
Bear. Wolf.

177
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:39,473
Do bears and wolves
hunt together?

178
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:41,587
Um, I mean, you could
you could train, train a bear

179
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,111
to be a wolf,
or a wolf to be a bear.

180
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:47,647
Train, train them long enough,
and they will hunt together,

181
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:50,417
feed together.

182
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:51,985
Hmm... OK.

183
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,723
En-enough-enough

184
00:14:56,757 --> 00:15:00,461
time, there's,
there's a great deal

185
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:03,830
I could train even you
to do, Will.

186
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:09,336
Hm.

187
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:14,140
That kind of friendship can

188
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,142
keep you on your toes.

189
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,277
Haha!

190
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,616
Animals, they, they do have...

191
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,652
they have friendships
just-just like us.

192
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:32,892
We're the same.

193
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:41,867
Yeah, I'll try to remember that.

194
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:45,538
Please, don't-don't
blame-blame the animals.

195
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,141
- No.
- Don't.

196
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,243
Man is the only creature

197
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:53,479
that kills to... kill.

198
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:07,359
(metallic clapping)

199
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,066
(stapling)

200
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,669
(buzzing)

201
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,781
(woman): Oh, God!

202
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,717
(indistinct talking)
(soft music playing)

203
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,252
(woman laughing)

204
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:14,225
(loud breathing)

205
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:18,195
(servo-motor sound)

206
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,564
(footsteps)

207
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,274
Argh!

208
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:35,645
(screaming)
(servo-motor sounds)

209
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:46,381
(deep breath)

210
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,191
(heartbeat)

211
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,926
(woman laughing)

212
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:55,314
Kill.

213
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:02,654
Ah!
(screaming)

214
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:22,775
It's not an animal.

215
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,878
It's a man who wants
to be an animal.

216
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:32,650
(Jack sighs.)

217
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:34,652
Does he believe he's an animal?

218
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:37,088
It's not what he believes;
it's what he imagines.

219
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:39,657
(Jack): Well,
what does he want?

220
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,960
He wants to maul.

221
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:47,932
Nothing personal about this.

222
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,168
He doesn't know them.
He doesn't need to know them.

223
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:53,638
They're just...

224
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:55,640
meat to him.

225
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:57,642
Prey.

226
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,044
This kind of psychosis

227
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,112
doesn't just slip
through the system.

228
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:05,049
Somewhere, someone
would have noticed this.

229
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,051
If it is psychosis,

230
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:09,186
he got inside of it somehow,

231
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,688
tamed it,

232
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:15,426
made a suit out of it.

233
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,995
He's an engineer...

234
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,397
or he understands engineering.

235
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,869
He knows how to build.

236
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,505
He built his beast.

237
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,207
He is a student of predators.

238
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,403
(Hannibal): "No beast
is more savage than man

239
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:53,440
when possessed with power
answerable to his own rage."

240
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,442
It's not rage.

241
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:58,244
Rage is an emotional response

242
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,814
to being provoked.
This is something else.

243
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,984
What is it?

244
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,019
Instinct.

245
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:10,691
- It's the way he thinks.
- The way any animal thinks

246
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:14,327
depends on limitations
of mind and body.

247
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:18,264
If we learn
our limitations too soon,

248
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,833
we never learn our power.

249
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:24,504
His victims are torn apart;
I'd say he learned his power.

250
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,040
He claimed his power.

251
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:30,410
Can you imagine
tearing someone apart?

252
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:35,315
Or would you prefer
to use a gun?

253
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:38,518
Guns lack intimacy.

254
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:41,187
You set an event in motion

255
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:43,189
with a gun;
you don't complete it.

256
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,592
You fantasized about killing me

257
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:47,727
with your hands.

258
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,630
Wouldn't that be more satisfying
than pulling a trigger?

259
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,768
Yes.

260
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,641
When you sent
the man to kill me,

261
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:05,011
were you imagining
killing me yourself?

262
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:08,114
Living vicariously
through him as if...

263
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:12,251
your hands tightened
the noose around my neck?

264
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:14,820
Or were you simply hiding?

265
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,791
I wasn't hiding from
anything the first time

266
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:23,495
- I tried to kill you.
- You were hiding...

267
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,698
behind the gun.

268
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:36,007
You must allow yourself to be
intimate with your instincts, Will.

269
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:45,450
The closest comparative
bite radius we could match

270
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:47,786
to the victims' wounds
is a cave bear.

271
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,054
Even the dire wolf,
which is the largest species

272
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:52,456
of the genus Canis,
is itty-bitty by comparison.

273
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,425
But a cave bear did not do this.

274
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,527
Mostly because
they're vegetarian,

275
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,563
and have been extinct
for 28,000 years.

276
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:02,366
Mostly because the bite force
relative to the skull size

277
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,569
doesn't match the kind of damage
we've been seeing.

278
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:06,270
What could?

279
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,605
Pull-ratchets
and pneumatics, maybe.

280
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:11,675
Pretty sophisticated ingenuity
for any kind of animal,

281
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,810
- man or beast.
- Animals are far more

282
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,813
like humans than
we ever realized.

283
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:19,082
And humans are far more
like animals.

284
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:21,150
One thin barrier between us.

285
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:25,188
And for some,
that barrier is way too thin.

286
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:28,925
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

287
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:32,761
How does something
like this present?

288
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:35,864
Someone affected by this kind
of species dysphoria

289
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:38,300
typically has other conditions.

290
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:40,336
Mood disorders,

291
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,504
clinical depression,

292
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,274
- schizophrenia.
- Typically?

293
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:48,110
They may not present at all.

294
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:49,978
Your killer could have
built a bridge between

295
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:52,615
who he appears to be and
what he now knows he's become.

296
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:54,450
He didn't build
a bridge, Doctor...

297
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:57,119
he built a suit.

298
00:24:57,153 --> 00:25:00,222
What he seeks is transformation.

299
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:05,260
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

300
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:15,570
This threatens
to be a violation of

301
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:18,439
doctor-patient confidentiality,
so I will thread carefully.

302
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:20,776
You've seen something like this?

303
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,944
Years ago, I treated a patient
who fits the profile.

304
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:26,480
A teenage boy who suffered

305
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,449
from what I would describe
as an identity disorder.

306
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:33,120
This boy fancied
himself a beast?

307
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:37,357
During our therapy,
he reported a moment of clarity.

308
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:39,860
He understood in that moment,
he was an animal

309
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:43,864
born in the body of a man.

310
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:45,866
He kept a solitary life.

311
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:49,670
He would hide and behave in ways
resembling animal behaviour.

312
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:52,371
- He was delusional.
- Not necessarily.

313
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,640
He didn't believe metamorphosis

314
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,676
could physically take place,

315
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,790
but that wouldn't stop him
from trying to achieve it.

316
00:26:00,714 --> 00:26:03,149
He'd be a grown man now?

317
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:07,086
And as he grew
in wisdom and confidence,

318
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:10,156
he would no longer feel he had
to meet his needs in hiding.

319
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:12,826
What are his needs,
Dr. Lecter?

320
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,662
Savagery.

321
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,441
(footsteps)

322
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:34,046
Museum's closed.

323
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:47,124
Hello, Randall.

324
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:51,963
Dr. Lecter.

325
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:56,734
You will always be ruled

326
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:59,370
by your fascination with teeth.

327
00:27:01,673 --> 00:27:04,175
That's what you said to me
when they brought in your office

328
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,210
the very first time.

329
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:09,079
Is that what I said?

330
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:11,081
Yeah.

331
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:14,384
I was crying.

332
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:17,988
I was dreading telling you
what was wrong with me and...

333
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:21,457
you made it easier.

334
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:25,161
Other visits too.

335
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:30,767
A therapist's life is equal
parts counsel and curiosity.

336
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,771
We set a patient on a path,

337
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,773
but are left to wonder
where that path

338
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:39,409
will take them.

339
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:44,280
You've come
so very far, Randall.

340
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:49,419
A long time
since you treated me.

341
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:53,389
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you

342
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,425
about your wonderful progress,

343
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:58,293
just for a moment, privately.

344
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:04,833
I've seen what you've done.

345
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,404
What have I done?

346
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:13,408
You bore screams...

347
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:17,345
like a sculptor bears dust
from the beaten stone.

348
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,919
That crying boy doesn't
cling to you anymore.

349
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,156
What clings to you now?

350
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:33,160
What clings to your teeth?

351
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,399
Ragged bits of scalp...

352
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:46,073
...trailing their tails of hair
like comets.

353
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,177
Beautiful.

354
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,548
They are looking for you.

355
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:58,285
I don't think I can stop.

356
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,720
I don't want you to.

357
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:02,922
But they will find you, Randall.

358
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:07,361
When they do,

359
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:10,397
it's important you do
exactly what I say.

360
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:30,214
You wanted to speak to me?

361
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:31,834
Ah, Randall Tier.

362
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:34,218
Special Agent Jack
Crawford with the FBI.

363
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:36,108
This is Will Graham.

364
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:39,818
Uh... did you...
put all that together?

365
00:29:40,163 --> 00:29:43,665
- Yes, I did.
- Nice work.

366
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,370
What is that?

367
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:50,772
That is a cave bear.

368
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:52,648
You put together
a lot of cave bears, do you?

369
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:55,944
Yeah. I put them together, take them
apart, put them back together again.

370
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:58,546
You understand their mechanics
and how they're engineered?

371
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:01,549
We understand a lot about
cave bears. Their fossils

372
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:05,153
have been found in the tens of thousands,
all over southern Europe. Very common.

373
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:08,189
The reason I ask is because a...

374
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,326
a cave bear skull

375
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,528
was used recently
as a murder weapon.

376
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,563
Prehistoric jaws and claws

377
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,565
are designed to do
what they do best.

378
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,702
The victims were torn apart.

379
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,905
Used the right tool for the job.

380
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,974
Well, look inside the skull

381
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,576
and you'll find what the job is.

382
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:33,180
You have a history of trouble
with things inside your head.

383
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,215
Isn't that right, Mr. Tier?

384
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,687
Is that what this is about?

385
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,791
You think I killed
someone with a fossil?

386
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,264
I had an identity disorder.

387
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,732
The doctors told me
the internal map

388
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,235
of my body didn't match reality.

389
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,271
Do you know what it's like

390
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,273
when the skin you're wearing
doesn't fit?

391
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:03,943
- I can imagine.
- I know who I am now.

392
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:07,214
And I'm doing much better.

393
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:10,184
I'm socializing.
I take my medication.

394
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:12,452
I'm employed. And I work

395
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:15,355
very hard.

396
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,490
And I'm proof that
mental illness is treatable.

397
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:27,333
(dogs barking)

398
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:36,809
Shh, shh.
(dogs stop barking)

399
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:39,277
Hi.

400
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:41,079
I don't know if you remember me,

401
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:43,915
but I met you outside
of Dr. Lecter's office.

402
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,984
I remember it.
How did you find me?

403
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:50,322
Well, as it turns out,
you are famous.

404
00:31:50,356 --> 00:31:52,257
Uh...

405
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,627
You're not exactly anonymous
yourself, Margot.

406
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:58,162
Did you, uh, sneak a peek
inside Dr. Lecter's calendar?

407
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,800
Yeah, it is exactly what I did.

408
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:09,641
It's cold.
Do you have any whiskey?

409
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:19,751
What is the heir to the Verger
Meat Packing dynasty

410
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:22,286
doing at my door?

411
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,321
Oh, my brother is the heir,

412
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,523
not me.

413
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,861
I have the wrong parts and
the wrong proclivity for parts.

414
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,035
You didn't answer my question.

415
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,338
Came for a character reference.

416
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:44,508
Patient to patient.

417
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:47,077
What do you think
of Dr. Lecter's therapy?

418
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,848
It depends what
you're in therapy for.

419
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:55,286
Oh, I'm in therapy
for all kinds of reasons.

420
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,121
The Vergers slaughter
86,000 cattle a day

421
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:00,123
and 36,000 pigs,

422
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:02,926
depending on the season,

423
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,128
but that's just
the public carnage.

424
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:09,132
What's your private carnage?

425
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,869
I tried to kill my brother.

426
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:18,508
Well, I assume he had it coming.

427
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:24,047
Did he ever.

428
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:29,786
What's your private carnage?

429
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,260
I tried to murder Dr. Lecter.

430
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,130
Did he have it coming?

431
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,903
What do you think?

432
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:51,006
I can't say that I know.

433
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,009
Neither can I.

434
00:33:54,044 --> 00:33:59,014
We have some
very similar issues.

435
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:02,218
Although I doubt
that Dr. Lecter

436
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:05,120
gave you the same advice
on murder that he gave me.

437
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:07,789
And what's that?

438
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:10,191
He said...

439
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:12,193
"If at first you don't succeed,

440
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:14,596
try, try again."

441
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,510
I'm curious what would happen

442
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:31,780
if your patients started
comparing notes, Dr. Lecter.

443
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:36,751
What would Randall Tier
have to say to me?

444
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:39,720
What did Randall Tier
say to you?

445
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:43,224
He said he was much better now,

446
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:45,493
that mental illness
was treatable.

447
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,429
Randall Tier is a success story.

448
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,498
You believe he's innocent?

449
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:53,201
I believe...

450
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:56,271
your therapy was successful.

451
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:59,540
You can be persuasive.

452
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:05,946
How many have there been?

453
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,082
Like Randall Tier?

454
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:11,651
Like me?

455
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,655
Every patient is unique.

456
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:22,695
Your psychiatrist came
to visit me

457
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,465
at the hospital before my trial.

458
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,702
Dr. Du Maurier.

459
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,972
She told me she believed me.

460
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,378
She knew there were
others like me.

461
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:41,380
Fascinating.

462
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:44,050
Did you kill her?

463
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:46,385
No.

464
00:35:55,429 --> 00:35:59,164
What do you think about
when you think about killing?

465
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:07,405
I think about God.

466
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,109
Good and evil?

467
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:14,612
Good and evil has
nothing to do with God.

468
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:19,484
I collect church collapses.

469
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:22,053
Did you see the recent one
in Sicily?

470
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,691
The facade fell
on 65 grandmothers

471
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:28,893
during a special mass.

472
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:34,698
Was that evil? Was that God?

473
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,668
If he's up there,

474
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:40,737
he just loves it.

475
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,242
Typhoid and swans,

476
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,444
it all comes
from the same place.

477
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,918
Does Randall Tier
believe in God?

478
00:36:58,123 --> 00:37:00,789
Perhaps you should have
a more personal conversation

479
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:04,293
with Mr. Tier
and ask him what he believes.

480
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:34,727
The solitude of what you do
is to be respected,

481
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:36,607
and I intend to honour that.

482
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,854
I've only come to offer
words of encouragement.

483
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:45,493
You are becoming, Randall,

484
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:48,029
and this beast
is your higher self.

485
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:50,465
Your bodies, voices,

486
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:52,500
and wills are one.

487
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:57,138
Revel in what you are.

488
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:11,251
(dogs barking)

489
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:21,161
(dog yelping)

490
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:23,897
Hey!
