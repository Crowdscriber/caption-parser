00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,880
There is a place
not far from here

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,040
where you could be
feared and respected.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,360
Eight men who support Hamund.
You said it yourself.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,720
<i>We kill him, they all become threats</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,880
<i>They disappear</i>
<i>all at once tonight.</i>

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,200
Between you and Flint, I'm not certain
who I should be more afraid of.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,960
- Leave with me. - I've spent my life
trying to build something here.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
What if I forgo payment
for the schedule

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
in exchange for my share
of the prize?

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,960
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,240
I will be right by your side.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,520
It wasn't Singleton
that stole the page.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,360
- <i>It was him.</i>
- You're lying to them.

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,640
If no one knows, everyone wins.

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,760
I believe in this place.
If there's anyone who can do

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
what's necessary to make it
something better, it's you.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,680
Once we have the money,
Flint dies.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,520
- No argument.
- Not from me.

20

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,520
<i>Ca va?</i>

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,600
Mr. Rackham,
a word.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,080
I've been expecting you,
please Sit.

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
Won't you tell me what you
think of our little production?

25
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,000
The theme is
"Evenings in Paris."

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,480
I'll give you three
guesses whose idea it was.

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,480
Mr. Rackham,
I just saw the bursar.

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,120
He says I'm no longer
to receive my distribution

29
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,360
of the house's profits.
Your instruction?

30
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,560
Yes, I did some rough calculations
to figure the amount

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
you've been skimming from the take
since we first began this arrangement.

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
It only seems fair to garnish
your proceeds to account for it.

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
Mr. Rackham, I understand
your new friend

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
has helped to bring
the girls into line,

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,800
<i>has them reporting their
income in a most honest fashion.</i>

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
<i>That must be very nice for you.</i>

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,280
But let us get something
very straight.

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm not one of the girls.

39
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,600
I will have my cut

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,960
or everyone in this street will know
what became of Mr. Noonan.

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,840
- You would do that?
- Don't you dare doubt it.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,960
Well, Mrs. Mapleton, that sounds
like gross insubordination to me.

43
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,240
That, coupled with the graft
you've been responsible for,

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,840
leaves me with no choice but to terminate
your employment here.

45
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,240
- What?
- You're dismissed.

46
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you for your service.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
Pardon me, but have you
lost your mind?

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,880
Not that I'm aware of, no.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,480
I just told you
that I am fully willing

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,640
to inform every
merchant in Nassau

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,840
that you murdered your way
into ownership of this place.

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,480
They will band together
to see you hanged.

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,840
Which ones exactly?

54
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,760
<i>Which merchants will see</i>
<i>Mr. Rackham hanged?</i>

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,120
Mr. Connors
the wheelwright?

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Or perhaps Mr. Peterson
the butcher.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
Maybe Mr. Rusch
the lapidary?

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,360
<i>They all have enjoyed</i>
<i>steep discounts here lately.</i>

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,240
Affordable now that the books are
in good order.

60
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,760
I wonder, given their fondness
for the new management,

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,600
which one of them would much care
what you think happened to Mr. Noonan?

62
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,280
You forgot the only name
that matters, dear.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
The lady across the street.
She finds out about this...

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,440
Oh, Madam Guthrie knows.
She's fine with it.

65
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,440
But by all means, go ahead, tell
her again. I can't see any harm in it.

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,440
You will regret this, <i>sir.</i>

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm sure I won't.
Au revoir.

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Please don't judge me,
but I really enjoyed that.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,160
You do not believe she will
attempt to strike back at you?

70
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
I wouldn't put it past her.

71
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,280
But at the moment I'll live with
the potential for future trouble

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,960
over the certainty of actual
trouble she was causing.

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,320
To a profitable venture.

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,040
And a partner significantly
more pleasing to the eye.

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,240
What am I supposed
to do with this?

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,760
If he's to continue on the ship, the crutch
is too much of an impediment.

77
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,360
<i>He shall have to wear this</i>
<i>whether he likes it or not.</i>

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,480
Come on, Randall.

79
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,480
Dr. Howell made this
'specially for you.

80
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,880
<i>Help you move around better.</i>

81
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,320
Perhaps you'll even be able to visit the shitter
once in a while without needing my help.

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
Whoa, easy there.

83
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,240
You're responsible for him.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,960
You figure it out.

85
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,120
"Oh, Mr. Silver.

86
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,440
How can I ever thank you?

87
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,600
<i>First you save me from ending up as
a stain on the Walrus's underside.</i>

88
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
<i>Then you secured</i>
<i>my position on the crew</i>

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
<i>on the verge</i>
<i>of an historic haul.</i>

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
And if that weren't enough,

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,720
you're still trying to find
something comfortable

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,120
to put at the end of my stump.

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,520
<i>From the bottom</i>
<i>of my heart, thank you."</i>

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,760
You're welcome.

95
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Launch from the Ranger.

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,880
Captain Gates is coming over.

97
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,040
Crazy bastard.

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
What could be
so fucking important

99
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,960
that he has to row
through all that shit out there?

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,240
We make landfall in the morning.

101
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,200
The last part of the schedule
if you don't mind.

102
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,160
What's that?

103
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
My own reconnaissance.

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,800
There are a dozen bays and inlets
within a day's journey from here

105
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
<i>that will make reasonable locations
for the Urca to take on water.</i>

106
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,920
If the course you write down
leads to one of them,

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
odds are that your
information is accurate.

108
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,080
And if it doesn't?

109
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,040
Division Bay.

110
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,240
The course leads
to Division Bay.

111
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Shoals on the eastern shore,

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,960
but if we approach
from the windward,

113
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,120
we should be able to take up
a strong opening position.

114
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,040
Take this
to Mr. De Groot.

115
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Tell him to adjust
our course accordingly

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
and set up our final
approach for the morning.

117
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,160
Something else?

118
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,480
Well, now that I've fulfilled
my end of the bargain,

119
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm just wondering
where you and I stand.

120
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Keep wondering.

121
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,760
I best be getting back.

122
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,360
Let's not tempt fate.

123
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,760
Talbot Rhodes.
Private stock.

124
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,800
I've been waiting
for an occasion.

125
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,240
My reckoning is tomorrow

126
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,760
we'll either be able to afford
a lot more of it or...

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,880
We'll be too dead to care.

128
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,120
Captain asked me
to pass these to you.

129
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,080
A new course.

130
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,360
The captain accepted the last segment
of the Urca route as valid?

131
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,960
One thing you should not doubt.

132
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,400
Certainty is not a word
I throw around lightly.

133
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
Now this information,
I am quite certain I have it right.

134
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,800
That man has a strange
way of handling

135
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,760
the prospect of imminent
wealth beyond reason.

136
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Ma'am.

137
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,800
What are you doing here?

138
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,000
Captain Hornigold
asked me to sit in

139
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,960
on Captain Lawrence's final
preparations before departure.

140
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>They're just finishing upstairs.</i>

141
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Mm.

142
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm fine.

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,160
Believe it or not,
this place didn't collapse

144
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,520
the moment you walked
out the door.

145
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,080
You really believe my concern
is for this place?

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
It's a ship killer out there.

147
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
I can't even imagine
what it's like further north.

148
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,760
You'd been opposed to hunting
the Urca from the beginning.

149
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,960
Perhaps God's on your side
of this one.

150
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,640
I just think of all the trouble that
fucking schedule caused.

151
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,680
The trouble it caused Max and I.

152
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
Caused you and I.

153
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
The thought that it could all
end up being for nothing...

154
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,240
Perhaps the trouble
was going to happen anyway.

155
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,320
Schedule or no.

156
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,360
Perhaps.

157
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,320
Tomorrow a thing
that you conceived

158
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
out of thin air becomes real.

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
<i>A thing that will</i>
<i>give this place</i>

160
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,080
<i>a chance to find some</i>
<i>small measure of peace.</i>

161
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,640
That is not nothing.

162
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,160
Henderson?

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,520
It wasn't Henderson.

164
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
It was something like Henderson.
Harrison? Harvey?

165
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,640
I don't know who the fuck
you're talking about.

166
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,200
The man that nicked
that bottle was called Cregg.

167
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,160
Cregg! That's him.
Cregg.

168
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,320
Mr. Cregg.
Carpenter's mate.

169
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,120
Had a nose
for sniffing out booze

170
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
on a prize ship
like a fucking bloodhound.

171
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh, Cregg. I remember walking in
on him once,

172
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,040
digging through a stash
on a prize.

173
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,720
He...

174
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,320
he found this bottle of booze
behind a baseboard.

175
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,160
Now he's convinced that the prize
captain's been hiding his best liquor.

176
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,000
So he pops the cork
and takes this big swig

177
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,280
in front of all of us.

178
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,960
- And it was piss.
- It was piss.

179
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
Aye, Cregg.

180
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
- Oh, God.
- Oh, Cregg.

181
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,760
I brought him over
with me, you know.

182
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
We served together under
Avery when we was kids.

183
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Huh.
He was my first bunkmate.

184
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,920
For years he went on
how he'd got this

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,960
huge stash hidden away.

186
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,680
And I should live to survive him

187
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,120
because one day
I will be a rich man.

188
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,360
As you know, we lost
him on the Pembroke.

189
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,400
So I open his locker
and what do I find?

190
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,720
12 pesos, a busted pocket watch,

191
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,960
and a letter with instructions

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,720
to deliver it
to his sister in New York.

193
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,680
<i>Lying sack of shit</i>

194
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
was Mr. Cregg.

195
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,200
<i>So I bought the boys</i>
<i>a round with the pesos,</i>

196
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,240
<i>traded the pocket watch</i>
<i>for a bit of tail,</i>

197
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,080
<i>and spent two weeks</i>
<i>that winter in New York</i>

198
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,360
trying to deliver that fucking
letter to his sister.

199
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,400
Looked high and low.

200
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,840
Never found her.

201
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
<i>So on the way home,</i>

202
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,000
<i>I waited till we were</i>
<i>in open water</i>

203
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,440
<i>and I could see no land</i>
<i>in any direction,</i>

204
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,720
and I dropped it over the side.

205
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,160
Returned to the sea.

206
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,800
There are no legacies
in this life, are there?

207
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,880
No monuments.
No history.

208
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,200
Just the water.

209
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It pays us

210
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,200
and then it claims us.

211
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Swallows us whole.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,160
<i>As if we'd never</i>
<i>been here at all.</i>

213
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,560
Well...

214
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,320
I better be getting back.

215
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,720
How the fuck can you cut Mapleton
loose without even telling me?

216
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware you were her
attorney in this matter.

217
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,480
She'll run her mouth all over
the fucking island about Noonan.

218
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,240
Who cares? The only people who
could conceivably make trouble for us

219
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,760
are currently elbow deep
in free prostitute downstairs.

220
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,960
What's worse, you keep counsel
with a whore about it.

221
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,800
Wait, what?

222
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,600
You think you can
trust her, you dumb shit?

223
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
That's what this
is about? Max?

224
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,880
You fucked her, didn't you?

225
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,520
Jesus H. Christ.
I can't win with you.

226
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
She's in the camp
with the men and it's, "Come on, Jack,

227
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,160
let's go kill everybody
and see if we can't get her out of there.

228
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,680
Hope you don't mind.
Made that decision on your behalf."

229
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,800
And now she's out, making us
a small fortune, by the way,

230
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,400
and you're pissed off
about that, too.

231
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,880
Might you consider making up your fucking
mind about it, please?

232
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
- Fuck you, Jack.
- "Fuck you, Jack."

233
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,120
Yes, I know.
Fuck me.

234
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,160
Listen here!

235
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,360
When we crest the point ahead
and spot the Urca in anchor,

236
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,640
we'll begin
our final run at her.

237
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,440
- Take it. - <i>The Spanish banner may</i>
<i>earn us a few hundred yards</i>

238
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,640
<i>of confusion before the captain</i>
<i>identifies us and opens fire.</i>

239
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,920
So we'll close fast on her,

240
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
hammer her well with our guns,

241
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,200
and then take the fight
to her decks.

242
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,760
<i>That fight will be the fight</i>
<i>of our lives,</i>

243
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,080
<i>make no mistake.</i>

244
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,080
But on the other side

245
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,800
lies paradise.

246
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
I'll see you there.
Mr. De Groot?

247
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,400
A full complement,
if you please.

248
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,880
Signal the Ranger.

249
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
- <i>Aye, captain.</i>
- <i>Full sail, final approach.</i>

250
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,400
Check our position.

251
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
- This is the course.
- Well, check it again.

252
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,080
Captain, this is
the location you requested.

253
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,080
Your true manifest.
Your false manifest.

254
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,480
And, most importantly,
your bribe money.

255
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,760
Godspeed, Captain.

256
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,200
Perhaps we should go over
the details one more time.

257
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,560
The harbormaster's
name is Singer.

258
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
The foreman's name is Smith.

259
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,840
The warehouse manager's Clay,

260
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,120
and the customs man is Kent.

261
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,440
<i>Now if you don't let me</i>
<i>board my ship</i>

262
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,960
<i>and leave this place,</i>
<i>none of it will matter</i>

263
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,240
as the goods in my hold will be rotten
by the time I arrive.

264
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,320
- Goodbye.
- Godspeed.

265
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,680
I have to hand it to you,

266
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,560
you said you'd rebuild things
here without your father,

267
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,680
and damned if you
didn't do just that.

268
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,040
Still one step
yet to accomplish.

269
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,160
Removing my father entirely.

270
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,520
Excuse me?

271
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
I know he's out
in the Underhill estate.

272
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,040
If you think he isn't scheming
to undo everything

273
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,480
we've done here,
you're kidding yourself.

274
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,520
You are truly amazing.

275
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,360
In a moment when stability
is at hand and the world is at your feet,

276
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,160
your first instinct is to go out in search
of someone new to fight.

277
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,040
Captain, a moment.

278
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,440
God.

279
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,040
Can't believe you left me
for that old lady.

280
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,600
Captain Hornigold is right.

281
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,920
What the fuck?

282
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,280
Where did that come from?

283
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,360
Jesus Christ, Ben, why are your men firing
on their own ship?

284
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,160
My men aren't the ones
doing the firing.

285
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,880
We need to get you
off the beach now.

286
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,160
Is someone shooting
the guns off out here?

287
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,520
What the hell is going on?

288
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Someone has taken over the fort.

289
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,600
Captain, after an
inventory of our stores,

290
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,360
the men have assented
to your plan.

291
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,920
Provided we find a suitable
place to land the Walrus,

292
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,680
you'll have two days
to send out scouts

293
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,440
and hopefully locate the Urca.

294
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Given their mood, I'd say we were
lucky to get that long.

295
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,840
Do it, then.

296
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,320
- What?
- It's Mr. De Groot.

297
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,480
He's put his foot down.

298
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,840
Once we make landfall,
he wants Flint tried immediately.

299
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,600
Oh, Jesus.

300
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,000
He's bitter about the fact that we
didn't listen to him regarding the cook.

301
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,400
He says there's no Urca out here

302
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,240
and that justice has been
delayed long enough.

303
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,680
That's not gonna happen,
so let's discuss reality.

304
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,720
He said that you'd say that.

305
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,120
And after all your talk,
you're just protecting Flint.

306
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,440
I'm protecting all of us.

307
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,200
These men are right on the edge

308
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,560
and he wants to rile
them up more

309
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,640
by talking about a lying,
thieving captain,

310
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,680
then stand on a deserted beach
and talk about an election.

311
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,720
Before you know it, half a dozen men
will have laid claim to the captaincy.

312
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,400
Camps will divide.

313
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,640
It won't be dark yet
before the fighting starts.

314
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,160
We're gonna see Flint
pay for his crimes.

315
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,600
But we'll do it at home

316
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,320
and we'll do it
like civilized men.

317
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,960
That's how we avoid the abyss.

318
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,040
We knew you spent the night
drinking together.

319
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,440
How can we take you
at your word?

320
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
You don't have to take my word.

321
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,720
Good enough for you?

322
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,360
Mr. Gates...

323
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,800
<i>Sails!</i>

324
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,320
To the south!

325
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Is it the Urca?

326
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,480
Captain, is it her?

327
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,720
Captain, is it the Urca?

328
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,600
Man-of-war!
She's a man-of-war!

329
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,240
<i>Spanish banners!</i>

330
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,840
In less than half an hour,
she'll be right on top of us.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,800
Get orders to the Ranger.

332
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,560
Tell her to raise the black

333
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,080
and fire two shots over our bow.

334
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,280
- Mr. De Groot.
- <i>Captain?</i>

335
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,400
<i>Rig a spring to the forward anchor,</i>
<i>then drop her immediately.</i>

336
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,240
Drop anchor?

337
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,840
You mean to fight her?

338
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,800
You all have your orders!

339
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
Captain, join me.

340
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,240
- We don't have time.
- Make time.

341
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,120
If he engages that ship
in battle, we're dead.

342
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,560
- I know.
- I know you know.

343
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,520
But does Mr. Gates?

344
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I can't let you
go down this road.

345
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
As far that
man-of-war knows,

346
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,800
we're Spanish merchantmen
under attack by pirate raiders.

347
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,480
We order the Ranger to flee,

348
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,960
the Spaniard passes us
to give chase,

349
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,920
and before she realizes her
error, we've got her trapped.

350
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
She's got 100 guns.

351
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,200
We do this properly, she'll never
get a chance to use them.

352
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,640
We'll rake her stern to bow,

353
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
the Ranger will rake
her bow to stern.

354
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,840
With a little luck, we'll hammer her
into submission

355
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
before she can bring
her broadsides to bear.

356
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
To accomplish what, exactly?

357
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,240
The Urca. She's here.
Can't you see that?

358
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,520
All I can see is an empty bay,

359
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,960
a guardacosta warship,

360
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,880
and a captain that's lost
his fucking grip on reality.

361
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,000
Guardacosta?
You think that ship's here on patrol?

362
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,360
That she just happened
by this place at this time?

363
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,920
That ship is an escort.

364
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
It's the only explanation.

365
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,640
The Urca has no escort.

366
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,440
Was that not the justification
for this entire endeavor?

367
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,640
They altered their plans.
Found a ship they could spare.

368
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm taking the Ranger
and I'm leaving.

369
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,880
What did you just say?

370
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,680
I'm gonna weigh anchor
and I'm gonna make a run for it.

371
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,000
If I can keep ahead
of it before dark,

372
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
there's just a chance
we can slip away.

373
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,800
Without the Ranger,
I have no chance against that ship.

374
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,600
I know.

375
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,760
So you're deliberately
challenging my authority here?

376
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,080
Deliberately
violating your duty?

377
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,200
My duty?

378
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,760
My duty is to them, not to you.

379
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,040
Although I have
violated it more times

380
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,760
than I can remember
in your defense.

381
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
<i>Helped you deceive good men</i>

382
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,520
who put their trust in me
because I was convinced

383
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,440
they would be better off for it.

384
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,600
Well, not here.
Not this.

385
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,600
This is fucking madness.

386
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,160
Mr. Gates, if you
walk through that door

387
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,880
with the intent
of subverting my plans,

388
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,320
I will have no alternative but to interpret
that as an incitement of mutiny.

389
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,840
You think I'm inciting mutiny?

390
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,120
- You are inciting mutiny.
- I'm managing one!

391
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,520
There are men
out there right now

392
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
that know about Singleton,

393
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,200
the book, the cook, all of it.

394
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,720
They know. And they mean to see
you hanged for it.

395
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,000
You told them?

396
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,920
After Billy, I just...

397
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,400
I didn't want to believe you could be
capable of doing something like that.

398
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,920
But I couldn't convince
myself that you weren't.

399
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,040
<i>That's when I realized,</i>
<i>this has got to end.</i>

400
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,880
So what, then?

401
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,160
You preside over a trial
that sees me hanged?

402
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,880
No.

403
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,760
We're going to go home

404
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,440
and I will see you
and Mrs. Barlow secreted away

405
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
before anybody
knows you're gone.

406
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,920
<i>You're gonna go to Boston.</i>

407
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,040
<i>You're gonna take the pardon
that she's offered you.</i>

408
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,360
And that is the last that you and I will
ever see of each other.

409
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,960
Please.

410
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,240
Please, don't do this.

411
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,120
I'm sorry.

412
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,960
Take a moment.

413
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,440
I'll deal with them.

414
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,480
This is not what I wanted.

415
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,800
This is not what I wanted.

416
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,480
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,440
I'm sorry.

420
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,520
I'm sorry.

421
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,880
I came to lend
credence to your case

423
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,040
that the Urca
is still to be won.

424
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,480
What the fuck
are you doing to him?

425
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,880
- Making sure there's nothing
incriminating... - Stop. Stop.

426
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,560
There's no way out of this.

427
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,240
Take it from me,

428
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,520
there's always a way.

429
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,080
Sir.

430
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,280
- What is it? - A small band of men were
seen approaching the fort

431
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,560
from the west this morning.
No one's been able to identify them.

432
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,040
Are all the home crews
accounted for?

433
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,880
Aye. Every one.
They had nothing to do with this.

434
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,200
<i>Could this be a first move by England</i>
<i>to reclaim the island?</i>

435
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,640
<i>Without a single ship involved?</i>

436
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,480
This does not have the air of
a state move. This is something else.

437
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,400
Captain, how easily
are the great guns

438
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
- <i>on the fort repositioned?</i>
- What difference does that make?

439
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,360
He's asking if the fort
can turn her guns around

440
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,640
and bring them to bear
on the street... on <i>us.</i>

441
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,000
Let's hope whomever's up there is
not mad enough to consider that.

442
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,240
That's less than
confidence-inspiring.

443
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,880
I have lieutenants
calling in favors

444
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
from the crews of the Colonial Dawn
and the Medusa.

445
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,400
I'll have 250 men assembled and ready
to storm the fort in a matter of hours.

446
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,440
By first light tomorrow,
I'll be back in my chair

447
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,680
and whoever did this
will be hanging by his goddamn...

448
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,560
- What is it?
- Quick, you all need to see this.

449
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,360
<i>Go back inside.</i>

450
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,920
Miss Guthrie.

451
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,680
I think it's time we talked.

452
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
Mr. Gates's heart
has given out.

453
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
He's dead?

454
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,480
Mr. Logan.

455
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,560
<i>Signal Mr. Thompson</i>
<i>on the Ranger.</i>

456
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
Inform him he's now in command.

457
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,440
His orders are to sail north.

458
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,920
When we fire on the target,
he's to tack hard to port and do the same.

459
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
Hoist the signals from the foremast
below the yard.

460
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,280
Get 'em up and down quickly before
the Spaniard sees them.

461
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,360
The question you need
to ask yourself

462
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,120
is "What good
can I do?"

463
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,000
<i>You can call this murder.</i>

464
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,560
<i>A number of the men</i>
<i>might even believe you,</i>

465
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,480
but will that be enough

466
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,600
to stop this fight
that is about to happen?

467
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,640
<i>Because if it's not,</i>
<i>a fight we might win</i>

468
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,040
<i>becomes a battle</i>
<i>we are doomed to lose.</i>

469
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,760
<i>Because the men went into it</i>
<i>infected with your suspicions,</i>

470
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,760
<i>with your doubts.</i>

471
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,520
So, Mr. Quartermaster,

472
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,640
is that truly what's
in their best interests?

473
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,000
St. Augustine.

474
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,320
Beg pardon?

475
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,520
When the warship draws close,

476
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,280
she'll ask our
last port of call.

477
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,160
St. Augustine's
the closest.

478
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,080
<i>And as she's likely</i>
<i>a customs ship,</i>

479
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,600
<i>we must identify our cargo</i>
<i>as anything but tobacco.</i>

480
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,400
Seville regulates
the trade heavily.

481
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,040
Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.

482
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,160
What the fuck did you do?

483
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,160
Spend enough time on an island,

484
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,080
begin to forget there's
a whole world out there.

485
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,360
A world where the rules
are different.

486
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,120
I went out there, found men
who don't know the rules here

487
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,880
and who don't much care
to learn them.

488
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,400
They helped me surprise
Captain Hornigold's men,

489
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,840
we took his fort, and not once were
any of them burdened

490
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,440
with the thought, "What if this were to
upset Eleanor Guthrie?"

491
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,280
Well, they're about
to learn the rules, Charles.

492
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,840
The hard way.
You think I'm gonna let this stand?

493
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,640
That Hornigold will?
We have men lining up

494
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,760
<i>in droves to back us</i>
<i>in retaking it.</i>

495
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
I'd expect nothing less.

496
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,040
Just out of curiosity,

497
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,680
how long do you think
that's gonna take?

498
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,120
Can you take back
that fort before...

499
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I sink another ship in the bay?

500
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,400
Three more?

501
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,400
All of them?

502
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,040
<i>Who knows?</i>

503
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,880
<i>If my men hold out long enough,</i>

504
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,720
<i>we may just decide</i>
<i>to sink the Walrus</i>

505
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,320
when she returns with your
precious Spanish gold

506
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,880
just out of spite.

507
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,720
So that's what this is.

508
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,160
You're annoyed at me, so you're
gonna destroy everything I've built.

509
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,920
Never said I wanted
to destroy anything.

510
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,520
Then what do you want?

511
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,040
Hornigold controlled the fort.

512
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,360
The fort controls the bay.
The bay controls commerce.

513
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
That meant he was your partner.

514
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,960
Now, <i>I</i> control the fort.

515
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,360
So I will be your partner.

516
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,160
You are kidding me.

517
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,400
I was a tenant in this
place for a long time.

518
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,080
Didn't work out so well.

519
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,800
Now I'd like a stake.

520
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,240
You've absolutely
lost your mind.

521
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,400
I remember
the first time I saw you.

522
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,040
You were about 13.

523
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,920
You'd snuck down to the beach

524
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,120
despite Mr. Scott's
rules forbidding it.

525
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,960
A girl that age

526
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,360
looking like you did.

527
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,560
And you just walked up
and down between the camps

528
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,520
like you owned the place.

529
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
Fearless.

530
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
Then you saw me watching you
and you didn't look away.

531
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,240
Didn't cower.

532
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,600
You just gave me this look...

533
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,520
this little smile...

534
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,120
that said you refused
to be afraid of me.

535
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,120
What the fuck
are you talking about?

536
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,640
I know you.

537
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,600
<i>Better than your father,</i>
<i>better than Scott.</i>

538
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,000
<i>Maybe better than anyone.</i>

539
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,720
You don't give a shit
about money or respect.

540
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,080
Or the things you've built here.

541
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
I think you're just tired
of fathers

542
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,520
telling you what to do.

543
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,480
And so I'm offering you
a life free from them.

544
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,440
With me in that fort,
you do as you like.

545
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,200
As long as it doesn't cross me,

546
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,200
you'll hear no complaints.

547
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,600
You know I have no choice
but to say yes.

548
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,440
But before I do, know this,

549
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,840
<i>you'll sit in that fort for a while.</i>
<i>You'll get comfortable.</i>

550
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,840
And that's the day
I'm gonna push you and your men

551
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,360
right into the fucking sea.

552
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,840
God, I missed that look.

553
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,680
Ben.

554
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
What the hell did he say?

555
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,160
He wants your seat on the consortium.
To be a partner to us.

556
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,800
Well, I have 300 men out there
more than happy to deny him.

557
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,600
- You can't, Ben.
- Oh, watch me.

558
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,920
I told him about the tunnels.

559
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,120
The tunnels that you would use to
launch a surprise attack into the fort.

560
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,440
- I told him.
- Jesus!

561
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,000
You told me to keep emotion
from clouding judgment.

562
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,360
To act in everyone's
best interest.

563
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,000
I believe that's what I'm doing.

564
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,840
This is not the end of this.

565
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,560
Captain.
Welcome back.

566
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,920
I hear congratulations
are in order.

567
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,840
Steward of the fort.
Stroke of pure genius.

568
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,600
In some ways, Jack,
it had to come to this.

569
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,840
- Don't you think?
- Come to what?

570
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,200
Me deciding if you live or die.

571
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,400
Captain, I don't know
what you've heard...

572
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,400
Hamund pulls you out of bed...

573
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,960
<i>marches you down to the wrecks</i>

574
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,800
to look for a stash
of stolen pearls.

575
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,600
And somehow, only you and your dog
make it back alive.

576
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,440
<i>Quite a moment.</i>

577
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,480
Jack Rackham
with nothing to say.

578
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,680
<i>Had I a shrewd</i>
<i>quartermaster right now,</i>

579
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,400
<i>he would tell me that
can't let what you did stand.</i>

580
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,640
He would say an offense
like that

581
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
demanded an example
be made of both of you.

582
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,640
<i>The bloodier the better.</i>

583
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,320
But today,
I'm a little less worried

584
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,000
about perception
than I used to be.

585
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,280
As long as I hold that fort,

586
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,040
doesn't really matter.

587
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,080
So the street
will know what you did.

588
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,880
<i>They will know you betrayed your</i>
<i>brothers for a woman.</i>

589
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,720
That story will spread
far and wide

590
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,920
and you'll never sail
beneath the black again.

591
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,640
<i>You'll sit in this place and rot</i>

592
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,120
with the rest of the whores.

593
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,160
Something tells me that'll
sting worse than dying.

594
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,760
<i>Loyalty, Jack.</i>

595
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,680
<i>It's supposed to mean something.</i>

596
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,240
It does to me, anyway.

597
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,720
Oh.

598
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,360
Love what you've
done with the place.

599
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,720
Here she comes.

600
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,920
Cazadora.
Marco Fernandez, captain.

601
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,000
Cazadora.
Marco Fernandez, capitán.

602
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,280
St, Augustine.
Tobacco trade.

603
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,920
If I'm not mistaken,
you told him to name us

604
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,600
anything but a tobacco
trader, did you not?

605
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,200
I did.

606
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,480
He means to prove that
that ship is not guardacosta.

607
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
That it's here for
the same reason we are.

608
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
The Urca.

609
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,120
That ship lets us pass,

610
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,520
he will have managed to both
renew the men's lust for gold

611
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,400
and their faith in his judgment.

612
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Hello.

613
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,200
All hands to their stations.

614
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,920
Quietly, if you please.

615
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,880
At 300 yards, we open fire.

616
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,240
Time and again
he gambles with our lives.

617
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,080
That is, when he's not
taking them in cold blood.

618
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,400
And once more
his influence grows.

619
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,600
And we're at his mercy
with no way to challenge him.

620
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,280
No, sir.

621
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,800
It only looks that way.

622
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,720
Turn us around slowly, boys.

623
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,680
They need to think
we're just drifting.

624
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
Range?

625
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,600
Hundred yards, Captain.

626
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,160
- Open.
- Open.

627
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,120
- Come right a few degrees.
- <i>Aye, Captain.</i>

628
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,360
We only get one shot at this.
We miss, we die.

629
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,760
- Clear, tack hull.
- Range?

630
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,920
Approaching 200 yards, Captain.

631
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,640
All crews, fire on my mark.

632
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,200
Steady.

633
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,840
Almost there.

634
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,200
Captain Flint.

635
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,080
As quartermaster,
I hereby accuse you

636
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,280
of tyrannical crimes
against your crew.

637
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,240
All crews, fire!

638
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,720
<i>Belay that order!</i>

639
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,640
Your duties as a member of this crew
have reached an end.

640
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,840
Take a seat.

641
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,680
Beginning with the murders
of Mr. Singleton,

642
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,840
Billy Bones,
and Mr. Gates.

643
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,560
What exactly do you hope
to accomplish by doing this?

644
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,320
In your case,
Mr. Silver, justice.

645
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,520
Once Dufresne exposes Flint's lies
in their totality,

646
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,080
the crew are gonna want
answers from you, too.

647
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,120
And as I explained
to Mr. Dufresne,

648
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,120
it's his word against Flint's.

649
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,440
Why would anyone believe him?

650
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,920
I hold in my hand a letter

651
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,640
written by Mr. Gates
confessing his knowledge

652
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,520
and complicity in
the captain's myriad crimes.

653
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,360
We're going to lose them.
We don't have time for this.

654
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,640
As well as his knowledge
of the captain's continued treachery

655
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,520
up to and including
his plan to steal

656
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,240
a portion of the treasure
fleet proceeds for himself.

657
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,560
I gave you all an order!
Fire!

658
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,480
Fire!

659
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,480
Mr. Logan.

660
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,800
It's in Mr. Gates's hand.

661
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,040
Where are you going?

662
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,280
Justice, thief.

663
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,800
This time there's
no escaping it.

664
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,040
You're welcome.

665
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,480
Raise the sails.
We're going home.

666
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,640
Who's shooting?!

667
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,160
Sorry.

668
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,800
Had to be done.

669
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,600
There's no running now.

670
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,960
<i>The Ranger's coming about.</i>

671
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,920
The Spaniards have got
men in the rigging.

672
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,320
Fire, Mr. Dufresne.
Everything you've got.

673
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,920
Don't waste this moment.

674
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,640
All cannons, open fire!

675
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,560
<i>Open fire!</i>

676
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,080
Reload!

677
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,360
Ready with this cannon!

678
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,560
Fire!

679
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,640
<i>The Ranger's opened fire!</i>

680
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,680
Again!

681
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,880
<i>...Fire!</i>

682
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,920
She's coming about!

683
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,680
Fire!

684
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,320
Fire!

685
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,680
<i>Below!</i>

686
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,400
<i>To your stations!</i>

687
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,760
Set sail!

688
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,120
Doctor! Doctor!

689
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,920
<i>No-man's-land.</i>

690
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,920
There was a time when
stopping halfway across this bridge

691
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,720
would have been
unthinkable to you.

692
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,200
How things change.

693
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,400
I can see that.

694
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,360
Max, I know we haven't spoken,

695
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,920
but I just want you
to know how sorry I am...

696
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,720
Don't.

697
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,520
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

698
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I was standing between
you and your dreams for this place.

699
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,120
You did what you had to do.

700
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,040
I thought you said
this place was just sand.

701
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,160
Sand has its virtues.

702
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,840
On sand, nothing is fixed.

703
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,720
Nothing is permanent.

704
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,680
And fates change so quickly.

705
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,920
Yesterday Captain Hornigold
was immovable from that fort

706
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,040
and Captain Vane was a beggar.

707
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,560
Now look at them today.

708
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,080
<i>Yesterday I was a whore</i>
<i>of little consequence,</i>

709
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,960
easily dismissed,

710
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,840
easily forgotten.

711
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
<i>Today I am a madam</i>

712
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,520
with an income and allies

713
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,960
<i>and a woman who has learned the most</i>
<i>important of lessons.</i>

714
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,360
Never let anyone stand in between you
and your ambitions.

715
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,000
Thank you for teaching it to me.

716
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,240
Ma'am, they're ready.

717
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,320
Congratulations on the launch
of your endeavor, by the way.

718
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,520
Today you have everything
you have ever wanted.

719
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,280
I suppose we can only guess
what tomorrow will bring.

720
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,440
They think it'll be a while
before she sails again.

721
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,960
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>you and I have been charged</i>

722
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,800
<i>with provoking this whole mess.</i>

723
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,720
Why am I still alive?

724
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,920
Why didn't you kill me?

725
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,440
Get him up.

726
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,320
Told you I was certain about
my information regarding the Urca.

727
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,880
Unfortunately, you and I
failed to take into account the weather.

728
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,600
The Urca de Lima wrecked
at sea last night.

729
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,200
Dashed by the storm.

730
