The nurses have stabilized her
for now, but if she

to send her to a real hospital.

Which I suppose is
the real... alternative.

166
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,189
(sobbing): Can you release me?

167
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:01,820
Oh, shut up, you stupid sow!

168
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:08,489
She likes it here.

169
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,438
We like it.

170
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:17,252
We have work left to do.

171
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,919
So do I.

172
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:23,766
We'll meet again.

173
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,052
You're grievously ill, Grace.

174
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,919
There's an infection
coursing through your body,

175
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:52,405
probably caused
by a botched hysterectomy.

176
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,063
I've been accused

177
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,362
of having committed
this savagery.

178
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:57,809
Both you and I

179
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,373
know it's not the truth.

180
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,308
At this stage, it would

181
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,614
be easier just to let you die,

182
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:07,389
but I will not be the one
to take the fall for this.

183
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:11,348
You will require
a strict regimen

184
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,327
of medicines and
round-the-clock care.

185
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,215
But you will live, Grace.

186
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,200
If only
to set the record straight.

187
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,683
(panting and groaning)

188
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,046
Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,301
(moaning)

190
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:24,992
It's all right.

191
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,152
Everything accurate

192
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,365
as, uh, far as
you can remember?

193
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:33,003
Yeah, I-I said these things,
but I didn't confess.

194
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,582
It was a headshrinker trick.

195
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:38,353
Kit, they're going
to play the tape for the jury,

196
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,956
and if I hear what
this says you said...

197
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,083
(laughs) ...I convict.

198
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,292
Did you talk to Grace,
like I told you?

199
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,144
I mean, she can testify
that she just saw Alma.

200
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:50,549
My wife is not dead,
and it proves I didn't do it.

201
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,136
First of all,

202
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,146
she's a patient
in a mental institution,

203
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,873
so what she saw is not likely
to convince a lot of people.

204
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,154
Second, they tell me
she's real sick.

205
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,963
She might not even
make it to the hearing.

206
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:06,920
The one way I saw
for you to avoid

207
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,635
the electric chair...

208
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,132
Dr. Thredson took away.

209
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,882
Now, that doesn't mean

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,001
(distant, echoing):
That you can't change his mind.

211
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:17,686
Now,
I'm not telling you to lie,

212
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,503
but, uh, if you
started to act up...

213
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:22,558
maybe we could

214
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,656
build a defense to get
12 people to, uh,

215
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:29,130
be convinced that, uh...

216
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,748
that you can't tell
the difference

217
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:33,112
between, uh, right and wrong.

218
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:35,754
(groans)

219
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,601
(grunts)

220
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:40,200
(panting)

221
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,866
You heard me calling?

222
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:05,311
(crying): I don't think

223
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,434
I can do this anymore.

224
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,461
(sniffles, cries)

225
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,730
(sniffling)

226
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,153
Death would be better.

227
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,652
I used to be scared of it.

228
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:28,319
But I'm not afraid anymore.

229
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,177
Just let go.

230
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:33,163
I'm right here with you.

231
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,665
No.

232
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,449
Not yet.

233
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:53,624
(panting)

234
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:55,632
THREDSON: Lana?

235
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,250
Are you decent?

236
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,245
(sighs)

237
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,594
I think we need to have
a little talk, don't you?

238
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,516
If that's what you want.

239
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:10,935
It is.

240
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,876
First of all, I want you to know

241
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,053
that I'm not angry.

242
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:18,675
What happened before was wrong.

243
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,303
It was very wrong,
and I don't blame you.

244
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:21,960
It was my fault.
Truth is, I probably

245
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,029
shouldn't have brought you
here in the first place.

246
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,549
- What do you mean?
- If there's one thing

247
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:28,465
you should know about me, Lana,
it's that I'm tenacious.

248
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:30,244
I don't like to give up.
That kind of

249
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:33,336
stick-to-itiveness has served
me and my patients very well,

250
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:36,085
but sometimes it also
prevents me from acknowledging

251
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:37,714
when I have reached an impasse
like the one

252
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,281
I think we've reached here.

253
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,089
An impasse?

254
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,321
(laughs)

255
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,667
(sighs)
Don't look so frightened, okay?

256
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,180
I don't want to hurt you.

257
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,433
I want this to be as painless
for you as possible,

258
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,028
so I will give you a choice...
I can either cut your throat,

259
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,703
or I can strangle you.

260
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,566
I don't believe in guns.

261
00:15:58,263 --> 00:16:00,009
Oh, God.

262
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:01,721
Christ, what am I saying?

263
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:04,854
It doesn't matter how we do it.

264
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:10,458
We'll put you out.

265
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,706
(quietly): - Please, no.
- You won't feel a thing.

266
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,646
Please, no. No, no.

267
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:15,962
Please, please. No, no, no. No!

268
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,518
- Please!
- Stop it! Stop...

269
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,281
fighting. (Whimpering)

270
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,158
Stop fighting!

271
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,250
- No!
- In no time at all,

272
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:26,054
you'll be reunited with Wendy.

273
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,548
You remember Wendy?

274
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,327
Don't you?

275
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:35,882
(Thredson grunting, muttering)

276
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:39,188
(Lana gasping)

277
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:45,813
(grunting) (yelling)

278
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:47,713
(yelling)

279
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,479
(Lana panting,
Thredson choking)

280
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,808
(Thredson gasping)

281
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:01,166
(groaning)

282
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,147
(gasping)

283
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,043
(gasping rapidly)

284
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:18,590
(panting)

285
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,678
(groaning)

286
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,368
(panting)

287
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,075
(panting)

288
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:53,147
(car approaching)
(tires squealing)

289
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,767
(panting)

290
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,141
(whimpering)

291
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,597
Drive. Go, please.

292
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,355
Please, drive away. Please!

293
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,465
(Lana panting)

294
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,490
(radio playing music
at low volume)

295
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,755
(breathing slows) Thank you.

296
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,813
You saved my life.

297
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,204
You didn't give me much
of a choice.

298
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:16,919
You jumped in the car.

299
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,119
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,994
I had to get away from him.

301
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:23,522
Did you have a fight
with your boyfriend?

302
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:25,742
What did you do to him?

303
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,659
Nothing.

304
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:33,128
What makes you think
it was my fault?

305
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,447
He almost killed me.
(wry laugh)

306
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,779
- And he's not my boyfriend.
- Yeah?

307
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:39,569
Of course it wasn't your fault.

308
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,381
Women are always the victims.

309
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:48,542
Could you please
just take me to the police?

310
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:49,578
Oh, is that how it works?

311
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:52,694
You get into my car, and then
you tell me what to do?

312
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,340
- Please stop the car and let me get out.
- That's right.

313
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,507
That's what you bitches do.
You get out.

314
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:59,638
You leave; you abandon ship

315
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:02,031
at the smallest
sign of a storm.

316
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:03,793
(laughing): What... What
are you going to do?

317
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,849
You gonna get out of a car
going 50 miles an hour?

318
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,515
Be my guest! Go!

319
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,455
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Why did she take

320
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:14,086
ten years of marriage and
flush it down the toilet?

321
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,801
Why did I catch another man

322
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,450
screwing my wife in my own bed?

323
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:19,948
I didn't do anything to you.

324
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:22,065
You brought this on yourself.

325
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,160
No.

326
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,705
Not you.

327
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,734
Not after everything.

328
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:41,983
I can't take it anymore.

329
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:44,427
The lies, the betrayal,
the cheating...

330
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,289
it's all going to end.

331
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:50,995
(gunshot, screaming)

332
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,991
(tires squealing)

333
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:59,032
(crashing)

334
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,774
(electricity crackling, buzzing)

335
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,867
Try not to move.

336
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,311
You'll be in terrible pain.

337
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,214
You've had quite the adventure.

338
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,486
The police said
the car accident

339
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:29,565
was horrific... I'm afraid
it was fatal for the driver.

340
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,418
But you're safe now.

341
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:35,344
Back to Briarcliff,
where you belong.

342
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,119
(electricity crackling, buzzing)

343
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:51,760
SISTER JUDE: <i>Oh, God.</i>

344
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,712
Oh, no.

345
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,081
(screaming): Oh, no, no...!

346
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:58,344
Oh, God.

347
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,348
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No.

348
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:02,802
Listen, listen.

349
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,454
- What?
- Listen, listen.

350
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:05,526
Arden did this.

351
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:07,803
No, no, nun, nun.

352
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,294
What, what?

353
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:11,060
- What did...?
- A nun...

354
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:13,150
- A nun.
- A nun...

355
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:14,902
A nun?!

356
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,308
One of... yours.

357
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:20,452
Yours... One of... yours.

358
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,720
(screams)

359
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,955
(sobbing)

360
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,178
We have to get you help!

361
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:34,563
(sobbing)

362
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,044
(dials phone)

363
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:40,079
Operator.

364
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:43,130
Operator, get me the police.

365
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,963
Oh, God, no!

366
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,399
(sobbing)

367
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,678
(insistent knocking on door)

368
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:16,305
(insistent knocking continues)

369
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:18,725
MAN: Judy!

370
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,771
Judy, you alive in there?

371
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,537
Hold on.

372
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:31,971
Hey... Terry.

373
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,882
Jesus, Judy, I've been

374
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,000
out here knocking
for ten minutes.

375
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:35,181
Hang on.

376
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,383
Hey, come on in.

377
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,656
Excuse the clutter.

378
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:43,660
Where were you last night?

379
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,819
- Last night?
- We had a gig at the White Rose.

380
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,571
- Oh...
- You didn't show up.

381
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:51,207
- We had to go on without a singer.
- Oh, shit.

382
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,370
I-I've, I've been a
little under the weather.

383
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:57,194
(coughs) I can see that.

384
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:58,999
Might want to open a window.

385
00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:00,133
It's pretty ripe in here.

386
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,396
How'd it go?

387
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,825
Uh, went great.

388
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,968
Barry called his cousin,

389
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:08,244
and she got there
by the third set.

390
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:12,674
What's this?

391
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:16,570
Just a little something
to tide you over.

392
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,599
You're out of the band, Judy.

393
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:23,016
What, because of one gig?

394
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,506
It's not just the one gig.

395
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:26,423
You've been slipping
for a long time.

396
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:29,302
We all noticed it,
and it got real clear

397
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:31,491
last night after
Barry's cousin filled in.

398
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,811
(scoffs) Barry's cousin?

399
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,922
What, she's Dinah
Shore all of a sudden?

400
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,104
She don't have to be.

401
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:39,594
She was on key.

402
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:41,894
He's been trying to get

403
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,672
his fat cousin in
there for months now.

404
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,624
No, this is a conspiracy.

405
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,455
This is a conspiracy
against me!

406
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,740
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,636
Wait, hey, what do I have to do?

408
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:57,072
Come on, Terry.

409
00:23:57,554 --> 00:24:01,554
Come on, man, tell me, just
tell me what I've got to do.

410
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,942
- Stop it.
- Come on.

411
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,984
I can make you feel real good.

412
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,358
- You know, I've always wondered...
- Judy,

413
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,498
- you are embarrassing yourself.
- ...what it felt like with a colored man.

414
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,384
Stop it! You smell of vomit.

415
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:12,679
(growls)

416
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,515
There's a card in there,
with a number.

417
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,418
A detective, uh,
wants you to call him.

418
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:18,751
What?

419
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,924
Yeah, uh, there was
a hit-and-run

420
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:23,351
couple blocks from the club
last Thursday night.

421
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,403
A little girl got run down,

422
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:27,389
and cops want to know
if anybody saw anything.

423
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,628
You take care, Judy.

424
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:32,267
We'll see you around.

425
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,058
(whimpers)

426
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:40,332
(murmuring)

427
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,557
NEWS ANNOUNCER: The search continues
tonight for the hit-and-run driver

428
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:11,629
responsible...

429
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:14,160
(music playing)

430
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:26,454
(tires screeching)

431
00:25:27,753 --> 00:25:29,163
(gasps)

432
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:40,730
(pipe organ playing
uplifting music)

433
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,508
(sighing)

434
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:26,771
Excuse me, Miss,
is everything all right?

435
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,637
Are you hurt?

436
00:26:30,594 --> 00:26:31,971
No.

437
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,124
I'm fine.

438
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:36,331
Everything's fine.

439
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,689
(distant phone ringing)

440
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,362
Hello.

441
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,937
SISTER EUNICE: Judy Martin?

442
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:02,938
Who is this?

443
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:05,724
It's your conscience calling.

444
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:08,496
Mary Eunice, what have you done?

445
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:09,632
What have <i>I</i> done?

446
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,880
No, no, no.

447
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:14,838
The question is...
what have <i>you</i> done?

448
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:16,402
That dead man
lying on the floor...

449
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:17,919
he was investigating you,

450
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,435
or so his papers all show.

451
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,526
A 15-year-old
unsolved hit-and-run case.

452
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,639
How did you know about that?

453
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,195
I know everything.

454
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:29,489
I was in your head, remember?

455
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,707
Lose your place, old man?

456
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:33,200
(screaming)

457
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,685
Don't even think
about coming back here, Judy.

458
00:27:38,796 --> 00:27:40,577
You might want
to start running now,

459
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,155
though the truth is,

460
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:44,356
how far do you think
you can get?

461
00:27:44,588 --> 00:27:45,657
Oh, um,

462
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:48,261
I left a bottle
of, um, Kentucky's.

463
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:49,724
I think that is for you.

464
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:51,700
I left something else
there for you, too.

465
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,810
(siren wailing)

466
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,955
(panting)

467
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:41,351
(quiet laugh)

468
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:52,476
You jumped the gun again.

469
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:54,858
It was a passing thought;

470
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:57,920
Nothing but a passing thought.

471
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,441
Your song was
different this time...

472
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:03,194
much more plaintive
and piercing.

473
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:06,675
Never trust a drunk.

474
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:09,585
I'm just the little girl
who cried wolf.

475
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,853
Aren't you sick of me yet?

476
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,502
I come when I'm called;
It's what I do, Jude.

477
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:17,088
I don't judge; I never judge.

478
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,758
What was so different
this time?

479
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:30,356
Was my song... so different...

480
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,490
the night Casey left me,

481
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,600
the night before our wedding,

482
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:37,223
when I told him
he'd given me syphilis

483
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,359
and I'd never be able
to have children?

484
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:41,963
I forgave him.

485
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:46,258
He just stared at me
like I didn't even exist,

486
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,331
called me a liar and a whore.

487
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:52,655
All I ever wanted
was my own family,

488
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,053
my own children
to teach and love.

489
00:30:57,642 --> 00:31:00,312
Why didn't I die that night?

490
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:03,947
You were young;
You still had hope.

491
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,660
And the night I killed a child,

492
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:10,622
the night I ran over
that little girl in blue,

493
00:31:11,264 --> 00:31:13,839
why not that night?

494
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:17,114
That was when God revealed
He had a plan for you.

495
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:19,275
He gave you a calling.

496
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,785
And now He's taken it away.

497
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:22,986
(chuckles)

498
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,066
I've been living
on borrowed time, haven't I?

499
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,709
Sooner or later, He was bound
to figure out...

500
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,217
I never really rose
to His challenge.

501
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:34,913
I'm still just a...

502
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:37,112
drunken whore...

503
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:39,119
and a murderer,

504
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:40,814
trying to disguise

505
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:44,612
my darkness under
that miserable black cloth.

506
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:47,264
You deserve some peace, Jude.

507
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,313
You deserve a peace

508
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:50,729
befitting your extraordinary,
tireless efforts

509
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:53,264
to find meaning in this life.

510
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:54,938
How long can you live

511
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:57,549
on free coffee
and crackers, Jude?

512
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:58,815
The winters here are long,

513
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:00,631
and they're very cold.

514
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:02,838
And the whiskey
won't keep you warm.

515
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,159
It just rots your insides.

516
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:08,065
Peace is so close, Sister.

517
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,944
(whispers): I'm ready.

518
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:21,711
But I need to do one last thing.

519
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:29,164
Poor thing.

520
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:31,087
Maybe we should
call Briarcliff.

521
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,654
At least they could
give her a bed for the night.

522
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,190
(baby crying)

523
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:48,527
Sorry, she's a fussy
baby, this one.

524
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,011
So you were saying
you were Missy's teacher?

525
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,609
Hank, you bringing that coffee?

526
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:53,664
I got it, dear.

527
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,371
- Here you go.
- So kind.

528
00:32:56,914 --> 00:32:58,222
SISTER JUDE: I, um...

529
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,003
I know you have to get to work,

530
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,676
so I'll only take
a minute of your time. I...

531
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:03,541
So...

532
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:05,553
you were her teacher, you say?

533
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:07,478
No, actually...

534
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,234
I'm a nun.

535
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,530
You don't look like a nun.

536
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:13,886
Honey, they're not
always in their habits.

537
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,952
He's a little old-fashioned.

538
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:17,120
So, you were her...

539
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:19,050
Sunday school teacher?

540
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:25,937
I, uh...

541
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:28,599
remember her little blue coat.

542
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:29,601
Oh, yeah.

543
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,168
I bought that for her
'cause she pitched

544
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,331
a full-on fit in the middle
of Filene's basement.

545
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,722
That girl could not take
no for an answer.

546
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,082
Right, Hank?

547
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:39,827
The truth is,

548
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:42,589
Mr. and Mrs. Stone...

549
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:44,073
I came here

550
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:45,511
to tell you a story about

551
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:47,582
(door opens)
your daughter, Missy.

552
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:48,723
And I want...

553
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:49,960
(sighs)

554
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:51,439
What a night.

555
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,782
Big bus accident...
three people dead,

556
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,756
everyone else a bloody mess.

557
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:58,094
- Oh, sweetheart.
- She sleep through the night?

558
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,617
Yeah, only woke up once
around 1:00 a.m.

559
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,115
Here's Mommy.

560
00:34:02,254 --> 00:34:04,564
We keep her when Missy
does the night shift.

561
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:07,146
Oh, Missy, this is Sister...

562
00:34:07,802 --> 00:34:08,649
Um...

563
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,280
what'd you say your name was?

564
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:12,789
You're Missy?

565
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:14,466
Little Missy?

566
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:17,184
With the blue coat?

567
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:20,514
Who are you?

568
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,173
I'm so confused.

569
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:32,340
I thought someone ran over you.

570
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,485
I thought you died out there,

571
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,327
on the street.

572
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,486
You mean back then,
when I was a girl?

573
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:41,788
(sighs)

574
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,052
Oh, forgive me. I, uh...

575
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:47,584
All these years, I've been...

576
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,067
lighting candles for your soul

577
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:51,883
and your parents.

578
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,887
You see, I, um...

579
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,721
The accident happened

580
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:58,711
right about the time
I was thinking of

581
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,490
joining the church.

582
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:02,897
In fact, it was...

583
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,922
one of the reasons
that led me...

584
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:08,835
to take the vows.

585
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:13,099
And recently, I've been
struggling with my faith,

586
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,411
wondering if I really
belong in the church,

587
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,071
and it made me think of you

588
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:20,471
and your tragedy.

589
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,417
I thought if I came...

590
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,748
(whimpers)

591
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,158
And here you are.

592
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,768
MRS. STONE:
Hank struggled, too. Um...

593
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:38,641
for a long time, he...

594
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:40,689
he wanted to get revenge
on the bastard who ran her

595
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:42,572
over, but I told him,

596
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:45,751
"Hank, our Missy came home
to us with a few"

597
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,217
broken bones. We get to live

598
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:49,504
with our daughter.

599
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:51,404
The monster who left her there

600
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,373
"has to live with himself."

601
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,993
No. I won't.
I have to stay awake.

602
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:04,084
Where is Sister Jude?
I need to speak to Sister Jude.

603
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:05,371
It's all right!

604
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,671
I'll see to her.

605
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:10,335
Where's Sister Jude?
I need to speak to Sister Jude.

606
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:12,054
Sister Jude is no longer
with us.

607
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,910
I'm in charge now.

608
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:16,784
- You?
- That's right.

609
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,283
- Now, you simply must take...
- No.

610
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,575
You don't understand.

611
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:22,128
Dr. Thredson...

612
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:23,685
Dr. Thredson isn't here either.

613
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,165
He's a murderer.

614
00:36:26,572 --> 00:36:28,368
- What?
- He killed Wendy.

615
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:29,841
Wendy?

616
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,104
My Wendy.

617
00:36:31,226 --> 00:36:32,226
And all the others.

618
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,347
It was him.

619
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:34,468
It was Thredson.

620
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:35,891
Right from the start,
it was him.

621
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:37,471
You have to send for the police.

622
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:39,027
You have to stop him.

623
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,076
Calm down.

624
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:42,211
Get back in bed, please,

625
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:43,998
or I'll be forced to get
Frank to restrain you.

626
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,205
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

627
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,167
I can't be chained down again.

628
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:49,340
You don't know what happened.

629
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:51,114
I know you've been in a very,

630
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,900
very serious
automobile accident,

631
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:55,008
and you're confused.

632
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,472
I'm not confused!

633
00:36:56,574 --> 00:36:59,252
I am telling you,
Kit Walker is innocent!

634
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:01,733
Oliver Thredson is Bloody Face.

635
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:05,635
I love your work, Bloody Face.

636
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,397
(cackling)

637
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,179
He admitted everything to me.

638
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:11,868
What he does to them.

639
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,241
I believe you.

640
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:16,169
You do?

641
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:18,331
Yes.

642
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:24,400
Please, Sister,

643
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:25,945
he cannot know that I am here.

644
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,607
No one knows.

645
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,295
No one knows that you're here.

646
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:34,276
Now, please, just...
just take these.

647
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:36,084
You have to go to the police.

648
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,027
All of the evidence
is in his basement.

649
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:40,380
I understand.

650
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,067
I do.

651
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,388
It's where he kills them.

652
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,829
It's where he violated me.

653
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,744
You're safe now.

654
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:07,404
How is she?

655
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,479
She's still very confused,
I'm afraid.

656
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,109
She claims that
Dr. Thredson attacked her.

657
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:14,125
She claims... well...

658
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,388
She insists that Kit
Walker is innocent.

659
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,754
Well, state police got
a different opinion.

660
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:22,175
Kit Walker escaped custody.

661
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:23,617
He's a fugitive.

662
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:25,516
Order on him is shoot on sight.

663
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:26,786
My gracious.

664
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:57,036
My child, what are you doing

665
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,564
down here?

666
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,881
Only a day ago you were
at the brink of death.

667
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:02,875
You should be convalescing.

668
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:04,421
Didn't you hear?

669
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,533
I'm Dr. Arden's little miracle.

670
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,089
Yet, I open my eyes,
and I'm still at Briarcliff.

671
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:12,125
Can't say that's much
of an improvement.

672
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,212
You make the best
of what life gives you.

673
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:15,474
Come, Grace, go to your...

674
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,933
No, please, Sister.

675
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:18,407
I'm gonna crawl
out of my skin if I have

676
00:39:18,516 --> 00:39:20,314
to lay on that bed again.

677
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:26,770
When I'm done cleaning up,
you'll have to go.

678
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:37,004
KIT:
Actually, you have to go now.

679
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,493
What are you doing here?

680
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,552
I couldn't let you
die here, Grace.

681
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:50,819
Now come on.

682
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:54,791
- Help!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

683
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,716
Help! (Growls)

684
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:02,540
(grunts)

685
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,677
No!

686
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:06,047
Hey!

687
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:16,308
- Drop it.
- No!

688
00:40:24,476 --> 00:40:26,337
(echoing): - Grace?
- Stay away from her!

689
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,554
Back up or I'll shoot you!

690
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:30,288
Walker, I'll shoot you.

691
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,575
Put your hands where
I can see them. Back up.

692
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:36,898
Are you ready for me?

693
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:40,813
Yes.

694
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:55,160
I'm free.
