Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,585
The road to power is paved
with hypocrisy...

3
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:08,237
...and casualties.

4
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,920
Never regret.

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:14,086
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,048
Whoever it is, they done stepped on
the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.

7
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:21,149
You help me repair
my relationship with Garrett,

8
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:25,314
Dan and I here get the money
flowing back in the right direction.

9
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,491
How about this? I get the BIA
to investigate both of you.

10
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:30,577
You implicate us,
you implicate yourself.

11
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:32,813
He sent them this. Is that you?

12
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,239
<i>You and I are just
pawns, Mr. Galloway.</i>

13
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,877
- How about I tell the press...
- Adam, shut up!

14
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:39,023
<i>We're giving you an out, Adam.</i>

15
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:43,038
<i>And if you choose not to take it,</i>
I will bury you.

16
00:00:43,764 --> 00:00:46,486
<i>My gut says there's more to
Xander Feng than has been reported.</i>

17
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:49,744
It's a far better use of my time
than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.

18
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,256
- You scared of this?
- Darnell!

19
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:53,479
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,678
<i>We have to strike
back hard and fast.</i>

21
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:58,589
<i>More than that.</i>
Let's make him suffer.

22

23
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:38,065
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.

24
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:41,264
"Do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God,

25
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:44,345
by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

26
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:50,211
Let all bitterness and wrath
and anger and clamour,

27
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:54,730
and evil speaking be put away
from you with all malice.

28
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,891
And be kind to one another,

29
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:01,572
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another."

30
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:08,106
Do you want me to keep going
with this, or something else?

31
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,666
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.

32
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:24,146
Doug, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

33
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,825
You said that she was
just staying for a few nights.

34
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:45,505
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.

35
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:49,385
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.

36
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,825
What's her name?

37
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,505
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?

38
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,345
You don't have anything
to worry about.

39
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:57,025
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.

40
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:59,386
There's a sleepover with some
of the kids from the day care.

41
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,866
Does she know about me?

42
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,545
No, I haven't told her anything.

43
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:07,505
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,

44
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,747
- and you've taken advantage...
- I'm not kicking her out.

45
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:17,226
- I could have said nothing,
but I told you. - I have to go.

46
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:21,586
She better be gone
by the next time we talk.

47
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:47,265
- Sir.
- What took you so long?

48
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,785
I can have a briefing ready
in five minutes.

49
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,224
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.

50
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,665
He doesn't have
security clearance.

51
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,385
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.

52
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,345
I'll see you in my office.

53
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,585
<i>Japanese sovereignty</i>
<i>is a matter of precedent.</i>

54
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,785
Mr. Prime Minister,
my concern is escalation.

55
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,584
<i>Well, I'm asking for a small</i>
<i>portion of the 7th Fleet.</i>

56
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:09,345
<i>We must bring China into line.</i>

57
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:12,344
<i>Show them that the US and Japan</i>
<i>maintain a strong alliance.</i>

58
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,505
Have you reached out
directly to Beijing?

59
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,625
<i>No recognition that</i>
<i>the island belongs to Japan.</i>

60
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:19,745
Well, I'd like to speak to my
team and formulate a plan.

61
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,264
<i>- Thank you, Mr. President.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

62
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,986
Admiral,
for those catching up...

63
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:28,145
Two Chinese destroyers
entered waters

64
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:31,465
within three miles
of Yonaguni Island here,

65
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:35,905
approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.

66
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:38,105
This is different than the standoff
over the Senkaku Islands.

67
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,785
It could have to do
with shipping routes.

68
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,865
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids,

69
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,305
so they're picking
on the little one.

70
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:45,825
- Do you see that?
- What?

71
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,904
In the alley, camera two.

72
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:52,024
All posts, white male,
hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.

73
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,186
Southeast side of Fair St.

74
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,745
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag

75
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,746
and place your hands
on your head.

76
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,465
Stay right where you are.

77
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:38,865
Mrs. Underwood? Will you
come downstairs, please?

78
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:42,505
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House,

79
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,105
there was an emergency meeting.

80
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:46,745
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.

81
00:05:49,237 --> 00:07:19,237

82
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,105
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?

83
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:26,304
Ninety miles north. We could have
ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.

84
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:29,785
But even sending them in that direction will
be picked up by the Chinese satellites.

85
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:32,184
Well, we have to stand with our allies,
that can't be in question.

86
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,705
What if we don't send ships,
just make a strong statement

87
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:37,144
condemning their excursion
into Japan's territorial waters.

88
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:40,105
We still have to offer the Chinese
an incentive to call back their destroyers.

89
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:43,345
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like
to have contingency plans in place.

90
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,744
- Already drafting them, sir. - Cathy, open
up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.

91
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:50,464
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't
have one, let's create a list of options.

92
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:54,625
- Right away, sir. - How about coordination
with the Japanese navy?

93
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:57,505
Go. Don't engage
with our navy yet.

94
00:07:57,506 --> 00:08:01,666
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister
Oshiro and express our intentions.

95
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:10,105
Former marine. He showed up at the outer
perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.

96
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,985
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.

97
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:14,145
We apprehended him,
the press isn't aware.

98
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:16,344
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible

99
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,625
for sending the package
of white powder to the capitol.

100
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:21,385
So this time he really wanted
to take me out for real.

101
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:26,744
Not exactly. His wife got an abortion last
week without telling him.

102
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:30,664
- Oh, my God. It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.

103
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:32,704
We'd like to keep you
down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,

104
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,825
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.

105
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:37,504
No, you have to get back
to the White House.

106
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:40,105
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine. Honestly.

107
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,264
I'm just gonna be in here.

108
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:46,465
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.

109
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,545
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on...

110
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:53,346
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir. As long as necessary.

111
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,585
I'll be back as soon as I can.

112
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:01,866
It's OK.

113
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,825
Don't go to California.

114
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:19,426
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.

115
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,225
You're gonna win.

116
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,905
Not if I don't give
the voters more face time.

117
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,905
When did you get it?

118
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:47,425
- The Army?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,345
It's grown since then.

120
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,866
Tell me about it.

121
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:56,665
No.

122
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:59,465
Why not?

123
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,626
I don't want to.

124
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,305
What are you doing?

125
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:17,426
Tell me about the tattoo.

126
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:24,824
- That's not fair.
- So what?

127
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,904
You think you can just get me
wet and I'll spill everything?

128
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:32,426
- I don't think so...
- Mm...

129
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:36,345
...I know so.

130
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:50,945
Tell me.

131
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:54,945
I like the pain.

132
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:01,825
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:04,946
How bad did it hurt?

134
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,665
It hurt a lot.

135
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,985
You like when it hurts?

136
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:20,665
I killed a lot of people.

137
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,305
What?

138
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,465
In the Army.

139
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:34,945
The pain...

140
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,266
...it helped.

141
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,226
Finish.

142
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:56,824
The most I could find
was some wrangling with the EPA

143
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:59,823
when he opened his first plant,
but that was almost 40 years ago.

144
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:03,384
- We need more. I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.

145
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:05,664
If you haven't found anything now,
what makes you think you will?

146
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,744
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.

147
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:11,985
You think Tusk isn't planning
his next attack even as we speak?

148
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:15,424
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.

149
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,385
You want to shift tactics?

150
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,665
The casino. We go public
as soon as possible.

151
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,345
You said that was a last resort.

152
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:25,144
Seth, you need to find a way
to make that happen

153
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,824
so it doesn't link to us.

154
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,583
If we launch that missile,
it could blow us up too.

155
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,064
Not if we spin it right.

156
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,704
- If we keep the focus on...
- Seth.

157
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,504
You're here to listen,
not contribute.

158
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,065
I wouldn't have him here if I
didn't want him to contribute.

159
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:40,905
Sir... he's been sitting
with this for three hours.

160
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:42,744
I've been working on it
for three months.

161
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:43,945
And accomplished nothing.

162
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,425
It's time we go on the
offensive.

163
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,544
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.

164
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:50,424
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?

165
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,744
She never mentioned a casino,
but now that I know what the dots are,

166
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:56,306
I can see that she's
starting to connect them.

167
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,384
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.

168
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,744
I imagine they're
waiting on the White House.

169
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:07,786
I hear there have been regular meetings
in the Situation Room since last night.

170
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:16,745
Let me call you right back.

171
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,864
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.

172
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,784
- I just sent you a picture.
<i>- Yeah, I got it.</i>

173
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:46,424
- What does it mean?
<i>- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.</i>

174
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,944
- Tell me. <i>- "Pursue currency" would be</i>
<i>the most literal translation.</i>

175
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,224
<i>Or "pursue money."</i>

176
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:56,024
- Follow the money?
<i>- That could work.</i>

177
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,625
Thanks, Lynne.

178
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,984
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?

179
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:19,864
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.

180
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:23,064
You get so used to a place,
the smallest things stand out.

181
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,144
I apologize for not
being responsive sooner.

182
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,384
I've been focused
on the midterms.

183
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:30,543
Oh, there's no need to explain.

184
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:35,185
Mrs. Underwood, you know how
much I respect your intentions,

185
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:38,825
but I've thought
deeply about this and

186
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:42,224
I can't cosponsor the bill
in its current form.

187
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:44,625
Civilian oversight
is too extreme a step,

188
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:48,823
but I'd be happy to revisit some
of the other less extreme proposals.

189
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:51,585
You think we're being extremist?

190
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,304
I want to help with this issue,
but this bill goes through...

191
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:58,305
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.

192
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:01,424
Almost every woman in the
House supports this bill.

193
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:06,264
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.

194
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:08,944
I didn't lie. I didn't lie.

195
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:12,904
I... I want to help. As long as
we rethink some of the language.

196
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:16,064
Are you trying to distance yourself
from us because of the Galloway scandal?

197
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,505
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances

198
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:21,345
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.

199
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:24,584
It's because I honestly don't
believe in this approach.

200
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:28,424
Do you realize
the message this sends?

201
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:33,224
The only woman in congressional leadership
in both parties, and you bow out?

202
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:38,704
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't
just bow out. I'll actively fight it.

203
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:42,144
You never asked my position.
You assumed.

204
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,664
I can't imagine
what that position must be.

205
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:48,145
I've served in war zones,
I know firsthand how important...

206
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:50,304
We're not talking
about war zones.

207
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:52,225
We're talking
about sexual assault.

208
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,224
How about a military commission
to review the internal...

209
00:15:56,225 --> 00:16:00,625
We don't need more studies,
we need reform.

210
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,584
Well, let's continue this conversation
when I return from California.

211
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:09,544
I'll be back the day
after tomorrow if you change your mind.

212
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:14,066
I won't, but I hope
you change yours.

213
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:23,064
China was insulted at the notion that
we could buy them off.

214
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,144
Do I need
to call President Qian?

215
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:27,264
I doubt he would contradict
one of his ministers.

216
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,064
See if he's willing
to talk one-on-one.

217
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,504
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing

218
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:34,904
to deploy three destroyers
and a light cruiser.

219
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,544
They're upping the ante.

220
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,105
Have Ambassador Hines
get in touch with the prime minister,

221
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,063
and ask if Japan will
hold off until I make contact with Beijing.

222
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:44,944
Yes, sir.

223
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,104
Have you gotten any rest at all?

224
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:50,905
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.

225
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,784
How's Claire?

226
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:58,745
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated
attempt, but they're being cautious.

227
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:02,464
After the Galloway thing
and the interview,

228
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,464
half the country thinks
she's a baby killer,

229
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:06,344
or an adulterer, or both.

230
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:09,504
But Claire's taking it in
stride. We're in good hands.

231
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:12,904
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.

232
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,064
One of us should, probably
the one that's calling all the shots.

233
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:18,505
No, I can hold out
a little while longer.

234
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,305
No, go to the residence,
spend some time with your wife.

235
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,144
You'll come back feeling
like a new man.

236
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:26,625
Honestly, it's less
stressful here.

237
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:33,025
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.

238
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:38,104
- I got rid of Christina
when Linda resigned. - I heard.

239
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:41,224
It's improved things some,
but...

240
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,864
...there's
still work to do.

241
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:46,704
Makes me tired
just to think about it.

242
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,984
Well, you probably wouldn't be the
first president to get a little shut-eye

243
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,785
on one of these sofas.

244
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:54,744
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.

245
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,864
Do the free world a favor
and get some rest.

246
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:59,304
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.

247
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:02,345
You should be nearby if President Qian
wants to get on the phone.

248
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,985
I've always loathed
the necessity of sleep.

249
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:20,184
Like death, it puts the most
powerful men on their backs.

250
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,384
<i>DC Limo and Bus Rental.</i>

251
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,824
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

252
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,824
We've got a corporate account.

253
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,623
<i>Let's see...</i>
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

254
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:35,224
<i>we don't have one</i>
<i>in our records.</i>

255
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,384
My mistake.
I must've called

256
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,745
the wrong limo service.
Thank you.

257
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,705
<i>Missouri Bus and Limo.</i>

258
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,823
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

259
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:52,544
<i>- You're not Darlene.</i>
- No, Darlene is out sick.

260
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,904
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.

261
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:56,663
<i>How can I help you, Pam?</i>

262
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,984
We've got a flight
coming in from China tomorrow.

263
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,865
We'll need some transportation.

264
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:04,785
<i>How many you got coming?</i>

265
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,263
I don't have the manifest
right in front of me.

266
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:08,304
<i>- The usual?</i>
- That's right.

267
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:11,024
<i>- So a luxury bus.</i>
- How many does that fit?

268
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,904
<i>Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.</i>
<i>Should be plenty of room.</i>

269
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,464
That's great, thanks.

270
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,783
Do you think
it's really her conscience,

271
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,384
or because the
bill's controversial?

272
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:21,944
I don't think she would have
threatened to fight us

273
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:24,824
if all she wanted to do
was avoid controversy.

274
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,824
I'll talk to her.

275
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:29,344
I really want this bill to pass.

276
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:32,384
I know you do, so do I.

277
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:34,865
We need Jackie more
than ever, Francis.

278
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,144
I'm damaged goods,
this whole Adam thing.

279
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,744
No, you're not.
We fought past that.

280
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:45,024
Well, there's plenty of people
who still believe it's true.

281
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:48,065
We'll get it passed, I promise.

282
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:54,905
- No, thanks.
- Come on. It's no fun doing it alone.

283
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:00,544
We could just go for a run.

284
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:03,824
No more runs until the death
threats die down, that's the new rule.

285
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,545
But they let you go
to the office.

286
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:07,704
Because I was
in a bulletproof car.

287
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,503
Does this mean
we've officially not quit?

288
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,865
We've never been quitters,
have we?

289
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:19,704
Sir, Mrs. Underwood,
sorry to interrupt.

290
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:23,384
I was gonna head home,
but I'll stick around if you want me to.

291
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,943
Oh, no. You've been up long
enough. Get some sleep.

292
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:28,264
I'll be back first
thing in the morning.

293
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,064
Thank you for looking
after me today.

294
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:34,185
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.

295
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:40,503
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.

296
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,825
It's rare to find
someone like Edward.

297
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:48,705
- What?
- You never use his first name.

298
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,585
Oh, did I?

299
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,944
I don't feel right
talking about her like this.

300
00:20:56,945 --> 00:21:00,383
It's just... technically,
she's my boss now.

301
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,664
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.

302
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:07,064
Which means it's coming directly
from the vice president.

303
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:16,184
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton
around from time to time.

304
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:18,864
Do you know what he and the
congresswoman were discussing?

305
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:21,344
No, they were private meetings.

306
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:25,184
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.

307
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:29,384
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.

308
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:31,545
Most of the time
pretty late at night.

309
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:36,064
Did the money
originate in China?

310
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:38,344
<i>The money came</i>
<i>from tribal revenue.</i>

311
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,104
<i>As our FEC reports</i>
<i>clearly stated.</i>

312
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,944
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue

313
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:45,704
come from Chinese visitors
who gambled at your casino?

314
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,824
<i>We have visitors</i>
<i>from all over the world.</i>

315
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:51,425
I'm speaking specifically about
a businessman named Xander Feng.

316
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:54,624
I have no idea who that is.

317
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,264
<i>I'm looking at FAA</i>
<i>flight records that show</i>

318
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,304
<i>a private plane he owns</i>
<i>making numerous trips</i>

319
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:01,464
<i>to Kansas City. And I spoke</i>
<i>with Missouri Bus and Limo,</i>

320
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:04,184
which has transported Chinese
visitors to your casino.

321
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:05,984
<i>- Ms. Said...</i>
- Sayyad.

322
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:08,464
<i>Ms. Sayyad, the only reason</i>
<i>I returned your call</i>

323
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:10,583
<i>was because you work</i>
<i>for</i> The Telegraph.

324
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:13,784
<i>It's not every day that I get a call
from a paper as big as yours.</i>

325
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:16,503
But I don't know what you're trying
to get at here, so if you'll excuse...

326
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:18,065
What about Raymond Tusk?

327
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,304
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.

328
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:24,744
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.

329
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,824
<i>That looks like foreign money</i>
<i>being used to influence political...</i>

330
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,543
What you're insinuating
is not only wrong,

331
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:33,623
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.

332
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:36,383
I won't bat an eyelash
getting my attorneys involved.

333
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:38,864
<i>Tusk made the same threat.</i>

334
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,224
<i>If a man worth 40 billion</i>
<i>dollars doesn't intimidate me,</i>

335
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,865
<i>you certainly don't,</i>
<i>Mr. Lana...</i>

336
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:49,983
Hello?
He hung up.

337
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:52,384
<i>I had nothing</i>
<i>to do with it, Raymond.</i>

338
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,903
I can smell the horseshit
through the phone.

339
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:57,384
<i>You think I'd put</i>
<i>myself at this great a risk?</i>

340
00:22:57,385 --> 00:22:59,583
Desperate men
are capable of anything.

341
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,183
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.

342
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:05,303
I have no control
over the press, Raymond.

343
00:23:05,304 --> 00:23:07,464
<i>You'll destroy</i>
<i>yourself, Frank, not me.</i>

344
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:09,705
Thank you for that
unsolicited advice.

345
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,944
Work with Doyle,
make sure we have no weak spots.

346
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:15,024
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?

347
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:20,024
Well, it looks like Jackie may
be sleeping with the enemy.

348
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:24,303
Lanagin is correct in saying
we run the risk of libel.

349
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:25,984
These links
are supported by fact.

350
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,824
Individually, but you can't
complete the circle.

351
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,224
I'm not saying the
headline should read:

352
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,864
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!

353
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:34,704
Just that we present the
landscape as we currently know it.

354
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,264
We're first and foremost
a financial paper.

355
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,224
Many of our readers
worship Raymond Tusk.

356
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,703
So we just protect him?

357
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:41,984
We don't insinuate
connections we can't back up.

358
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:44,944
If there's any basis for litigation, you
can be sure his team will be aggressive.

359
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:47,064
They've bankrupted
papers before.

360
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:50,223
I think you should slow down and take
your time. When, and if, you have a story...

361
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,664
Mr. Maxfield,
Raymond Tusk is on the line.

362
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,664
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.

363
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,463
He's specifically
asking for you, sir.

364
00:23:57,464 --> 00:23:59,664
We got off the phone
with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.

365
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:01,983
That means Tusk was the
first call Lanagin made.

366
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,663
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?

367
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:06,504
They're not talking to anyone
until after the president

368
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:08,184
does his press briefing
tomorrow.

369
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:09,943
All right, walk me through

370
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:11,985
all of this again,
point by point.

371
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:06,304
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.

372
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:09,944
No. What is it?

373
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:20,104
I'd like to put in a request to
be on your wife's detail full time.

374
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,104
At least until the death threats
quiet down.

375
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:24,543
That's very thoughtful.

376
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,263
I'll only do it if you approve,
sir.

377
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:28,104
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.

378
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:31,103
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.

379
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,064
I'll let Agent Rockland know.

380
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:36,744
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.

381
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,384
You didn't interrupt anything.

382
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:40,945
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.

383
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:47,703
- Hey.
- Hey.

384
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,783
You'll never believe
what just happened.

385
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,784
- What?
- Meechum came into the office

386
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:56,144
and found me
watching something...

387
00:25:56,145 --> 00:26:01,743
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!

388
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:05,384
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.

389
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:09,224
- Were you...?
- No, no. I was just watching.

390
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:12,023
That's really funny.

391
00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:13,984
What about you?
What are you watching?

392
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:17,424
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.

393
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:18,904
I forgot about that.

394
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,864
So did I, until I found it
in the desk this morning.

395
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:22,624
Let me see.

396
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,544
<i>...been there, like I have.</i>

397
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:26,943
<i>Of course, it doesn't hurt to</i>
<i>have a little Texas in them...</i>

398
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,744
My God, look how young we are.

399
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,424
I know.

400
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,224
<i>Everyone here has been</i>
<i>so kind, and so welcoming.</i>

401
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,504
<i>We'll have her rooting</i>
<i>for Clemson before too long.</i>

402
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:38,185
<i>That's where</i>
<i>I have to draw the line.</i>

403
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:44,464
Do you miss being with Adam?

404
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:46,345
Where did that come from?

405
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:50,983
Miss it? No.

406
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,824
Well, you must, sometimes.

407
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:59,583
He meant a lot
to me for a while.

408
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,944
But that's done now.

409
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:05,343
What about you?

410
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,505
What about me?

411
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:11,425
Are you unsatisfied?

412
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:16,104
There's just
too much at stake now.

413
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:18,344
No one we can trust.

414
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,024
We don't have
the freedom we once did.

415
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,025
Maybe it's better this way.

416
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:30,785
No room for distractions.

417
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,664
I don't mind the sacrifice.

418
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:36,424
We chose this instead.

419
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,263
<i>I think the one thing</i>
<i>we can agree on</i>

420
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:40,264
<i>is the ribs here are better.</i>

421
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:42,143
<i>See, he's just trying</i>
<i>to get under my skin.</i>

422
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,463
<i>No, it's not even debatable...</i>

423
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:54,384
- How was California?
- Oh...

424
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:58,704
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.

425
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:02,224
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.

426
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:06,743
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.

427
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:08,983
Took 85 years to complete it.

428
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:12,624
- How long did it take to
complete the bridge? - About four years.

429
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,944
It opened a few months
after FDR's second inaugural.

430
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,143
There was a man
who got things done.

431
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:20,624
Strong beliefs
and he stuck to them.

432
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,584
But compromised when he had to.

433
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,783
I assume you're here
to talk about Claire's bill.

434
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:28,983
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen

435
00:28:28,984 --> 00:28:31,063
cosponsors on either
side of the aisle.

436
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:33,303
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.

437
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:37,224
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking,

438
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:39,063
but I doubt I'll convince you
anymore...

439
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,904
Putting aside the military's
honor, chain of command,

440
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,745
all the things
that you hold dear...

441
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:48,624
...let's consider
one simple fact.

442
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,863
You wouldn't have this office
if it weren't for me.

443
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:56,503
I made very clear
that I wouldn't be a puppet.

444
00:28:56,504 --> 00:29:00,744
I'm not trying to pull strings,
but you could show a little gratitude.

445
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:05,343
If it were anything else,
Mr. Vice President... but not this.

446
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,304
All you're doing is making
the inevitable more difficult.

447
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:10,864
It's not inevitable. Claire
doesn't have the votes yet.

448
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:14,544
You really want
to fight us on this.

449
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,503
I don't want
to fight you at all.

450
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,504
Which is why I suggested to
Claire that we sit down...

451
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:21,663
I neither have the time
nor the inclination to negotiate with you!

452
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:25,744
Cosponsor the bill, whip
the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.

453
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:28,424
Then I'm no longer listening.

454
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:34,423
You don't have just this office
to thank me for.

455
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:37,623
If you win reelection,
you can thank me for that, too.

456
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:40,304
Those attack ads didn't just
disappear on their own.

457
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:43,264
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.

458
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,783
And ask him about Raymond Tusk
while you're at it.

459
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,504
That ought to make for some very
interesting pillow talk.

460
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,064
You keep up the good work,
Nancy.

461
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:07,663
I will, Mr. Vice President.

462
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:10,543
I miss having you around,
but you're my eyes and ears now,

463
00:30:10,544 --> 00:30:12,503
otherwise I'd steal
you back in a heartbeat.

464
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:16,144
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.

465
00:30:22,024 --> 00:30:24,544
- Doug?
- I'm busy.

466
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,024
The story just broke.

467
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,824
They timed it with
the president's press conference.

468
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,103
Connect me with
the vice president.

469
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:41,103
<i>So the 7th Fleet is</i>
<i>currently positioned near Guam,</i>

470
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:45,584
<i>where it will remain if China removes
its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.</i>

471
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:48,223
<i>I've been in frequent touch</i>
<i>with prime minister Oshiro,</i>

472
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:50,863
<i>and have made personal</i>
<i>overtures to President Qian.</i>

473
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:53,983
<i>And I remain optimistic</i>
<i>that tensions will be quelled</i>

474
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:57,264
<i>without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.</i>

475
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:59,304
<i>- Henry, you first.</i>
<i>- Can you comment</i>

476
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:01,263
<i>on the</i> Wall Street Telegraph
<i>article...</i>

477
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:04,503
<i>I was just notified of that</i>
<i>moments before I joined you.</i>

478
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,183
<i>I haven't had a chance to read</i>
<i>it yet. Yeah, Jane.</i>

479
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:07,904
<i>Mr. President, would</i>
<i>you walk us through</i>

480
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,704
<i>your history with Raymond Tusk?</i>

481
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:13,023
<i>I'm here to answer questions on</i>
<i>Sino-Japanese relations. Mark.</i>

482
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:16,662
<i>The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy
and influential Chinese business...</i>

483
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:18,543
<i>Unless this has to do with the</i>
<i>statement I just made...</i>

484
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,463
<i>It does, Mr. President.</i>
<i>Feng has ties</i>

485
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,224
<i>to the standing committee</i>
<i>and we're currently in a</i>

486
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:23,984
<i>standoff with the Chinese.</i>
<i>Economically...</i>

487
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:25,584
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

488
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:29,984
It's not beginning the story
that I fear,

489
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:31,703
it's not knowing
how it will end.

490
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:35,624
Everyone is fair game now,
including me.

491
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:39,023
<i>This is par for the course, what we've
come to expect from President Walker.</i>

492
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,184
<i>Whenever he's selling a shiny
new car, he can't say enough about it.</i>

493
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:44,823
<i>The engine breaks down,</i>
<i>the transmission gives out,</i>

494
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:47,903
<i>he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something,</i>

495
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:50,943
<i>our warranty is the Constitution of the</i>
<i>United States,</i>

496
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,904
<i>and there's no limit on that.</i>
<i>He needs to read the fine print</i>

497
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,183
<i>and start answering</i>
<i>our questions.</i>

498
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:59,943
<i>If any of this is true, we're
talking Congress, the White House,</i>

499
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:02,903
<i>both parties...</i>
<i>Now, I'm saying "if,"</i>

500
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:05,983
<i>but when it look like dirty money,</i>
<i>and it smells like dirty money,</i>

501
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:07,863
<i>somebody has probably got dirt</i>
<i>under their nails.</i>

502
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:10,064
<i>Look, there's no real proof</i>
<i>this money laundering is even...</i>

503
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,503
<i>The connections are troubling,</i>
<i>especially Underwood.</i>

504
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:15,664
<i>He was the House whip the entire time
Adohi were contributing to the Democrats,</i>

505
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:17,823
<i>and he's working side by side</i>
<i>with the president now.</i>

506
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:19,623
<i>The president. So this goes all</i>
<i>the way to the White House?</i>

507
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:21,783
<i>- It might.</i>
<i>- It's hypothetical. And by the way,</i>

508
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:23,543
<i>you've cherry-picked the facts</i>
<i>to make your case.</i>

509
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:25,704
<i>I'm not making a case.</i>

510
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:28,263
<i>PAC Money Raises Questions.</i>
<i>And it has.</i>

511
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:30,183
<i>I haven't answered</i>
<i>those questions,</i>

512
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,583
<i>but I think the American people</i>
<i>deserve answers. Don't you?</i>

513
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:36,383
You can bet your bottom dollar
the attorney general is gonna investigate.

514
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:39,824
- With the firestorm this is causing in
the media... - What's our course of action?

515
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,824
As your counsel, I would encourage you
not to speak to the press

516
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:45,983
until we have more information.
As your average citizen,

517
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:48,183
the longer you wait,
the more suspicious it looks.

518
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:50,943
If there's been any irregularity,
I had nothing to do with it.

519
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,064
Your friendship with Tusk
implies guilt by association.

520
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,743
Are we presuming guilt
before innocence?

521
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:58,224
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.

522
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:00,664
But public opinion
doesn't have a law degree.

523
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,304
Give us a few moments.

524
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:09,343
I have to advise you not to have
any conversation about this matter

525
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:12,023
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.

526
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,824
I'll be right outside.

527
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:19,464
Is this what you were keeping
from me?

528
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,863
We should follow
your counsel's advice

529
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:24,023
- and not...
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.

530
00:33:24,024 --> 00:33:26,343
With Bill out of the room,
we open ourselves up to...

531
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:30,904
Damn it, Frank! I've been in the dark
too long on this. That ends now.

532
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:38,303
I don't know any details.

533
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,023
Feng told me if the Bridge
project got approved,

534
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:43,903
the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.

535
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:46,743
Jesus Christ, that connects
the White House directly to the money.

536
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:50,864
No, sir. You knew nothing,
you still know nothing.

537
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:53,503
If the DOJ finds any concrete
evidence of foreign money...

538
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:56,303
That's Raymond Tusk's head,
not yours. You've done nothing wrong.

539
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:58,303
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.

540
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:01,903
If the DOJ investigates,
it will only prove your innocence.

541
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:04,703
Nobody walks away from something
like this without bruises.

542
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:06,943
Well, bruises you can survive.

543
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,543
I just don't know how we can
avoid it at this point.

544
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:11,984
Unless you want to accelerate
the process and get rid of it.

545
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:15,543
We could always have the attorney
general appoint a special prosecutor.

546
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:18,343
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.

547
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:21,423
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not
inclined to follow your suggestions.

548
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:23,743
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was
something you should do.

549
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:26,703
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.

550
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:29,223
I think it's better to drag these
things out as long as possible.

551
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:32,863
- Let the public fatigue on it. - And have it
hanging over our heads until the midterms?

552
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,343
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.

553
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:38,064
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical
drone strikes in the South China Sea.

554
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:40,303
I can't be dealing with
something like this for months on end.

555
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:43,062
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.

556
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:44,823
I didn't say that, you did.

557
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:47,023
Oh, no. I just meant in terms
of getting it off your plate.

558
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:49,143
It wouldn't be on my plate
if you kept me better informed.

559
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:51,783
I have done nothing but try
to insulate you, sir.

560
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:54,184
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy
I just went through?

561
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:58,983
I make this solemn promise
to you, Mr. President.

562
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:02,543
I will take the fall
if it comes to that, but it won't.

563
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:06,102
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.

564
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:09,264
We probably shouldn't
involve a special prosecutor.

565
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:14,743
Send Bill back in.

566
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,624
You knew about this.

567
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:23,263
Tusk is a client,
doesn't mean I know everything...

568
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,943
Bullshit. The reason you're
a partner at Glendon Hill

569
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:29,104
is because you know the
things nobody else does.

570
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,383
What do you want me to say?

571
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:35,504
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.

572
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:38,423
We're not in bed,
we're in my fucking office.

573
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:40,343
And in here, you work for Frank.

574
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:43,103
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.

575
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:48,543
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods
for whoever can pay the highest retainer.

576
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:51,743
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs,
I'm fully aware and willing,

577
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:55,383
but you're worse. You're Frank's bitch
and refuse to believe it.

578
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:58,463
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.

579
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:01,223
Don't turn this. You knew about
the money and you didn't tell me.

580
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:03,663
Even though it's thrown
my seat into contention.

581
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:07,063
Let's say there was money,
and let's say I did know,

582
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:11,024
- what good would it have done? - It means
you were willing to watch me lose!

583
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:13,104
It means I respected the
boundaries that you demanded.

584
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:16,342
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!

585
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:20,182
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!

586
00:36:20,183 --> 00:36:22,224
You can't have it both ways.

587
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:26,545
Were you...?

588
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:28,663
Was I what?

589
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:32,184
...fucking me
to get info on Frank?

590
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:44,342
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.

591
00:36:44,343 --> 00:36:48,343
I care about
you more than I should.

592
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:50,264
But I'm getting tired
of having to say it.

593
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:56,502
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric
facility for assessment.

594
00:36:56,503 --> 00:37:00,063
Then a high security detention center
until the official sentencing.

595
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:02,262
Well, that's good to hear.

596
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,423
The bad news is we don't want
you doing any public events for a while.

597
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,943
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.

598
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:13,343
Your death threats continue to
rise. We can't take the risk.

599
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,822
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.

600
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,703
But we want you
to avoid large crowds.

601
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:22,183
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.

602
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:24,943
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood

603
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:27,024
on her new security protocol.

604
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,905
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.

605
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:35,823
How did it go?

606
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:39,223
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?

607
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:42,823
No. It could look like
I was trying to go behind his back.

608
00:37:42,824 --> 00:37:45,462
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.

609
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,144
Hopefully,
he'll disagree with it.

610
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,183
But this could've
been the wrong move.

611
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,303
Well, don't doubt yourself.

612
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,623
Seth has gotten over 3,000
e-mails in the last six hours.

613
00:37:54,624 --> 00:37:57,982
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?

614
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:00,543
I can't ignore
the Department of Justice.

615
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,144
What can I do?

616
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:05,304
Come and visit me
when I'm in prison.

617
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,184
You don't have
to stand by that door.

618
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:31,023
Take a load off.

619
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:33,423
Thank you, sir, but I'm
supposed to stay on my feet.

620
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:35,743
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

621
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:39,783
And if anybody gives you
any trouble about this,

622
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,464
or anything,
they can talk to me.

623
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:50,704
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,423
It's been strange not having
you around these last few days.

625
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:58,303
You want me to switch back
to your detail?

626
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,343
No, no. I'm glad
you're with Claire.

627
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:03,303
I just...

628
00:39:03,304 --> 00:39:07,543
...didn't realize how much I got used
to your company until you were gone.

629
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,744
Protecting her is the same
as protecting you, in my mind.

630
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:16,823
Oh, come on.

631
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:35,063
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?

632
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,223
I've always been awestruck,

633
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:42,183
people who are willing
to take a bullet for someone else.

634
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:46,384
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways
to serve your country.

635
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,224
And this is my way.

636
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:55,624
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.

637
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:58,623
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.

638
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,623
It's not for you either.

639
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,984
Well, come on over
and join the party.

640
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:10,183
Haven't you got sick
of seeing my face yet?

641
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:11,904
Never, ma'am.

642
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:19,503
To Meechum,
for his loyalty and service.

643
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,143
To Edward.

644
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,903
I'm on my way
to my lawyer's office, Remy.

645
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:33,983
That's not where I want to be
when I'd usually be in bed.

646
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,263
I can't stop Frank
from leaking things.

647
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:41,342
No, but you can make sure
he suffers more than us.

648
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:46,823
And I say "us," Remy, because
your skin is in this game now, too.

649
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:49,743
- Are you gonna deny?
<i>- Of course I'm gonna deny.</i>

650
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:52,182
Every step of this was legal.

651
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,463
They can't prove
the links between them.

652
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:58,863
<i>- What about Lanagin?</i> - He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.

653
00:40:58,864 --> 00:41:01,342
I'll find a way
to get in touch with him.

654
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:03,863
<i>We do have one major advantage.</i>

655
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:08,102
The public can hate me,
but as long as Clayton West

656
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:10,902
remains profitable, my
stockholders won't care.

657
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,862
Frank doesn't
have the same liberty.

658
00:41:13,863 --> 00:41:18,742
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.

659
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,582
I can work with
the Republicans on that.

660
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,582
<i>Well, we'll be under the</i>
<i>magnifying glass too.</i>

661
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,143
<i>This will be a witch hunt.</i>

662
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:26,024
I'll make sure that they pick
the right targets.

663
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:29,863
What you need to do
is go after the leadership.

664
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:34,503
Make them hurt. They'll turn on
Frank to save themselves.

665
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:37,063
<i>Birch, Womack, Sharp.</i>

666
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:41,184
<i>Especially Jackie Sharp.</i>
<i>She's his chosen one.</i>

667
00:41:43,464 --> 00:41:47,862
- Remy?
- I heard you. I got my marching orders.

668
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:50,863
<i>- I'm counting on you.</i>
- I'll deliver.

669
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:53,583
<i>Let's talk in the morning.</i>

670
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:56,382
The two names I like the most
are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.

671
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:57,863
Gaines has better credentials.

672
00:41:57,864 --> 00:41:59,542
But he's close
to the administration.

673
00:41:59,543 --> 00:42:00,743
I would've made him
a federal judge

674
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:02,343
if the GOP hadn't blocked it.

675
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:04,103
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.

676
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,143
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?

677
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:08,903
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general

678
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,782
would've put her on his list
if he thought she was a wild card.

679
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:14,223
Sir, I have to say,
I think this step is premature.

680
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:17,063
We should hold off and see what
the DOJ does on its own.

681
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:19,463
I don't want to do it,
Bill, but my fear is this:

682
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:21,703
if we wait until the water
goes from hot to boiling,

683
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,303
we seem reactionary,
not proactive.

684
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,942
But proactive could
also seem defensive.

685
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,063
Like the suspect that screams
"I didn't do it" before anyone asks.

686
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:32,063
Aside from that, we simply
haven't had time to prepare.

687
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:34,422
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.

688
00:42:34,423 --> 00:42:36,302
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.

689
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,063
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.

690
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:41,462
Bill, I'd like you to convey my
wishes to the attorney general.

691
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:44,662
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.

692
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,863
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.

693
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:53,343
The only thing more satisfying
than convincing someone to do what I want,

694
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:55,663
is failing to persuade them
on purpose.

695
00:42:55,664 --> 00:43:00,022
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign,
it just begs you to walk through the door.

696
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:02,143
Doyle's about halfway
through our initial background check.

697
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:04,142
Every donor,
every political event.

698
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:05,622
Everything that Dunbar
might be looking into.

699
00:43:05,623 --> 00:43:08,743
- Good. Seth?
- We avoid any official statement,

700
00:43:08,744 --> 00:43:10,503
follow the president's cue.

701
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,743
In the meantime, I'd like to
make some off the record calls.

702
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:15,183
You welcome the investigation,
it's the right step, et cetera.

703
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:16,702
Give folks the personal touch.

704
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:18,782
That's fine, as long
as we don't come off defensive.

705
00:43:18,783 --> 00:43:20,343
I'd like to see a list
of who you'd be calling.

706
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,023
Some of this is gonna be
on the fly,

707
00:43:22,024 --> 00:43:23,823
it'd be great
if I had a little leeway.

708
00:43:23,824 --> 00:43:25,382
Let Seth do his thing, you'll
have your hands full with Doyle.

709
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,582
I'll let you know
who I've called.

710
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,064
All right, let's get to work.

711
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:37,104
Sir?

712
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:40,622
Yes, what is it?

713
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,503
I understand that
you need to delegate,

714
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:44,022
but when you contradict me
in front of Seth,

715
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:45,542
it compromises
my authority over him.

716
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:47,462
You can't micromanage,
we have too much to do.

717
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,863
Seth is still new to the team.

718
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,983
I need to make sure that
he's doing his job properly.

719
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:56,143
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.

720
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:58,143
But I can't be that
if you won't let me.

721
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:06,262
Are you, Doug?

722
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:10,742
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?

723
00:44:10,743 --> 00:44:13,382
We're flying full throttle
into a hurricane,

724
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:15,262
and you're talking
office politics

725
00:44:15,263 --> 00:44:19,063
instead of focusing on making
sure we don't get ripped apart.

726
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:22,902
You're right, sir.

727
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:24,664
I shouldn't have brought it up.

728
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:07,702
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.

729
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:10,223
I told her I was
going for a walk.

730
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:14,183
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted
her gone, but you have to understand...

731
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:16,702
She can stay.

732
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:20,304
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.

733
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:23,543
I trust you to be smart.

734
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:29,783
Will you read to me?

735
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,663
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.

736
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:38,583
Just pull up something
on your phone.

737
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:47,703
- Like what? <i>- A Tale of Two Cities.</i>
My mom used to read it to me.

738
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:03,303
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,

739
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:06,064
it was the age of wisdom,

740
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:09,703
it was the age of foolishness,

741
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:12,502
it was the epoch of belief,

742
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,983
it was the epoch of incredulity,

743

we were all going
direct the other way."
