1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,593
When the enemy attacked,
you ran away.

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,137
That's treason.

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:10,889
Now it's time to splatter
your brains everywhere.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,476
Please! Please, don't kill me!

5
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:15,394
Shut up! Die like a man!

6
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,229
But I have a wife and family.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,064
[Imitates weapon firing]

8
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:20,691
That's what happens to cowards.

9
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,776
Hey, shh, shh, shh!
You have to keep it down.

10
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:25,779
- There's an important meeting going on.
- Sorry.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,365
I'll set you up
in the copy room.

12
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,283
You won't be in the way there.

13
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:30,951
[Francis]
This is gonna be a close vote.

14
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,786
Most of your colleagues
are not gonna wanna spend

15
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:34,997
this amount of money
in just 25 districts.

16
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,832
Try persuasion first.

17
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,501
Talking points
are in your packets.

18
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,336
And if you want
more detailed information...

19
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:43,506
research, statistics... you can
contact Gillian or myself.

20
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:45,548
And when it comes to doling
out favors, talk to Doug.

21
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,386
If favors don't work,
come to me directly. Peter.

22
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:50,095
I'll be campaigning
in Pennsylvania.

23
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,638
All my events this week

24
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,307
will be in counties
within the watershed,

25
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:54,975
so I'll be working
the media angle.

26
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,852
But if you need me to get
on the phone with anybody,

27
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:57,895
reach out to Christina.

28
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:58,896
She'll work it into my schedule.

29
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:00,439
I have to say, Frank,

30
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,316
$200 million
is going to be a hard sell.

31
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:04,068
The natural gas lobby's
already putting up a big fight.

32
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,153
We need to make this
about jobs.

33
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:08,780
But the drilling industry can offer
far more jobs than this bill can.

34
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:10,533
This bill doesn't threaten
those jobs,

35
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:11,950
it just makes sure the drilling
is done responsibly.

36
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,785
It adds more jobs
on top of that.

37
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:16,205
I've already been approached by
Sancorp with reelection funds.

38
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,749
I have too. They offered me
a donation package

39
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,376
from eight different
drilling companies.

40
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:22,585
- Remy Danton?
- Yep.

41
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:24,338
How many of you
been approached by Remy?

42
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,717
Look, I know it's not easy
to turn down money.

43
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:32,221
But if the Republicans control
redistricting in Pennsylvania,

44
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,223
we lose the house
next election,

45
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,641
and all of you lose
your committee chairmanships.

46
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,810
This is a feather
that we need in Peter's hat.

47
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:41,980
A loss on this bill
endangers his chance of winning,

48
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,733
and we are fighting
to keep our majority here.

49
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,944
Any other concerns?

50
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:49,488
I want a first vote count
by 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

51
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:52,324
Thank you all very much.

52
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:12,381
Sync and correction by GeirDM
www.addic7ed.com

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,047
It's brutal.
22 stops in three days.

54
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,674
- That's a lot of sleeping on the bus.
- No sleeping.

55
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,634
That bus is the only place
I can get work done.

56
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,554
You know, Francis did
a big bus tour in '98,

57
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:36,891
and the bus lost its brakes
going down a hill,

58
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,600
and we landed
in a tobacco field.

59
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:42,021
He gets out of the car,
knocks on the farmer's door,

60
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,023
writes a check
for all the damaged crops,

61
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,693
and then borrows his pickup so
he doesn't miss the next event.

62
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,028
And it was actually fun.

63
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,946
He was driving. I was shotgun.

64
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,322
We had the whole staff
in the flatbed.

65
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:54,742
We actually got there
ten minutes early.

66
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:56,265
- I think I should be here
to help drum up votes.

67
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,786
- Careful, sir. It's very hot.

68
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,164
Look, you and the vice president
will get national coverage.

69
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:01,874
That's gonna help us
with the count.

70
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,918
I reached out to him.
He never got back to me.

71
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,961
I don't know if he even knows the
talking points about the bill.

72
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,588
I don't think Jim wants to go.

73
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,506
He's doing it as a favor
to the president and I,

74
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,717
so it doesn't matter if he
doesn't know the talking points.

75
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,343
People wanna see him
be folksy, you know?

76
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:15,679
So just humor him.
Show him some degree of...

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,347
- aagh! Aagh!
- Oh, my God.

78
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,891
- Are you okay?
- [Kevin] It was an accident.

79
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,351
Okay, it's time for us to go.
I'm so sorry.

80
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:24,188
It's all right. I just need to
run it under some cold water.

81
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,150
I'm not going to lie.

82
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,611
I despise children.

83
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,529
There. I've said it.

84
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,573
You can't act
like that in here.

85
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,283
- You have to be a big boy.
- I know.

86
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:38,452
Peter, we really need
to get going.

87
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:41,122
We've already missed one flight
because the meeting went over.

88
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:43,498
I booked us another one
at 9:25, but...

89
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,646
- we have to drop the
kids off at school.

90
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:45,793
- It's going to be really tight.

91
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:48,420
If we miss this plane, we have
to cancel our first event.

92
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,256
[Stamper]
Nancy, can you take them?

93
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,674
I've gotta get packets ready
for the lunchtime sub-caucuses.

94
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,156
Peter, I'd do it, but
we have a meeting

95
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:55,636
with Greenpeace in 20 minutes.

96
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,972
- I gotta get their rating on the bill.
- Where's their school?

97
00:04:57,973 --> 00:04:59,974
Connecticut and Q.

98
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:01,892
- Oh, I can take them.
- You sure?

99
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,936
Yes. It's on the way
to my office.

100
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,897
This watershed act
proves that once again

101
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,523
the anti-capitalist agenda

102
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:11,152
is alive and well
in the Democratic party.

103
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:13,279
Let me show you
what's really going on.

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,073
Here are the democrats
eating up all of their

105
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:19,701
soft science, "organically
homegrown" propaganda

106
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:22,163
that the eco-fanatics
are force-feeding them.

107
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:25,249
And over here, at the tail end
of all those jackasses,

108
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,209
are middle-class Americans...

109
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,878
people who just
want to work hard

110
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,965
and rely on jobs
in the drilling industry.

111
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,802
And what about
the hypocrisy, folks?

112
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,887
Does Peter Russo
honestly have the gall

113
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,307
to lecture us
on the purity of our rivers

114
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:45,186
when he has been polluting himself
with chemicals for years?

115
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:48,814
He's not just been eating grass,
he's been smoking it.

116
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,275
It's the only major bill
he's sponsored in six years.

117
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,548
I know, but they already
have national coverage.

118
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,819
What's the angle?

119
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,696
If it doesn't pass,
I think he'll lose

120
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:57,572
support from the
shipbuilders' association.

121
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,574
So they lose support.
It's not that juicy.

122
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:02,286
They're a huge part of his
get-out-the-vote effort in Philly.

123
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,121
It sounds like inside baseball.

124
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,498
Not if I get the vote count.
Black and white numbers.

125
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,335
Nobody has that.
But when I called the campaign,

126
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,752
they stonewalled me.

127
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,254
Same thing
in the whip's office.

128
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,714
Do you know anyone over there?

129
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,174
In Underwood's office?

130
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,717
No, I don't.

131
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,093
Nobody on staff?

132
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,761
- Hmm-mm.
- Oh.

133
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,388
I just figured because
you gave me the Russo profile.

134
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,807
No, that didn't come from them.

135
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,684
But Underwood organized
the campaign.

136
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,146
I'm sorry.
I don't know anybody there.

137
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,773
Okay.

138
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,697
Hey, it's me. I just wanted
to fill you in on something.

139
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,950
I should be back home at 10:00.
Meet me there.

140
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,830
- Sarah made this one.
- [Sarah] It's a frog.

141
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:48,999
And I made this one.
Can you guess what it is?

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,626
- A lobster?
- No. It's a scorpion.

143
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,963
They're for you.
For the ones you gave us.

144
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,798
Aw, they're beautiful.

145
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:00,510
But maybe you should
bring them to school, no?

146
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:03,347
For show-and-tell?
Or give them to your friends.

147
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:06,100
No. The other kids
will just make fun of us.

148
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,851
Why?

149
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:10,437
Everybody hates us at school.

150
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:13,607
They say dad's a crackhead
and that we're crack babies.

151
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,442
I looked up "crack baby"
on the computer.

152
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,027
I don't look like that.

153
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:20,239
Yeah, they say dad's gonna O.D.
like Amy Winehouse.

154
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,368
Well, you tell them
that your dad doesn't do

155
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,328
that kind of thing anymore,
right?

156
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:29,998
Yeah, we do,
but they don't believe us.

157
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,419
Did you try
going to the teachers?

158
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,713
We can't do that. Everyone
will just hate us even more.

159
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:44,679
Well, you can't worry about
what other people think, right?

160
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,934
I wish dad wasn't running
for Governor.

161
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,561
- You ever been to allentown before?
- I have not.

162
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:52,980
What do you think?

163
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:55,649
Compared to New York,
the parking is easier.

164
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,734
Finding a decent bagel,
not so much.

165
00:07:57,735 --> 00:07:59,445
We make up for it
with the cream cheese.

166
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,155
- Shall we?
- Ready when you are.

167
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,823
Your watershed bill.

168
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,866
You've ticked off
the Republicans, oil, gas...

169
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,077
sometimes you gotta upset a few
people to do the right thing.

170
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,455
Not just a few.
There's a sizable coalition

171
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,165
that wants
to see your bill fail,

172
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,250
including environmentalists
from your own party.

173
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,461
- Don't think the bill does enough.
- We wanted a passable bill.

174
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,045
That's why we aimed
for middle ground...

175
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:20,257
do you actually care
about the Delaware river?

176
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,301
I don't sponsor legislation
I don't care about.

177
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,594
Until recently, you hadn't
sponsored any legislation at all.

178
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,638
I spent my time in congress
focusing on things

179
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,432
that were important
to my constituents.

180
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:32,144
- The shipyard.
- Kept it open as long as I could.

181
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,313
Okay. That's one thing.
What are the others?

182
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,606
I'd love to provide you a list

183
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,360
of all the things I've done in
congress, but we've got 15 minutes...

184
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:42,259
your opponent has
linked your inactivity

185
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,157
to your fondness
for single-malts.

186
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,284
I've been very open
about my past,

187
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,744
and I've done everything I can
to overcome it

188
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,706
in a responsible,
permanent way.

189
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:55,000
And I preferred vodka
to scotch.

190
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,543
You should get
your facts straight.

191
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,712
[Laughs]

192
00:08:58,713 --> 00:09:01,298
Is your watershed act

193
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,425
just a ploy
to jump into the spotlight

194
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:06,678
and pad your transcript while
you apply for Governor school?

195
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,680
It's real money.

196
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,849
It's real jobs.

197
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,456
And when the Delaware
river is less

198
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:14,061
polluted than it's
been in 50 years...

199
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:17,814
it's holding up a real glass of its
water and seeing how clear it is.

200
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:19,774
That's what my bus tour
is about.

201
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,152
- The vice president is joining you later?
- Correct.

202
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:25,989
Why has it taken him this long
to endorse you?

203
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,410
He didn't think I was worth it.

204
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:32,413
But then he heard I had a
one-on-one with the New York Times,

205
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:35,749
- and, boom, he was on board.
- I might print that.

206
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,897
The more of my
words, the fewer of

207
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,043
yours, the better
off we'll both be.

208
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,213
If I didn't think you were such a
liability to yourself, congressman,

209
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,131
I might even like you.

210
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,342
If your circulation was as high
as the wall street journal,

211
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:46,885
I might like you back.

212
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,720
Hit me. Next question.

213
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,556
[Danton] I have to put
up a fight, Frank.

214
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,057
Tell them they're
wasting their money.

215
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,975
- It's gonna pass.
- Are you sure?

216
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,311
When was the last time
I got a count wrong?

217
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:58,855
If you were certain, you wouldn't
be trying to neutralize us.

218
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,441
Well, Sancorp
has been good to me.

219
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,484
I'm just trying to do you
and them a favor, Remy.

220
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,069
Then why propose the legislation
in the first place?

221
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,529
You must've known
they would oppose it.

222
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,406
The regulatory restrictions
are minimal.

223
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,990
There's a bigger battle
here, Frank.

224
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,534
Sancorp is against any step

225
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,369
toward regulation,
no matter how small.

226
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,539
Russo's planted his feet on
the wrong side of the fence.

227
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,583
How much are you giving
his opponent?

228
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,543
Check the F.E.C. Filings.

229
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:21,462
How much are
you actually giving?

230
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:23,338
This is a ten-billion-dollar
industry, Frank.

231
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,132
There's money to spend.

232
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,801
If the democrats lose Pennsylvania,
you know what that means.

233
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,429
We don't want you to lose leadership,
but that's up to you, not us.

234
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,390
You don't have the same kind of
relationship with the Republicans

235
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:36,143
that you have with me.

236
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:37,894
Then we'll adapt.

237
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:41,773
[Sighs]

238
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,317
We both have votes to count.
Good luck.

239
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,777
You tell Sancorp
they're being foolish.

240
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,195
I'm not gonna do that.

241
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,989
Well, then,
you're being foolish.

242
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,824
Come on, Frank.

243
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,826
Let's not make this personal.

244
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,537
I can't compete
with Sancorp's war chest.

245
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,498
- My only option is asymmetrical...
- [Door closes]

246
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,916
To pick off the opposition
one by one

247
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,960
like a sniper in the woods.

248
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,088
There will come a
time to put Remy

249
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,214
in my crosshairs,
but not right now.

250
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,133

I deeply appreciate you taking
the time out of your schedule...

You have to eat it.

you have to watch me eat mine.

I'm gonna be late
to meet someone.

- Who? Like a date?
- A friend.

Not that I would judge.
We've all done it.

Wow.

with a congressman.

Which one?

[Engine starts]

312
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,588
Francis...

313
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,843
How's your hand?

314
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,553
Fine.

315
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,849
You should change
the bandage, no?

316
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,476
Later.

317
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,645
I thought you were
gonna be out late.

318
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,522
No.

319
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,149
- You seem upset.
- I'm not.

320
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,444
- What happened?
- Nothing.

321
00:14:56,445 --> 00:15:00,031
- Can I get more than two words out of you?
- [Man yelling]

322
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,367
I'm just trying to relax.

323
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,707
Claire,

324
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,584
I love you.

325
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:12,627
I love you too.

326
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,759
Did Zoe expect me to twiddle
my thumbs until her arrival?

327
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,218
Perhaps she's
making the mistake

328
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,846
thinking her time
is as valuable as mine.

329
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:26,516
Proximity to power deludes some
into believing they wield it.

330
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:29,853
I put an end to that sort of
thinking before it begins.

331
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:33,523
And if I'm not mistaken, the
last time I was in Tannersville,

332
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:34,775
Buddy Corcharan pulled me aside

333
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,860
and told me
I was wasting my time,

334
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:38,236
because the Republicans

335
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,030
were gonna sweep Monroe County
in a landslide.

336
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:44,075
Well, Buddy had to eat his hat
and both his shoes

337
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,535
when I won the county
in a landslide.

338
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,829
And let me tell you,
that man has big feet

339
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,915
and an even bigger head,
so that was quite a meal.

340
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:57,338
My daddy used to tell me
a story about people

341
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,007
who count their chickens
before they hatched.

342
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,447
Although, to be
fair, he probably

343
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:02,886
didn't know what he
was talking about,

344
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,596
because he grew up
in Pittsburgh.

345
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,681
And I certainly never saw
a hen around my house,

346
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:10,226
unless you count my mother.

347
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:12,771
- Do you want me to do something?
- But, seriously, folks...

348
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,607
- No. Let him talk.
- ...I do love this town...

349
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,567
I don't know if he's ever
going to introduce you.

350
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:20,361
[Peter]
He will. Just give him time.

351
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:21,947
It's been an hour
. We were supposed to

352
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,531
leave for Carbondale
ten minutes ago.

353
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,575
I can't interrupt him.
He's the Vice President.

354
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:29,162
- We're not on the edge of Penn's Woods.
- [Laughter]

355
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,540
We need economic
development flowcharts

356
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,793
for the watershed bill sent over
to Terry Womack's office.

357
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,044
- Hard copies, 20 of them.
- I'll do it right away.

358
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:39,923
How's everything going
with Rachel?

359
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,342
I think she's a little
down in the dumps.

360
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:44,845
She got a waitressing job last
week, and then they let her go.

361
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:46,513
- Why?
- She wouldn't tell me.

362
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,807
All she said
was her boss was a creep.

363
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:59,233
Thirty minutes ago,
I received a text from Zoe.

364
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,528
She intends to apologize,
no doubt.

365
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,613
I respect that she wants
to atone in person,

366
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:07,283
even though it's taken her over
16 hours to build up the courage.

367
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,386
Janine Skorsky is digging
into Peter Russo.

368
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:28,095
What in particular?

369
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:29,764
The shipbuilders' association.

370
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,474
She have an angle?

371
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,476
The watershed bill
is a consolation prize

372
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,186
for them losing their jobs.

373
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,521
That's not an unfair assessment.

374
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,356
She thinks
if the bill fails to pass,

375
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,066
they'll withdraw support.

376
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,819
Not an unfair speculation.

377
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,530
Well, I know how hard you've
been working on his campaign,

378
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,992
so I wanted to give you
a heads-up.

379
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:51,578
Well, let me know
if she expands her inquiry.

380
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,998
- Into what?
- Anything you deem worth telling.

381
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,917
Well, can I throw her a bone?

382
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,711
She might be more talkative
if I have information for her.

383
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,380
- What sort of bone?
- The vote count for the bill.

384
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,215
I don't have a vote count yet.

385
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,467
Should have a preliminary one
this afternoon.

386
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,387
- You'll let me know?
- As soon as I have something solid.

387
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,681
There's one more thing.

388
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,101
About last night...

389
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,728
oh, no need to apologize.

390
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,064
I'm sure you had
a very good reason.

391
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:23,109
I do.

392
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,571
I think we should end it.

393
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,366
Not professionally,
the other thing.

394
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,251
Why now?

395
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,837
We have a really good
working relationship.

396
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:46,132
I don't wanna
overcomplicate that.

397
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,802
All right.

398
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:51,512
- You're okay with it?
- Completely.

399
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,140
It's over.

400
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:56,893
And it won't change things
in terms of our arrangement?

401
00:18:56,894 --> 00:19:01,648
Oh, please. I don't punish people
for making adult decisions.

402
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,444
Thank you, Francis.

403
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:17,789
She was never more
than a faint blip on my radar.

404
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,207
We've served
each other's purpose.

405
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,168
If she wants to be an adult,

406
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:26,297
let her see how she can fly
once she leaves the nest.

407
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,353
- Claire.
- Catherine.

408
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,355
Hi.

409
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,691
Thank you for fitting me in.

410
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:48,235
Oh, I can always find time
for you and Frank.

411
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,658
Well, the reason I'm here is
the C.W.I. Has a large shipment

412
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,827
of water filters
stuck in South Sudan,

413
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,830
and they've been in storage
for the past four months,

414
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,957
just sitting there,
and the Sudanese government...

415
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,458
won't release the shipments
through customs.

416
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,585
My deputy briefed me
on the latest.

417
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,004
Right. And I know
that Francis spoke

418
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,421
to you about this
not too long ago,

419
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,090
but lately we haven't
heard much from the state

420
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,758
department, so I was
wondering if you could help.

421
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,344
We've done our best, Claire.
I put my top people on this.

422
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,471
The sudanese
are just not responding.

423
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:17,682
Well, is there anything else
we can do?

424
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,518
There's over $200,000 worth
of equipment.

425
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,687
I wish I could. I know how
important this is to you,

426
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,106
but we're about to cut off
diplomatic ties.

427
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,858
It's a directive straight
from the president.

428
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,653
We can't ignore their
human rights violations anymore.

429
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:32,279
What about back channels?

430
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,075
Well, once we cut ties,
I can't contact their government

431
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,202
officially or unofficially.

432
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,495
Well, is there someone
you could put me in touch with?

433
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:42,749
I'm sorry, Claire.
My hands are tied.

434
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,458
I would move mountains
for you and Frank,

435
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:47,003
but I've done all I can.

436
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,506
Of course.

437
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,717
- Okay. Good to see you.
- You too.

438
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,929
[Female reporter] Congressman,
you have a major bill

439
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,638
going to the floor
later this week.

440
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,058
- Are you optimistic it'll pass?
- I'm very optimistic.

441
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,228
The Delaware river watershed act
not only protects large portions

442
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,896
of the state's
freshwater resources,

443
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,898
it also creates thousands
of jobs.

444
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,524
I'm confident that my colleagues
on the hill...

445
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,817
there's only one way
to create jobs.

446
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:11,611
I did it during
my administration.

447
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,488
The answer is tax credits
for small businesses.

448
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,783
You've got to encourage
self-starting entrepreneurs

449
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:18,118
to start new ventures,

450
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,078
- hire employees...
- But specifically,

451
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,122
- about the watershed act...
- Small businesses,

452
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:24,207
that's the solution. Everything
else is window dressing.

453
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,166
Thank you all very much.

454
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,459
[Chattering]

455
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,169
Thank you.

456
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,504
Good night, Mr. Vice-President.

457
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,095
Hello.

458
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,264
[Russo] I need to
talk about Matthews.

459
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:42,183
Yes. I read the press reports. He's
not being very helpful, is he?

460
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,518
He's doing more harm than good.

461
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,979
I want to ask him to leave.

462
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,647
Well, that wouldn't make
for a very good story.

463
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,816
It's better than him torpedoing
the whole bus tour.

464
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,151
Have you tried to talk to him?

465
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:52,526
No, I wanted to ask
your advice first.

466
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:55,196
Well, maybe there's a way

467
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,657
to keep him on the tour
and inspire his support.

468
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,742
We have fundamentally
different views.

469
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:01,744
Well, look, you're not going
to be able change his ideology,

470
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:03,121
but dig deeper.

471
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:07,667
Jim is a proud man.
Tap into that pride.

472
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:09,127
I just wish he was gone.

473
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,544
Well, you do whatever
you think best.

474
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,046
But whatever it is you decide,

475
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,174
be firm
and stand up for yourself.

476
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:15,925
He'll respond to that at least.

477
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:18,094
And call me back
if you need anything.

478
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,768
[Stamper] What was the reason he gave you?
Were you messing up?

479
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,314
No. The head waiter said
I was doing a really good job.

480
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,983
He even started letting me take
my own tables on the second day.

481
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,694
And then the manager...
what's his name?

482
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,612
Leon.

483
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:39,199
He propositioned you?

484
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,159
Called me into his office,

485
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,038
said couldn't afford to start
taking anyone new on,

486
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,414
even part-time.

487
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:49,271
Put his hand on my
knee, said he might

488
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:51,127
be able to make an exception.

489
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:54,047
So he started sliding
his hand up my thigh.

490
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:57,217
So I stood up and I tell him
I should get back to work.

491
00:22:57,218 --> 00:23:00,887
He says, "stay."
He unbuckled his belt.

492
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:03,848
Did you?

493
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,057
No, I walked out of the office
and got back to my tables.

494
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:12,274
Next day, I came into work,
told me to go home.

495
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:13,942
I was fired.

496
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,613
Tell me the name
of the restaurant.

497
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:25,787
You're home early.

498
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,081
I needed a breather.

499
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:28,665
I didn't have breakfast
this morning.

500
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,293
I might head back
in a little while.

501
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:34,129
The vote count?

502
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,258
It's going to come down
to the wire on this one.

503
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:43,138
I spoke
to Catherine Durant today.

504
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:45,807
She's unable to get the shipment
out of South Sudan.

505
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:47,851
Yeah, we're cutting
all diplomatic ties.

506
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,603
Foreign affairs
is up in arms about it.

507
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:52,981
Yes. Which is why she can't
lift a finger, according to her.

508
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:56,110
It's what she said anyway. Anyway,
I need you to talk to her.

509
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:57,652
I don't think that
would make any difference.

510
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:00,364
I thought she owed us, Francis.

511
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:01,531
She does, but there's limits.

512
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:02,824
She's secretary of state.

513
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:03,951
She can't break
diplomatic protocol.

514
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:06,036
Well, can you make some calls?

515
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:09,331
If she can't, I can't. Plus I have
to focus on the watershed bill.

516
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:12,876
I'm taking time out of my
schedule to help you with that.

517
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:14,920
- Because you drafted it.
- Because you asked me.

518
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,005
I didn't want to do this.

519
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,487
All I'm asking is
that you give me a

520
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:19,967
little bit of your
time in return.

521
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,010
And how am I supposed to fix
a problem I can't fix?

522
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,221
What about Remy?

523
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:27,308
Glendon Hill must have contacts
in South Sudan.

524
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,809
He's fighting us on the vote.

525
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,103
Those are two completely
separate issues.

526
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:34,148
They are not. He does you a
favor, he hangs it over me.

527
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:39,278
So what you're saying is
my goals are secondary to yours.

528
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,571
That is not what I'm saying.

529
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,115
I think you don't want
to go hat in hand

530
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:44,658
to somebody who used
to work for you.

531
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,828
I will not be lectured to
the moment you walk in the door!

532
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:50,038
I called Catherine, as promised!

533
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,123
Her inability to deliver

534
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,041
is not my problem or my fault!

535
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,585
I cannot control changing
global landscapes!

536
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,878
And I will not be cornered

537
00:24:56,879 --> 00:25:00,090
into making promises
I cannot deliver!

538
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:08,182
[Sighs]

539
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:12,602
I am sorry I yelled.

540
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm under a lot of pressure.

541
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:20,235
You're right,
I didn't think it through.

542
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,070
I just can't go to Remy
right now.

543
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:23,489
He's poaching too many
of my people.

544
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,530
I've got two congressmen

545
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,825
who will not commit.

546
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,035
[Sighs]

547
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,911
I was hoping you might
speak to them.

548
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:33,207
Who?

549
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,083
Vanderburgh and Abrams.

550
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,252
What is it that you want me
to say to them?

551
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:38,337
They're big on the environment.
They

552
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:39,421
don't think the bill
goes far enough.

553
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:41,089
They respect your opinion.

554
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,091
I wanted you to walk them
through the bill step-by-step.

555
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:45,927
Put them at ease. I need to
get them in the yes column.

556
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:48,305
I meet with them tomorrow.
I'll deliver the bruises.

557
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:49,973
You meet with them later
and patch them up.

558
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:52,100
That might just do the trick.

559
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:57,189
Of course.

560
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:02,610
I think I broke the bowl.

561
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:08,992
[Danton] We have contacts there
through our oil interest.

562
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,576
I'm going to need
government intervention.

563
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:12,871
Wherever there's a government,
we know people.

564
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,541
Even when there's only
the illusion of a government.

565
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,251
Will you help me?

566
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,545
I'd like to.

567
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:22,464
But for something like this,
I'm afraid there's a price tag.

568
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:25,884
The C.W.I. Will endorse Sancorp
as eco-friendly.

569
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,886
They can use our logo on any PR

570
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,513
or marketing materials
you want.

571
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:31,432
We'll need more than that.

572
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:34,184
They were willing to donate
over a million for that.

573
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:35,601
These filters
are only worth $200,000.

574
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:36,937
I'd say that's a bargain.

575
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:38,439
You turned down that offer.

576
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,023
Landscape has shifted
since then.

577
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:43,902
- The watershed bill?
- That's right.

578
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,153
You want it amended?

579
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:48,115
I want you to kill it,
the whole thing.

580
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:51,952
C.W.I. Has publicly backed
the bill, Remy.

581
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:55,247
What you do publicly
is your concern.

582
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:02,421
Gentlemen. Please, have a seat.

583
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:06,883
So have either of you changed
your mind since we last spoke?

584
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:09,635
[Vanderburgh]
We're still undecided, Frank.

585
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:11,555
Leaning one way or the other?

586
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:13,681
If congress is going to allocate
a quarter billion dollars,

587
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:15,038
we want to make sure
it goes towards a

588
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,393
bill that does more
to protect the...

589
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,437
we've been through all that.
I know your concerns.

590
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:21,315
So if the protection standards
don't change,

591
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:24,318
we would rather see that money
spent more effectively elsewhere.

592
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,405
That sounds like you're both
leaning no.

593
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,365
We've been very clear
about what we're asking.

594
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,243
[Sighs]

595
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,162
Okay.

596
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,834
This is you, Abrams.

597
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:44,129
And this is you, vanderburgh.

598
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,297
And over here...

599
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:56,266
Is the majority
of the Democratic caucus.

600
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,602
See, you're over there
all by your lonesome.

601
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:00,937
Now, you don't mind being
the black sheep.

602
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,564
You're the liberal wing
of the liberal wing.

603
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,941
Most of the time you can vote
what you want,

604
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:06,485
we still pass things anyway.

605
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:07,735
But this time

606
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:10,447
it does matter.

607
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,658
And what the two of you aren't
taking into account

608
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,369
is between this end of the desk
and this end of the desk...

609
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,412
Is me.

610
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,789
Now, I'm going to say to you
what I say to every congressman

611
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,249
that sits where
you're sitting now.

612
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,503
Vote your district.
Vote your conscience.

613
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:26,004
Don't surprise me.

614
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,422
And the most important one
of those...

615
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:34,304
Is don't surprise me.

616
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:36,557
Now, you're both to meet
with my wife tomorrow.

617
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:39,267
And you're to hear her out.

618
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:42,103
She will go through
your concerns point-by-point.

619
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,481
And I am certain after that

620
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:49,736
that the two of you will make
the right decision.

621
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:55,075
This is the part
where you leave.

622
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,791
I have often found
that bleeding hearts

have a ironic fear
of their own blood.

624
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,255
One drop and the seize up.

625
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:11,925
But offer them a caring hand
and massage them back to life

626
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:14,052
and they soon start beating
to the right drum.

Hello.

630
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,057
I've just spoken
to Abrams and Vanderburgh.

631
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,518
Let them toss and turn tonight,

632
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,353
but they're all yours tomorrow.

633
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:26,356
I'll reach out to their offices
and set a time.

634
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:28,316
Thank you, Claire.

635
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:31,986
Of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

636
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,576
Here you go, sir. Enjoy.

637
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:40,495
Excuse me.

638
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:41,788
There's a hair on my steak.

639
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,665
I am so sorry, sir. Where?

640
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,917
Right there.

641
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:48,712
I don't see it.

642
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:50,297
Are you telling me I'm blind?

643
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:51,881
No, sir. I'm so sorry.

644
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:53,717
- I'll have the kitchen.
- What's your name?

645
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:55,135
Stephanie.

646
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:56,928
You can leave the plate,
Stephanie.

647
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,096
I'd like to talk
to the manager.

648
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,724
Yes, sir. I'll go get him.

649
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:03,560
Thank you.

650
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:13,612
Good evening, sir.

Uh, Stephanie tells me
there was a hair on your plate.

No.

653
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,245
There wasn't any hair.

654
00:30:22,246 --> 00:30:23,664
Leon, right? That's your name?

655
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:25,206
Yes.

00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,751
Stephanie is a hot
little number, isn't she?

00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,298
Did you make her blow you

661
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,593
before or after you hired her?

662
00:30:36,594 --> 00:30:39,095
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

663
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:41,014
- Sit down, Leon.
- Sir, I want you to go.

664
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:43,183
- I said sit.
- Don't make me call the police.

665
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:45,101
I'll tell you what.
You call the police,

666
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:47,187
I'll call the department
of immigration

667
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:49,043
about the four
undocumented employees

668
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:50,898
you have working in the kitchen.

Felony, Leon.

670
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,235
And I might also mention

671
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:56,196
your girlfriend,
her mother, and her aunt

672

who also undocumented and living
in an apartment that you pay for.

673
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,451
Prison time for you,

674
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:04,162
deportation for them.

675
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,831
Not a pretty picture, is it?

676
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:19,052
Let's talk about Rachel Posner.

[Walker] How close is it?

678
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,890
I should have the last two votes
I need committed today.

679
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,933
I just want to make sure
no one changes their mind.

680
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:29,145
I'd prefer not to get embroiled

681
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:31,064
in environmental issues
at this time.

682
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:32,982
But it's also
a jobs-creation package.

683
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:34,776
It's antagonizing oil and gas.

684
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:36,486
We can't afford
that sort of battle

685
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:38,029
after all the capital
we spent on education.

686
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,408
All I need is one
public statement of support.

687
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,577
I won't do that.
About you take Linda tomorrow.

688
00:31:43,578 --> 00:31:45,078
You set her up in your offices.

689
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,705
Any meetings or calls
you might need

690
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,707
to whip up votes,
you got her there.

691
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,917
Well, I can't afford to spend a
whole day lobbying on the hill.

692
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,168
Well, you got deputies.

693
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:53,754
Yes, I do.

694
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,505
Well, you're telling me
you can't manage them

695
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:56,590
from ten blocks away?

696
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:57,965
Of course I can, sir.

697
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,760
Look, if it's too difficult...

698
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,887
no, no, no. We'll help you out,
Frank. Won't we, Linda?

699
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:03,930
Yes. If you'll just excuse me,

700
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:05,891
I have a few things
to rearrange on my schedule.

701
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:09,394
What else, Frank?
Tell me what Birch is up to.

702
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,937
No, I know I've already
canceled twice.

703
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,441
They start next week.

704
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:16,150
Sweetie, I'm trying
to figure this out.

705
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,318
- Linda.
- Excuse me.

706
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,446
- Yes?
- Just wanted thank you

707
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,573
for agreeing to pitch in,
I know you have a full plate.

708
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:22,824
Of course, Frank.

709
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,409
Is everything all right?
It sounds like...

710
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,578
yes. What time do you want me
to come by tomorrow?

711
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,581
Can we talk?

712
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:31,374
Can I just call you back
in one second?

713
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,628
I will call you. Yes.

714
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,923
Linda, I am so sorry that the
president has forced you into this.

715
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,257
It was not my intention.

716
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,634
If you would like,
I can talk congress...

717
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:41,968
no, it's not that.

718
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:44,304
It's a personal matter.
Don't worry.

719
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:45,764
Well, what is it?
Maybe I can help.

720
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:48,224
Just... my son didn't get
into Stanford.

721
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:49,893
I was supposed to meet
with the Provost tomorrow

722
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:51,394
to see if I could get him
to change his mind.

723
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:52,854
I asked the president
if I could go,

724
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:54,564
and he said yes,
but he must have forgotten.

725
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:56,942
You should go. I'm sure the
president will understand.

726
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:59,611
No, no. I don't let personal matters
get in the way of my job, Frank.

727
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,822
Linda, you can't put
your entire life on hold.

728
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:04,240
And certainly not at the expense
of your own son.

729
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,326
Well, it has been
at the expense of my son.

730
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,035
It's my fault he didn't get in.

731
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:11,122
I was on the campaign
and I wasn't there for him.

732
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,834
His grades suffered.
His application was...

733
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:16,336
I wasn't there, Frank.

734
00:33:16,337 --> 00:33:18,345
But I figured if I could just meet
with the Provost face to face...

735
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:21,175
okay, look, you're going
to Stanford tomorrow.

736
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,884
If you show up at my office,

737
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,719
I won't let you in,
so don't even consider it.

738
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,262
Frank, the president wants
me to be...

739
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,597
he doesn't have to know.

740
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:29,098
I'm going to have
one of my schedulers

741
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,310
buy you a ticket.
The bill will be fine.

742
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:36,189
Frank.
You don't have to do this.

743
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,150
We may have
our disagreements, Linda,

744
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,194
but that doesn't mean we can't
look out for each other.

745
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:44,155
You tell them you're coming.

746
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,869
- Okay. Give that a try.
- Test, test, test.

- Sounds good.

749
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,834
The first topic will
be the congressional

agenda for the fall session,

751
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,252
then we'll move on to the
midterms, then we'll wrap it up

752
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:00,714
with Peter Russo's race for
Governor and his watershed bill.

- Okay, great.
- Taking you off mic until 30 out.

754
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,386
Hey, Janine, I have to talk
about the watershed bill.

755
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:09,639
- Do you have a one-sheet?
- Uh, yeah. Hold on.

756
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:18,690
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:20,441
Any word on the vote count?

758
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,944
Still no luck. I've called
every democrat in the house

759
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:26,072
to cobble together a number,
but no one's getting back to me.

760
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:27,908
So what can I say?

761
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,160
That there's a lot in flux,
and it'll be tight.

762
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,746
Okay. Thanks.

763
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,039
Yeah. Sure thing.

I'd like to talk
about how the tour's going.

774

Well, let's talk on the bus.
Don't we have an event at 11:00?

There won't be any events
until we talk.

00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:23,838
Let me tell you
what I don't appreciate.

781
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,133
The D.N.C. Is running a man
with zero track record,

782
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:29,594
except for substance abuse,
to fill my shoes.

783
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,721
I realize you don't want to be
here, sir, but it seems like

784
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:34,307
you're deliberately trying
to sabotage my campaign.

785
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:36,726
Despite my better judgment,
I'm trying to save it.

786
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:38,979
I know the people of this state
better than you, Peter.

787
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,231
They don't want to
hear about watersheds.

788
00:35:40,232 --> 00:35:41,481
They want to hear about jobs.

789
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:42,816
Well, this week,
they need to hear both.

790
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,525
Well, then,
maybe I should just stand

791
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,736
quietly beside you at the podium
and watch you lose.

792
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:48,655
- You don't think I can win, do you?
- I'm not optimistic.

793
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:51,324
You lost the first two times
you ran for Governor.

794
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:53,451
The third time,
nobody thought you had a chance.

795
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:56,955
By September, you were 15 points down.
You were out of money.

796
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,248
You had to mortgage
your own house

797
00:35:58,249 --> 00:35:59,540
just to keep your
staff on payroll.

798
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,709
I'm well aware of what I did.
I was there.

799
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,630
My point is you kept going. You hit
67 counties in less than 20 days,

800
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,674
and you proved everyone wrong.

801
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,801
Like it or not, it's my name
on the ticket this time,

802
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:12,595
and I got the shot, and I'm
gonna prove everyone wrong.

803
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,430
Just like you did.
Including you, sir.

804
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:19,185
I would like your support,
but if you won't give it, fine.

805
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:21,312
It won't stop me.

806
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,861
You think it's easy
for me to be here?

807
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:30,404
I left the Governor's mansion
right in my prime.

808
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,365
To be what? Vice president.

809
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,826
I thought that was a step up.
But you know what?

810
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:37,037
I don't have a fucking shred
of real influence.

811
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:40,206
I'm trotted around
like a goddamn mascot,

812
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,249
and this is my home state.

813
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,045
I'm offering you influence, sir.

814
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:50,216
I'd like your guidance
and your expertise.

815
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:52,468
But if that's not on the table,
then, well...

816
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:54,274
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President,

817
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,227
you should head back
to Washington.

818
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,186
[Abrams]
Your husband was very explicit.

819
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,063
I would categorize it
as a threat.

820
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:13,816
- What did he say exactly?
- Not to surprise him.

821
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,819
Didn't he also tell you to vote
your district and your conscience?

822
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,449
He did, but those seemed
far lower on his priority list.

823
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,201
Well, he would never fault you

824
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,370
if you had a compelling reason
to do what you think is right.

825
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:28,206
I'm confused.
Aren't you for this bill?

826
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:30,396
C.W.I. Is publicly for it.

827
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:33,797
Privately, I have my doubts
for the same reasons you do.

828
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,856
I was under the impression

829
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:38,233
that we were here so you could
persuade us to vote yes.

830
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:41,028
Oh, I'm not trying
to persuade you of anything.

831
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:42,946
I will say this:

832
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:45,908
If the bill fails,
it's not the end of the world.

833
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,451
We can always sponsor
new legislation.

834
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:51,538
You know, something with
stricter regulatory standards.

835
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,122
Just to be clear,
you're telling us

836
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:55,042
you don't mind if we vote
against the bill.

837
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:58,461
I'm simply saying
what my husband would...

838
00:37:58,462 --> 00:38:01,590
that you should vote
your conscience.

839
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:05,218
- How are we looking?
- We're short a vote.

840
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,595
I just got off the phone
with Claire.

841
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:08,221
Vanderburgh and Abrams
are on board.

842
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:10,348
- Those are definite yeses?
- Definite.

843
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,350
We should be good.

844
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:13,894
Yes?

845
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:15,812
I've been trying to reach you
since yesterday.

846
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:17,981
Well, I've been a bit busy
counting votes.

847
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,524
You said you'd have
a number for me.

848
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:21,359
Well, you should try
my press office.

849
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,445
I did. They won't
return my calls.

850
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:25,989
Well, the official word is
it will be close.

851
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,783
I'm trying to get
the unofficial word.

852
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:30,452
Oh, I can't appear to be playing
favorites now, can I?

853
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:33,329
This isn't because
of the other day, is it?

854
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,874
What other day?

855
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,501
You said we'd keep
our professional relationship.

856
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:40,837
Well, this is what
professional feels like.

857
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:42,965
[Line clicks, beeps]

858
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:50,208
[Woman] The vice president of the
United States, Jim Matthews!

859
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,682
[Cheering]

860
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:57,020
Thank you.

861
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:59,815
It's good to be back in Bristol.

862
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:01,650
[Whooping]

863
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:04,694
- Go, warriors!
- [Cheering]

864
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:07,739
Now, you all know me.
I'm a windbag.

865
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,742
I can go on
until you all fall asleep,

866
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:14,955
get eight hours of shut-eye, and
wake up to find me still yapping.

867
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:17,597
And there's a lot I could say
about this young man to my left.

868
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:21,618
The truth is, I've had a lot of
doubts about him and his ideas,

869
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:25,758
about his past,
about his youth.

870
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,718
But if you'll remember,

871
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,055
a lot of you had doubts about me
the first time I ran.

872
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:34,142
And the second and the third.

873
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,354
But over the last few days,

874
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,773
traveling around the state
with Peter,

875
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:43,275
I have to admit
he's won me over.

876
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:45,695
He's smart, he's energetic,

877
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:47,338
- and, most important, he's a fighter.
- [Murmuring in agreement]

878
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,118
Now, it says "a fresh start"
on that bus over there.

879
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,162
And that's the real truth,

880
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:54,997
because this young man
will give our state

881
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:57,082
the fresh start
it so desperately needs.

882
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,085
Ladies and gentlemen, the next
Governor of Pennsylvania,

883
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:01,503
Peter Russo.

[Cheering]

885
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:12,390
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

886
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:14,058
How's it going, Bristol?

887
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,809
[Shouting]

888
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,450
Today I'd like to talk to you
about economic recovery.

889
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:20,107
Now, as many of you
may be aware,

890
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:21,609
mostly because my
opponent feels the

891
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,110
need to spend
millions of dollars

892
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:24,653
on TV ads about my past,

893
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:27,117
I know a thing or two
about recovery.

894
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:30,381
I've learned a great deal
through my personal struggles.

895
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:36,082
I've learned how to harness
my strength and my resolve,

896
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,125
make them work for me,

897
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:41,212
much the way your Bristol
watermills harnessed the power

898
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:42,838
of your beautiful otter creek

899
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,592
and the mighty Delaware river
years ago.

900
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:48,386
Let me tell you
how the Delaware river

901
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:51,431
will reinvigorate your economy
for years to come!

902
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,891
[Cheering]

903
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:56,436
[Knocks]

904
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,605
We're going to get
the shipment out of Sudan.

905
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:00,814
- That's great.
- It might take a few weeks,

906
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:03,025
but I think you should start
making arrangements for Botswana,

907
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:05,445
where you're gonna set up
base camp and the depot.

908
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:09,031
Just send me a budget
as soon as you've got one.

909
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:13,160
Claire, is there any way
we can send someone in my place?

910
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:15,162
I thought you wanted
to be on the ground.

911
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:18,082
I would, but I can't this time.

912
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,917
Why not?

913
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:21,877
I wasn't sure
how to tell you this,

914
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,272
but I passed the 12-week mark.

915
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,836
You're expecting.

916
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,712
Gillian, that's wonderful.
That...

917
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:34,132
when did this happen?
Who's the father?

918
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:37,260
There was this guy I met overseas.
Doctors without borders.

919
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,720
We had this thing. Then I left.

920
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,140
But he came back to the states
a few months ago,

921
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:44,184
and that's when it happened.

922
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:47,770
Anyway, it didn't end well.
But I want to keep the baby.

923
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,857
- And does he know?
- He's married.

924
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,401
- Oh.
- I shouldn't have. It was stupid.

925
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:55,820
You don't have to explain.

926
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:58,906
I'll need some time off
at the beginning of march.

927
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:00,492
Of course.

928
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,870
And absolutely,
we'll send someone else instead.

929
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,830
I appreciate it, Claire.

930
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,332
Sure.

931
00:42:13,254 --> 00:42:15,756
You said medium-rare?

932
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:18,218
Just, uh, let me know

Who would you guess
texted me just now?

936
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,831
I thought she'd last
more than a couple days.

937
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:54,295
- Going somewhere?
- Just for an hour or two.

938
00:42:54,296 --> 00:42:56,714
I got one last holdout to whip.

What's the vote count
on Russo's bill?

[Panting]
Oh, don't you wanna shower first

947
00:43:42,636 --> 00:43:44,678
before we dirty ourselves
with business?

948
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,639
I'll shower after you leave.

949
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,850
What's the vote count?

950
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:53,187
Your tone doesn't inspire me
to be very forthcoming.

951
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:55,356
Oh, the fuck wasn't enough?

952
00:43:55,357 --> 00:43:57,609
You need a special tone too?

953
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,946
Ooh, someone washed her mouth
out with acid this morning.

954
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:04,365
Whatever it is
you're grappling with,

955
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:06,326
I am sincerely not interested.

956
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,119
You're almost twice my age.

957
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:11,081
You said that didn't bother you.

958
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,582
I lied.

959
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,002
If you had a daughter,
she'd be older than me.

960
00:44:15,003 --> 00:44:17,963
In 20 years, I'll still
be younger than you are now.

961
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:20,507
Well, I can't argue
with basic arithmetic.

962
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:23,969
You don't find that disgusting?

963
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,096
I think you want me to.

964
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:29,432
But I've never considered this
any more or less

965
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,811
than a transaction
between two consenting adults.

966
00:44:32,812 --> 00:44:35,271
If you just want the girl who
will do your bidding for you,

967
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,898
you already have that.

968
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:39,233
Why do you need to fuck me?

969
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:40,735
I would remind you
that it was you

970
00:44:40,736 --> 00:44:42,403
who initiated our affair,

971
00:44:42,404 --> 00:44:45,406
and it was you who came knocking
at my door last winter.

972
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:48,493
And it was me who asked that
we stop what we're doing now.

973
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:51,121
Which I respected
until you picked up a phone

974
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:52,706
and asked me
to come over tonight.

975
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:55,625
Because you wouldn't
give me what I wanted

976
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,169
unless I did.

977
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,880
So tell me,
why do you need this?

978
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:01,923
You don't seem to get
any pleasure out of it.

979
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:04,051
I know I certainly don't.

980
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:08,220
I seem to always
leave you satisfied.

981
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:10,974
How do you know
I'm not faking it?

982
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:15,896
Are you?

983
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:19,315
Doesn't it say a lot
that you can't tell?

984
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:28,491
[Sighs]

985
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,120
What do you think about
when I'm up against the wall?

986
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:35,373
A great man once said

987
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:38,543
that everything in life
is about sex...

988
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,171
Except sex.

989
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:44,716
Sex is about power.

990
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,886
So you need a whore,

991
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:49,763
which makes you a pimp.

992
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:53,892
I'm not a pimp.
Just a very generous John.

993
00:45:57,562 --> 00:46:01,942
Fine. As long as we're clear
about what this is,

994
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:03,944
I can play the whore.

995
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:05,570
Now pay me.

996
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:09,365
The bill will pass.
We have it by two votes.

997
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:14,162
You can pass that along
to your friend, miss Skorsky.

998
00:46:14,163 --> 00:46:18,458
If she must say such things in
order to sleep at night, so be it.

999
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:22,170
Her loyalty costs me nothing but
the occasional crumb of news.

1000
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:24,672
Her hatefulness takes
no toll at all.

1001
00:46:24,673 --> 00:46:29,094
You don't compensate a working
girl so you can cuddle after.

some really great crowds.

1004
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,476
- No buses losing their brakes.
- Final call for voting.

1005
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:38,645
Oh, please now.
When do you head back?

1006
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:41,106
Tomorrow. We wanna do a press
conference when all the votes are in.

1007

- Members, please cast your votes now.
- Are you all right?

1008

I'm just a little nauseous.
It'll pass. I'm okay.

1009

- March 14th.

It's so exciting.
How's the morning sickness?

1011
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:53,660
I think I'm over the hump.

1012

It was good to be
on the road again. Invigorating.

1015

Our internals are showing
a nice bump in the numbers.

1016

You made a big difference.

and so am I.

1018

Well, it's a team effort, right?

1019

hello to your better half.

- Well, I think.

The Dean's a republican, so there
was not a lot of small talk.

1022
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:19,602
But he seemed open to considering it.
We'll know more next week.

That's not true.
You covered for me.

1026
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,612
Well, we have to keep the important
things in perspective, right?

1027
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,032
Don't think it's bought you
any favors.

1028

Kindness isn't kindness
if you expect a reward.

grape juice there to celebrate.
