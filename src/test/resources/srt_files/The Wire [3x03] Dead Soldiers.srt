1
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,992
I got to hit the head.

2
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,017
I can't take this shit, Bunny.

3
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,213
Hey.

4
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,423
It'll pass.

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,521
They're just riding you now.
Next week it's somebody new.

6
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,766
They can't take away your E.O. D, Marvin.

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,768
The worst they can do
is bust you back to lieutenant.

8
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,535
I don't even wanna think about the worst
these motherfuckers can do.

9
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,669
You don't either.

10
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,785
You're still not
connecting the dots, Marvin.

11
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,819
Have a look.

12
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,385
- Hoffman and Holbrook, sir.
- Very good.

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,724
But you had a body dropped there
last week...

14
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,990
and this is what the fuck
it looked like yesterday.

15
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,465
Bond and Preston, for the record.

16
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,863
Ashland and Wolfe.

17
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,798
Chase and Durham.

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:52,037
Sir, I deployed my resources
per your instructions.

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,447
We've beefed up foot patrols...

20
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,675
we have our plainclothes squads
on 12-hour shifts.

21
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,651
- And the corners stay full?
- They move, sir.

22
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,618
Every day.
They're gonna sell their drugs somewhere.

23
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:09,827
Major Taylor, I look at your numbers,
I see the intel reports, the photos.

24
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,456
It all tells me that you lack a fucking clue.

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,998
If you'll permit me.

26
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,301
- Is your Deputy Major present?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,004
You now command the Eastern District.

28
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,911
Major Taylor, you are relieved.

29
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,075
Take the podium.

30
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,230
Anyone else having trouble
with the writing on the wall?

31
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,296
Dismissed.

32
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,026
And I'm like,
"Nigga, if you want to sell me a new car...

33
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,899
"you better really sell it to me.

34
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,441
"'Cause otherwise,
I'm sitting back and I'm watching."

35
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,304
What you want with a new ride for?

36
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,379
Ain't like you can't get a new car
anywhere you want...

37
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,708
anytime, in this whole city.

38
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,782
- I'm just saying.
- Saying what?

39
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,942
- In case.
- In case what?

40
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,486
In case I ever want to buy a new car.

41
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,524
- Damn, is that too much to ask for?
- Girl, you crazy.

42
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,525
Shit, shit, get down, get down.

43
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,547
- Yeah, they feeling it now.
- They protecting the fuck out of it, too.

44
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,688
You see what you wanted?

45
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,217
Yeah, man, but they got
the whole second floor boarded up.

46
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,725
Got a little porch around back.

47
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,625
Couple of the boys out there
now smoking on them menthols.

48
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,925
So we slide up from the back?

49
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,758
- That barred up, too.
- No way through the front?

50
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,800
Not now. But come tomorrow morning...

51
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,341
they gonna scale back down
to a three-man skeleton crew, you feel me?

52
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,506
Not sure I like this.

53
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,343
Why we got to keep hitting up
the Barksdale people?

54
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,247
Ain't like this whole motherfucking city
ain't got stashes all over it.

55
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,683
True that.

56
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,014
So why?

57
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,854
Because.

58
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,453
Because?

59
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,988
Indeed.

60
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,105
So that's a cop-shooter?

61
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,204
Yeah, not much to him.

62
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,075
But he did that job
on the Dozerman kid last week.

63
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,838
Gave it up in a full statement.

64
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,006
Before or after
you knocked the shit out of him?

65
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,952
"Injuries were sustained
while patrol officers...

66
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,785
"were effecting pursuit
and arrest of aforementioned suspects."

67
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,355
- He was caught East Side, right?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,724
But the wagon made a stop
at the Western District...

69
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,888
for an unscheduled tune-up.

70
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,124
It's dark on that back lot.

71
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,897
Western boys mistook him for a <i>piï¿½ata.</i>

72
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,268
So what do you think?

73
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,242
I think this is a tragic motherfucking
miscarriage of justice.

74
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,006
I think it deserves a special grand jury...

75
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,242
and if not, the President should appoint
an independent prosecutor.

76
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,340
No, no, no.

77
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,013
Actually, I think, Kofi Bryant
and the United fucking Nations...

78
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,749
should get involved.

79
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,587
- It's a murder, Bunk.
- The word from upstairs...

80
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,684
is that we're supposed to be
having less murders, not more.

81
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,560
This is Anne Arundel County.
Why should they care about that?

82
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,757
Why should you?

83
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,390
Hey, Bunk. Hey, how's it going?

84
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,993
Listen, Deputy wants to know, have we
recovered Dozerman's service weapon?

85
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,073
No, sir.
The kid said he sold it on the street.

86
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,005
Gave only the street name of the buyer.

87
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,100
A certain Peanut, whereabouts unknown.

88
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,304
- They want that gun back.
- Sir?

89
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,779
They don't want to have
a departmental weapon on the street.

90
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,406
You know, as a principle.

91
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,352
Look, the great white deputy has spoken.

92
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,514
This case is not down
until that gun comes home.

93
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,386
Fine, don't get up.

94
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,188
One of the most heavily armed cities
in the gun-loving <i>world...</i>

95
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,922
Why should those ignorant
motherfuckers care...

96
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,090
about one goddamn semi-auto
more or less?

97
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,107
What'd you bring me downtown
in this shit for, man?

98
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,976
Police don't get wet.

99
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,149
Talk to me, big man.

100
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,186
Thought you should know,
my boy, Cheese...

101
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,721
he went into the box
with a couple of police.

102
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,757
- He stood tall?
- No doubt.

103
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,555
Kept his mouth shut and waited them out.

104
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,088
The way it turned out,
they the ones that fucked up.

105
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,524
How come?

106
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,761
Police let it slip
Cheese played in on some talkies.

107
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,303
Tried to pin a hit on him.
Said they heard it all over.

108
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,905
- Who got hit?
- A dog.

109
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,903
- What kind of dog?
- Kind mistake your leg for pussy.

110
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,084
So, they had phones tapped?

111
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,745
Don't matter to me none if they did.

112
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,958
Me and the people I keep close,
we don't talk on the phone none.

113
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,255
You talk on the phone, String?

114
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,620
So we good then.

115
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,724
What we know is
they still looking hard at us.

116
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,604
You wanna know what kills more police
than bullets and liquor?

117
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,776
Boredom. They just can't handle that shit.

118
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,605
You keep it boring, String.

119
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,512
You keep it dead fucking boring.

120
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,251
You're serious?

121
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,855
I am.

122
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,227
What's the closest school to here?

123
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,267
Stuart Hill Elementary.

124
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,597
That's at least eight blocks.

125
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,936
- Three sevens.
- Three sevens?

126
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,112
Five eights.

127
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,280
Bullshit, let's see it.

128
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,717
Five eights. Read them and weep.

129
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,487
You're cheating.

130
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,753
- I just can't catch your ass is all.
- It's just luck, Tony.

131
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,520
Yeah, it's just luck.

132
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,428
- You called my desk looking for me?
- Yes, I did. Come on in. Grab a chair.

133
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,523
But watch your wallet if you do.

134
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,493
Make it quick, Tommy.

135
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,335
The new city editor wants a 40-inch
weekender on liquor board reform.

136
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,774
- They're going to reform the liquor board?
- Yeah, with a hand grenade.

137
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,779
So what's on your mind?

138
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,174
We're off the record?

139
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,889
There's going to be no academy class
of police cadets this year.

140
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,480
Mayor's orders.

141
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:30,024
Homicide rate's climbing, felonies are up,
we got patrol vacancies out the ass.

142
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,393
Even more coming
at the year-end retirements.

143
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,467
And this is coming from His Honor?
To what end?

144
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,899
Keep some money.

145
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,300
Money's in the budget...

146
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,770
but even a six-month delay in hiring
saves a couple million.

147
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,733
You think there's some paper?
Something the Mayor signed?

148
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,367
No, but you call the personnel office...

149
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,174
and they'll confirm that the class
is delayed until next year.

150
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,181
You get that much, you can come back
to me for a couple of quotes.

151
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,252
- You want in on this?
- No indeed. I love my Mayor.

152
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,255
Councilman, thank you.

153
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,591
- Stirring up some shit?
- Just a little bit.

154
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,960
For the good of our fair city by the bay.

155
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,966
Three twos.

156
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,509
Housing authority has this slated
for demolition, right?

157
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,636
But no money to do it yet.

158
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,111
Boss, you sure it's a good idea
not to tell anybody about this downtown?

159
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,378
Ignorance is bliss, Lieutenant.

160
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,147
Anyone ever tell you that?

161
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,655
Once, but I beat the dog-piss out of the guy
with a nightstick.

162
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,289
Anybody seen McNulty?

163
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,388
Catch him up when he posts.

164
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,225
New target.
Kintel Williamson, goes by Prince K.

165
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,973
Has a string of corners
from Park Circle to Woodland Avenue.

166
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,635
And he's dropping bodies, too.
Three in the last four months.

167
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,338
Or so say our friends
in the Northwestern District.

168
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,347
So we're off Proposition Joe's people?

169
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,282
We're gonna ship all the mid-level arrests
downtown to C.I.D.

170
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,980
Let narcotics work up those prosecutions.
After that, we're on to new business.

171
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,923
- He don't look like much.
- He's dropping bodies.

172
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,790
And with everybody pressed
to bring the murder rate down...

173
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,658
that's the new mandate for this unit.

174
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,528
- Bell has bodies on him, too.
- Not lately.

175
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,965
And Prop Joe
hasn't made much noise either.

176
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,835
They're still running product.
Still got kids banging out there.

177
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,000
And now, 'cause we blew a wire
over a fucking dog...

178
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,738
we have to let them just walk on,
go about their shit...

179
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,872
like we were never anything
to take seriously in the first place?

180
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,522
I want an investigative strategy mapped up
by week's end.

181
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,301
Well, McNulty's here in spirit anyway.

182
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,031
What?

183
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,130
Right there.

184
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,682
This will work, too.

185
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:21,225
There's a couple occupied
in the 200-block and that one over there.

186
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,962
But otherwise...

187
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,497
we're good.

188
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,729
Good shit, right?

189
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,935
Let's go.

190
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,339
- Commissioner Burrell, please.
<i>- Who's calling, please?</i>

191
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,038
- It's Councilman Carcetti.
<i>- Hold, please.</i>

192
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,847
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Erv, I'm giving you a heads up.

193
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,849
You're gonna get a call
from a <i>Sun</i> papers reporter...

194
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,181
- about the academy class.
<i>- What the fuck, is this a joke?</i>

195
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,687
Calm the hell down, Erv.
You just "no comment" the fucker.

196
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,848
<i>You tell me my name</i>
<i>will be nowhere near this...</i>

197
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,119
<i>- and then send a reporter my way?</i>
- Exactly.

198
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,422
Then you call the Mayor yourself
and you tell him...

199
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,692
you got a reporter nosing around
about the academy class getting pushed.

200
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,630
You tell him you have no idea
how it leaked.

201
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,168
<i>I knew this shit'd come back to me.</i>

202
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,033
- Trust me, you're covered on this.
<i>- God damn it...</i>

203
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,163
<i>you can't hang me out there like this</i>
<i>with the Mayor.</i>

204
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,334
<i>- My ass is flapping in the breeze, for...</i>
- You want that class, Erv?

205
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,274
- You got to trust me.
<i>- Shit!</i>

206
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,492
How you even find me?

207
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,531
- Ran into Lucas.
- Don't even call his name.

208
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,926
Nigga still owes me money.

209
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,733
He just told me how to find you, that's all.

210
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,865
He tell you how I'm doing?

211
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,845
Yeah...

212
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,040
I know what you're thinking.

213
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,715
You ain't looking all that yourself.

214
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,650
You look just fine, girl.

215
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,154
Just trying to find your sister, that's all.

216
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,316
She ain't for you no more.

217
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,924
She ain't for none of our kind.

218
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,498
Gone out County way.

219
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,467
Picked herself up County clothes,
County car...

220
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,605
County nose to look down
on all us city niggers with.

221
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,011
She a teacher.

222
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,172
- Where at?
- Don't be rushing me, motherfucker.

223
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:33,814
I know you looking to tip on out of here,
get your aftershave on, get yourself correct.

224
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,793
She teach speech.

225
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:49,040
Make it so every nigga
sound like Condoleezza.

226
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,577
Up Ida B. Wells.

227
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,520
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, have you seen this little girl?

228
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,428
This my baby.
Can you just take that picture with you?

229
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,194
Thank you so much. God bless.

230
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,168
- Excuse me, have you seen this little girl?
- Lady, you gonna have to back up.

231
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,068
She's my little girl.
Please, she's only four years old.

232
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,471
I ain't seen your little girl.
You're gonna have to back up.

233
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,203
- Please, just take a look at her!
- I ain't seen your girl, <i>you...</i>

234
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,471
How do?

235
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,966
Let's go.

236
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,933
Where it at, man?

237
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,343
Back there.

238
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,123
So, what up, man?
You don't value my time?

239
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,715
Nigga, please.

240
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,163
Hand me that screw gun
and calm the fuck down.

241
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,617
Go! Go!

242
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,052
Clear!

243
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,859
Yo, Tosha, go!

244
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,358
- Dante, go, I got your back.
- Go, Dante.

245
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,326
I got you, baby. I got you.

246
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,793
Go! Go!

247
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,795
Go, Dante, go!

248
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,372
Yo, y'all ready?

249
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,042
Let's bang out.

250
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,521
Go, go, go!

251
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,561
Come on, Kimmy, get in the car.
Get in the car, man.

252
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,709
Your department leaks like a fucking sieve.

253
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,238
It could be someone over here at the Hall.
Someone on your staff.

254
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,079
- Someone on the Council.
- It doesn't matter now.

255
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,948
We got to spin it the best way we can...

256
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,182
which means we need you to step up
and take this one for the team, Erv.

257
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,485
- Me?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,221
Tell the newspaper that the academy class
has been delayed for some reason.

259
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,492
Lack of recruits,
problems in your personnel division.

260
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,759
Keep it in your shop.

261
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,494
After which, the Mayor steps in...

262
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,038
announces we'll have an academy class
in January come hell or high water.

263
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,437
Do it like that, it's a one-day story.

264
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,567
Mr. Mayor, this was a budget question.

265
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,469
I was directed to delay that class.

266
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,640
Yeah, you took the hit then
and you're taking the hit now.

267
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,412
And I thank you for both, Commissioner.

268
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:13,888
Eighty-nine?

269
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,194
And that's just the ones
with West Side addresses.

270
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,202
Man, you got to narrow that shit down.

271
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,431
Find some way
to work with all them Peanuts.

272
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,065
Motherfucker, do I look like
George Washington Carver?

273
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,170
Shit.

274
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,148
Cocksuckers got me chasing one gun
through a city full of them.

275
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,410
- Homicide. Yeah.
<i>- Two down, Pall Mall and Pimlico.</i>

276
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,216
Pall Mall and Pimlico. Got it.

277
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,159
Two down in the street.

278
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,525
Ray Cole's up.

279
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:52,432
Cole is in court today and I caught
that cutting in Cherry Hill last night.

280
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,631
Don't look at me.

281
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,109
I'm in the haystacks,
looking for Dozerman's prodigal gun.

282
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,772
You gonna make me
go back-to-back as a primary?

283
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,173
That's some cold shit, Bunk.

284
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,986
Agg assault with a two-by-four?
I don't think so.

285
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,994
Put that with the part twos.

286
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,224
This one, too. Assault by pointing.

287
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,661
If you don't use a handgun,
you don't get credit for waving it, right?

288
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,764
Larceny here.
Hump wrote this up as a daytime B and E?

289
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,406
Fuck this.

290
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,044
Do it clean.

291
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,382
Don't massage anything,
don't sex anything down.

292
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,042
We give them the fucking truth.

293
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,348
What about COMSTAT, boss?
They'll rip you.

294
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,946
There's five months to my 30, right?

295
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,452
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

296
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,929
The major no doubt has some explanation,
some excuse, if you will...

297
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,472
for a weekly felony tabulation
that's going in the opposite direction...

298
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,165
from the other eight districts.

299
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,902
I have none, sir.

300
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,179
You are content with this?

301
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,414
No, Deputy, I'm unhappy.

302
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,642
I wish we were making more of an impact.
But doing what we're doing...

303
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,686
it's clear that's not the case.

304
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:23,222
Major Colvin, I am under the impression
crime is down in the Western.

305
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,559
Perhaps you misfigured
your felony stats this week.

306
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,156
No, sir. We were very accurate.

307
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,400
Sometimes the gods are uncooperative.

308
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,272
Uncooperative?

309
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,966
This is a cooperative effort,
a cooperative department.

310
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,905
Why, in the Eastern District...

311
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,244
Lieutenant Daniels exemplified
this new spirit just the other day.

312
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,841
And because of that,
we got two fresh homicides in the black...

313
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,251
and a lot less bodies on the streets
than could have been...

314
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,788
had that drug war been allowed to drag on.

315
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,916
Mayor has me taking the hit in public
for the late academy class.

316
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,484
- You're kidding me.
- Where's the fucking loyalty, I ask you?

317
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,930
But in the Western,
what do I get from a veteran commander?

318
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,799
You're just having a laugh,
aren't you, Bunny?

319
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,601
You got the real stats and projections
somewhere else.

320
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,302
Someone's just outside the door
with them, right?

321
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,641
A stripper, maybe? That would be nice.

322
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,016
She comes in, flashes a little tit
gives us a whiff of that muff...

323
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,584
and delivers my fucking stat sheets...

324
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,711
with the reduction that matches
just what we promised the Mayor.

325
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:28,486
That would be beautiful.
That would be crï¿½me fucking brï¿½lï¿½e.

326
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:35,297
But what I got instead is some half-assed
"I wish we were doing better" platitude...

327
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,337
that's meant to fool maybe a six-year-old
girl into thinking you're doing your job.

328
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,335
Well, she's left the room, Major Colvin.

329
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,699
She's out there right now
asking the stripper...

330
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,607
if she can have her job
when she grows up...

331
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,907
because she sure as shit
doesn't want yours.

332
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,349
You know why?

333
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,677
Because there isn't gonna be a goddamn
Western District in 20 years...

334
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,346
if this shit keeps up.

335
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:01,687
I don't care how many years
you have on this job.

336
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,126
If the felony rate doesn't fall,
you most certainly will.

337
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,924
The gods are fucking you,
you find a way to fuck them back.

338
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:15,370
It's Baltimore, gentlemen.
The gods will not save you.

339
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,640
I ain't on nobody's team.
I'm not playing <i>that...</i>

340
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,785
Come on. We're on the same team.

341
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,425
Give me that.

342
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,426
She look like a player?

343
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,862
Bystander?

344
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,160
Come on, let's go.

345
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,633
Right in the middle of it all if she was.

346
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,689
- Yo, my turn to be Omar.
- No. Give it to me.

347
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,963
Look, I'm telling you, I was there.

348
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,228
White folks was on the stoop
by the 909 Club...

349
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,065
and Apex just standing over his ass...

350
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,503
pumping more holes in the boy
than a motherfucker need.

351
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,508
Shit, I ain't lying. Soon as that
motherfucking nine stopped talking...

352
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,704
White folks look up at Apex, say,
"Bitch, that the best you got?"

353
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,110
Man, I'm just saying...

354
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,582
a boy got that much white blood,
he got to be a punk.

355
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:40,522
- You want me, boss?
- Your numbers way down, Fruit. Way down.

356
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,686
Man, it's Barksdale's people.

357
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,888
They clipping the dope fiends
coming up Fremont.

358
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,136
You know, when I ran a shop
and my numbers dropped...

359
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,439
I damn sure did something about it.

360
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,508
- Yeah, I hear that.
- I just want them moved.

361
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,072
Take the young 'uns with you,
give them a workout.

362
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,213
All right.

363
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:11,780
So, Lieutenant, you got an "attaboy"
from the Deputy today, huh?

364
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,349
It cost me my wiretap, though.

365
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,224
Still, it's good work over in the Eastern.

366
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,456
Knocking down a drug war.

367
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,501
Yeah, he's gonna do the same thing for me
up on Park Heights.

368
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,231
I got this Kintel Williamson character
who needs some fixing.

369
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:32,036
And Rawls promised me Daniels
and his unit for about a month or so.

370
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,839
You're getting quite the rep there, kiddo.

371
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,244
So, Stan, what's your plan
for the Southeast?

372
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,373
How you gonna give Rawls his numbers?

373
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,385
I don't know. Flex squads on the corners...

374
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,781
foot patrols in the Perkins Homes,
overtime out the ass.

375
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,156
And if that don't work, cheat on the stats.

376
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,259
So what say you?

377
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,889
Shit, me? I'm going to 12-hour shifts
on the weekend, man.

378
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,067
What about you, Bunny?

379
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,738
I don't know.

380
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,408
I thought I might legalize drugs.

381
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,741
So they hit the goddamn alley.
And we on them.

382
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,185
That cocksmoking motherfucker
with the big-bitch gun?

383
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,222
- We was running hard on his ass, but...
- I think I hit him.

384
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,384
- Nigga, you ain't hit nobody.
- I might've hit him.

385
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,860
Yo, String, we hit the one girl.

386
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,455
But after that, man,
I ain't seen nobody catch no lead, man.

387
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,727
- Except for Tank.
- Yeah, Tank gone.

388
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,998
The other broad dropped him.
So I guess we're even now.

389
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,631
- So you get one, right?
- Yeah.

390
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,074
That's good. That's like a 40-degree day.

391
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,181
Ain't nobody got nothing to say
about a 40-degree day.

392
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,476
Fifty. Bring a smile to your face.

393
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:52,022
Sixty, shit, niggas is damn near
barbecuing on that motherfucker.

394
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,519
Go down to 20, niggas get their bitch on.

395
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,060
Get their blood complaining.

396
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,428
But 40? Nobody give a fuck about 40.

397
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,765
Nobody remember 40, and y'all niggas
is giving me way too many 40-degree days.

398
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,996
What the fuck?

399
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,077
Now, we gonna cover that bitch's funeral,
her fucking wake.

400
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,276
We're gonna be all over that motherfucker,
till the bitch hit the ground.

401
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,683
And if the faggot roll up
to pay his respects...

402
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,345
we're gonna be on that motherfucker.

403
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,047
Who the fuck you talking to, man?

404
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,455
It's Donette, String. She been calling.

405
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,120
No, put the phone down.

406
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,866
- Are you all feeling me on this?
- Yeah.

407
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,332
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

408
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,698
He show up,
we on him like a motherfucking...

409
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,362
Like a 40-degree day.

410
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,977
So overall, felonies are down.

411
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,147
But murders are still up.
What's our next move?

412
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,778
Let me bump overtime and court pay
for homicide and district ops.

413
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,289
Cases go into the green
before they go into the black.

414
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,491
Done.

415
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,255
And of course, if we could get some help
at the courthouse, it would go a long way.

416
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,524
Hey, if you're going to try
and dig your way out of this...

417
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,758
don't make me your shovel.

418
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,266
My department is bringing you casework
that goes nowhere.

419
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,802
The cases are thin.

420
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,930
Most wouldn't make it past a prelim
in the court of a freshman judge.

421
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,565
Well, maybe if your personnel weren't
so goddamn concerned...

422
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,736
for their goddamn conviction rate,
they'd chance a whodunit or two.

423
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,835
For Christ's sake...

424
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,041
Jesus, at least pretend
you're on the same side.

425
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,849
Stephen, you and I are both going to be
counting votes this time next year.

426
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,048
Do something to help our sorry asses.

427
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:09,092
And Erv, if you want to do more
than just finish out Walker's term...

428
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,252
show me something more
than just a pass of the buck.

429
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,589
I don't think any of us
wants to have to get a real job.

430
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,075
- Mr. Mayor.
- All right.

431
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,372
- I'll see you both in here on this next week.
- Thank you, sir.

432
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,441
They're like children.

433
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,412
Demper's always been a hack.

434
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,990
But he's an elected hack,
so we're stuck with him.

435
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:45,085
But Burrell, though.
You're vulnerable on crime, Clarence.

436
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,357
You need to set some deadwood adrift.

437
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,730
- Burrell's got friends.
- The ministers?

438
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,837
Well, he might be their man, but so are you.

439
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,566
You fire Burrell,
you get some new blood in here...

440
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,472
the crime rate drops, huh?

441
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,875
The ministers will live with it.

442
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,080
So you're tough on deadwood, huh?

443
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,416
In the new 11th district, too, I hear.

444
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,654
Mr. Mayor, it's time for Eunetta to go.

445
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,159
She's had her time. There are better people
out there for the Council.

446
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,958
She's on the team, Odell.
Just like my police commissioner.

447
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,133
I value loyalty. Don't you?

448
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,965
Bunky Bunk, where's my Bunk?

449
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,072
Cole was up, not you.

450
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,238
You're on Dozerman's gun, remember?

451
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,748
Cole was at the courthouse. Sue me.

452
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,518
Rawls and Foerster have crawled up
into my backside...

453
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,180
and they're gonna stay there
until you find Dozerman's gun.

454
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,783
Now, I would like it very much
if I could unclench my ample ass cheeks...

455
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,530
if you don't mind,
and rid myself of that discomfort.

456
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:58,431
Jay, I just caught one that pushed its way
all the way to the top of my stack.

457
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,731
- A victim, Jay. On the real side.
- Do tell.

458
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,575
Second body in a double.

459
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,371
Girl in her 20s, caught in the middle
of a firefight. Takes one in the dome.

460
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,677
But she's still dead
in a zip code that does not fucking matter.

461
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,617
And you still owe me
a departmental-issue nine.

462
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,348
Find the fucking gun, Bunk.

463
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,627
Fuck me.

464
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,662
Kintel Williamson, who the fuck?

465
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,431
- He has corners in Park Heights.
- But Jesus, who doesn't?

466
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,407
So all day we're calling you, Jimmy,
wondering where you're at.

467
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,443
Kima, maybe you can enlighten us.

468
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,978
Don't look at me.

469
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,675
My running buddy don't even tell me
where he's off to these days.

470
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,910
- I was at the library.
- Bullshit.

471
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,714
I was at the library at M.C.I. Jessup.

472
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,450
D'Angelo Barksdale was not a suicide.

473
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,751
- The M.E. Tell you that?
- He didn't need to.

474
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,454
The physical evidence didn't match up.

475
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:03,261
Look, I don't like coming up off of Stringer
or Prop Joe any more than you do.

476
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,029
But, McNulty, this shit is kind of weak.

477
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,002
Cedric is under a lot of pressure...

478
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,767
to use this unit
to get the murder rate down.

479
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,002
So for now,
Stringer Bell's jacket belongs in narcotics.

480
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,011
Man took you off a boat, Jimmy.

481
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,276
He want to peel his unit off,
his unit, Jimmy...

482
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,916
and go after the target of his choice,
baby, it's his call.

483
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,780
Lester, I thought you were all about
the best case possible.

484
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,189
When it's there, I am.

485
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,915
Yo, I need y'all to hear this, man.

486
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,615
It was my fault.

487
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,291
You hear me?

488
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,518
I'm sorry, yo.

489
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,127
That don't do nothing for me.

490
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,285
How come...

491
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,657
they know you're police
when they hook up with you...

492
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,932
and they know you're police
when they move in...

493
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:20,002
and they know you're police when
they decide to start a family with you...

494
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,831
and all that shit is just fine
until one day it ain't.

495
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,207
One day it's,
"You should have a regular job...

496
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,879
"you need to be home at 5:00."

497
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,108
- "You need to call more."
- I'm saying.

498
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,314
"You need to stop fucking waitresses."

499
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,260
I wanna come down here tomorrow
to Western.

500
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,298
See what's what
since those Towers came down.

501
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,227
We're supposed to start
on Kintel tomorrow.

502
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,893
Fuck that chump.

503
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,801
- He can wait a day or two.
- Yeah, okay.

504
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,597
What the fuck.

505
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,782
When you were humping a radio car
in the Western, was this your hole?

506
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,045
Yeah.

507
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,021
Here and down on Winchester,
under the bridge.

508
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,059
Bet there were a lot of nights
you didn't go home to the missus.

509
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:22,427
- Don't tell me I'm the same kind of asshole.
- Pucker up, girlfriend.

510
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,427
Jesus!

511
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,893
I'm turning into McNulty.

512
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,444
Hey. I'm getting ready to go now.

513
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,776
No, Mee-maw, you know I can't.

514
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,783
Times like these, honey, you have to shine.

515
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:19,684
In your face, in your clothes,
and in your pocket. Now, go on.

516
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,394
- Make sure you get something to eat, hear?
- Go on, now.

517
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,031
- You know them?
- Not a clue.

518
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,003
The crew on that corner looks familiar.

519
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,546
A couple old faces.

520
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,416
Not many.

521
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,251
You go away for a year
and the whole world changes up.

522
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,794
Quiet, though.

523
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:03,530
Barksdale loses the Towers and he's able
to stretch out without bodies falling?

524
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,759
I wonder what the Western guys
have been seeing lately.

525
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,835
Yeah. Hey, Jay.

526
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,775
<i>- You have a minute?</i>
- Yeah.

527
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,011
- What the fuck happened?
<i>- He just collapsed.</i>

528
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,212
When?

529
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,887
How is he?

530
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,319
Shit.

531
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,199
- You're gonna let me know, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

532
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,068
Okay, yeah.

533
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,899
Thanks.

534
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,535
- You know Ray Cole?
- Homicide, right?

535
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,110
Collapsed in the gym at the Central District
this morning.

536
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,943
- On a fucking Stairmaster.
- Well, how is he?

537
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,281
A Stairmaster.

538
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,162
Hey, Poot, check it out.

539
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,867
- Where they at?
- I don't know.

540
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,935
Shit! Go!

541
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,733
Go! Look out, man!

542
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,342
Break it, break, motherfuckers.

543
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,584
Man said break. Come on.

544
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,314
I was working that bitch.

545
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,683
Yeah, shorty, you hard.

546
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,919
Go. We out of here.

547
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,867
"The Commissioner acknowledged
that money had been budgeted...

548
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,271
"for the academy class...

549
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,775
"but said the department
was awaiting approval...

550
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:57,439
"of a federal training and education grant
before scheduling the program."

551
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,276
Burrell can talk some shit, can't he?

552
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,547
Downtown in the house.

553
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,884
- Hey, Kima baby.
- Hey, Ellis.

554
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,750
Herc.

555
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,521
So, what do we owe the pleasure?

556
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,530
Cruising your district,
seeing what's up since the Towers fell.

557
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,227
We see Barksdale crews on a few corners,
but no one seems to be beefing with them.

558
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,825
What's up with all this brotherhood?

559
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,100
We keep the lid on tight. You know,
they know we're not their friends...

560
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,176
and they damn well know that
we'll take it to them if they don't behave.

561
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,670
What do your C.I.'s tell you?

562
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,008
Fuck C.I.'s.
We don't need no stinking C.I.'s.

563
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,676
We tune them up, we beat them down,
we lock them up.

564
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,214
It's the Western District way.

565
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,525
Sergeant, you're wanted in roll call
for a supervisor's meeting.

566
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,623
Gotta go.

567
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:53,629
Remember what I told you?
Police is only as good as his informants.

568
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,763
Yeah, well, we ain't downtown no more,
Kima. We're in the trenches here.

569
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:01,004
You want information, you go get
your own C. I. And you shoot the shit.

570
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,783
You're late, Sergeant.

571
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,945
I had a couple of downtown detectives
in my shop.

572
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,455
They were confused
and required assistance, sir.

573
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,896
Well, I'll catch you up.

574
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:25,598
The new strategic plan for the district
is to move all street-level trafficking...

575
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,271
to these three areas.

576
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,098
- We want to push it.
- Push it, boss?

577
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,573
If they don't go easy, then they go hard.

578
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,941
But we let these knuckleheads know...

579
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,077
that if they move to these areas,
away from the residential streets...

580
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,812
away from commercial areas,
away from schools...

581
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,445
if they take that shit down the road...

582
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,548
they can go about their business
without any interference from us.

583
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,517
It's going to be hands-off
in the Western District...

584
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,688
- for the foreseeable future.
- Bullshit, man.

585
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,788
- No fucking way.
- Wait.

586
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,958
You're saying you want us to give them
a free pass?

587
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,899
- How're we going to look them in the eye?
- Yeah.

588
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,472
They'll shit all over us,
tell their kids to shit all over us.

589
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,666
Hey, the Major wasn't finished.

590
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,212
You got to take the long view here.

591
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:10,981
<i>Once...</i>

592
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,749
Once they're all comfortable,
once they are all rounded up...

593
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,949
once they've been down there a bit
and they're used to putting their feet up...

594
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,993
and playing with the remote, then we move.

595
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,563
Then we go back and we do police work.

596
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,191
Look at it this way, gentlemen.

597
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,666
Would you rather shoot at fish
in the ocean...

598
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,264
or would you rather gather them up
in a few small barrels...

599
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,634
and start emptying your clips then?

600
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:42,712
Not to mention, you still get to kick
the shit out of all the mopes...

601
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,110
that don't move off our corners.

602
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,546
So it ain't all bad.

603
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,825
Slow up, girl.

604
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,860
Come on, now.

605
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,561
So this your ride?

606
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,030
- It's nice.
- I suppose you got a Lex.

607
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,834
No, girl. Got a bus pass.

608
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,507
You out the game, then?

609
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:18,109
Doing a little landscaping right now
but trying to figure things out.

610
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,450
- So what's your boy's name?
- Allen.

611
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,090
- After lverson?
- After his daddy.

612
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,088
What?

613
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,723
I'm trying to picture you mowing a lawn.

614
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,637
Yeah, I don't be wearing this suit.

615
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,368
- You look good in it, still.
- You look good, too.

616
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:49,208
You know, they bought a lot a folks out
with early retirement in Parks and Rec.

617
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,413
I could maybe hook you up
with someone to talk to.

618
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:56,452
A man at my church is helping the city
fill a lot of those jobs.

619
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,885
That would <i>be...</i> Thank you.

620
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,093
Write your number there.

621
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,319
He'll call you.

622
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,596
I gotta go.

623
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,803
It was good seeing you.

624
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,766
Grace.

625
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,171
Looking at <i>you...</i>

626
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,737
What?

627
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,507
Hurts.

628
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,742
You shouldn't look then.

629
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,626
A food blast will take your mind off it.

630
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,790
I'd rather my mind on it, Bubs.

631
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,432
I swear, I'm sick of all of this, man.

632
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,731
Wondering when I got so old.

633
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,534
Some more mac and cheese, huh?

634
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,939
- Hey, Bubs.
- Kima.

635
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,479
- Hey, Bub.
- McNutty, man. My mainest man.

636
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,471
- You ready to put some work in?
- Born ready.

637
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,450
- Snitching? Fuck that, Bubs.
- Hey, no, man.

638
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:06,682
Better than lifting 500-pound radiators.
I'm up for these two, Johnny.

639
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,018
That's easy money, man.

640
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,650
Come on, let's grab a burger.

641
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:16,722
You mind if I bang out of here early?
I ain't right with this Cole thing.

642
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,201
There's gonna be a detectives' wake
at Kavanagh's tonight. You gonna come?

643
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,967
I barely knew the guy.
You all laying him out at the bar, huh?

644
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,435
Tradition. Tomorrow night,
he goes to the funeral home for family.

645
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,671
Tonight, Ray drinks with the boys.

646
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,608
Come on, Bubs. We ain't got all day.

647
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,446
He's up for re-election...

648
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,956
and he's never had a single one of his
goo-goo bills pass the committee.

649
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,186
So, he's got one for all-day kindergarten.

650
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,194
I mean who's gonna argue
with more kindergarten?

651
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,923
I mean, this guy has got a bill...

652
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,966
which is the legislative equivalent
of kissing a baby.

653
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,764
So, right, he goes to his chairman,
pleads his case and says...

654
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,771
"You know, this don't go through,
I'm torched...

655
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,535
"and I'm going to be back
in that hardware store, mixing paint."

656
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,634
So, the chairman takes pity and agrees.
He gets the bill to the floor.

657
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:05,772
But the house speaker, he hates this bill.
So, it gets loved to death, you know.

658
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,579
Slap on an amendment
for another $150 million in costs...

659
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,845
subsidies, handouts...

660
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,547
and the bill goes down in flames.
122 to 10.

661
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,749
The delegate,
he can smell those paint cans.

662
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,224
And the chairman says,
"Hey, sorry, brother.

663
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,557
"I fought like a tiger for that bill."

664
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,093
With friends like <i>that...</i>

665
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,861
You want friends? In this racket?
Get a dog.

666
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,330
- What?
<i>- Look, we're real busy.</i>

667
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,134
- I need to talk to him.
<i>- I gave him the message.</i>

668
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,142
- Look, just tell him it's Donette.
<i>- You're sure he knows you?</i>

669
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,303
Yeah, he know who the fuck I am.

670
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,438
- Yo, String, she said...
- Not now.

671
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,747
Look, he say not now. I got to go.

672
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,655
Marlo? It's a problem, String.

673
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,960
Club soda and lime.

674
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,965
You'll never get there that way.

675
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,800
Get where?

676
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,205
Excuse me.

677
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:13,505
How the hell was I to know the Mayor
was gonna put the screws to you?

678
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,848
You read the paper? I look like shit.

679
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,213
Hey, you got your class.

680
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:23,782
And probably scored points with Royce
out of sheer loyalty, right?

681
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,755
We are police.

682
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,127
So no lies between us.

683
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,432
He wasn't the greatest detective
and he wasn't the worst.

684
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,231
He put down some good cases
and he dogged a few bad ones.

685
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,706
But the motherfucker had his moments.
Yes, he fucking did.

686
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:21,083
You remember the Mississippi extradition?
The arson murders?

687
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,118
- Right.
- He brought that case home.

688
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,417
And the triple at the after-hours
over on Hudson Street...

689
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,855
that was Ray Cole at his best.

690
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,652
And Fayette Street in '93, the drug wars.

691
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:37,165
He took a lot of hot corners
and cooled them.

692
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,867
Yes, indeed.

693
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,638
He won as much as he lost.

694
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,037
Much as any of us.

695
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,647
For Christ's sake, Hugh,
play the fucking song, already.

696
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,720
Did he piss off a wife or three?

697
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,351
No fucking doubt.

698
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,422
I think the last one actually
kind of got used to him, thank God.

699
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,031
Did he say the wrong shit now and then?

700
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,467
Did he bust balls and cheat on his taxes...

701
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,267
and forget to call his mother
and fuck the wrong broad...

702
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,638
for the wrong fucking reason
every now and then?

703
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,301
Who fucking doesn't? Christ!

704
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:27,005
Was he as full of shit as every other
sad-sack motherfucker wearing a badge...

705
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,678
of Baltimore City Police?
Abso-fucking-lutely.

706
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,554
His shit was as weak as ours, no question.

707
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,852
But Ray Cole stood with us...

708
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:39,925
all of us...

709
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,230
in Baltimore...

710
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:47,269
working, sharing a dark corner
of the American experiment.

711
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,933
He was called.

712
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,112
He served.

713
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,617
He is counted.

714
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,446
Old King Cole.

715
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,248
Old King Cole!

716
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,631
I'm sorry, but I gotta get these guys home.

717
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,734
But all things considered,
I think they did pretty well.

718
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:36,175
They were great.
And you were great, really, Jen.

719
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,072
Besides, I think they got
all the family shots they need.

720
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,208
So, you'll be a while, though, huh?

721
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,845
Got to work the crowd, you know.

722
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,651
- Make them think I'm worthy of their faith.
- You are...

723
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,520
- Well, thank you.
...most of the time.

724
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,752
Bitch.

725
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,224
Not too late if you can help it, okay?

726
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,815
Jimmy.

727
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,681
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

728
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,122
Shit is fucked.

729
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,436
You fucking wake up like any other day.

730
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,400
You fucking eat and think about bills...

731
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,568
and dry-cleaning and shit...

732
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,241
and fucking vacation
and your fucking retirement plan and what?

733
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,883
Like that.

734
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,953
Like that.

735
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,716
He checked out of here...

736
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:01,363
with you still owing him
a clearance on that Omar thing.

737
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,625
I know, I know. I fucking know.

738
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,265
Like that.

739
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,645
On a fucking Stairmaster.

740
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,578
On a fucking Stairmaster.

741
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,751
Wake up and die right, you cunts.

742
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,504
What's going on, man?

743
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,914
That whip is pretty.
I gotta get me one of them joints one day.

744
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,739
Shit, yeah.
