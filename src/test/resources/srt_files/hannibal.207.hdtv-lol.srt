1
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,545
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:08,749
Where were you last night?

3
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:10,458
I was withHannibal all night, Jeff.

4
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:13,184
- My name is Miriam Lass. I'm with the FBI.
- Come in.

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,621
The Chesapeake Ripper recorded Miriam Lass
2 years ago.

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,135
Jack, I was so wrong.

7
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:19,897
You said yourself there's no body.

8
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:21,423
Miriam Lass is dead.

9
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:22,772
Found something else in the woods.

10
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,044
Madrona bark.

11
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,772
Will didn't kill any of these people.

12
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:27,596
There's a small stand in Virginia.

13

<i>Jack, it's Miriam.</i>

00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:32,873
<i>I don't know where I am.</i>

<i>I was so wrong.</i>

17
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:41,181
<i>Please, Jack.</i>
<i>I don't want to die like this.</i>

18
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,183
<i>Jack, it's Miriam.</i>

<i>I was so wrong.</i>

21
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,073
Thank you.

22
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,179
I knew you'd never
stop looking.

23
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,188
Can I see him?

24
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,160
We haven't caught the Ripper.

25
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:32,332
He's... he's still...?

26
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:36,336
We need your help, Miriam.
You know who he is.

27
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:40,374
I don't.
Know who he is.

28
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,511
You found him.

29
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:47,715
I don't remember finding him.

30
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:52,219
He got inside my head.

31
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:02,563
I remember a dream
about drowning.

32
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,103
And then being awake.

33
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,604
And not awake.

34
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:14,608
Being myself, and not myself.

35
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:17,811
I'd wake up to the smell
of fresh flowers

36
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,847
and the sting of a needle.

37
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:25,686
I wasn't afraid.

38
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:34,028
Fear and pain were so...
far away.

39
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,466
I was reckless with your life.

40
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:43,470
- I was reckless with my life.
- I saw

41
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,906
what I needed in you
and I used you.

42
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,410
I let you break the rules on my behalf
while I hid behind deniability.

43
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:53,080
Agent Crawford, please do not
apologize to me for my mistakes.

44
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,850
He treated me very well,

45
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:00,888
until the end,
until he put me in the ground.

46
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:04,358
Even when...
he took my arm.

47
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:06,460
He told me
what he was going to do.

48
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:09,997
I went to sleep, woke up,
it was gone.

49
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:15,169
He said he wanted
to give it to you.

50
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,510
Can you identify him?

51
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:27,514
I could hear his voice,
but I couldn't see his face.

52
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:32,152
All I could see...

53
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,723
...was light.

54
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,535
Why didn't he kill you, Miriam?

55
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,307
Why were you spared?

56
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:56,076
I wasn't spared.

57
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,813
He was saving me for last.

58
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,458
They found a witness.

59
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:16,664
A survivor.
The only victim

60
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:18,866
of the Chesapeake Ripper
who lived to tell.

61
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,337
<i>Is this witness</i>
<i>watching me now?</i>

62
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,141
(Alana):<i>Yes.</i>

63
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,479
(Hannibal):<i>It seems I am</i>
<i>the usual suspect.</i>

64
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,189
I keep having angry, imaginary conversations
with Jack Crawford about that.

65
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,995
I wish I could tell you
why this is happening.

66
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:56,370
His witness must not be able
to identify the Ripper by sight.

67
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:01,842
Jack wants them
to hear my voice;

68
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:04,044
otherwise,
I'd be in here alone.

69
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,579
Right?

70
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:14,455
Still...

71
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:16,490
I appreciate your company.

72
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:43,350
It's not him.

73
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,990
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

74
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,026
He's not the Ripper.

75
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:21,068
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

76
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,155
This is very sudden.

77
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,658
The federal prosecutor dropped
all charges.

78
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:51,428
Since you were not convicted
of killing anyone,

79
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:54,965
the basis for your sentencing
to this institution is

80
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,901
null and void.

81
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,672
The Chesapeake Ripper has
set you free.

82
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,707
Mazel Tov.

83
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,512
(door buzzer) (door unlocked)

84
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,721
I would love nothing more

85
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:22,293
than to see you trade places
with Dr. Lecter.

86
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,462
I have no intention
of ending up on his menu.

87
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:28,132
Well, then confess, Frederick.

88
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,467
Might be the only thing
saves your life.

89
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:31,969
Confess to what?

90
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:34,805
Confess to bonding
with Hannibal Lecter

91
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,641
over your shared practice
of unorthodox therapies.

92
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:40,644
Dr. Lecter with me,
you with Abel Gideon.

93
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,646
Gideon is playing his own game;

94
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,815
was wheeled out of that hospital
by the Chesapeake Ripper.

95
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:46,817
Curious what bargain
they struck.

96
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,819
No, there's no bargaining
with smoke.

97
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:51,322
No, Gideon's dead.

98
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,557
You're next.

99
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:55,559
Unless I unburden myself?

100
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:58,262
Confession is
good for the soul.

101
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:03,233
Shine a light on your relationship
with Hannibal Lecter.

102
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,235
He works in the shadows.

103
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,271
Deny them to him.

104
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,375
Tell Jack Crawford everything.

105
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:14,378
Are you suggesting I kill my career
before Hannibal can kill me?

106
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:17,047
I'm suggesting you convince
Jack Crawford however you can.

107
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:23,120
Like your life depends on it.

108
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,660
Why did Hannibal
not just kill you?

109
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,266
Because he wants
to be my friend.

110
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,784
You need a ride?

111
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,422
I was gonna call a cab.

112
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:02,159
We found Miriam Lass.

113
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:04,461
Alive.

114
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,833
You catch the Ripper?

115
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:16,240
How is she? Miriam.

116
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,843
Traumatized.

117
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,114
Miriam thanked me

118
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,350
after we found her.

119
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:29,153
Thanked me for not
giving up on her.

120
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:33,057
But I had.
I had given up on her.

121
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,558
And I gave up on you too.

122
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,493
I thought she was dead.

123
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,464
I thought you were crazy.

124
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:43,500
And I gave up on trying
to find the both of you.

125
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,777
You didn't have to
find me, Jack.

126
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,518
You just had to listen to me.

127
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:03,520
I put Miriam in a room
with Hannibal Lecter.

128
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:05,623
She stated definitively
he is not

129
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:07,992
the Chesapeake Ripper.

130
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:10,194
That definitive enough for you?

131
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,729
No.

132
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,799
It wasn't.

133
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:23,674
Where'd you find Miriam, Jack?

134
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:36,854
The property was condemned
years ago.

135
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:40,290
Apparently the Ripper has been
using it since that time.

136
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,159
Will.

137
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,694
In here.

138
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,560
It's Beverly Katz's blood.

139
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:52,897
He drained her before he froze
her before he cut into her.

140
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,302
Chesapeake Ripper's
latest victim,

141
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,304
he was found
in the other cistern.

142
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,673
The water in his lungs
is what led us here.

143
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:11,615
We found Miriam down there.

144
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,451
She believed the Ripper
brought her here to kill her.

145
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:17,021
He was saving her
to be his last victim.

146
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,492
He knows we're close
to catching him.

147
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,961
He's been caught before.

148
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:27,531
Catch a fish once
and it gets away...

149
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:32,536
...it's a lot harder to catch
a second time.

150
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:48,719
(steady heartbeat)

151
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,300
I sowed the seeds...

152
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,504
and watched them grow.

153
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:45,209
I cultivated...

154
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,512
a long chain of events
leading to this.

155
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,218
All of this...

156
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:59,790
...has been my design.

157
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,802
It's theater.

158
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,340
Every time the Ripper kills

159
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,342
someone, it's theater.

160
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,078
The Ripper didn't bring
Miriam here to kill her.

161
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:23,514
He brought her here
for you to find.

162
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:29,486
But the Ripper's
not self-destructive.

163
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:32,623
- He doesn't want to get caught.
- He wants you to catch someone.

164
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:35,960
Like he wanted you to catch me.

165
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:41,832
Somewhere,
in all of this evidence,

166
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:43,667
you will find something

167
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:46,670
that will lead you away
from Hannibal Lecter.

168
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,840
Miriam Lass has
already done that.

169
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:51,909
Two years -

170
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:56,013
it's a long time
to have Hannibal in your head.

171
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,149
You can't trust her, Jack.

172
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:03,153
You can't trust any of this
to be what it seems.

173
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,900
(dogs barking)

174
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:29,902
Hey!
(He whistles.)

175
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,437
Hey.

176
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:38,044
Welcome home.

177
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:41,072
Thank you.

178
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,852
Thank you
for looking after them.

179
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,787
They seem happy.

180
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:50,823
Happy to see you.

181
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:52,825
Who's this?

182
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,561
Applesauce.
She's mine.

183
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:59,098
She likes applesauce.

184
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,633
I rescued her.

185
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,773
Picking up
some of my bad habits?

186
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,944
Picking up your good habits.

187
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:13,980
You challenged
my whole framework

188
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:16,949
of assumptions
about the way you are.

189
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:21,421
- The way I think you are.
- Well, the way you think I am

190
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:24,424
isn't always a reliable guide
to who I am.

191
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,828
I was wrong about you.

192
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:31,931
Because you didn't believe me?
Or in me?

193
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,200
Because you

194
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:39,505
let me question my sanity,
my sense of reality?

195
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,141
Because you tried
to kill Hannibal.

196
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,013
You're wrong about him, Will.

197
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,816
No, you're wrong about him,
Alana. You see the best in him.

198
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,752
I... don't.

199
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:59,025
- Hey?
- What was done to you

200
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,227
doesn't excuse what you did.

201
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:07,567
Are you going to try
to hurt Hannibal again?

202
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,869
Is he safe?

203
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,775
From me, or for you?

204
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:27,420
He's dangerous, Alana.

205
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:30,924
I suggest you stay as far away
from Hannibal Lecter as you can.

206
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:40,600
Come on.
(He whistles.)

207
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:42,602
(He whistles.)

208
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:45,071
(dog barking)

209
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,006
<i>What can I do for you,</i>

210
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,575
- Dr. Chilton?
- It is what I can do for you.

211
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,845
I would like to offer my services
on the Ripper case - pro bono,

212
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,115
- of course.
- I see.

213
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,118
You wish to be helpful expediting
Hannibal Lecter's arrest?

214
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:02,722
I have consulted with the FBI
on previous Ripper murders.

215
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:05,291
You have an agenda
with this case, Doctor.

216
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:08,094
Yes, I have an agenda:
living.

217
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:11,130
I should be assigned
an FBI escort.

218
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:15,101
Everyone who believed Will Graham
about Hannibal Lecter is dead.

219
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:18,204
- Except you.
- Except me.

220
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:22,275
I would like to remain not dead
for the foreseeable future.

221
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:27,313
Do you have something substantial
to contribute, or just an opinion?

222
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:29,916
- I have a witness.
- A witness?

223
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,418
If Will is not a suspect,
then he is a witness.

224
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:35,255
- To his own manipulation?
- We have had

225
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:37,957
remarkable success
recovering memory.

226
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:41,361
He remembers so much
of what was done to him.

227
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,663
Why hasn't Will
told me this himself?

228
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:46,165
Because you told him
his memories were meaningless.

229
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:51,437
I imagine Hannibal Lecter used
the same coercive techniques

230
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:54,974
on Miriam Lass that he used
on Will Graham.

231
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,977
He buried memories
in both of them.

232
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:04,617
Jack, I dug those memories out of
Will; I can dig them out of Miriam.

233
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:08,187
Miriam Lass is not
your patient, Doctor.

234
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,832
Over the shoulder...

235
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:45,692
Are you an FBI agent?

236
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:47,794
No. Uh...

237
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,797
I used to teach at the academy.

238
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,800
And, uh, two days ago,

239
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,568
I was an inmate

240
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:58,705
at the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane...

241
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,042
...courtesy of
the Chesapeake Ripper.

242
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,514
Well, the Guru told me
the only person who had

243
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:11,284
any practical understanding
of the Ripper was you.

244
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:13,553
But he didn't mention
that you were a victim.

245
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,054
Guru?

246
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,190
- Jack Crawford.
- Oh.

247
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:19,826
He has a peculiar cleverness.

248
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:24,964
The Guru tells me

249
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,300
that you don't remember much

250
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,702
about what the Ripper
did to you.

251
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:34,007
I couldn't remember either.

252
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,676
- Couldn't?
- Oh, I remember now.

253
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,512
Uh... not all of it.
Pieces.

254
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:45,685
I was...
under his influence.

255
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:51,090
He used some kind of light

256
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,261
to induce a seizure response
in my brain.

257
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:58,298
It created blackouts
and lost time.

258
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:04,904
I remember the light.

259
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:09,309
He, uh, would stand
in front of it,

260
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,477
at a distance from me,

261
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:15,882
silhouetted, very still.
He would

262
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,953
listen to chamber music.
I still hear that.

263
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:22,121
(Hannibal):<i> You're waking now.</i>

264
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:26,226
And his voice, low and even,
would pull me to him.

265
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,461
(Hannibal):<i>Waking</i>
<i>in a pleasant room. Safe...</i>

266
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:30,163
Like a current.

267
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:34,734
(Hannibal):<i>You're waking now.</i>
<i>Waking, calm.</i>

268
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:38,037
<i>Waking in a pleasant room,</i>
<i>safe.</i>

269
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,508
You and I

270
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:46,179
are... part
of his design.

271
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:53,753
He wanted you to be free.

272
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:56,689
He wanted me to be free too.

273
00:22:56,724 --> 00:23:00,426
Neither of us are really free.

274
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,462
He's not done.

275
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,485
The same unfortunate
aftershave.

276
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:32,559
Too long in the bottle.

277
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:41,768
Our last kitchen conversation
was interrupted

278
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:44,504
by Jack Crawford.

279
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:47,841
I'd like to pick up
where we left off.

280
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,843
If memory serves,

281
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,745
you were asking me...

282
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,382
if it would feel good
to kill you.

283
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,587
You've given that some thought.

284
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:03,256
You wanted me to embrace
my nature, Doctor.

285
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,227
I'm just following the urges
I kept down for so long,

286
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:10,230
cultivating them
as the inspirations they are.

287
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:12,866
You never answered my question.

288
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,171
How would killing me
make you feel?

289
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:20,607
Righteous.

290
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:23,109
Aren't you curious, Will?

291
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:26,045
Why you?

292
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,547
Why Miriam Lass?

293
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:29,549
What does the Chesapeake Ripper
want with you?

294
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,584
No, you tell me.

295
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:41,094
How did Miriam Lass find you?

296
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:44,130
You made sure no one could
find you that way again.

297
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:50,737
If I'm not the Ripper,
you murder an innocent man.

298
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:54,807
You better than anyone
know what it means

299
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,943
to be wrongly accused.

300
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:58,945
You were innocent
and no one saw it.

301
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:01,447
No, I'm not innocent.
You saw to that.

302
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:05,652
If I am the Ripper and you kill me,
who will answer your questions?

303
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,124
Don't you want to know
how this ends?

304
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,288
My name is Miriam Lass.
I'm with the FBI.

305
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:50,290
I would show you my credentials,
but I'm actually just a trainee.

306
00:25:50,324 --> 00:25:54,160
Never just a trainee.
An agent in training. Please,

307
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:55,695
come in.

308
00:26:06,953 --> 00:26:07,892
I would have been happy

309
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:10,480
- to come to your office, Jack.
- I understand,

310
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,482
but I wanted to do this here.

311
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:14,518
I'm sure you have your reasons.

312
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:17,888
The most-important aspect
of a successful recovery is

313
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:20,891
recognizing that life will
never be the same.

314
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:24,928
Then I must be well on my way
to a successful recovery.

315
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,512
That's beautiful. Yours?

316
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:44,514
Yes.

317
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,017
I enjoy portraiture.

318
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:50,020
A subject's mental process
betrayed

319
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:53,523
only by the expression
on their face.

320
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,460
Miriam.
The Chesapeake Ripper

321
00:26:56,494 --> 00:27:00,364
sent me a message from you.
It was recorded

322
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:02,366
shortly after you were taken.

323
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,234
It's me? My voice?

324
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,236
Yes.

325
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,771
I want to hear it.

326
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:13,410
Very well.

327
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:18,382
<i>Jack, it's Miriam.</i>
<i>I don't know where I am.</i>

328
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:21,051
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

329
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:23,687
<i>I was so wrong.</i>
<i>I was so wrong.</i>

330
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:26,223
<i>Please, Jack.</i>

331
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:28,258
<i>I don't wanna die like this.</i>

332
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:33,597
I don't remember.

333
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:39,736
Would you like to try?

334
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:42,773
You're waking now.

335
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:45,776
Waking, calm.

336
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,945
Waking in a pleasant room.

337
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,083
Safe.

338
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,222
Open your eyes.

339
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:09,733
Jack.
Jack, it's Miriam.

340
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:12,803
Tell me where you are.

341
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,771
I don't know where I am.

342
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,943
What do you see?

343
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:22,045
I... I can't see
anything.

344
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,881
I was so wrong.

345
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,817
Jack, please.

346
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,720
I don't wanna die like this.

347
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:32,723
Miriam... what was

348
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:35,525
the last thing you remember
before making the call?

349
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,701
The wound man.

350
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,707
We found a fingerprint
on a flower petal.

351
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:54,645
A partial, smudged.
Not enough points for

352
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,015
a courtroom, but it triggered
a match in the system.

353
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,250
Hannibal Lecter.

354
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,319
After all

355
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,755
these murders, the Ripper's
gonna leave a print now?

356
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:09,192
Will said whatever evidence we found,
it would lead us away from the Ripper.

357
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,528
We also found sodium amytal
and scopolamine

358
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:13,263
in Miriam's blood.

359
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:16,033
Dr. Chilton used
scopolamine

360
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:19,036
and sodium amytal
on both Gideon and Will

361
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,271
during their therapy.
One claimed

362
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:25,208
to be the Chesapeake Ripper
and the other accused Hannibal.

363
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,578
"You've got the right box,

364
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,846
but you're looking
in the wrong corner."

365
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:33,150
Gideon pointed me at Chilton,

366
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:35,218
told me that he was the Ripper.

367
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:38,222
Wait. I'm confused.
So, who are we saying is

368
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:42,259
the Chesapeake Ripper?
Dr. Lecter, or Dr. Chilton?

369
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,930
Bring 'em both in.

370
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:59,309
(faint steady beeping)

371
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:20,130
(continuous steady beeping)

372
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:33,210
(flatline tone)

373
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:08,378
Hello, Frederick.

374
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, my god.

375
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:11,715
(knocking)

376
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:14,918
That will be the FBI.

377
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:23,627
When you wake up,
your only choice will be to run.

378
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:26,663
(doorbell) One moment, please.

379
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:12,413
(dogs barking)

380
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:21,088
May I use your shower, please?

381
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,929
Gideon hasn't
been dead for long,

382
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,865
no more than a couple of hours.

383
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,534
Chilton's been carving steaks
off of him for days.

384
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:36,904
Chilton's shelves are filled
with a lot of old medical books.

385
00:33:36,938 --> 00:33:38,906
- The wound man.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,543
This illustration shows up
in a lot of early texts.

387
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,712
It's the Ripper's sixth victim.

388
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:48,049
Chilton was consulting on the Ripper
case when Miriam disappeared.

389
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,051
She must've talked to him,
made the connection.

390
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:52,720
Beverly made a connection too.

391
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:54,722
Chilton's been a part
of the Ripper case

392
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:59,226
since before Will Graham,
Hannibal Lecter, Miriam Lass.

393
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:02,063
He had access to case files.

394
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:05,266
He would know everything
the Ripper would need to know.

395
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:14,408
I have the same profile
as Hannibal Lecter.

396
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:18,012
Same medical
and psychological background.

397
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:21,649
We are both doctors of note
in our field.

398
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,451
Of course it would be me!

399
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:27,154
Hannibal was never going
to kill me.

400
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:30,324
I'm his patsy. I...

401
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,260
I have to leave the country.
I am leaving the country.

402
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:35,262
No, if you run,
you look guilty.

403
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:37,665
You did not run
and you looked plenty guilty.

404
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,703
Abel Gideon was half-eaten
in my guest room.

405
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:45,106
I have corpses on my property.

406
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,943
- You just threw up an ear.
- There's an APB on you

407
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:51,979
right now. They've canceled credit
cards, they're tracing your phone.

408
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:54,715
I have cash
and I tossed my phone.

409
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,885
Jack Crawford thinks I killed
two agents - three agents.

410
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:01,389
You know what tends to happen to
people who do that? Shoot on sight.

411
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:05,226
I'm going to prove Hannibal
Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper.

412
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,962
I know you will.
And when you do,

413
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:11,198
I will read about it
from a secure location

414
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:15,202
and I will reintroduce myself
to society at that time.

415
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:18,105
(dogs barking)

416
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:34,021
Will... what have you done?

417
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:37,224
- I called Jack Crawford.
- No.

418
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:38,759
N...

419
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:43,831
No. No.

420
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:45,833
No.

421
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:50,304
No! No!
No, stay there!

422
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:55,543
You're not a killer, Frederick.

423
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:02,846
Why'd you come alone,
Jack? Why'd you come alone?

424
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:03,901
Where is he? Where is he?!

425
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:06,823
Hey, I told you, everything is
not what it seems.

426
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:09,090
The Chesapeake Ripper is still
playing with us. All of us.

427
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:13,060
The Chesapeake Ripper is not playing
all of us, Will; he's playing you.

428
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:15,863
Jack, wait.
I'll bring him out.

429
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:18,633
- He's got a gun.
- Good.

430
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:46,160
CHILTON!

431
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,416
Chilton, stop where you are!

432
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,680
Please.

433
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,167
One navy blue sweater,

434
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:52,837
one pair of men's dress pants
in charcoal gray,

435
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,473
one black and red pea coat,

436
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,977
one black leather billfold
containing

437
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:04,372
$443, various credit cards,

438
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,838
one set of car keys.

439
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:09,222
I need to speak to Will Graham.

440
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:10,798
I don't care what you need.

441
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,993
One Montblanc fountain pen
in silver and black.

442
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:19,764
Does it have to be you?

443
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:22,233
It seems like one
final indignity.

444
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,771
Not like you

445
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:29,074
- to hide an achievement.
- The achievement

446
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:32,610
is not mine.

447
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,213
Whose is it?

448
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:36,714
Hannibal Lecter's?

449
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:41,252
Those are just words
coming out of your mouth.

450
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:46,057
No weight to them.

451
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:49,094
No consideration
they may be true.

452
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:51,563
They're not true.

453
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:53,898
You were using
coercive therapies,

454
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:56,167
influencing Abel Gideon
and Will Graham

455
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:59,504
to point the Ripper investigations
in false directions.

456
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,005
You cannot see it,

457
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,274
and you will not see it
until it is too late.

458
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:06,678
Don't say I did not
warn you, Dr. Bloom.

459
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,316
In fact, I believe

460
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,818
these should be my last words
on the subject of the Ripper

461
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,121
<i>until my lawyer arrives.</i>

462
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:19,858
You're waking now.

463
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:23,194
Waking, calm.

464
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:24,963
Waking in a quiet room.

465
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:34,205
You're waking now.
Waking in a quiet room. Safe.

466
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,610
It's him. It's him.

467
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:41,045
(stuttering): It's him... It--

468
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,150
(Miriam crying)

469
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:47,485
It's all right.

470
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,679
(knocking on door)

471
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:34,532
Hello, Will.

472
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,568
May I come in?

473
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,905
Do you intend
to point a gun at me?

474
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,310
Not tonight.

475
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,485
Are you expecting someone?

476
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:57,789
Only you.

477
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,325
Kept my standing
appointment open?

478
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,662
And you're right on time.

479
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:12,137
I have to deal with you.

480
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,672
And my feelings about you.

481
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:19,177
I think it's best
if I do that directly.

482
00:41:24,116 --> 00:41:26,418
First you have to grieve
for what is lost

483
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:28,420
and what has changed.

484
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:32,290
I've changed;
you changed me.

485
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,228
The friendship
that we had is over.

486
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:40,598
The Chesapeake Ripper is over.

487
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,601
It had to be Miriam, didn't it?

488
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:47,005
She was compelled
to take his life

489
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,140
so she could take her own back.

490
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,611
How will you
take your life back?

491
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:03,321
I'd like to resume my therapy.

492
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:28,179
Where shall we begin?

493
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:41,638
