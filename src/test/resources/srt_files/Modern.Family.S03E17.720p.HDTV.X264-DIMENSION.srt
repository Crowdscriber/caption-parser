1
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,966
Come on, boys!
It's leap day, not sleep day!

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,288
I love leap day!

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,094
It's kind of a big deal
in the Dunphy house.

4
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:16,729
This year, we even
got Manny involved.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,385
You're given this gift
of 24 extra hours.

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,145
You can't waste it
at work or school.

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,888
You have to do
something extraordinary,

8
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,698
- something shocking.
- Mm.

9
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:28,454
This year, the entire family
is taking a trapeze class.

10
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:29,749
How extraordinary is that?

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,696
It was my idea.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,872
How shocking is that?

13
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:34,214
I can be spontaneous every four years.

14
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:35,451
I can't wait.

15
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:37,149
Leap day is stupid.

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,325
You're not understanding
the logic behind it.

17
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:43,411
A year is actually 365.25 days.

18
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:45,626
Every four years, we gain one day.

19
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:48,268
If we didn't adjust the
calendar in, say, 40 years,

20
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,916
February would almost be January.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,887
That's not my problem, and
it's definitely not your problem.

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,522
Look at this.

23
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,396
The housekeeper turned
another one of my whites pink.

24
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,384
I can't wear this to a sports bar.

25
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,497
Mm, they're to going to
be looking at you, Jay.

26
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,236
Somebody's feeling pretty
good about herself.

27
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:06,147
They're going to be
watching the match.

28
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,125
You meant you a little bit.

29
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:10,947
Okay, put it in there.

30
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,372
All right, very quietly,

31
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:15,926
we're gonna go to daddy's
bedroom, open the door,

32
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:17,270
and-- Aah!

33
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,488
Happy Birthday to me.

34
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,036
I'm 10! 40!

35
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:24,609
I was born February 29th,

36
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,159
and there have been
ten of those...

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,750
In my lifetime, therefore I'm 10!

38
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:29,665
It's fun.

39
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,476
It's so much fun.

40
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:33,915
Anyway, I-I've spent
the last four years

41
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,043
trying to figure to what kind
of party to throw this one.

42
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,352
Oh, honey, you know I'd be fine

43
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:39,421
with just a nice casual
evening at home with you.

44
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:40,775
Don't--don't even.

45
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:42,955
No. No! That's what he said last time.

46
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:47,059
Okay, birthday boy, what's it gonna be--

47
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,700
rom com or horror?

48
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,946
Or we can do both and watch
"maid in Manhattan."

49
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,203
Whatcha doing?

50
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,854
Canceling our baby.

51
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:10,172
Okay, love to dad. Bye! Mwah!

52
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,714
Daddy, what are you doing?

53
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,422
Yeah, daddy, what are you doing?

54
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:19,726
Snooping for hints about
your birthday? Wow.

55
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:20,863
No, I-- come on.

56
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,541
No, I'm just excited,
and I wanna be helpful.

57
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,358
I know party planning isn't your thing.

58
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,412
Wow.

59
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,542
Y-you need to trust me, cam.

60
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:30,124
I know, and I do.

61
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,236
It's not like you're
gonna do anything tired,

62
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,981
like appletinis or ice sculptures.

63
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,617
Or synthetic napkins
or anything mylar.

64
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:36,812
Cam, that's enough!

65
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,100
I've been paying for your
last party for four years.

66
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:40,918
And I find it a little insulting

67
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,671
that you don't think
I can pull this off.

68
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:43,611
You know what?

69
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,340
I trust you. I'm letting go.

70
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,901
- Okay.
- Okay?

71
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:49,541
You know orange is over, right?

72
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,339
It's a simple party. I can do it.

73
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,469
Simple.

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,355
Perfect.

75
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:57,205
Yeah, just a simple party.

76
00:02:57,238 --> 00:03:00,727
I'm simply taking Cam's favorite
movie, "The Wizard of Oz,"

77
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:03,862
and turning our house into
an Oz-themed extravaganza--

78
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:07,327
yellow brick carpet,
waitstaff in full costume,

79
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,536
and custom-made Ruby slippers for Cam.

80
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,015
Whazzup?!

81
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,733
So is this safe?

82
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,600
It's a trapeze.

83
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,645
Relax. More people are killed
by knife-wielding strangers

84
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,359
than from trapezing.

85
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,323
I'm thinking about going home now.

86
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,236
Honey, are you okay?

87
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:29,663
I'm fine.

88
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,182
I'm watching...

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,849
It's so sad.

90
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:37,189
Oh, no. Not today.

91
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:38,467
What's wrong?

92
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,431
Nothing. No, your mom's just, uh...

93
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:41,764
Feeling emotional.

94
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:44,725
She was like this last month
and the month before

95
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:45,958
and the month before.

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,700
What?! I could kill someone!

97
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:49,249
No, I can't hear you!

98
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,726
This stupid phone gets no reception
in this stupid house! Aah!

99
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:55,848
Dear God, no.

100
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,485
I'd heard rumors.

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,477
Yeah, we all had,

102
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:02,205
that females living or
working in close quarters

103
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:05,042
could eventually get on the same... cycle.

104
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,908
But I always assumed that
was a story designed

105
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,890
to keep women out of submarine corps.

106
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,826
This isn't milk.
What's wrong with me today?

107
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,496
My brain's not working right.

108
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:16,543
No.

109
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,251
I can't focus...

110
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:20,819
Three legs?

111
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:22,341
It's not fair.

112
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,365
I know.

113
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,851
Oh, no! It's sad.

114
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,364
Oh, my God.
They're gonna ruin everything.

115
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:30,197
No. We--we just need to be extra sensitive.

116
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:31,887
Phil, honey, when do we need to leave?

117
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,267
Whenever's good for you, sweetie.
Maybe 20 minutes?

118
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:35,659
- 20 minutes?!
- Then which one is it, Phil?

119
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,993
Is it whenever it's good for
me or is it 20 minutes?!

120
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:40,275
Whenever you're ready!

121
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,348
It happened-- Satan's trifecta.

122
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:52,072
They're gonna ruin trapezing.

123
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:53,473
I bet they don't even catch me.

124
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,339
Why are you so afraid of them?
They're reasonable.

125
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,899
Why don't we just suggest they stay home,

126
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,908
- considering they're all on
their menst-- - Shh!

127
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:02,078
The first rule of dealing with the cycle--

128
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,573
you never mention the cycle.

129
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:04,945
You tiptoe around it.

130
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,587
The woman's actually taken great pains

131
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:09,871
to hide the monster she's become.

132
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,999
But if you acknowledge it,
that brings the monster forth.

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,345
My God.

134
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,090
And there's three of them.

135
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,170
It's okay.

136
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,306
I have a plan.

137
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:22,891
It's kind of traditional
for people to lean in

138
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:24,727
when somebody says, "I have a plan."

139
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:27,283
Okay...

140
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:31,531
Ja! Ja! Ja! Ja!

141
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,650
Ooh! No!

142
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,716
Si! Si! Si! Si!

143
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,030
Goal!

144
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,469
Goal!

145
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,931
You should call your
country "the never-lands"

146
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,126
- because you're never-- - Ja, because
we are never going to win.

147
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,612
You said that a billion times.

148
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,849
Just go home.

149
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,219
Why don't you Dutch people go home?

150
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,513
Someone should shut your Colombian mouth!

151
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:53,927
- Okay, I wanna see you try!
- Uh, is there a problem over here?

152
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,609
Yes. There is a problem,
and you're married to her.

153
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,868
Really? Well, let me make a suggestion.

154
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,916
Why don't you sit down,
I send you over a beer,

155
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,429
my wife and I watch from over there?

156
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,324
That way, everybody enjoys the game--

157
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:08,302
except me, 'cause I prefer a
game where something happens.

158
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,864
Gloria, let's go.

159
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,964
Let's go.

160
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,481
I thought you were going to
punch that guy back there.

161
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,286
Ah, I got 60 pounds on the kid.

162
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:22,298
Yeah. It's just that I've heard so
many stories about you fighting.

163
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,842
And-- it's not worth the trouble.

164
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,533
Yeah, and he has all those friends and...

165
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,033
Well, his friends had
nothing to do with it.

166
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,093
I mean, sometimes it's better
to take the high road.

167
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:32,214
Yeah, it's better that you walked away.

168
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:34,627
Gloria, I get-- I get the impression

169
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,072
- you're disappointed I didn't
punch that guy. - Of course not.

170
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:40,986
Who needs all that manly,
protect-your-woman stuff?

171
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,953
- No, see, like, right there.
- You're saying one thing,

172
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:44,698
but it feels like you mean the opposite.

173
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,412
- No.
- That's a "yes."

174
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,023
Look, Jay, I just came to watch the game.

175
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,915
- I don't want to fight.
- Neither do I.

176
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:52,809
I know.

177
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,516
So in keeping with the film,

178
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:57,155
this area will be in black and white,

179
00:06:57,156 --> 00:07:00,310
and then an explosion of technicolor.

180
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:02,812
Best part--as the guests are coming in...

181
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,280
Auntie em! Auntie em!

182
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,603
A simulated tornado.

183
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,071
Yeah. Oh, he's gonna love that.

184
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,064
- So the appletinis are canceled...
- Yes.

185
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,834
The little Toto dog is ordered, and...

186
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,627
Please tell me that you are
not mixing punch in costume!

187
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh, no! W-what is Cam doing home?

188
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,017
- Hey.
- Hey.

189
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:23,512
We're the monkeys.

190
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:25,988
Yes, hi. Hi. Come on inside.
Quickly, quickly.

191
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,270
Hi. Okay, one second.

192
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,351
Hey! Whatcha doing home?

193
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:31,819
Are you checking on me
and the party again?

194
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,475
No, no. I left my cell
phone in your car

195
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:34,596
and I gotta be in touch
with mama today.

196
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,753
She's talking to the insurance
agency for the first time

197
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,966
to see if they're gonna
rebuild grandpa's farm.

198
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:39,949
Rebuild the...

199
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:42,249
Because of the tornado.

200
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:44,465
I totally missed the connection.

201
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,489
A month after the
most devastating twister

202
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,923
to ever hit Cam's hometown,
I throw a party

203
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,792
based on gay cinema's
most famous tornado.

204
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:56,268
Yeah, you know, it's been a month,

205
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,095
and she hasn't heard anything,
and she's just beside herself.

206
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,631
And then you know what else?

207
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,123
Lily succumbed to her injuries.

208
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:04,538
- Your aunt Lily died?
- No, the family pig.

209
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:05,641
Aunt Lily was a...

210
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:07,160
We named our daughter after a pig?

211
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,861
Could you just witness
my pain instead of criticizing?

212
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,994
I just want to be in touch
with my family today,

213
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:15,113
get all this tornado stuff
behind me so I can enjoy...

214
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,118
The fabulous party
you're planning for me!

215
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,532
Yeah! You gotta get outta here!

216
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,061
- Okay. Hey, listen. Hey, Cam?
- Yeah?

217
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:23,602
You just call your family,
tell them I said "hi."

218
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,867
And don't worry about being
back at 6:00 on the dot.

219
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:26,982
There's a little breathing room.

220
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,656
Oh, what, are you kidding me?

221
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,104
- Mnh-mnh.
- The sooner I can start to party,

222
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:31,712
the sooner I can start to forget.

223
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:32,804
But then again,

224
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,779
hey, if you keep running from
every reminder of the tornado,

225
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,220
doesn't the tornado win?

226
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,299
Mitchell, my grandpa runs to
his pickup truck every morning

227
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,523
because he thinks the pitchfork
is gonna come back down.

228
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:43,537
The tornado always wins.

229
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,697
Okay, well, it's gonna
be so much fun tonight!

230
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,659
I know! The big 1-0!

231
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,792
4-0!

232
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,014
Hey, Mitchell!

233
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:54,031
- I'm over here! But you didn't!
- I could've hit you!

234
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,282
I'm doing my "I love ya" dance.

235
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,335
Okay, I'm doing
my "I love you" car dance.

236
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,602
Look at you!

237
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:01,363
- I do the best moves!
- Stop that! Okay! Go!

238
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:02,197
I got-- this is dangerous.

239
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,028
Okay, okay. Go.

240
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:03,887
Get out of here, you. Out!

241
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,461
It's my birthday!

242
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,813
All right, guys, come here.
We need to talk.

243
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,561
- There they are.
- Stop rushing us!

244
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,356
Buddy, what's wrong?

245
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,148
Yes, you've been
a little off all morning.

246
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,433
I've been feeling
a lot of stress lately.

247
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,834
My head's all foggy, and
I'm kind of emotional.

248
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:26,953
Oh. Well, I sure hope
you feel better soon

249
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,728
'cause you really need your wits
about you when you're trapezing.

250
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:32,738
This is weird because the three of us

251
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,347
haven't exactly been feeling
our best today either.

252
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,111
- Really?
- Mm.

253
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,630
I can't find my other sock!

254
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,373
Try looking under
the one you have one.

255
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:42,075
I am not you. I don't do that. See?

256
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,602
Oh, God, I am you.

257
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:48,179
Would you mind if
we sat out trapezing?

258
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,838
- Really?
- Yeah.

259
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,162
Are you sure? Okay.

260
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:51,803
Why does he do that?

261
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:52,938
Every month.

262
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,043
Yeah, I get a little moody,

263
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,708
but unrelenting physical discomfort

264
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,255
will do that to a person.

265
00:09:58,738 --> 00:09:59,717
Doesn't he know

266
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,007
that tiptoeing around
someone like they're crazy

267
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,270
makes them crazy?

268
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:04,760
All right, you and Manny go ahead.

269
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,943
- Luke can just stay here with us.
- Wait. What?

270
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,540
Luke's actually looking better.

271
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,720
- I am better.
- Well, let's not take any chances.

272
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:13,193
- He can stay here. You go ahead.
- Dad?

273
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:14,918
- Um, I...
- Daddy?

274
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,297
See you later, buddy.

275
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:18,019
What are we going to do?

276
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,702
We leave no man behind.

277
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,266
I think I'm just gonna go home.

278
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,095
We have time.

279
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:26,549
Just take down the decorations
and have a normal party.

280
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,073
Yeah, and throw a boring
party in our house

281
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,086
that looks like I just threw
it together this afternoon?

282
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,938
- Think!
- Okay, we have a few options.

283
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,789
I can get you
the back room at Amelia's.

284
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,086
Spilled juice on the owner's white rug

285
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:36,664
and almost killed her toddler. Next.

286
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:37,361
Bowling alley?

287
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,946
Not classy enough.
What have you got?

288
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,356
- Uh...
- You're no help. You.

289
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,573
Well, last weekend,
I did a party on a boat.

290
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,366
You said you were visiting your parents.

291
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:45,239
Shh! You're suffocating me.

292
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,755
What's this boat? Tell me about the boat.

293
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:49,277
Okay, we did an elegant dinner
party on a luxury yacht

294
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,263
for about 25 people.

295
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,961
It takes you around the harbor,
dancing under the moonlight.

296
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:55,881
Okay, okay. Uh, maybe we can--
we can make a theme out of this.

297
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:57,884
You know, Cam's life
is like a long voyage.

298
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:00,880
Sometimes choppy but--but
always forward, ever forward.

299
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:02,430
- We have two hours.
- Book it.

300
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,169
Hey, you survived trapeze class, huh?

301
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,038
Didn't happen,

302
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,464
and common decency prevents
me from telling you why.

303
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,228
How was the soccer match?

304
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:14,044
Thrilling. 1-1 tie.

305
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,792
One of the goals was an accident.

306
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,145
I'm sure my mom was happy you went.

307
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,760
I don't know
what to make of her today.

308
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,011
She got into it with this guy,

309
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,455
and I swear she was pushing
me into a fight with him.

310
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,237
Now is that something she'd want?

311
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:25,226
I don't know.

312
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,832
I always thought of women
as the more evolved sex.

313
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,087
But after today... I've seen things, Jay.

314
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,949
'Cause, you know, I had
my share of fights in my time.

315
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,931
You know that.

316
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,739
Mmm! Mm. Mm. It's too warm for me.

317
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:39,155
Yeah, I remember this time I was
crossing the street with Dede,

318
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,372
and some jackass almost clipped her.

319
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,743
I had the guy on the ground,
my foot on his neck,

320
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,321
before the car stopped moving.

321
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,178
Yeah, we've heard all those stories.

322
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,445
Maybe my mom wouldn't mind
a glimpse of that Jay.

323
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:51,623
That's her.

324
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,437
She wants me to help
pick out Cam's gift.

325
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:55,707
I'm still that guy, you know. 100%.

326
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,185
What the hell?
How do you cut your finger on a cracker?

327
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,955
Anyway, if I thought there
was a fight worth fighting,

328
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:00,993
I'd fight it.

329
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:03,770
Ow! Now I got salt in this.
That stings!

330
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:10,980
Next time, don't scream at your boss

331
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,972
so that he doesn't make you
work during the weekends.

332
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:15,769
And you can come to see your son!

333
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:17,013
Si. Adios.

334
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,833
Hey, mom. Who were you yelling at?

335
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,672
Your father, baby.

336
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,835
He cannot make it this weekend.

337
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,419
Okay, I admit it.

338
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,388
I wanted Jay to kick that little
Dutch man's ass at the bar.

339
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:34,854
But two seconds
on the phone with Javier,

340
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,905
and I remember what that stupid
hothead behavior gets you-

341
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,151
Nothing.

342
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,548
It's better to be calm like Jay.

343
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,294
Like Jay and me.

344
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:46,621
Like Jay.

345
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:50,052
I'm back!

346
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:53,279
Wouldn't you know, I forgot
my ding-dang sunglasses.

347
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,885
Luke, could you give me a hand?

348
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:59,994
What were the chances that Phil
had come back to apologize

349
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,376
for all the game playing

350
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:03,347
and have an open conversation with me

351
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:04,869
about what I was feeling?

352
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,982
Okay, I got a bottle of fake blood
out of the Halloween supplies.

353
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,304
Put a dab on your finger,
say you cut it.

354
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:12,814
I say I need to run you by the doctor.
Easy trapezy.

355
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:13,518
Got it?

356
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,151
See ya on the other side, brother.

357
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:19,679
Just once, I would like Phil
to have a little empathy,

358
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,715
give me some sense
that he understands

359
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,103
what women go through.

360
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,172
- You feeling any better?
- Mnh-mnh.

361
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:28,536
Hate to see the whole team on the D.L.

362
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:29,785
Ow! My finger!

363
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:32,143
I don't like the sound of that.

364
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,814
I said a little bit!

365
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,044
The cap fell off.
I decided to just go with it.

366
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:40,586
Okay, we gotta get you out the back.

367
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,152
- God, what happened?!
- Oh, it's just a little cut.

368
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,806
But to be safe,
I'll run him by the doctor.

369
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,156
No, are you crazy?! Call 9-1-1!

370
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:49,423
No, no, they're so busy.

371
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,404
Where's the wound?!
We need to put pressure on it, right?

372
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:52,630
- I'm gonna be sick!
- My--my finger.

373
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,592
Oh, he needs a tourniquet!
Where do I put it?!

374
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:57,090
- On my finger. - Stop!
There is nothing wrong with h..

375
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:59,337
- Luke, what's going on?
- I cut my finger?

376
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,886
- Dad?
- How crazy is that?

377
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:03,726
They were in my pocket the whole time.
I'll see you.

378
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:04,727
Phil!

379
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:06,654
What is going on, Luke?

380
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,812
Dad staged the whole thing

381
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,058
so we could go on the
trapeze without you three.

382
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:11,130
Why?

383
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,323
Because...

384
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,839
B-because...

385
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:16,952
Because of this! You're all monster-ating!

386
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:19,548
- Luke, no! - Are you kidding me?!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my lord.

387
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:21,890
Sorry! I know you told me
not to say it, but I...

388
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:23,132
Phil!

389
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,894
Is this what you've
been teaching our son?

390
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:27,247
That--that women are some
kind of unclean lepers

391
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,823
that should be hidden away
under sheets for a week?

392
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,588
Do you have any idea
how offensive that is?

393
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,002
I do, honey.

394
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,980
And from the bottom of my heart,

395
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,414
I am so...

396
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:38,635
S-s-scared.

397
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,441
- Ugh!
- Oh, no!

398
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,013
Oh, my.

399
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:49,555
Okay.

400
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:51,915
3, 2, 1!

401
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,525
Surprise!

402
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,519
Oh, my gosh! Oh, it's amazing!

403
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,276
- Yeah, it's a boat party.
- Oh! Because?

404
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,672
Your life is like a voyage.

405
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,849
Oh! Well, everyone's is, but I love it

406
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,997
because none of our other
friends have ever done it.

407
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:05,935
Aw. That's so sweet.

408
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:09,902
Oh, it must be easy with no dirty,
broken woman in the relationship.

409
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:13,444
What are you laughing at?

410
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,343
Okay, everybody follow the birthday flag!

411
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:18,275
What'd you call me?
Oh. Uh, oh, yes.

412
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:21,144
Oh, my gosh. It's so elegant.
I'll bet Pepper is dying.

413
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,798
Oh, you know, actually,
Pepper couldn't come

414
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,184
because he hates boats.
You know, after the Navy.

415
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,401
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

416
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:29,439
I guess longinus got over
his fear of--of water?

417
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,982
Mnh. No, no.

418
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,728
Why don't we just focus on
the 30 people who are here,

419
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,428
having a great time!

420
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,509
Ew! It smells like somebody's dead.

421
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,122
Ugh! What is that smell?

422
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:41,055
That faint odor is-- is
a tiny, tiny blue whale

423
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,736
who apparently has indeed died, uh, nearby.

424
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:44,708
But...

425
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,136
Si, but it's getting all over my coat.

426
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,465
I don't smell anything.

427
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:51,363
Maybe that's because you smell
like a bouquet of flowers.

428
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,796
Oh, yeah. Watch out for that.

429
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:56,376
Ugh! It smells like puke married poop

430
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:58,546
and had the ceremony in my nose.

431
00:15:58,547 --> 00:15:59,871
You paint with words.

432
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,289
Okay, don't worry, everybody.

433
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,361
Soon we'll be way, way out
at sea, bouncing on the waves

434
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:07,053
with all of his sweet-smelling
brothers and sisters. Okay?

435
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,343
- Mitchell Pritchett?
- Oh, yes. Hi.

436
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,377
Hi. I'm your captain tonight.
We've got a problem.

437
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,907
I can't fit this many people on my boat.

438
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,725
No, no. I was--I was
told you could take 30.

439
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:14,962
I have exactly 30 guests.

440
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:17,089
Plus six in help.
You gotta drop a few people.

441
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,781
Come on. There--there must be
something that we can do here.

442
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:20,899
Well, we have bigger boats,

443
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,023
but this is the best I could
do on two hours' notice.

444
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,165
- Please, um...
- What is the problem?

445
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:28,005
Apparently, Mitchell started planning
my birthday party two hours ago.

446
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:30,131
Mnh-mnh. No. No, I-I did not.

447
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,918
Uh, apparently, we have too
many people for his boat.

448
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,532
So... that's crazy.

449
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,477
I've seen more people
clinging to a floating door.

450
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:39,117
I'm sorry, lady. It's a safety issue.

451
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:41,214
Oh, no. You're going
to have a safety issue

452
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,640
if you don't take me away
from this whale.

453
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,520
Okay, little too much finger,
little too much attitude.

454
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:46,321
What's all this?

455
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:48,980
Uh, two hours of Mitchell's
hard work going down the drain.

456
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:52,219
Look, I can't fit more than
30 people on the boat,

457
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,844
as I was just explaining to the lady here.

458
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,812
Well, first of all,
that "lady" is my son.

459
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,377
He wasn't talking about me.

460
00:16:57,378 --> 00:16:58,694
I was talking about her.

461
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:00,441
Oh. Her. Oh, it's "her" now.

462
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,583
Well, "her" happens to be my wife.

463
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:05,110
You got a problem with her,
you got a problem with me.

464
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,563
- No, no, Jay...
- You know...

465
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,252
- Calm down.
- I didn't have a problem before,

466
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,132
but now I'm starting to.

467
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,396
No, your problem's about
to get a lot bigger.

468
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,978
No, Jay, I know you think this
is what I want, but it's not.

469
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,701
- I've got this, Gloria.
- No, Jay.

470
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,901
I was just being stupid today.
I like that you're calm,

471
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:21,569
that you think first, and you act second.

472
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,466
I need that in my life.

473
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:25,052
Yeah, so walk away, grandpa.

474
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:25,864
You know what?

475
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:28,581
Nobody call him "grandpa"!

476
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,771
I do.

477
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,559
Okay, that's it!

478
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:34,568
No boat! Everybody off my dock,
or I'm calling the cops!

479
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:35,944
Wait, w-wait. So no party now?

480
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,717
No! No, of course! Just...

481
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,197
Just... just give me a minute okay?

482
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:40,439
Oh, we, after what
you did with two hours,

483
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,272
- I can't wait to see what
you do with a minute. - Cam!

484
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,258
Poor Cam. He seems so upset.

485
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:47,536
Oh, is that hard for you, Phil,

486
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,106
that he's have a feeling around you?

487
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:50,793
- I'm so sorry.
- Too many emotions?

488
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,099
Okay, okay, I give up!

489
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:56,412
- Yeah, I made a mistake today.
- Mm.

490
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:58,398
But only because the three
of you ganged up on me

491
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,594
like when the wolfman,
Dracula, and frankenstein

492
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:02,275
show up in the same movie,

493
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:03,849
except this wasn't awesome!

494
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,440
I have been on an emotional
roller coaster all day today.

495
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,957
I'm afraid. I'm mad.
I'm mad because I'm afraid,

496
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,803
and now I can't even think straight

497
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:13,268
because I'm in so much pain from
what just happened over there!

498
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,810
And the whole thing makes me so
sad, and I'm not even sure why,

499
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,530
and I'm nauseous from that
smell but I'm so hungry.

500
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:23,356
Yeah.

501
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,881
Cam, the--the boat wasn't
even part of the plan.

502
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:28,771
No, it's fine.

503
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:31,471
It's my fault for letting my
expectations get too high.

504
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,094
- I'll get over this one, too.
- No, no.

505
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,628
I had this whole "Wizard of Oz"
party planned,

506
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:37,579
only today I realized that it might be

507
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,507
a-a little too tornado-y.

508
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,448
- Today?
- Yes!

509
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,542
I'm sorry I-I didn't make
the connection, okay?

510
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,612
Probably 'cause I've been
planning for months

511
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:46,913
so that you could have
the perfect party and be happy,

512
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:49,084
which now I don't
even think is possible.

513
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:50,675
Oh, I'm sorry that I would like to have

514
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,786
a nice 10th birthday party.

515
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:54,265
Well, you can't have it, Cam!

516
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,640
You wanna know why?!
Because you're 40!

517
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,306
You're a 40-year-old man!

518
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,465
I am 40.

519
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,069
- I'm 40.
- Yes.

520
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:12,307
Oh, Cam, stop it.

521
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,884
I'm 40 and I'm--I'm on this
stupid--wait, what is that?!

522
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:17,128
Oh, it's this...

523
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:18,581
Thing!

524
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,478
Suddenly, it all made sense.

525
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:23,455
Cam's craziness all day
wasn't about a party.

526
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,226
It was about turning 40.

527
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,988
And once he realized that,
everything got much worse.

528
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,872
- I've done nothing with my life!
- Oh, w--stop it.

529
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,528
Come on. How--how can you say that?

530
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:36,397
You're--you're a wonderful father. You...

531
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,645
You--you graduated from clown college.

532
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,527
You've been to France.

533
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,564
I don't want to be 40. It's not fair!

534
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:44,871
- I know.
- Nothing's fair.

535
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,276
2 Miles from here is an amusement park

536
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:49,894
full of happy families
swinging on a trapeze.

537
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,379
That's all I wanted for
my special bonus day.

538
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,324
What?

539
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,621
I'd been trying so hard

540
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,766
to figure out what Cam
wanted for his birthday.

541
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,790
He'd been telling me all along.

542
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:07,006
He wanted to be 10.

543
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,836
Seriously? There's nothing you can do?

544
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:21,979
I'm sorry. You just missed the cutoff.

545
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,266
How about we see you next time?

546
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:27,233
How about you make an exception
and strap him in there?

547
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,549
Yeah, we're, like, ten minutes
past your deadline, anyway.

548
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,323
And you don't want
to make us angry today.

549
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:33,246
- Ladies, uh, I really can't
make any exceptions. - "Ladies"?

550
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:38,077
- Seriously, Pete?
- No, I don't think "ladies"...

551
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:41,544
And that was
how they apologized to me.

552
00:20:41,552 --> 00:20:43,794
- Whoo!
- Come on, Phil!

553
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,650
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ohh!
Oh, God, Phil!

554
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,135
Aah! You did it!

555
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:52,151
At least, I-I think it was.
I could never ask them.

556
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:58,476
This is so satisfying!

557
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,173
Best I've felt all day!

558
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:05,348
Can I rent one of these on a monthly basis?

559
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,619
Ohh, ha ha! Yes!

560
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,402
Oh, yay!

561
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,353
Best 40th birthday party ever.

562
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,706
No, no. 10th.

563
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:17,408
- Really?
- Yeah.

564
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,329
In fact, you're still that
sexy little 8 year old

565
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,713
I fell in love with.

566
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,787
Oh, um... no, just go.

567
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
