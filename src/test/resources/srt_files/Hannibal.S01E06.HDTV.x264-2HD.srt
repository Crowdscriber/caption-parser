1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,436
- I thought it might be
the chesapeake ripper, but there

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:07,006
Were no surgical trophies taken.
I'm gonna need you to prepare

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,341
Yourself on this one.
- I'm prepared.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,044
- Yeah, prepare yourself some
more. It's soup in there.
- Jack gave you his word

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,414
He would protect your headspace,
yet he leaves you to your
mental devices.

6
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,017
- Are you trying to alienate me
from jack crawford?

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,220
- It's difficult to lie still
and fear going to sleep when
it's there to think about.

8
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:24,289
(siren)
- do you have a history
of sleepwalking, mr. Graham?

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,792
- My wife and I need to talk.
May we use your waiting room?

10
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,461
- Lung cancer.
- When were you gonna tell me?

11
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,264
- Do I seem different?
- But you've always been
a little different.

12
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,433
- It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

13
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,502
- I'm not gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

14
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,138
- I don't know how much longer
I can be all that useful
to you, jack.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,273
- Really? The last three we had,
you caught.

16
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,375
- You can't arrest me
for writing an article.

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,412
- You don't write another word
about will graham and
I won't have to.

18
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,660
- This is your final opportunity
to comply.

19
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,797
On your feet, dr. Gideon,
or we will restrain you.

20
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:12,104
(door buzzer)

21
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:15,107
Alright, lace your fingers
behind your head!

22
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,519
Get a gurney!

23
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,319
(monitor beeping)

24
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,297
(flatline tone)

25
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,714
- Well, thanks
to freddie lounds,

26
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,716
There's an unconfirmed story
floating out there

27
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,718
That the chesapeake ripper's
already in custody.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
- Unconfirmed.
Am I confirming?

29
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,855
Fact-checking
for freddie lounds...

30
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,191
- You're fact-checking
for me.

31
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,326
- I always feel a little nervous
going into these places.

32
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,828
- Why's that?

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,830
- Afraid they won't let me out.
- Don't worry.

34
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,832
I won't leave you here.
- Yeah, not today.

35
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,835
- Dr. Bloom just called me
about you,

36
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,771
Mr. Graham--or should I call you
dr. Graham?

37
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,840
- I'm not a doctor.
- You're not fbi either.

38
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,842
That's a temporary
identification.

39
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,844
- Mr. Graham teaches
at the academy.

40
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,181
- Ah, a teacher. Please,
gentlemen, take a seat.

41
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,649
- Thank you.

42
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,787
Dr. Chilton, we're going
to need to see

43
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,924
The crime scene while it's
still relatively undisturbed.

44
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,927
- I assure you, for something
so disturbing, it is quite
undisturbed.

45
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,896
- Why was a nurse left alone
with a prisoner

46
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,566
In a high-security
psychiatric hospital?

47
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,834
- For the two years
since he was brought here,

48
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,570
Gideon behaved perfectly

49
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:25,971
And gave every appearance

50
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,607
Of cooperating with attempts
at therapy. As dictated

51
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:33,345
By our present administrator,
security around him was
slightly... Relaxed.

52
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,847
I cannot help
feeling responsible

53
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,551
Myself for what happened.
He sat directly across from me

54
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,687
And I had no idea
what he was hiding.

55
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,923
And now one
of our staff is dead.
- I understand, doctor.

56
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,326
Mr. Graham's going to need
to see the crime scene

57
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,461
With as much privacy
as you can provide.

58
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,563
- Oh, yes, that thing you do.

59
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,934
You're quite the topic
of conversation in, uh,
psychiatric circles, mr. Graham.

60
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,537
- Am I?

61
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,006
- Uh, yes.
A unique cocktail

62
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:05,611
Of personality disorders
and neuroses that make you
a highly skilled profiler.

63
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,680
- He's not here to be analyzed.
- Perhaps he should be.

64
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,016
We are woefully short
of material

65
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,452
On your sort of thing,
mr. Graham.

66
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,454
Would you mind speaking
to some of the staff?

67
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,457
- Doctor.
- No, no, no. Not this trip.

68
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,859
Maybe a special visit.
- Thank you, dr. Chilton.

69
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,562
I'd like to see
the crime scene now.

70
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,597
- So, gideon was restrained?

71
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,599
- Handcuffed.
- Hm.

72
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,735
- He concealed a fork tine
in the palm of his hand

73
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,337
And used it to pick the lock.
- Where is he now?

74
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,407
- In his cell.
You'll note

75
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,843
The removal of organs
and the abdominal mutilations

76
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,012
Are all consistent
with the chesapeake ripper.

77
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,447
- So is the brutalization
of the corpses, but that doesn't

78
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,650
Change the fact that
the ripper is still out there.

79
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,952
- Jack, what I'm about
to show you

80
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,321
Suggests otherwise.
(door buzzer)

81
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,627
- Dr. Chilton consulted
on the case when we failed

82
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,563
To catch the ripper after
his last series of murders.

83
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,047
- The reason you failed

84
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,816
And kept failing to capture
the chesapeake ripper...

85
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,552
Was I already had him.

86
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,517
(monitor beeping)

87
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,835
(flatline tone)

88
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,557
(nurse crying out)

89
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,659
- Um...

90
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:21,600
It's been over two years since
the chesapeake ripper killed?

91
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,669
- That's correct.

92
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,974
- When was gideon admitted?

93
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,042
- Almost two years ago.

94
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,150
<i>Lass, miriam regina.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

95
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,853
- Morning, agent crawford.

96
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,589
- Sorry to pull you out
of class. There's nothing wrong.

97
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,725
Uh, no reason
to be nervous.

98
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,027
- I'm not nervous.
Curious.

99
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,862
- Your instructors tell me

100
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,865
That you are in the top 10%?
- Top five, sir.

101
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,868
- You're gonna have
to stop correcting me
if we're gonna get along, lass.

102
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,770
Take a seat.

103
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,772
You wrote me

104
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,275
A letter when you qualified
for the academy.

105
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,711
- I wasn't sure you got it.
You never replied.

106
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,015
- Never do. Odds are against any
trainee completing the program.

107
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:13,652
But I'm glad to see
you're still here.

108
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,154
In your letter, you said
you wanted to work for me

109
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,156
In the violent criminal
apprehension program.

110
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,991
- Yes, sir.
- There might be an opportunity.

111
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,093
I'm assuming
that you're familiar

112
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,329
With the chesapeake ripper.
- Yes.

113
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:28,099
- The ripper's very hot
right now. Killed his last two
victims in six days. There'll be

114
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,201
At least one more body
and then nothing for months.

115
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,938
- They say
he's a true sociopath.

116
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,673
- What do you say?

117
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,909
- I say they don't know
what else to label him.

118
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,911
He has some
of the characteristics

119
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,915
Of what they call a sociopath--
no remorse or guilt at all.

120
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,917
He won't have any
of the other marks.

121
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,319
He won't be a drifter.

122
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,754
He'll have no history
of trouble with the law.

123
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,756
He'll be hard to catch.

124
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,593
- I'm assigning you to the
chesapeake ripper task force.

125
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,661
You're gonna work
directly under me.

126
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,799
- I'm grateful for
the opportunity, agent crawford.

127
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,069
But I can't help
wondering... Why me?

128
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,805
- You have
a forensics fellowship,

129
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,807
Six years of law enforcement,

130
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,744
A degree in psychology,
doctorate in criminology.

131
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:16,948
And what I don't have are
enough warm bodies.

132
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,285
So, I'm gonna need
your full attention on this.

133
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,954
- (miriam): <i>Yes, sir.</i>

134
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,926
- The volume of abel gideon's
mail is becoming a nuisance.

135
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,930
Sometimes I feel
like his secretary
rather than his keeper.

136
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,367
- Any specific correspondences
that stood out from the others?

137
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,236
- Mostly researchers
or phd candidates

138
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,706
Requesting interviews.
A scattered dozen lonely hearts

139
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,010
Seeking his hand in marriage.
- He butchered

140
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,079
His last wife and her family
on thanksgiving.

141
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,116
- There's no accounting
for taste--or intelligence.

142
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:55,120
- Murdering his wife was
impulsive. The chesapeake ripper

143
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,922
Is methodical, meticulous.

144
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,958
That's why he's so hard
to catch.

145
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,427
- Was so hard to catch.

146
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,831
Will you be conducting
a joint interview?

147
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,401
- Separate.
Compare and contrast.

148
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,302
- I know you're anxious
to get on with it.

149
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,205
You have talked to gideon
before, for some length of time.

150
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,875
- Well, I saw him mainly
in court. I wrote an article

151
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,177
About him in the <i>journal</i>
<i>of criminal psychology.</i>

152
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,913
- He is very familiar
with you.

153
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,382
He has given you
a lot of thought.

154
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,985
- You had some sessions
with him?

155
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:30,755
- Yes, two, a couple years
ago when he was first
institutionalized.

156
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,292
- I've read your notes,
of course. They were
more or less helpful

157
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,962
As I conducted my own interviews
with dr. Gideon over the years.

158
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:42,167
- Well, I'm glad I was helpful.
- (will): More or less.

159
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,271
- I'll go first.

160
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,339
(door buzzer)

161
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,732
- Why, dr. Bloom.

162
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,734
How wonderful to see you again.

163
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,436
- You remembered.
- I've met a lot

164
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,939
Of psychiatrists in the last
two years. It's hard to forget

165
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,041
One so sublime.

166
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,877
- Thank you for your time,
dr. Gideon. I won't waste it.

167
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,879
Shall we begin?

168
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,148
- Dr. Bloom,
what is this to be?

169
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,951
I was caught red-handed.
I mean, literally.

170
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,955
There's no mystery
as to whodunit. I did it.

171
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:41,059
- The mystery is whether you are
who you say you are.

172
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,461
Or not.
- Never liked being called

173
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,530
The chesapeake ripper.

174
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:49,234
Maybe something
with a little more wit.

175
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,937
- Is that why you didn't take
credit for the ripper murders
before now?

176
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,941
- Just watching the goose chase
from the box seats.

177
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,210
- Two years of goose chasing.

178
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,313
You must be a very patient man.
- Are you just gonna run

179
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,483
The psychopathic checklist here?
I have had my personality

180
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,520
Inventoried by the minnesota
multiphasic.

181
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,955
- Would you prefer
a rorschach test?

182
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,091
- Well, if you're gonna
show me those pictures,

183
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,961
Maybe you should put a blood
pressure cuff to my genitals.

184
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:21,032
I find it gives
a much truer gauge of reaction.

185
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,836
- What effect were you hoping
to have by killing

186
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,504
The night nurse?

187
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:32,110
- The effect I was hoping
to have was her death.

188
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,312
Mission accomplished.

189
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,816
- Brutalization of the body was
done posthumously.

190
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,918
- Chesapeake ripper usually

191
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Does that sort of thing during,

192
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,922
Not after.

193
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:50,061
- I do not have to convince you
that I am the chesapeake ripper.

194
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,833
- Seems that's what you need
to do.

195
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,271
- Certainly what somebody needs.

196
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,551
- Jack.

197
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,420
Come in.

198
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,563
- I'm sorry. Um...

199
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,634
I was just, uh...

200
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,636
- In the neighborhood.

201
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,038
- Yeah, something
like that.

202
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,245
- How's mrs. Crawford?

203
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,547
- Yeah, that's why I was
in the neighborhood.

204
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,217
She's fine.

205
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,353
Well, she tells me
that she's fine

206
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,956
And she tells me
when she's not.

207
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,292
- You expect me
to tell you more?

208
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:57,495
- Look, bella's
at a nato conference.

209
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,465
I can't talk to her.
She's working.

210
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,035
I doubt I could talk
to her if she was here.
- About her condition?

211
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,037
- Yeah. About her cancer,
about her dying.

212
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,106
She doesn't want to talk
to me about it.

213
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,177
- I am prohibited from talking
about it--doctor-patient
confidentiality.

214
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,247
- You talk to me
about will graham.

215
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,984
- Will graham is not
officially my patient.
We have conversations.

216
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,121
- What do you
consider this?

217
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:23,488
- Desperate coping.

218
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,664
- You don't think I have a right
to know what's happening
with my wife?

219
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,401
- You have every right to know
what's happening,
but not from me.

220
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:40,672
- Well, I'm not just gonna
stand outside my marriage
and watch this happen.

221
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,640
If that's what she wants,
too bad.

222
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,275
She married the wrong guy
for that.

223
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,946
- I'll offer one insight.

224
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,048
She doesn't think
she married the wrong guy.

225
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,089
- I can't stop thinking about
when my wife is gonna die.

226
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,025
I look at her side of the bed
and I think,

227
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,094
"is she gonna die there?"

228
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,099
I can't stop thinking about it,
you understand? I can't stop.

229
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,537
- You're dreading the loss
of your wife.

230
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,140
- Yes.

231
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,615
And I'm thinking
about other losses too.

232
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,188
- What other losses are
you dreading?

233
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,260
Jack, you can't save her.

234
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,262
She won't let you.

235
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,331
The cancer won't let you.

236
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,770
Who else couldn't
you save?

237
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,573
- (miriam): <i>Where is everyone?</i>

238
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,009
- <i>It's just you and me</i>
<i>for the time being.</i>

239
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,278
Take a look around here.
Tell me what you see.

240
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,365
- He did it all here.

241
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,335
Did it while he was alive.
He struck the throat

242
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,337
So he couldn't call for help.
- Do you think

243
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,240
He was unconscious
when the ripper did the ripping?

244
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,308
- No, he'd want him awake.

245
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,113
Organs were removed.

246
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,450
Not all of them. He was choosy.
He took the liver, thymus,

247
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,519
But left the heart.

248
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,124
- What's he doing
with the organs?

249
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,460
- Surgical trophies.

250
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,730
He's a medical doctor, isn't he?
Is that why you call him
the ripper?

251
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,566
- Why do you say that?

252
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,171
- Psychopaths are attracted
to surgical fields.

253
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:56,541
They offer power.
They require the ability

254
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,544
To make objective clinical
decisions without feeling.

255
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,546
- White male?

256
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,148
Forties? Fifties?

257
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,418
- I don't know
that he's white.

258
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,720
He's exotic somehow,

259
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,323
Which is why
you're gonna catch him.

260
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,426
- I'm gonna catch him?

261
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,563
- We call you the guru.

262
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,199
You have a peculiar
cleverness.

263
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,502
- I'll take that
as a compliment.

264
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,637
- You should.

265
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,807
You'll probably spot him
before anybody else.

266
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,310
- Or you will.

267
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,717
Now I want you
to take a look at this.

268
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,624
- There's no
detectable consistency
with the ripper victims.

269
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,893
He doesn't hunt exclusively
within his own ethnic group.

270
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,496
He's killed all creeds,
colors, men and women.

271
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,899
- She has the exact same
wound pattern as the last-known
victim of the chesapeake ripper.

272
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:59,504
I mean exact.
- We never found a body
for his last-known victim.

273
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:03,174
- Then the victim before that.

274
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:06,277
- I see the ripper,
but I don't...

275
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,279
Feel the ripper.

276
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,648
This is plagiarism.
- We never made

277
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,918
The wound patterns for any
of the ripper's victims public.

278
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,487
- Well, maybe he is the ripper.
I don't know.

279
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,524
But if he's a plagiarist,
the real chesapeake ripper is

280
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,660
Gonna make sure
everybody knows it.

281
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,897
(jack sighs.)

282
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,466
(phone ringing)

283
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,414
- Hello.

284
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,816
- [jack. Jack.]

285
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,418
- Who is this?

286
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,687
- [jack, it's miriam.]

287
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,758
[I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.]
- miriam?

288
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,694
- [I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.]

289
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,598
- Miriam?
- [please... Jack. Please.]

290
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,667
(signal cuts out.)

291
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,211
- I'm hooked in
to every carrier database

292
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,580
And telephone provider
in the United States.

293
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,782
Nothing.
- Look again.

294
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,451
- I did my agains.
And my again and again

295
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,653
And agains. I can't find
any electronic trace

296
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,590
Of any call made to your home
at 2:46am.

297
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,758
- I am telling you
that the phone rang.

298
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,795
- Wake your wife up?
- I was alone.

299
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,864
- Whoever made that call could
have made it from that little
box outside your house

300
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,267
Or a junction
in your neighborhood.

301
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,369
Either way, there would be
no trace signal

302
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,372
To track.
- You're sure
it was miriam lass?

303
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,308
- It was miriam.
- You haven't heard
her voice in two years, jack.

304
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,911
- You gonna continue
to question me on this, z?

305
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,848
If so, maybe I should ask you
to leave the room while it's
still safe for you to be here.

306
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:57,855
The chesapeake ripper recorded
miriam lass two years ago
as he was killing her.

307
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:03,594
Last night, he called my house
at 2:46am. He played
that recording for me.

308
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,631
- Well, then we know
the chesapeake ripper is
not dr. Gideon, because

309
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,766
We know the call wasn't made
from the baltimore

310
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,036
State hospital
for the criminally insane.
- That we would've been able

311
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,440
To trace.
- Are you certain
it was a recording?

312
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:22,480
Jack, you said
yourself there's no body.
- Miriam lass is dead!

313
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:27,285
The chesapeake ripper is making
it very clear that someone is
plagiarizing his work!

314
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,887
- It was 2:46 in the morning,
jack. You're in a deep sleep,
you're roused, you're

315
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,923
Disoriented. You might not even
know you're still asleep.

316
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,495
- I know when I'm awake.

317
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,935
(sigh)

318
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,721
(stag bellowing)

319
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,628
- Will? You look
like you were dreaming.

320
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,863
- I was, uh, thinking
about something else.

321
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,933
- Well, here's something
for you to think about.

322
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,003
We have a direct way
of communicating

323
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,406
With the chesapeake ripper,
and we'd like to see
if we can push him.

324
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:26,744
- Push him toward what?
- We might be able
to influence him

325
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,480
To become visible.
- If we can enrage him.

326
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,483
- To what purpose, jack?
I-I don't see what
you're asking.

327
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:36,420
- Do you think there's a way
to push the chesapeake ripper
and focus his attention?

328
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:40,624
- Well, he's already focused
on gideon as his adversary.
Don't fool around.

329
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,961
- Gideon is just a tabloid rumor
right now. We think we need
to make him the truth.

330
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:47,365
- You might push the ripper
to kill again just to prove

331
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,600
He isn't in a hospital
for the criminally insane.

332
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,969
- I have to push, will.

333
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,139
- Are you thinking about getting
into bed with freddie lounds?

334
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:59,009
- You yourself know
it's the best way to bait
the real chesapeake ripper.

335
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,648
- Morning, agent crawford.
Thank you for inviting me.

336
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,385
- Miss lounds.

337
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,653
This is dr. Alana bloom.

338
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,989
She's one of our psychiatric
consultants.

339
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,991
I believe you know will graham.

340
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,394
- Mr. Graham.
So good to see you.

341
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,801
- Miss lounds.

342
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:27,171
You have all the qualities
of a good reporter. You have

343
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:30,908
Intelligence, guts,
a good eye.

344
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,677
So how is it that you wind up
where you've ended up?

345
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,747
- Where I wound up being
criminal justice journalism?

346
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,751
- "criminal justice journalism"
being a euphemism for
tabloid reporting.

347
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:47,491
- You ran an unconfirmed story
about the chesapeake ripper.

348
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:51,128
What I want is
for you to confirm it.

349
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,467
- An exclusive story would be
a coup.

350
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,837
- Mm, yes, it would.
And you would get

351
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,773
The satisfaction of seeing
the    <i>los angeles times,</i>

352
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,875
The sanctified
<i>washington post,</i>

353
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,913
Nd even the holy <i>new york times</i>
<i>un copyrighted material</i>

354
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,148
Under your byline,

355
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,219
With a picture credit.
- What's against you,

356
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,221
And by association us,

357
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:20,524
Is that your brand
of journalism is obnoxious

358
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,526
And therefore disliked.

359
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,029
- Yes. That is an obstacle.

360
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:28,599
Tried to get an interview
with dr. Gideon.

361
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,470
I was denied. Evidently some
trouble with my euphemism.

362
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:36,073
- I'm friendly
with the new chief of staff.
I can get you an interview.

363
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,178
- Not to snap bubble gum and
crack wise, but what's my angle?

364
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,514
Is he the chesapeake ripper,

365
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,616
Or do you just want me
to tell everybody that he is?

366
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:50,788
- He could be, and certain
personalities are attracted
to certain professions.

367
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,790
- Do you know what profession

368
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,493
Psychopaths disproportionately
gravitate to?

369
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,062
- Ceos, lawyers, the clergy.

370
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:01,065
- Number five on the list is
surgeons.

371
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:04,935
- I know the list.
- Well, then you know
what number six is.

372
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,204
- Journalists.

373
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,508
Know what number seven is,
mr. Graham?

374
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,113
- Law enforcement.

375
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,249
- Here we are,

376
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:21,519
A bunch of psychopaths
helping each other out.

377
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,126
(door buzzer)

378
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,766
(beeping)
(door buzzer)

379
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,118
Dr. Gideon.
I'm freddie lounds.

380
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,321
May I call you dr. Gideon?

381
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,957
Or do you prefer
the chesapeake ripper?

382
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,594
<i>His name is dr. Abel gideon,</i>

383
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,030
And strong evidence has surfaced
<i>that he's far more</i>

384
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,033
<i>Than a mild-mannered surgeon</i>
<i>who cruelly murdered his wife.</i>

385
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,035
<i>Maybe, just maybe,</i>

386
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:14,204
Gideon is the most sought-after
<i>serial killer at large,</i>

387
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,574
<i>A killer who's eluded the fbi</i>
<i>for years</i>

388
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,577
<i>And has baffled</i>
<i>their most gifted profilers.</i>

389
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,681
<i>That serial killer? None other</i>
<i>than the chesapeake ripper.</i>

390
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,784
<i>This would explain why</i>
<i>the ripper has been silent</i>

391
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,852
<i>For more than two years.</i>

392
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,997
- (gideon): <i>So, are you enjoying</i>
<i>reading my mail?</i>

393
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,967
- No, not particularly.

394
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,169
- Looking for something
instructional?

395
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:48,672
Diagrams? Don't believe
I can recreate

396
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,208
One of my own murders
from memory?

397
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,811
- You wouldn't be recreating
them from your memory, doctor.

398
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,680
You're not
the chesapeake ripper.

399
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,216
- Ooh, have to agree
to disagree.

400
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,252
- Then why
the surgical trophies?

401
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,623
- Agent crawford, there are just
some things you're not allowed

402
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,792
To do in a state-certified
operating room.

403
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,894
- You didn't take any trophies
when you murdered your wife

404
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,932
And her family on thanksgiving.
You didn't put any of them
on display. Why not?

405
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,400
- Crime of passion.

406
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,870
You know how stressful
the holidays can get.

407
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:24,108
Anyway, you didn't come here
to talk about my wife--

408
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,843
Or the little nursey.

409
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,013
- Oh. What am I here
to talk about?

410
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,982
- Your trainee.

411
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:37,087
Miriam... Somebody.

412
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,192
- You're telling me
you killed miriam lass.

413
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,231
- Yes. Didn't mean
to kill her.

414
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,967
Don't get mad at me.

415
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,969
- I'm not mad at you.

416
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,238
I know where you are.
I know how you got here.

417
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,740
I read your file.

418
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,743
I'm curious, why are you being
so forthcoming all of a sudden?

419
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,146
- Well, what have I got
to lose?

420
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:05,849
You know where I am
and you know how I got here.

421
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,888
- Why didn't you put her
on display?

422
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,090
- What makes you think
I didn't?

423
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,793
(cell phone ringing)

424
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,898
- Excuse me.

425
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,368
- The polite thing to do is
to ask them to call back.

426
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,004
(door buzzer)

427
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,773
Unless it's not an option.

428
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,777
- You're home early.

429
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,981
Bella? Something wrong?

430
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:41,385
- [jack, it's miriam.
I don't know where I am.]

431
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,854
[I can't see anything.]

432
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:47,725
[I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.]

433
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,761
[please... Jack. Please.]

434
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,830
(signal cuts out.)

435
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,872
- In my house.

436
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,974
In my bedroom.

437
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,976
Where my wife sleeps.

438
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,045
- I've dusted the phone.

439
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,913
Got a lot of usable prints.

440
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:14,017
Nice detail too. I got
three distinct beauties here.

441
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,953
Yours, your wife's,

442
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:18,122
And presumably
the chesapeake ripper.

443
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:21,225
- I can't imagine the chesapeake
ripper would start
leaving prints

444
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,193
At his crime scenes now.

445
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,963
- The ripper put his head
on your wife's pillow.

446
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,499
- Now somebody's sleeping
in my bed.

447
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,869
- There he is.
Or there she is.

448
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:35,405
Was miriam lass a blonde?
- Yes.

449
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,075
- I pulled her fingerprints
from the vicap database, jack,

450
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,510
And I got a match.

451
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:42,212
- She's dead.
She wasn't here.

452
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:46,784
- Jack. Did miriam lass know
where you live?

453
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:50,220
- If she wanted to know, she was
smart enough to find out.
- She could've told

454
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,023
The chesapeake ripper
before he killed her.

455
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:56,326
Did you know you were
sending her after him?

456
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,196
- I sent her
after information.

457
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:02,466
- Whoever made that call thinks
you were close to miriam lass

458
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:06,103
And feel responsible
for her death.

459
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,339
- Don't you have classes today?

460
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,108
Aren't you still in school?

461
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,211
- Yes, sir. I thought this might
be more important

462
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,914
Than "exclusionary rules
of search and seizure".

463
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,216
- Is that
what you thought?

464
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:22,219
- I left a report here for you
last night.

465
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,288
I don't know if you got it.
- I got it.

466
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,158
- Did you read it?
- Go back to class.

467
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,430
You feeling
frustrated, lass?

468
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:36,066
If so, you should start
forming calluses,

469
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,403
Some thick ones,
'cause frustration's
gonna wear you thin.

470
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,874
- You could have
at least read the report.

471
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:48,245
- I read it.
- Your assessment? Sir.

472
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,114
- My assessment is that
instead of being here

473
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:55,586
You should be in a lecture hall
boning up on "good faith
warrant exceptions".

474
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,428
What you're proposing
in your report breaks

475
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,897
Confidentiality laws.
You know that.

476
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,999
You shouldn't be so dismissive

477
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,968
Of what you're learning here.

478
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,303
- If the chesapeake ripper is
a surgeon,

479
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,039
We should check medical records
for all of the known victims.

480
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,276
I knew we couldn't get a warrant
if we didn't have something
substantial.

481
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,012
- It's one thing for a trainee
to go poking around

482
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,414
In private medical records
without a warrant;

483
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,951
Very different
if the guru did it.

484
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:34,291
- Better for a trainee to ask
for forgiveness than an fbi
agent to ask for permission?

485
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,227
- In my experience.
- Then I hope you forgive me

486
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,196
For skipping class today.

487
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:43,634
<i>- If someone were using</i>
<i>manipulative methods</i>

488
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:47,337
To subvert your sense
of control, you may
not realize it

489
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,339
Until those methods are
pointed out to you.

490
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,276
- Which may be
a manipulative method in itself.

491
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,246
- You were
a model patient.

492
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,548
You behaved yourself
for two years.

493
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,552
- Well, no opportunity
to be naughty.

494
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:06,423
- You could have
been pushed.

495
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,393
- Well, that would be unethical.

496
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,132
- We can help you find out.

497
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,200
But I need your trust
to do that.

498
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,103
- Oh, I trust you, dr. Bloom.

499
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,279
- To the chesapeake ripper.

500
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,281
Dr. Gideon is going

501
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,418
To provide us with a singular
opportunity to analyze

502
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
A pure sociopath.

503
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:40,223
It is so rare
to find one in captivity.

504
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,593
(classical music playing)

505
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,730
Ah. Dinner is served.

506
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,704
- Inspired by auguste escoffier,
we are having long tangyuan

507
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,439
<i>En papillotte,</i>

508
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:58,575
Served with a sauce of duxelles
and oyster mushrooms.

509
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,210
Picked myself.

510
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:03,180
- I don't think
I've ever had tongue before.

511
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,248
- It was a particularly
chatty lamb.

512
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,353
(dr. Chilton laughs.)
- (alana): It smells delicious.

513
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:13,390
- The romans used to kill
flamingos just to eat
their tongues.

514
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:17,060
- Don't give me ideas.
Your tongue is very feisty.

515
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:21,732
And as this evening has already
proven, it's nice to have
an old friend for dinner.

516
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,104
- Mm.

517
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,175
- I see three possibilities.
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,412
- Gideon is
the chesapeake ripper,

519
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:39,616
Or he just thinks he is,
or he knows he isn't.

520
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:44,388
- He is, he knows he is,
so do I.

521
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,157
- Did you discuss the chesapeake
ripper's crimes with dr. Gideon

522
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,359
Before he murdered
the night nurse?

523
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,495
- Mm-hmm. When I began

524
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:54,498
To suspect what he was.

525
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,367
Fearing he might be exposed
may have, uh...

526
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,037
Spurred him into action.

527
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:03,073
- Is it possible
you inadvertently planted

528
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,642
The suggestion in gideon's mind
that he was the ripper?

529
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:09,613
- You're not suggesting
coercive persuasion.

530
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,549
- No, I said
inadvertently.

531
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,486
- Psychic driving is
unethical.

532
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:20,123
- But reasonable
in certain circumstances.

533
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,459
- What circumstances?

534
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:26,329
- It may have been useful trying
to remind gideon he's the
chesapeake ripper.

535
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,666
- Mm-hmm.
- If he repressed
those memories.

536
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,806
But he seems to have come
to that awareness
all by himself.

537
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,108
- Dr. Bloom,

538
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,776
If he has been

539
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,779
Unethically manipulated
somehow,

540
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,382
I need to know.

541
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,384
I would love
your insight.

542
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:49,319
- Dr. Chilton,

543
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,322
Would you care to assist me
with dessert?

544
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,591
- Pleasure.

545
00:34:54,593 --> 00:35:00,397
- I love norton grapes.
Same color inside as outside.

546
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:03,567
Peel it...

547
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,536
And the flesh is also purple.
Not like other grapes

548
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,507
Where flesh is white
and color comes from the skin.

549
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,376
- A grape with nothing to hide.

550
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,849
- Were I in your position,
I would have attempted
psychic driving.

551
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:22,686
Perhaps you already have.

552
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,489
I promise

553
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:29,459
I am much more forgiving
of the unorthodox
than dr. Bloom.

554
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,897
Shall we?

555
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:43,140
(phone ringing)

556
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:52,649
- [jack. Jack, it's miriam.]
<i>- the last call was made</i>

557
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,352
To jack's cell from
a disposable phone traced here--

558
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,521
Or within 100 feet of here.

559
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,523
- What was miriam lass
looking into?

560
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,791
- Medical records.
If the ripper was a surgeon,

561
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,694
She thought he might've
treated one of his victims.

562
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,731
- Have they retraced her steps?
- The ones they could find.

563
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,901
She made a jump somewhere
they couldn't explain.

564
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:13,503
You make those jumps.

565
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,773
- The evidence has to be there.
- Every surgeon that came
into contact with any

566
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:20,377
Of the ripper victims has been
thoroughly vetted or currently
under observation.

567
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,778
- Including dr. Gideon?

568
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,348
- Dr. Gideon wasn't
in my bedroom;

569
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,319
The chesapeake ripper was.
The last call left

570
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,555
Something
the others didn't--

571
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:34,724
A phone number.

572
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,664
(phone ringing inside)

573
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,550
(phone ringing)

574
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,626
- What would be the benefit

575
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,428
Of making you believe
your trainee was alive?

576
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,668
- Hope. The ripper wanted
to cloud my vision with hope.

577
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,405
- It can sometimes be brave
to allow yourself hope.

578
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,010
- Not the false kind.

579
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:04,014
- Don't give up hope
for your wife. Not yet.

580
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:07,284
She's lost hope,
which means you can't.

581
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,755
- I don't have any control
over that.

582
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,491
- Take control.

583
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,636
I'm sorry
about your wife, jack.

584
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,972
I truly am.
I believe the world is

585
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,374
A better place
with her in it.

586
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,779
I am sorry
about your trainee.

587
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,318
- Whatever the ripper was doing,
it worked.

588
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,323
I mean, I thought she was alive.
For a moment, anyway.

589
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,893
I actually let myself believe
something that I knew
was impossible.

590
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,661
- Talk to me about her.

591
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,065
What was her name?

592
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,867
<i>- My name is miriam lass.</i>
<i>I'm with the fbi.</i>

593
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,470
I would show you my credentials,
but I'm actually just a trainee.

594
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:04,474
- Never just a trainee.
An agent in training.

595
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,344
Please. Come in.

596
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,915
- I was hoping to talk to you
about a former patient--

597
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,484
Not necessarily one of yours,
but someone you may have

598
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:17,887
Come into contact with when
you were a practicing physician.

599
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,757
- I haven't practiced medicine
for some time,

600
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:24,427
But fortunately for you, I have
a very good memory. Please.

601
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,498
- His name was jeremy olmstead.

602
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,770
- Perhaps not so good
a memory after all.

603
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:37,774
I don't recall a patient
with that name, but
it sounds familiar.

604
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:42,045
- He was recently found
murdered in his workshop.
We think he may be a victim

605
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,847
Of the chesapeake ripper.

606
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,783
- That's why he sounds familiar.
It was all over the news.

607
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:50,387
- He had two old scars
on his thigh.

608
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:53,022
Pathology checked with the local
hospital. He had fallen

609
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,993
Out of a tree-blind five years
ago while bow hunting--
stuck an arrow

610
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,429
Through his leg.
The doctor of record was

611
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,132
A resident surgeon, but you were
on duty in the er that night.

612
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:07,070
- I was?
- Your name was
on the admissions log.

613
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,506
- Let me think.

614
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,508
You'll have to forgive me.

615
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,577
I saw so many people in the er,
but not so many hunters.

616
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,447
- It's been a long time
since the accident,

617
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:20,850
But I thought you may remember
if anything was fishy
with the arrow wound.

618
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,453
- If it's the gentleman
I'm thinking of,

619
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,055
I vaguely remember
a fellow hunter bringing him in,

620
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,091
But I recall
very little else.

621
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,594
- Figured it was
a long shot.

622
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,434
- I did keep detailed journals
during those days.

623
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:41,704
If you like, I can get them
for you. Maybe you'll find
something helpful.

624
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,940
- That would be great--
if you don't mind.

625
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,210
- Not at all. If you'll wait
here, I'll be right back.

626
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,948
- Thank you.

627
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,892
- She was a very brave
young woman.

628
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,677
