1
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:04,643
Haley, hurry up!

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:06,644
You don't have much time, and
I made chocolate chip pancakes.

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:07,720
Mom, I'm not 12.

4
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:08,975
Dibs on hers.

5
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:10,800
Honey, you excited
about your first day?

6
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,415
You know what? I really am.

7
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,464
There's something
about going to work

8
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:14,814
that makes you feel like you're...

9
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,277
I don't know, worth something.

10
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:17,739
No offense, mom.

11
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:19,723
Listen... I wanna
give you some advice.

12
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,462
Do it fast.She's gonna be late.

13
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,085
Work hard.

14
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:24,572
Keep your eye on the ball.

15
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,407
Stay focused.

16
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,983
Never... Check it out!

17
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,642
Cam in overalls!

18
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,858
Mitchell sent me the same text!

19
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:34,239
Why "Look what you've done"?

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,407
Oh, because Cam is helping me out

21
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:36,545
with that baseball field,

22
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,575
and Mitchell hates it
when he gets all farmed up.

23
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,652
His turn-offs are farm, Fizbo,

24
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:42,952
And, worst of all, Farmbo.

25
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,405
Howdy, life pardner!

26
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:51,161
Well, I gotta go.
Don't wanna be late for my first--

27
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:53,875
Oh, my god! Why didn't
you guys tell me the time?!

28
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,734
So what do you think?
Can we turn this into a baseball field?

29
00:00:58,735 --> 00:00:59,875
Oh, yeah. No problem.

30
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:00,693
You know, back on the farm,

31
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,989
I once turned an acre of corn 
into a snowflake-shaped maze.

32
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,865
It'd still be there if
our neighbor Billy Bob Sheinberg

33
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,293
hadn't seen it from his crop duster

34
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:09,712
and said it looked like a swastika.

35
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,712
So how good's Luke's team anyway?

36
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:13,190
Well, you may have
seen them on youtube

37
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,251
under "Boy stuck in batting helmet"

38
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,646
or "Pitcher beans self."

39
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:20,480
But a few of them went through
puberty early this year, so...

40
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,796
They say it's because
of hormones in our milk.

41
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:25,138
But whatever it is,
they really jacked up.

42
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:27,571
Luke and Manny's team tied
for the final spot in the playoffs,

43
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:29,533
but since nobody was expecting it,

44
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:30,929
all the fields were booked.

45
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,072
The other team wanted
to settle with a coin flip.

46
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,113
We said "Rock paper scissors."
That's when talks broke down.

47
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:39,099
So what do you do 
when you can't find a field?

48
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,640
You build one.

49
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,998
And we got the last laugh,

50
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,586
'cause guess what I found there?

51
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,901
Rocks, paper, and scissors.

52
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,962
- I see home plate up here. 
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,686
I see pitcher's mound in here,

54
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:53,266
And I see little boys' dreams
coming true everywhere.

55
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,929
I found a dead snake!

56
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,252
It's perfect.

57
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,996
Not dead! Not dead!

58
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,852
I'm gonna be mother of the year.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,074

61
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:16,057
And this is our dining room,
where we eat.

62
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,865
And this is our kitchen,
where we also eat.

63
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:19,513
Who are you talking to?

64
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,131
It looks like you lost your tour.

65
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,220
Or your mind.

66
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,408
The baby.

67
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,972
Shorty's girlfriend
Darlene send it to me.

68
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,432
She said it's for prenatal bonding.

69
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:31,034
I love it.
We took a tour of the house.

70
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:32,929
We took a look at all my shoes.

71
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,549
Come on, Jay. 
Say something to the baby.

72
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,701
Darlene's an idiot.

73
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,573
Oh, yeah, beautiful.

74
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,882
Your first words to our baby--

75
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:39,191
"Darlene is an idiot."

76
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,152
This is stupid.
The baby's only 2 inches away.

77
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:43,222
He doesn't need
speakers blasting at him.

78
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,406
Like in restaurants nowadays

79
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:45,929
where you can't
even hear yourself think.

80
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,276
Ah, you're gonna do whatever
you want. Why do I bother?

81
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,185
Get used to that. 
Sometimes you just gotta let him go.

82
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,453
Then he eats some sherbet 
and falls asleep.

83
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,962
Okay, I'll chalk the field 
with this bad boy.

84
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,917
And while you're doing that, 
I will get the bases.

85
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,278
We make such a good team.

86
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,552
Why does your friend 
have a chalker?

87
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:05,075
Oh, he used it
to propose to a skywriter.

88
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,542
Oh, ma'am? Ma'am,
do you need help with that?

89
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:09,217
Oh, yes. Please.

90
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:10,332
Is this your house?

91
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:12,554
I'm moving in with my son.

92
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:13,578
He's rich.

93
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,506
Phone by the toilet rich.

94
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,129
All right, so have
you lived here a long time?

95
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,709
I moved here in '62 
to be an actress.

96
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,554
I had one line in a "Rockford files."

97
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,009
"He went out the back.,"

98
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,393
Who went out the back?

99
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,100
That was you.

100
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:31,644
Well, you're all set here.

101
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,629
You're not interested 
in the place, are you?

102
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,464
- Oh, no, thank you. 
- Yes-- yes, we are.

103
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,473
Yes. Yes, we are.

104
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,924
- Come on. 
- Okay.

105
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,654
You gotta keep your eyes open.

106
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,261
It's not natural when a ball 
is hurtling at your face.

107
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:47,389
Will you choke up a little?

108
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,453
Probably when they play 
the national anthem.

109
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,337
No, move your hands up the bat.

110
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,469
"When they play 
the national anthem."

111
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,813
I had a perfect record--

112
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:58,256
22 games, and I hadn't played 
a single inning.

113
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,764
Then the McCoy twins' grandma dies,

114
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:01,838
and suddenly I'm starting 
at right field.

115
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:05,120
What does that even mean?
Is it the same as stage right?

116
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,032
All right, ready? 
Nice and easy.

117
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:11,085
I haven't even thrown it yet.

118
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:13,177
Then it's your fault.
I'm doing my part.

119
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:15,188
Forget it. We need
to do something different.

120
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,721
Let's change your stance.

121
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:19,060
Try leaning in.

122
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,389
Further.

123
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,085
Now close your eyes.

124
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:27,274
Ah! Perfect! You think 
you can do that every time?

125
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,035
What, get hit on purpose?

126
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,125
If you wanna get 
on base and be a hero.

127
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,402
Some men are born into greatness.

128
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,477
Others have it 
chucked at their face.

129
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,219
Yes!

130
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,752
Okay, Mrs. Brooks,
thank you very much.

131
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,448
We'll be in touch very soon.

132
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,661
Say it one more time.

133
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:43,610
He went out the back.

134
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:46,354
- Oh, love it! Love it! 
- Brava! Brava!

135
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:47,571
Bye-bye!

136
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:48,570
What do you think, Phil?

137
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,526
Well, I have to admit, 
it's a steal.

138
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,253
Yes! Yes! I told you!

139
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:55,598
And you said Gil Thorpe
makes a killing flipping houses.

140
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,114
Yeah, he brags 
about it all the time.

141
00:04:57,115 --> 00:04:57,887
Every time he makes a sale,

142
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,239
he calls himself "Flipper"

143
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,732
And walks around making 
this dolphin sound. Like...

144
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,209
How does he do it? 
I hate him so much.

145
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,154
Okay, look, if the four of us 
go in on this together,

146
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:08,352
we can minimize the risk.

147
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:09,329
Or if none of us do it,

148
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,652
we can eliminate the risk altogether

149
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:12,709
because none of you know
anything about flipping houses.

150
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,034
Okay, well, we already
have it figured out.

151
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:15,140
I'm gonna be the designer...

152
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,850
Because I know 
about colors and shapes.

153
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,561
Yeah, so does Lily.

154
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:20,046
I'm gonna be the contractor.

155
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:22,901
And I'm gonna be the astronaut.
Oh, this is fun. Phil, you go.

156
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:23,745
Mitchell, I am serious.

157
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:25,761
I have overseen lots 
of projects in our home.

158
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:27,781
I oversaw the remodel
of our bathroom.

159
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:29,217
Under budget. Right, Phil?

160
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,500
Yeah. I was a little disappointed
we didn't go for

161
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,311
the butt-washing toilet,
but otherwise...

162
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:33,607
You can wash
your own butt for free.

163
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,033
Well, that's not the same, is it?

164
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,190
This is all fun to talk about.

165
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,270
It is, but I don't think
that you understand

166
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,699
what-- what this
could really entail. And--

167
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,187
Okay, there it is. Mitchell just
said "No," so we're done.

168
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,497
Surprise, surprise.

169
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,524
Listen, we'll talk
about this at home, okay?

170
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,540
Don't give up.

171
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,036
Phil, you think
it's a good idea, right?

172
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:52,017
Totally.

173
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,513
Yes. And you know
we can handle it, right?

174
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:55,894
I think you guys
can handle anything.

175
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,621
And you go talk to him.
You're a professional.

176
00:05:58,622 --> 00:05:59,469
He respects you.

177
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,889
Okay. Give us some space.
I'll go talk him into it.

178
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,790
- All right. 
- All right?

179
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,032
- Okay.
- Okay.

180
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,230
Listen...

181
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,336
there's no way
we're letting them do this.

182
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:08,326
I know, right?

183
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,117
They are not equipped
to take this on.

184
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:11,402
We might as well
flush all our savings

185
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,921
down my boring old toilet.

186
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,330
Oh, you are really
bitter about that.

187
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,555
It's the one thing I asked for.
Don't sit on your sunglasses.

188
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:20,425
Sorry, guys.

189
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:22,350
Whoops. Just to be clear, though.

190
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,828
Under no circumstances
are we letting them do this?

191
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:26,230
I am totally with you.

192
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,008
Okay, you stay here.
I'll go break the bad news.

193
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:31,477
Sorry, guys.
Not gonna happen.

194
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:32,854
- Yeah, well, maybe if-- 
- I would drop it.

195
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:34,622
It's not worth the fight.
Come on, Claire.

196
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:37,077
The faster we leave,
the less it's gonna hurt.

197
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:38,864
Hop in. Yep.

198
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,605
Why does it have to be like this?

199
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:47,201
I don't know. He's your brother.
Buckled up? Good.

200
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,858
No! No! No, no, 
I see what you're doing!

201
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,805
He doesn't want this either!

202
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:53,272
- Little radio? 
- Sure.

203
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,064
Phil! Claire!

204
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:58,344
Come on!

205
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,222
It's such a shame

206
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,630
because I know we would do
a great job on that house.

207
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:15,365
- Totally. - If Gil Thorpe
can do it, I can do it, right?

208
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,576
Please!

209
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,292
Please. Gil Thorpe
has decades of experience

210
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,111
and infallible instincts.

211
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:23,175
As much as we'd all like
to believe otherwise,

212
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,136
I did not marry Gil Thorpe.

213
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,698
Can you imagine that?

214
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,137
God, we'd sell a lot of houses.

215
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,825
Oh! Great.

216
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:35,565
- Mitchell. 
- Oh, you know what, Claire?

217
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,227
You gotta cool down or 
you're just gonna make this worse.

218
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,178
Why don't you go get the coffees?

219
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:39,214
And I'll deal with him.

220
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:40,687
Well, okay,
what are you gonna say to him?

221
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:42,254
I'm just gonna
talk to him man-to-man.

222
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:43,475
Right.

223
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:44,510
Okay.

224
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,674
Hello?

225
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,733
Claire, Phil doesn't want
the house either, all right?

226
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,639
He's letting me take the fall.
He's a liar.

227
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,001
And a clever one.

228
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,689
Ugh! How long do you think
you can keep this from her?

229
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,289
All right? I'm gonna
talk to her eventually.

230
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,504
Well, as long as
we're swapping stories,

231
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:58,345
Maybe I'll tell Cam

232
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:01,077
what happened to the sweater
he knit for you.

233
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:05,630
I can't.

234
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,697
I can't! I can't!

235
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,316
I can't do it! I can't take
this stupid thing anymore!

236
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,547
It was stolen out of the car.
Do you understand me?

237
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:14,566
Got it.

238
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,166
That is low.

239
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,430
I know. Don't be mad at me.

240
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,697
That said, I suggest
you lose this number.

241
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,548
I'm not proud of what I did,

242
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,797
but I'm not comfortable
squashing people's dreams.

243
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,854
I am a cheerleader.

244
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,484
I'm the guy on top
of the pyramid shouting,

245
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:30,920
"Go, dreams, go!"

246
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,652
You know what's not a cheer?

247
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,118
"Two, four, six, eight,

248
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,386
you are going to fail at this

249
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,797
and lose everything 
we've worked for, Claire!

250
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,399
Hush, little baby,

251
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,199
don't say a word.

252
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,454
Papa's going to buy you
a mockingbird.

253
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:50,181
And if that mockingbird won't sing,

254
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:53,861
papa's gonna buy you
a diamond ring.

255
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,440
Papa'd buy ten diamond rings

256
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:58,074
to get that mockingbird
to shut the hell up.

257
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,939
But I wasn't gonna tell Gloria
she was a terrible singer.

258
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,590
That's just taking
a bath with a toaster.

259
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:04,813
Still, the thought of

260
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:07,309
that poor little thing stuck
in there like a hostage,

261
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,168
listening to that racket
days on end...

262
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,329
I just couldn't take it.

263
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:16,253
And if that billy goat won't push,

264
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:19,409
papa's gonna get every le--

265
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,770
I'll tell you what papa's gonna do.

266
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,287
He's gonna take a turn on that mic.

267
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:23,975
- Oh! Really? 
- Yeah, I've been thinking,

268
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,865
if it's a chance to bond,
I should take it.

269
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,736
Ay, Jay, that's great.

270
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,815
I think that the sound of my voice

271
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,070
shouldn't be the only thing
that the baby should hear.

272
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,154
Same page.

273
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,026
Breaker, breaker, big Jay.

274
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:36,855
Baby, what's your 20? Over.

275
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:37,588
Ay, that's so cute.

276
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,000
You sound like
Smokey and the Bandito.

277
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:40,741
Go on. Go on.

278
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:42,998
Hi, kid.
This is your dad Jay Pritchett.

279
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,798
Uh, we're all pretty
excited to meet you.

280
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,500
Just a heads-up--

281
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,842
I might be a few years older
than you're expecting.

282
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:50,845
But on the plus side,
we're very comfortable.

283
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,773
What's that? Nothin'?

284
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,306
Tough womb.

285
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:56,790
What are you doing in there?
You sleepin'?

286
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,006
Are you sleeping?

287
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,177
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- *Are you--

288
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:03,172
Ah! Still daddy's turn.

289
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:10,278
Dumb-- dumb rock!

290
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,209
- Are you cryin'? 
- No.

291
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:17,550
No. I just can't get
this rock to budge.

292
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,564
Okay, what did we learn
from "A League of Their Own"?

293
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:20,921
No crying in baseball.

294
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:22,677
No. That Madonna's
a lousy actress,

295
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:23,380
and so are you.

296
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,677
What's really going on?

297
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:26,383
Okay.

298
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,246
You know, over the last
couple of months,

299
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,150
I've applied for, like,
five different jobs.

300
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:34,513
- I didn't know that. 
- No. I didn't tell anyone,

301
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:37,257
because I didn't get them, Cam.

302
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:40,085
I went to college, you know?

303
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:44,310
And... I just wanna be able
to contribute to my kids' education.

304
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,892
And I wanna be able
to buy my husband a present...

305
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,473
with my own money.

306
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,418
Hey, you're preaching
to the choir director.

307
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:52,543
It's actually why
I became a choir director.

308
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:56,408
You became a part-time teacher
in a public school for money?

309
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:57,723
I make more than you do.

310
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,316
I mean, before parking. But...

311
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,195
Look, I'm sorry Mitchell
killed our house dream.

312
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,620
You know, now especially that I know
you wanted to use the money

313
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,087
for such noble reasons.

314
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,248
Yeah.

315
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,446
And also...

316
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:13,350
there was this pair of boots.

317
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,176
There's always a pair of boots.

318
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,877
Mitchell, do you know
what I've realized?

319
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,047
That some thoughts
are better left unexpressed?

320
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,871
No. That in this relationship,

321
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,401
I'm the gas pedal,
and you're the brakes.

322
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,517
Okay, wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

323
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:31,363
Last week, you said that

324
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:32,995
you were the painting
and I was the frame.

325
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,225
That's if we were artwork.

326
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,791
This is if we were a car.

327
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,559
I know what part
you'd be if we were a horse.

328
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,853
- Excuse me? 
- Hmm?

329
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:41,267
Claire and I bring you
this great opportunity,

330
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,507
And you stop it cold.

331
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,113
I guess that's what brakes do.

332
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:45,384
You know what brakes also do?

333
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:46,879
They keep you
from driving off cliffs.

334
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,430
Maybe they're not cliffs.
Maybe they're ramps,

335
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,790
ready to launch us into new,
exciting vistas.

336
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,865
I am not the only one against
this whole house thing.

337
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:54,897
Phil doesn't want it either.

338
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:55,625
You keep saying that,

339
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,727
but I find that very,
very hard to believe.

340
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:58,898
Phil supports Claire.

341
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,850
Phil is a cheerleader.

342
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,709
Why can't you be more like Phil?

343
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,253
And then it hit me.

344
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,438
I could be exactly like Phil.

345
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:08,894
I could pretend to be on board,

346
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,295
forcing the cheerleader
to be the bad guy.

347
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,879
I know it's underhanded,

348
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,730
but that's the way I throw.

349
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,450
- Mitchell? 
- You-- you know what?

350
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:19,353
You've convinced me.

351
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,681
If-- if you and Claire
and especially Phil

352
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:23,576
are into this,
then I'm on board.

353
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,191
- What? Seriously?!
- Yes! 100%.

354
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:27,950
In fact, why don't you
call Claire and Phil

355
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:28,824
right now and tell them?

356
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,775
Okay. It was
the ramp thing, wasn't it?

357
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:32,491
You know, I felt
really good about it.

358
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,330
What?

359
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,645
Are you serious?
That's fantastic!

360
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,743
Oh! I gotta tell Phil.
I'll call you right back.

361
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,035
What's-- what's up?

362
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:41,551
Mitchell changed his mind.

363
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,622
He's all for it.
We're flipping a house!

364
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:45,495
- Yeah. 
- Yeah!

365
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,572
Well, hello, Phil.

366
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,325
To what do I owe this pleasure?

367
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:53,233
Cut the crap.

368
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,571
You wanna play chicken?
Chicken's my middle name.

369
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,408
I don't know what
you're talking about.

370
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,991
I'm just being supportive
of my partner and my sister,

371
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:01,818
both of whom I love very much.

372
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,195
How do you sleep at night?

373
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,994
Soundly, knowing
you'll do the right thing.

374
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,670
So how about it, Phil?

375
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:10,407
You gonna stop this train?
'Cause these brakes are out.

376
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,876
Oh. And I suggest
you lose this number.

377
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:15,891
Mitchell?

378
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:17,233
Mitchell?!

379
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:20,888
Yeah, I was pretty ticked off

380
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,554
that Mitchell double-crossed
my double-cross.

381
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,167
And then he stopped
taking my calls,

382
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,955
And so I sent him the following
carefully worded text...

383
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,680
"U suck."

384
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,966
I could tell Phil felt pretty hurt

385
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,854
and betrayed, so I responded.

386
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:38,028
"How r u gonna cheerlead
your way out of this one, Buffy?"

387
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:40,928
"We both know this
house thing is a disaster."

388
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,084
"Then say something, or I will.

389
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,041
I don't care if you tell Cam..."

390
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,099
"I threw out
that hideous sweater?!"

391
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,738
I spent months knitting
that hideous sweater.

392
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,589
- Yeah. 
- W-- how are we seeing this?

393
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,327
They're using the
group text from yesterday.

394
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,345
They have no idea these
are even coming to me.

395
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:56,339
Okay.

396
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,844
Oh. Here's another one.

397
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,279
"We need to shut
this house thing down

398
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,539
without them knowing it's us"?!

399
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:04,637
Oh! Well...

400
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,622
"2 late."

401
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,732
No, that-- that's bad.

402
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,842
Claire, I am so sorry.

403
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,957
I know I should've been
more honest with you, but I--

404
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:25,891
No, Phil.

405
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,098
You know what really kills me?

406
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,451
Is you didn't believe in me,
and you believe in everything!

407
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,713
You know, I knew
that sweater wasn't stolen.

408
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:36,198
And here I pick blue yarn
to match your eyes,

409
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,339
but I should've picked
black to match your heart.

410
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,628
Although you look
amazing in black. Damn you.

411
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:41,802
Come on.

412
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:47,601
"...Leaving 17 dead and
thousands without power."

413
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:49,117
Ay, Jay, please!

414
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:52,255
It's bad that the baby listens
to such terrible things.

415
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,372
He's heard worse.

416
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:55,696
Jay, do you know a good
1-hour dry cleaner?

417
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,384
And I don't mean
the "Must be in by 10:00,

418
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,674
only on weekdays,
you need a coupon" kind.

419
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:00,916
I mean a hard 1-hour.

420
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,206
This conversation feels
like a hard one hour.

421
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:05,207
And what do you need it
cleaned for? It's spotless.

422
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,226
There's mustard here
from Reuben's reuben.

423
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:08,061
That's what happens when

424
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,126
you put a narcissist
in charge of snack day.

425
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,574
Okay, it's my turn again.

426
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,076
Baby, it's your mother again.

427
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:14,799
- I'm-- 
- Gloria?

428
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,038
Why don't we give him a break?

429
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,139
He probably needs a minute

430
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,113
because he just learned
about a deadly tornado.

431
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,958
Okay, stop calling him a he.

432
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,399
What if he's a she,
and you're making her upset?

433
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,520
I told you. That's just
the shorthand I'm using.

434
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:26,272
- Don't jump down my throat
every time I'm - Ay, yes,

435
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,732
- because you always 
- What are you doing?

436
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,260
Do you really want
your unborn baby

437
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,982
to hear you fighting like this?

438
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:33,265
Studies show it's unhealthy

439
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,886
for a fetus to be exposed
to a stressful environment.

440
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:38,064
Studies? You're 13. 
Read a comic book.

441
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,732
What time does your game start?

442
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,422
I have to be there
at 3:00 for hitting practice.

443
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,783
Batting practice.

444
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:43,856
Not for me.

445
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,591
Jay, I don't want our baby to think

446
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:49,071
that it's coming into
an unhappy home.

447
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:52,186
Let's promise that we're
never ever going to fight

448
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:53,029
in front of him.

449
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,622
No fighting in front of the baby.

450
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,775
Okay, good.

451
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,799
Twinkle, twinkle

452
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,078
little lamb

453
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,908
Gloria, stop it! Stop it.
No more singing.

454
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:06,130
Why?

455
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,516
Because you stink.

456
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:10,236
You're a terrible singer.

457
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,337
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

458
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:16,381
How dare do you say that I am...

459
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:17,955
I know! Ay, no, no, no.

460
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:19,856
No fighting in front of the baby.
We just made a deal.

461
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:20,673
Yeah, but that's not fair

462
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:22,557
because I am always
in front of the baby!

463
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:25,297
Gloria, you're as close
to perfect as woman gets.

464
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:27,343
Nothing wrong with
one tiny, little flaw.

465
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,376
Yours is when you start to sing,

466
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,435
is sounds like something got stuck
in the vacuum cleaner.

467
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:32,239
That's-- you're just--

468
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,632
No, no, no.

469
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:38,656
That is just your stupid,
stupid opinion, Jay.

470
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,839
But I am very angry at you,

471
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,548
and I am gonna make a list

472
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:45,514
of all the things that
I am going to scream at you

473
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:48,610
as soon as this baby's out of me.

474
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,336
I didn't think it
all the way through.

475
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,157
Oh, hello, Mitch.

476
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,735
Uh, you got Claire flowers?

477
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,227
Yes. I had a little bit
of a rough night.

478
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,803
Yeah, you and me both.

479
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,210
Daddy slept in my room last night.

480
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,605
- Here, give me some of those. 
- What? No.

481
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,501
- You got me into this. 
- Hey, stop! You're breaking them!

482
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:09,600
I need-- I'm not going
to Cam empty-handed!

483
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,431
Phil, let go of the...

484
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:19,944
Hold still!

485
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:21,980
Claire and Cam did all this?

486
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,886
A week ago, that was all junk.

487
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:26,531
It's amazing.

488
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:27,730
I mean, there's that
little bump in the middle.

489
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:29,078
But other than that...

490
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,186
Even if one of those boys
had hit five home runs,

491
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,355
the biggest star
on that field was Claire.

492
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:34,937
That's the funny thing
about marriage.

493
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,445
You fall in love with this...

494
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:37,688
extraordinary person,

495
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,105
and over time, they
begin to seem ordinary.

496
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:42,925
I think it's all the nagging.

497
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:48,932
Wow. This...

498
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,304
this is incredible.

499
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,397
You literally saw
a diamond in the rough.

500
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:54,041
Yeah, but I take on
a lot of projects

501
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,554
no one else is willing to.

502
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,409
I deserve that.

503
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,750
I was an idiot for doubting you.

504
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,909
Please, honey, forgive me.

505
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,606
How could I not,

506
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,972
when you give me
this bouquet of crumpled flowers?

507
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:05,779
- Mitchell did that! 
- Mitchell again?

508
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,036
Ask Lily!

509
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,151
- Hey, Cam. 
- Hey.

510
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,737
Here you-- Okay. Well...

511
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,019
Oh, wow. Broken and mangled...

512
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,412
Just like my heart.

513
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,930
Cam, I'm sorry
for not supporting you.

514
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:18,989
- What about the sweater?
- That's unforgivable.

515
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,816
I mean, you put all
that time and work into it,

516
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,222
and I just toss it
out the car window.

517
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,353
Tossed it out the car window?!

518
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:24,778
I'm forgetting how much you knew.

519
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,948
You know what, guys?
Honestly, I...

520
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:29,324
I think we should do it.
I think we should go for the house.

521
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,542
- Really?
- Okay, but careful, honey.

522
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,718
Don't say something
if you don't mean it.

523
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,225
No, I do mean it.
I think you two will do a fantastic job.

524
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,965
You know, I do, too.
I'm on board.

525
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:36,687
On board for what?

526
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,835
Oh, well, the four of us,
uh, might go in on a house.

527
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:40,377
Claire and I fix it up and flip it.

528
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,729
That's the worst idea I ever heard.

529
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,321
You guys know nothing
about construction.

530
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:47,080
You'll make all sorts of mistakes,

531
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:49,657
you'll turn on each other,
you'll stop talking,

532
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,241
and suddenly I'm doing
two dinners a week instead of one

533
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,132
because you can't be
in the same room.

534
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,063
Family and business doesn't mix.

535
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:58,280
Ah, you're gonna do whatever
you want. Why do I bother?

536
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:00,533
Is he right?

537
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:02,711
Y-you know dad.
I mean, he's a pessimist.

538
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:04,379
I want us to get that house.

539
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,079
I do. But I don't want us to fight.

540
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,259
We're not gonna fight.

541
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,223
Of course not.

542
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:09,303
Probably.

543
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:10,842
I don't know. Will we?

544
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,300
Maybe we just take
a beat and think about it.

545
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:15,859
Yeah. I-I guess that couldn't hurt.

546
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,698
Yeah.

547
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:17,875
You guys mean the world to us.

548
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,725
I don't want to jeopardize
that over a house.

549
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,848
- We feel the same way.
- I know.

550
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,986
- I just wanna say I know we'd do
a good job, though. - Hello?

551
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,068
- And I feel so-- 
- It's Mrs. Brooks, the lady with the house.

552
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:29,002
Actually, it's good that you called.

553
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,211
What?

554
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:32,215
What happened?

555
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,136
Gil Thorpe just made her an offer.

556
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,596
- We did it! 
- We bought a house.

557
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:38,716
It's gonna be... great!

558
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,806
What could go wrong? Nothing.

559
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:45,374
Sometimes I don't understand people.

560
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,456
They do crazy things
for the dumbest reasons.

561
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:51,018
I'm going to march out there
and swing as hard as I can.

562
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,934
And if every
sports movie is correct,

563
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:54,184
I'm going to smack that ball,

564
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:57,107
and everyone will chant
my name as I round the bases.

565
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:57,843
By the way,

566
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:00,389
it is always counterclockwise,
or do I get to choose?

567
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,006
I don't think it's gonna matter.

568
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,685
They convince themselves
it'll all work out...

569
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,134
Please rise for the national anthem.

570
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,431
I'm gonna show you who can sing.

571
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:11,392
Gloria.

572
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:13,219
Oh, this is gonna be rough.

573
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,460
Despite all the evidence
to the contrary.

574
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:21,053
Oh say can you see?

575
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:25,467
By the dawn's early light?

576
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,150
Which I guess isn't so bad.

577
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:33,676
And the rocket's red glare!

578
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:34,787
All I'm saying is,

579
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:37,587
I hope to god you don't have
your mother's singing voice.

580
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,432
But, man, I hope you get
her self-confidence.

581
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:44,985
Try to get some sleep.

582
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,184
I'll talk to you in the morning.

583
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:58,968
2 outs, bottom of the sixth.
Tied at 4.

584
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:00,406
This is it, folks.

585
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,318
The whole game comes down to this.

586
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,917
Manny Delgado 0 for 3 on the day.

587
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:06,277
Gloria, your thoughts?

588
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,509
I think he's going
to hit the home run.

589
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,767
Please, God, give me one.

590
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,884
Manny, stand up straight!

591
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:14,087
But bend your knees.

592
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,414
Widen your stance!

593
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:16,866
Would you please let me just--

594
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:18,009
Take your base!

595
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,766
- You did it! You got it, Manny!
- I did it?

596
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,690
No, no, no, no!
Not that way! Go this way!

597
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:25,044
Oh, why do I bother?
He's gonna do what he wants.

598
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,426
Manny! Manny! Manny!

599
