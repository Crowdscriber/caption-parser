00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,700
Lights Out, it's Johnny Drama!
What's up, man?

4
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,100
You see that? He recognized me.

5
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,200
$3 million for eight rounds! It's unreal.
You gotta make a movie to make that much.

6
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Are you crazy? Did you see that guy's face?

7
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,300
No amount of money's
gonna get me in the ring.

8
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,700
$50,000, I'd let Klitschko
beat the fuck out of me.

9
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll beat the fuck out of you for free.
What do you think?

10
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,300
I'm telling you,
Klitschko don't hit that hard, man.

11
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
You kidding? The guy's Russian.

12
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,500
He's got that Mongolian
Genghis Khan warrior blood in him.

13
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,300
I'd do three shots of Stoli
and let him blast away.

14
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,500
You fucking dick.

15
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
You'd be a dead man.

16
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
Yeah, but I'd be flush.
I tell you, I'd let that hit me for free...

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
- Fuck off, asshole.
- It was him.

18
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
- Relax.
- He didn't mean that.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
- How are you?
- Good.

21
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm Johnny.

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Let's go to the bar.

23
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,700
- Let's see. What do you guys want?
- Beer, baby.

24
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
What did you think of the seats?

25
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,900
- Amazing.
- Two very slow white men.

26
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,200
I apologize. But goddamn,
there was some blood.

27
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
- You liked the blood?
- Loved it.

28
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
That was for you. If you see Rob Schneider,
tell him you bought those seats.

29
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
What do you want to drink?

30
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Listen. Three tequilas would be great,
all right?

31
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
- Cheers!
- Good for what ails you.

32
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Yes!

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,900
- Jimmy! Jimmy Kimmel!
- How you doing?

34
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
You know Vincent Chase, right?

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,300
- Yeah, how are you?
- There you go.

36
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,500
- What's happening?
- Big fan.

37
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,300
Thank you. I appreciate it.
We should get you on the show.

38
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,400
- Yeah. I'd love to do it, anytime.
- I'd love to have you.

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,900
Like tomorrow,
we'd love to have you if we could.

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,200
I don't know, you're putting me on the spot.

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,700
I know you got the movie.

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,300
- You got a movie coming out Friday.
- It can't hurt.

43
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,000
All right, fuck it. See you tomorrow.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,900
- There you go, he's in!
- All right. I'll call you, then?

45
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,800
- Absolutely.
- Very good. Thanks, Ari.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,100
Pleased to meet you.
I can't. I don't drink. I'm sorry.

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
I do drink.

48
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,500
- Say hello to your brother for me, too.
- Johnny?

49
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,100
Tell him I said hi.
I haven't seen him in a long time.

50
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,300
- He's around here somewhere.
- See you, Jimmy.

51
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,500
There you go. You're in.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
So, I got this guy, Rufus.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,900
He just installed
this sweet little home system...

54
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,500
in my place on Mulholland.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,200
State-of-the art everything.
I could charge admission at this place.

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,500
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you.

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,300
Here's the kicker:
I mention Rufus' name in {y:i}InStyle.

58
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,500
All he charges me for is installation.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,000
- Fuck you!
- No. Fuck you, seriously.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Rufus, that's how he does it.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,700
He's a wild cat, Rufus.
I got his card here somewhere.

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,200
I'd love that.

63
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,100
You still doing that thing with Wes?

64
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,400
Yeah. We're gonna start shooting in June.

65
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,300
Did you get anyone
to play the part of the partner?

66
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,900
Yeah. Unfortunately,
my brother's gonna do it.

67
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,900
He's costly.

68
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,500
If he falls out, you think of me, right?

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,400
Always. Always thinking of you,
Johnny Drama.

70
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,000
- Thanks a lot, Luke. I appreciate it.
- Call Rufus.

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,500
Vince, you gonna prepare anything
for the show?

72
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,200
No. That would take all the fun out of
just winging it.

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
The guy's gonna ask you a lot of questions.

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah, it's {y:i}Jimmy Kimmel.
Not {y:i}60 Minutes, bro.

75
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
All right, you'll see.
You should have some stories ready.

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,700
Hey, ladies.

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,900
You got any stories I can tell
on {y:i}Jimmy Kimmel?

78
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,500
You know what? The night's still young.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
The night is young.

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,900
- Taste this.
- I am not tasting that, it stinks.

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
- What the fuck is it?
- It's a new recipe.

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Tofu spirulina scramble, it's delicious.
Taste it.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,900
It smells like dog shit scramble.

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Eat your Froot Loops and shut up.

85
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,100
- What the fuck smells?
- Open a window, Drama. Jesus Christ!

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,800
You know what?
Kitchen's closed, fellas. Enjoy cold cereal.

87
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,400
- So, you want to talk about Kimmel?
- Jimmy Kimmel?

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
- Vince is doing the show tonight.
- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,500
- You're angrier than usual this morning.
- Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.

90
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Why? He said to say hello to you.

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,200
He's a phony prick.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,900
He and I were running buddies
back in the day.

93
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,800
That was before
I got kicked off of {y:i}Melrose Place.

94
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,500
The money ran dry. I lost my house.
I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
After that, that was it.

96
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,800
He dropped me like a bad habit.
Never heard from the guy again.

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
I never heard that story.

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Well, you know me. I don't like to advertise.

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,000
- Cancel on the prick, Vince.
- He can't cancel.

100
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,200
- I can't cancel.
- What are you gonna talk about, though?

101
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,200
"What's up?" "Not much."
"How you feeling?" "Pretty good."

102
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't forget about the time
you tanked on {y:i}Regis and Kelly.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,300
That was a morning show.
We pulled an all-nighter.

104
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,500
Plus, who could focus...

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,900
with hot-ass Kelly Ripa up there
interrogating you?

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,100
- So, what's really bothering you, E?
- What?

107
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,800
Are you really concerned about me,
or is this maybe a Kristen issue?

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,900
- Yep.
- Don't tell me Kristen's back in the game.

109
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,000
Fuck off. She's picking up her shit
later today. That's all.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,400
I offered to help him box it up
and send it off.

111
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,500
But he didn't want that.

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Throw her shit in the garbage
and change your number.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,700
Yeah. She comes down here,
you're out of commission for two weeks.

114
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,900
I can't have that.

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,000
Broken up and still pussy-whipped.
That's just sad.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.

117
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.

118
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,500
You never ended one. The only person
you've ever loved is yourself.

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,800
What's not to love?

120
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Look, breaking up is painful.
That's why I never do it.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Why hurt someone
when you can just let it drag on forever?

122
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
Come on.
You must've broken up with someone.

123
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,200
- No, Johnny. Nobody.
- Bullshit!

124
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,000
What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,900
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.

126
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,400
No, you just started banging
Meredith Tierney at the same time.

127
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah. I liked her, too.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't know how you get away
with this shit. Lucky guy.

129
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Vince, I was talking to Luke Wilson
last night.

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,400
He's got this phat home theater.
I think we should make a play for one.

131
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,300
- You couldn't call me?
- It happened last night.

132
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,500
There's a right way to do things
and a wrong way to do things.

133
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,800
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.

134
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.

135
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Is he gonna get killed for going on {y:i}Kimmel?

136
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,200
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,800
If you want to do {y:i}Kimmel, come to me.
I'm your publicist. That's what I'm here for.

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,400
I gave him the idea for {y:i}The Man Show.
He loves my ass.

139
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,800
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out. Look, I'm serious.

140
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,300
You don't want to piss off Letterman
or Leno.

141
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,300
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.

142
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,900
I am. But those guys
are vindictive pricks. Here, try this on.

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
- I'm sorry, okay? Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?

144
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,000
- What? {y:i}Jimmy Kimmel?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know. Maybe. What's the difference?

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
I think he should go with Byblos.

148
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,900
If he decides later he doesn't like it,
I'll take it.

149
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,500
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.

150
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,300
You should get a few suits to choose
from, so you're not locked into one.

151
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,200
- He doesn't wear suits.
- He does now.

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,500
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.

153
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,900
- That's a keeper.
- Nice.

154
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,200
Hello.

155
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,700
- You should get me on a talk show. I'd kill.
- I'll get you on {y:i}Springer.

156
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,300
Fat, little horny fucks,
and the women that despise them.

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,600
What are you laughing at?

158
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,500
Maybe I'll get you on {y:i}Montel
with Don Swayze...

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,900
Joey Travolta
and the other retarded star siblings.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,300
- They're calling back in an hour.
- You're gonna have to do that, E.

162
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,400
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
That's what makes you a star.

165
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,900
You wanna write that down for me
in case I forget?

166
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,800
Yeah. Try this one on, all right?

167
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,300
Yeah, that could be funny.

168
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,400
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.

169
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,900
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.

170
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,700
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.

171
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,000
What else?

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,900
Tell him about that stoned-out craft
service girl who blew me after lunch.

173
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,400
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- I'm trying to help.

174
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,000
You're embarrassing me.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I was on {y:i}Arsenio. It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,800
Let's see. Here's something. I got one.

177
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,500
Vince went to the High School
of Performing Arts where they shot {y:i}Fame.

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,000
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.

179
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,500
Hold on a second.

181
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,000
You want to do this? This is your interview.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.

183
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
You're doing a good job.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah. Vince actually...
He's not available right now.

185
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I'll talk to him
and see if we can come up with something.

186
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll call you later, okay? Thank you.

187
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.

188
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,500
No. Don't even cancel.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,500
Just don't show. That'll really fuck Kimmel.

190
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,700
You'd never cancel.

191
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,600
Why would I cancel
when it's so much fun to watch him freak?

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,800
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.

193
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,500
Shit. You serious?

194
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,600
- You're fucking dead!
- Fuck you, baby!

195
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,700
Yo, Turtle!

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm not walking.

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Sara Foster? That chick is hot.

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,800
You think she'll bring other hotties
with her?

199
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,000
- Why would she?
- 'Cause hotties roll in packs, baby.

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I never broke up with her, either.

201
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,300
We had that crazy night in the Hamptons.
I never called her again.

202
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm not proud of that.
But that's not breaking up.

203
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
See? My record's intact.

204
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
No asterisk there.

205
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,200
What are you gonna say to her?

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,100
What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.

207
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,800
- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?

208
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,000
Same thing. Whatever I say when I see her
is what I'll say.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,900
Bullshit. He's gonna cry like a little bitch.

210
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
Cry like a little bitch.

211
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,000
Why are you using Vince as a defense...
Run, Forrest, run!

212
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
You look great.

213
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,100
Thanks. I'm probably in the best shape
of my life.

214
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,300
- You look like shit.
- I do?

215
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, who's been cutting your hair? Turtle?

216
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,500
No, I just haven't...

217
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,500
- Still doing the Pilates?
- When I have time. I'm really busy.

218
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah, me, too. Real busy.
Got no time for anything.

219
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
No time for haircuts.
Got a lot of shit going on right now.

220
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,600
- Like what?
- Stuff.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
- Really, like what?
- Like stuff. Don't quiz me.

222
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,200
What did you do today?

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
You don't get my job, you never did.

224
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,500
I shopped and I played golf.
But it's not how it sounds.

225
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Shopping and golf?

226
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,200
Vince is doing {y:i}Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
I've got to keep his mind focused.

227
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,500
He's on with Sara Foster.
You know who that is?

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,000
They had a one-night stand and
he never called her. Can you believe that?

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can. Vince has to break up with girls
before it gets serious.

230
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
That way he can't get hurt.

231
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Textbook narcissist.
He has major intimacy issues.

232
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
- You think that's what it is?
- I'm a Psych major, Eric.

233
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Turtle tells me
you're thinking of buying a house.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,300
Not exactly.

235
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,300
Of course. Vince is gonna buy a house,
and you're all gonna live in it.

236
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah. Something like that.

237
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
- Fuck.
- What?

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,100
What happened to you
getting your own place?

239
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,000
- I am getting my own place.
- When? When Vince dies?

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
When the time is right. Jesus! What?

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Can't this wait?

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,100
It's in the second drawer. Jesus!

243
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,500
- Vince says hello.
- Great. Look, I gotta go.

244
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,900
I was hoping
we weren't going to fight about this.

245
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,800
- I thought you like to fight.
- Only when it leads to make-up sex.

246
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
That's not gonna happen.

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,100
Wait.

248
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's be clear about one thing, okay?

249
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,800
- This isn't make-up sex. It's break-up sex.
- Whatever.

250
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
This fucking place is a shithole.

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,300
This can't be the place. It looks like a dump.

252
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,800
Luke Wilson's system
was in the neighborhood of $190,000.

253
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,200
$190,000?

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,100
- Can't you do any better?
- No, I can't.

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,300
I didn't want to have to bring this up,
all right?

256
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,300
- I work for a fairly prominent movie star.
- Yeah. Who?

257
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,400
- Vincent Chase.
- Really?

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,300
He's great.

259
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Maybe you recognize me. I'm his brother.

260
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
No.

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,500
Anyway, off the record,
my man is doing {y:i}Jimmy Kimmel tonight.

262
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,600
- All right.
- What if we threw in a plug for your outfit?

263
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,700
Would that be cool?
Would that be worth something?

264
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,600
I'll tell you what.

265
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,700
You deliver on that promise,
I give you half off.

266
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
But if he wears this hat...

267
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
it's free.

268
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,200
So all he has to do is wear the hat?

269
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
- Check this out.
- She's sweet.

270
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah. She's gonna be naked in a second.

271
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
So, now what?

272
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
You wanna go to dinner tomorrow night?
Talk about all this?

273
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,500
Eric, you're really not getting this concept.
This was break-up sex, for real.

274
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,700
So, what, you just had sex with me
as a goodbye?

275
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,300
Yeah. It was great.

276
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,500
- I feel dirty.
- Take a shower.

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,700
- Tie or no tie?
- No tie.

278
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,100
- What do you know?
- Where are you guys going, church?

279
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,000
- Gotta look nice for the ladies.
- Vince, come on. We're gonna be late.

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
- What ladies?
- Kimmel's green room.

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,400
We hear it's stocked like a trout pond.

282
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
So, how'd it go with Kristen?

283
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,700
- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"? Never heard of it.

285
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Yeah. You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.

286
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,500
That's the only kind of sex I have.

287
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?

288
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,800
- You look like you just rolled out of bed.
- Yeah, I did.

289
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
You're gonna wear that shirt?

290
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
No, it's wrinkled.

291
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm gonna wear this one.

292
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,800
- You got style, bro.
- Looks good!

293
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
{y:i}We got a good show tonight.

294
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
{y:i}All right, from the movie, The Big Bounce...

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
{y:i}Sara Foster, here, tonight!

296
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,900
{y:i}Heard a lot about this.
{y:i}This movie everybody's talking about...

297
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,100
{y:i}the movie, Head On,
{y:i}the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!

298
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,800
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.

299
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,700
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.

300
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.

301
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Don't tell me you made notes.

302
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,800
Only one.

303
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.

304
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,800
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.

305
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,500
- Where is it?
- That way.

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,300
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.

307
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!

308
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,500
I don't know about the afterlife,
but this life is sweet.

309
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,200
- Shall we?
- We shall.

310
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,500
This is bad.

311
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,300
What?

312
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,000
- I never called you.
- Please. I never called you.

313
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
- Really?
- Really.

314
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,700
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.

315
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,300
I feel worse, trust me.

316
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,800
You look incredible.

317
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,600
You, too. Come in.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,300
Close the door.

319
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,700
You know me, Shauna. I like
to play the field. Keep my options open.

320
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,500
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.

321
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Weren't you married once already?

322
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,500
Nine days. It was annulled. Next time.

323
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,100
- Ari's late.
- Good.

324
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,300
- I'm early.
- Good.

325
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,500
Hey, guys.

326
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,700
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?

327
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.

328
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,900
- How hard are you trying?
- Not that hard.

329
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,800
Good.

330
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,200
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.

331
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,600
Ready in five.

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,300
We need 10.

333
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I've tried everything. I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.

334
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,900
- I know. Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?

335
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,800
I did, I tried it,
but I couldn't follow the instructions.

336
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I never thought chewing gum
could be so complicated.

337
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,200
I even tried smoking
only when drinking coffee.

338
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,700
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.

339
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,300
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.

340
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good...

341
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,200
until I saw a pair of shoes
that I could've bought.

342
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,000
I started smoking again.

343
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,100
But this time I'm quitting for sure.

344
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,800
- For sure.
- Yeah.

345
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,500
Me, too.

346
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,200
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.

347
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,300
Definitely.

348
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,200
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?

349
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,700
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy...

350
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,300
like yourself!

351
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,200
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.

352
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Sarah Silverman. Hi.

353
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,300
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.

354
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,300
- We've met before.
- No, I know...

355
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,900
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.

356
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
No, I'm not on the show tonight.

357
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,200
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.

358
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
That's awesome. That's cool.

359
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,300
Right. I'm here representing my boy,
Vinny Chase.

360
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,200
Are you going to the green room?

361
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,800
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.

362
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,300
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.

363
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I had a little situation
with Natalie Portman's father.

364
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,400
Stupid.

365
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,100
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in. Wanna go in with me?

366
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,200
Like we go in together?
You and me together?

367
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,100
Like, we're going in at the same time.

368
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,000
All right, but are we going to be
leaving together is what I'm saying.

369
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,200
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.

370
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.

371
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.

372
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

373
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,900
You're a funny girl. I mean, you know...

374
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,300
you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.

375
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
What's the problem? I'll be out in a second.

376
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,600
{y:i}I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you
{y:i}not to hold hands.

377
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,500
{y:i}The FCC says
{y:i}no overt displays of affection. So...

378
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,900
If you could just separate them. Thank you.

379
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,300
We just had sex about five minutes ago.

380
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,900
That's another...

381
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,400
{y:i}- Is that okay?
{y:i}- No, you could be arrested for that.

382
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,700
{y:i}- So wrong!
{y:i}- We're on the lam now.

383
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,400
It's wrong. So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?

384
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,800
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?

385
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,000
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.

386
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.

387
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,900
{y:i}Well, thank you.

388
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,600
What about me?

389
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,200
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it. It's unbelievable.

390
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,500
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?

391
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
Forget about the clip.

392
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,000
{y:i}All right, we'll forget about the clip.

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,100
{y:i}Look, the movie's called Head On.

394
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,400
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.

395
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
You're guaranteed to love it,
or your money back.

396
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,900
- From the studio. Not from me.
- Yeah. Right.

397
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,900
{y:i}What would you like to talk about then?
{y:i}I'll let you decide.

398
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,400
{y:i}Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
{y:i}He's really pissed.

399
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,700
He says you dissed him,
you owe him a phone call.

400
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,300
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.

401
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
I can't believe
he's not talking about the movie.

402
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,500
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.

403
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,200
How is he gonna work
Home Video Solutions into this?

404
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Would you shut up and listen?

405
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
What did he tell you?

406
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
He said that when he hit a rough patch,
you kind of bailed on him...

407
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
and you never called him again.

408
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,000
He did not... He said I bailed on him?

409
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,900
I was like a bounty hunter
trying to get a hold of him.

410
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
{y:i}I called his house. I looked for his address.

411
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,700
{y:i}He owes me a call.

412
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,600
I think he might be right.

413
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,100
He's backstage.

414
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,000
Who? He is?

415
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
{y:i}Is he really? Johnny Drama's backstage?

416
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,000
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.

417
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,200
{y:i}Is he around? Is he really backstage?

418
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,800
- Come on. Go.
- Go!

419
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,800
What's wrong with you? Get out there!

420
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,100
Do I need makeup?

421
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,300
The great Johnny Drama!

422
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right. Johnny Drama, everybody!

423
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,800
Isn't that classic?

424
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,600
- How do I look? I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.

425
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,500
- Thin? I look lean.
- That's what I meant.

426
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,900
No body fat.

427
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,800
{y:i}You guys are living together now?

428
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,500
{y:i}It's a bachelor pad?
{y:i}What's the setup over there?

429
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,300
{y:i}- Tell them about the home theater.
{y:i}- Yeah.

430
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,700
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.

431
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,200
- Except...
- Except...

432
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,200
a home theater.

433
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
But we've been told that Rufus
at Home Video Solutions...

434
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,000
...is the best in the business.

435
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,200
{y:i}Here you go!

436
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
- To Drama.
- To Drama.

437
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,400
Great night.

438
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,800
Great fucking night.

439
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,113
