Dr. Curan, I presume?

11
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,457
You work out of your home.

12
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,027
I think that's wonderful.

13
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,230
Well, I cater mostly to the
families in the neighborhood.

14
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,200
Makes it convenient
for them and for me.

Oh, I'm not married, not currently.

00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,840
Where did you say you heard of me?

18
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,042
My girlfriend Nabby Pierce?

19
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,511
You filled her cavity.

20
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:17,145
She said you were very good.

21
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:19,314
Nabby, yes, nice gal.

22
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,150
Nabby also said

23
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:24,153
you sometimes made
special arrangements

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,889
with girls who were a little short.

25
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,523
You don't have any money?

26
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,858
Not very much.

27
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,660
I'm still trying to establish myself.

28
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:34,429
I'm an actress.

29
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,996
I'm going to make it big.

30
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,198
Everyone says so.

31
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,002
You can expect to see me up
on the silver screen one day.

32
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:45,640
Don't you think
we could come to some kind

33
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,976
of mutually beneficial arrangement,

34
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,578
Dr. Curan?

35
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,214
Well, I-I don't know.

36
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:52,916
It hurts, Doctor.

37
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:55,751
I really need you to fill it.

38
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:00,692
I'm just going to put this on you.

39

(gas hissing)

40
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:07,266
I don't want to crush your carnation.

41
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,803
It's not a carnation, silly.

42
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,238
It's a dahlia.

43
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,078

Violet's camping out in her room.

51
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,308
I was wondering if you could
make her a sandwich.

52
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,432
Of course, Dr. Harmon.

53
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:11,346
Thank you.

54
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,928
Could you help me a minute?

55
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:22,053
It must be hard on you
with your wife indisposed.

56
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,451
I miss Vivien.

57
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:25,890
We became quite close.

58
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,876
Don't worry.

59
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,079
Our secret is safe.
What secret?

60
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:33,241
The way you look at me, the
way you fantasize about me.

61
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:37,420
You have a diseased
mind, Dr. Harmon.

62
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,826
That must be why you
became a therapist.

63
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,428
I'm glad you and my wife are friends,

64
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:45,631
but I'm not interested
in your pet theories about me.

65
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,012
So maybe I'm way off base

66
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,503
or maybe I'm crazy like Vivien.

67
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:55,240
Is that what you think, Doctor?

68
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,009
I think you must have
pretty low self-esteem

69
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,510
to keep throwing yourself
at a married man

70
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,946
who doesn't want you.

71
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:04,016
So you don't want me?

72
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,584
You don't find me attractive?

73
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,821
Just make Violet a sandwich, please.

74
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,057
I don't believe you, Ben.

75
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,292
I know you want me.

76
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,429
No, I don't want this.

77
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,264
I love my wife.

78
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:18,599
I want her to get better

79
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,069
and come home
so I can take care of her.

80
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,772
I just want a normal...

81
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,641
boring family.

82
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,046
That's a beautiful speech, Ben.

83
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,682
It's Dr. Harmon.
No more games.

84
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:37,486
No more bullshit.
Do you understand?

85
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,388
I'd better make Violet a sandwich.

86
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,861
You know, it's just
a matter of time, Ben.

Poo? Uh, yeah.

Oh, all except for that one.

00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,653
Well, if he shits in the house

95
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,588
you're cleaning it up.

00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,924
Damn, look at the mud you tracked in.

97
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,094
Nice.

98
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,633
You smoked the last one.

99
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,368
My daughter just died,

100
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,937
and you're on my back
about a goddamn cigarette?

101
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:32,774
Here, smoke that one, asshole.

102
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,744
I'm not another one
of your dogs. I got a job.

103
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,747
I work hard. I don't want
to come over here;

104
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,981
I don't want to have to work more.

105
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,517
You got a job.

108
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,057
Let me rub your feet.

109
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,627
And how did those headshots
that I paid for

110
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,396
work out for you?

111
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,106
I'm sorry about Addie.

112
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,174
She was a cool chick.
Ugh!

113
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,912
Yeah. Maybe that's why you used
to come over here early, huh?

114
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,613
Before I got home?

115
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,984
So you could spend
a little time diddling her, huh?

116
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,186
Whispering sweet nothings in her ear?

117
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,387
I hate when you drink.

00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,724
Hey!

119
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,127
What?

120
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,862
Why don't you run on down

121
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,199
to the Koreans and get us
another carton of ciggies?

122
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,534
That's where I'm going.

123
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,304
And take that goddamn dog with you.

124
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,906
And don't come back until he does

125
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,708
his business.

126

00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:03,866
You want me to get you
some candy, little girl?

135
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:06,469
You're with that lady next door.

136
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,270
She a little old for you?

137
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,540
She seems like a royal bitch.

(sighs)

139
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,844
Maybe you and I should run away
together, then.

Sex is the only weapon

156

She's treating you like shit

157

because she's afraid of losing you.

158

Prove to her that she's right,

00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,448
Okay...

168
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,550
then how come you rocked out with me?

169
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:32,254
To see if I could do it
with a guy who's still alive.

170
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,857
♪ Ah-ha-ha, spooky. ♪

171
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,359
(doorbell rings)

172
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,327
Dr. Harmon, Detective
Jack Colquitt.

173
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,661
Missing Persons, right?

174
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:43,230
Mm-hmm. This young lady
believes you might be

175
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,233
involved in a case we just opened.

176
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,868
You don't remember me, Ben?
Marla McClaine.

177
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,436
Hayden's sister?

178
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,305
BEN: <i>I honestly have no idea</i>
<i>what happened to her.</i>

179
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,207
In fact, I have a few questions
for her myself.

180
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,677
You're a liar.
Hayden is pregnant with your baby.

181
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,946
And she comes here with the crazy idea

182
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,983
that somehow, you're gonna leave
your wife, support her

183
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,051
and raise your child together.

184
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,520
So what'd you do, Ben?
Where is she?

185
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:05,055
In a hole somewhere?

186
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,590
Dr. Harmon, the last time
I was here, I saw Ms. McClaine's

187
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,158
sister coming out of the house.

188
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:12,195
Yes. We made plans to
go to lunch... at Norm's.

189
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,763
You were also working in
the backyard digging

190
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,198
weren't you, around the time
she disappeared?

191
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,766
Detective, you have no idea
what happened here.

192
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,035
That's what we're here to find out.

193
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,670
What's with all the drama?

194
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:23,573
MARLA: What the hell, Hayden?
How come you haven't

195
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:26,176
answered your phone
or called or anything?

196
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,211
Uh, to be honest with you,
Marla, I didn't think

197
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,812
you gave a rat's ass about me.

198
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,715
I thought you were calling
to borrow money again.

199
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,316
So you're okay, then?

200
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,317
Obviously you're not missing.

201
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,519
Nope.

202
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,188
You don't have to worry about me, sis.

203
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,423
You were wrong about Ben.

204
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,860
I've decided to stay
here in La-La Land.

205
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,663
This is my home now.

206
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,133
(door closes)

207
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,935
BEN: You got about ten
seconds to give me

208
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,871
some answers before
I call that detective back

209
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,740
and have you arrested
for assaulting my family.

210
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,541
I'm-I'm sorry, Ben.

211
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,011
I was pregnant, scared and hormonal.

212
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,514
I was a crazy bitch
when I came here on Halloween.

213
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:05,184
I deserve whatever punishment
you think is right.

214
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,319
Ben, this whole thing
has been so ugly.

215
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,520
It's not me.

216
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,322
It's not how I want you
to think of me.

217
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,924
I don't know if we have
a future together,

218
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,258
but I've always been there for you.

219
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,860
From the beginning.

220
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,729
I just want you to remember that.

221
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,802
By the way...

222
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,603
I had the abortion.

223
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,672
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

224
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:32,010
Dr. Harmon?

225
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,246
Excuse me, do we have an appointment?

226
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:36,814
I was told there was a doctor
here who might help me.

227
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:39,150
You need to call
and make an appointment.

228
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:41,552
Doctor, I think something
terrible might happen to me.

229
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,453
What do you mean,
"something terrible"?

230
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,522
I'm not quite certain.

231
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,323
It's a strange feeling.

232
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:48,092
An endless foreboding.

233
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,428
Like a dream I can't wake
myself out of.

234
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,163
Sounds like acute anxiety.

235
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,831
But you really--
It's worse than that.

236
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,900
I do things with men.

237
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,069
Things I shouldn't.

238
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:01,085
But I'm a great actress,
and it's frustrating.

239
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,855
I just need that break.

240
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:06,205
All you need is that one
person who believes in you--

241
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,564
and every time I go into an audition,

242
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:10,700
I think maybe he's the one and...

243
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,168
I get carried away.

244
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,804
Do you know what I mean?
I do.

245
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:27,116
I have an opening tomorrow at noon.

246
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:28,417
What's your name?

247
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:29,585
Elizabeth Short.

248
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,388
I assume you're
covered by SAG insurance?

249
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,523
I see.

250
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:35,758
Well, you're a beautiful young girl.

251
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,727
I just assumed that
you were working steadily.

252
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,195
In the meantime, we need to discuss

253
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:40,496
how you plan to pay for treatment.

254
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,934
Do you really think I'm beautiful?

255
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,702
Really?

256
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,537
You're, um...

257
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,405
an attractive young woman.

258
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,210
No, no, no, no, Beth,
we, we, we just discussed that.

259
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,512
You don't need to do that.

260
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,180
But I don't know how else to pay you.

261
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,582
I know you're the one who can help me.

262
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,018
I can tell you understand.

263
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,186
Well, we can...

264
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,589
figure something out.

265
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,529
You never need to do that with me.

266
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm the one you should feel safe with.

267
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:29,344
(cell phone buzzing)

268
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:30,645
Excuse me.

269
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,851
Uh, I need to, I need to get this.

270
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,019
You won't regret this.

271
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:36,886
Hello?

272
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,722
Uh, just-just slow down, Doctor.

273
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:39,989
I can't...
I can't understand you.

274
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,624
I spoke with Vivien's psychiatrist,

275
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,426
and he doesn't feel she's
mentally strong enough

276
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,994
to hear this news right now.

277
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:46,496
Normally, I would be
very uncomfortable

278
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,531
giving a husband this information,

279
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,101
but you are her designated
health care proxy.

280
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,269
Would you just tell me
what's going on, Doctor?

281
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,439
Heteropaternal superfecundation.

282
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:56,206
Hetero-what?

283
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,407
Your wife's twins

284
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,109
have different fathers.

285
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,711
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:01,712
What did you say?

287
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,447
It's extremely rare.

288
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:04,748
Maybe one in a million.

289
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,350
Your wife must have had

290
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,718
intercourse with two different men

291
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,988
during the same ovulation cycle,

292
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:12,799
within a 48-hour period.

293
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,084
Where is she?
Little slut.

294
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:22,918
Who?

295
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,010
Violet.

296
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,092
She's been catting around
with my dog walker.

297
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:27,287
Nonsense.

298
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,625
The girl's taste in men
is hardly refined,

299
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,326
but I doubt it runs to rough trade.

300
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:33,996
Well, when Travis came back
from dog walking--

301
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:37,533
a 15-minute affair that somehow
stretched into 45--

302
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,437
he smelled... of something
other than canine.

303
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,738
You're delusional.

304
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:45,007
That girl wouldn't give
your greasy boy toy

305
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,508
a second glance.

306
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:50,479
She thinks she's in love
with your little angel.

307
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:53,382
But once the truth comes out,
I suspect that'll change.

308
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:56,318
What the hell are you babbling about?

309
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:59,254
The two babies her
mother is carrying--

310
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,323
only one of them was
fathered by Dr. Harmon.

311
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,097
Tate?

312
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,600
Tate, honey, it's Mama.

313
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,935
I have to talk to you.

314
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,770
Tate?

315
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:16,838
Tate...?

316
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,573
So talk.
(gasps) Oh!

317
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,608
Oh, God.

318
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,410
Tell me it isn't true,

319
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:25,046
what I've been hearing about you.

320
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:26,481
About what?

321
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,615
Your behavior.

322
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,652
God, after all the missteps,

323
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,954
we finally have somebody in this house

324
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:36,190
that maybe can help you.

325
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:42,695
Tell me you did not crawl
on top of that man's wife.

326
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,833
Oh...

327
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,302
Mama... Mama, you can't
tell Violet, okay?

328
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,537
Please don't...

329
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,706
What is wrong with you, for God sakes?

330
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,875
What's wrong with you?
Mama!

331
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,177
Don't you realize what you've done?

332
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:01,679
(sobbing):
Mama...!

333
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:11,989
Come play, Ben.

334
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,558
Come, Ben...

335
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:16,393
(echoing):
Please...?

336
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,132
(moaning, kissing)

337
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:25,501
Oh, Ben...

338
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,910
(moaning, gasping)

339
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,183
Get out.

340
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,819
Elizabeth, put your
clothes on and leave.

341
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm sorry, but I can't
treat you anymore.

342
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,992
You're not really gonna
turn this down, are you?

343
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,960
And you're fired.

344
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:52,329
Sue me if you need to.

345
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,231
Make your last chore to show her out.

346
00:16:58,503 --> 00:16:59,937
You said this would work.

347
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,839
You said this is what he wanted.

348
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,040
She's using you, honey.

349
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:12,750
(sobs)

350
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,187
My dreams will never come true.

351
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,588
Your dreams?

352
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,692
I know it sounds terribly selfish,

353
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,426
but I must become famous.

354
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:27,764
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

355
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,365
Honey, don't you know who you are?

356
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,834
I'm Elizabeth Short.

357
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,536
You really don't know, do you?

358
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,711
(grunting)

359
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:43,148
(gas hissing)

360
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,395
(quietly):
God, you're beautiful.

361
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:01,498
Now, let's look at those teeth.

362
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,968
(drill whirring)

363
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:08,070
Beth?

364
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:12,408
Beth...

365
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:14,177
Oh, God!

366
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,112
(sobs)

367
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:27,090
Who are you?

368
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,691
My name is Charles Montgomery.

369
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,227
I am quite a renowned surgeon.

370
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,261
I'm here to help you.

371
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,597
(inhales deeply)

372
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,369
(inhales)

373
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,312
(humming a tune)

374
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,814
(inhales)

375
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,487
(singing quietly)

376
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:58,422
What have you done?

377
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:00,691
I've bisected her body,

378
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,328
removed the intestines
and drained her blood.

379
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:06,064
Why?
A writer writes, a surgeon cuts.

380
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:09,301
I think you will find
these pieces more portable.

381
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,036
What are you doing now?

382
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,072
She seemed so sad.

383
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,509
I've decided to give her a smile
that will last forever.

384
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,814
<i>That's how they found me--</i>

385
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:24,417
naked, on display for
the whole world to see.

386
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,554
You were the front-page news of
every paper for two months.

387
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,528
I really did become somebody.

388
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,732
She's been extremely agitated,

389
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,701
and the paranoia hasn't abated.

390
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,938
I'm sure the doctor will change
up the meds when he gets here,

391
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:46,108
but, in the meantime, we've
had to keep her restrained.

392
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,709
Restrained?

393
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:50,512
She attacked one of the orderlies.

394
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,215
He suggested that this
rapist in a rubber suit

395
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,684
was some kind of sexual fantasy.

396
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,854
Vivien...

397
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,288
you have a visitor.

398
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,468
(sighs deeply)

399
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:17,105
I know you can't carry on
a conversation right now.

400
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,273
That's okay.

401
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,209
I know what you're thinking.

402
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:22,211
You're thinking, "Thank God he's here."

403
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,714
"Thank God he can see
what they're doing to me,

404
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,282
"and how wrong it is.

405
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,386
And thank God he's a shrink,
so he can get me out of here."

406
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:31,854
You're right.

407
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:36,758
You're in hell here.

408
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:38,527
This is no place for my wife.

409
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,329
And I'd move heaven and earth

410
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:42,965
for the Vivien I thought
I was married to.

411
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,234
But you aren't her.

412
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:48,069
You're a stranger to me.

413
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,640
You actually pretended,

414
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,043
maybe even believed, like a sociopath,

415
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:58,079
that you were some kind of
holy saint without sin

416
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:00,349
while you shit all over me...

417
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:03,185
our life...

418
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,720
and our family

419
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:08,257
with betrayal and lies.

420
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,994
The way I feel right now,

421
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,664
I wouldn't lift a finger
to help you get out of here.

422
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,037
God, I miss college.

423
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,353
Enjoy it before real life
knocks you on your ass.

424
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:40,252
Do you want to talk about it?

425
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,209
Nope. I don't.

426
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:46,463
I miss beer.

427
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:48,331
Vivien hates it when I drink.

428
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:49,198
Especially beer.

429
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,800
I like beer.

430
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:52,835
("Spooky" playing)
Mm! There you go!

431
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,764
Can I confess something to you?

432
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:58,874
Hmm! I think the smart answer
would have to be no.

433
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:03,078
I'm not really confused about
interpersonal aggression.

434
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:04,379
You're not?
Uh-uh.

435
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:07,015
That's a shame, because
I could tell you a lot

436
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,184
about interpersonal aggression.

437
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:12,453
My marriage, for one thing.

438
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,588
Not in a happy place right now.

439
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:18,026
See? You do want
to talk about it.

440
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:20,529
I don't. I just want to--
I just want to drink

441
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,399
and get drunk and stumble
home on the T.

442
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:31,374
The thing is, Dr. Harmon--

443
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:33,109
I have a crush on you.

444
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:38,681
That's a bad move.

445
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:40,116
Seriously. I mean...

446
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:43,419
You're going to have
so many men in your life.

447
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,087
What does that mean?

448
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,422
It means you're a knockout.

449
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,991
You're smart as hell.
Is hell smart?

450
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,359
(chuckles)

451
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:53,427
Oh, oh, listen to this guitar solo.

452
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:55,329
I mean, it's-it's incredible.

453
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:58,100
(electric guitar solo)

454
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,268
(chuckles)

455
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:07,343
It was written in the stars.

456
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,147
And I was meant to take your class

457
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:13,717
right at the moment
your marriage imploded.

458
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,219
You needed me, Ben.

459
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,421
I did.

460
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,123
I did need you.

461
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,526
But I shouldn't have crossed the line.

462
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,527
Ben...
I abused my authority.

463
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:29,334
I was a consenting adult.

464
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,401
I still am.

465
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,104
Hayden, please, listen to me.

466
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:35,673
My marriage was a mess when we met.

467
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,344
And now? It's even worse, Ben.

468
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:41,513
You're right, it's bad.

469
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,950
It's really bad.
But here's the thing, Hayden--

470
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:47,086
and I hope you understand this--

471
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:49,990
we weren't written in the stars.

472
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,192
We're not meant to be together.

473
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,995
Not then, not now,

474
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:56,263
not six months from now.
Ben...

475
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,766
I was lonely, I was
heartbroken and I used you.

476
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,868
It was unforgivable.
I'm sorry.

477
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:05,003
But no matter what
happens with my wife,

478
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:07,005
I can't be with you.

479
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,142
I don't love you, Hayden.

480
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,844
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,880
I never did.

482
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:19,117
You don't love me?

483
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,654
You don't love me.

484
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,324
Okay.

485
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:31,296
Could I have a hug?

486
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,198
Of course.

487
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:48,313
Hayden, come on.
It's over.

488
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,381
You can't just hang around here.

489
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,617
I'm not just hanging around here.

490
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,218
I came for a reason.

491
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,357
When it concerns your family,
you have a right to know.

492
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:01,125
What are you talking about?

493
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:05,430
Vivien and that black guy--
you know, in the uniform.

494
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:08,265
I came around here the other
morning and he was leaving.

495
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,601
Who knows how long it's been going on?

496
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:12,904
Just thought you should know.

497
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,776
CONSTANCE:
Travis.

498
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:20,578
I need to talk to you, honey.

499
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,447
You mean yell at me some more?

500
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:23,948
On the contrary.

501
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,751
I want to apologize
for my earlier manners.

502
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,787
It was unnecessarily cruel.

503
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:31,756
Well, you've been going through
a lot of stuff lately, so...

504
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:37,195
It's true, I have.
But so have you. Here by my side.

505
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:43,569
Oh, and don't think it hasn't
gone unnoticed or unappreciated.

506
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:45,604
(chuckling)

507
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:50,677
You know, in many ways,
you are a fine man, Travis.

508
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,648
Sit down, baby.
I want to ask you something.

509
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:58,418
Okay.

510
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:03,256
What do you want to ask me?

511
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,926
Will you marry me?

512
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:09,296
(laughing)
Marry you?!

513
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:11,998
Listen to me, there's
going to be a child

514
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,701
and I want to bring that
child into this home

515
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:16,803
and raise it as my own.

516
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,738
What child?

517
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:22,809
Our child-- or it could be.

518
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:24,344
We could be a family.

519
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,814
I won't make the same mistakes
that I made the last time.

520
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:31,785
And you would be a wonderful father.

521
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:34,789
Father, whoa. Um...

522
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:37,392
I'm not ready to be a father.
Oh, but you are.

523
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:42,064
I've seen how you were with Addie,
and with the dogs.

524
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:44,233
With Addie and the dogs, it's...

525
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,135
Okay...

526
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,104
What about my career?
Your what?

527
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,973
My career, you know.

528
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,841
Maybe-- I don't know,
maybe we should wait

529
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,610
and let me get myself established

530
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,679
and then we could do whatever, you know?
What career?

531
00:26:56,747 --> 00:27:02,151
What? This dream you have
of-- of appearing half naked

532
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:05,054
in your skivvies 60 feet
high above Times Square?

533
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:07,622
I don't know why
that's so funny to you.

534
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,427
I know that dream.
I had that dream!

535
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,429
I was going to be a big star,

536
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:16,766
and, baby, if it didn't happen for me,

537
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,001
it is not going to happen for you.

538
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,471
Why are you being so mean?

539
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,074
I am being honest.
No, you're being mean.

540
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:29,346
A lean torso in this town
is a dime a dozen, baby,

541
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,448
and that's all you've got.

542
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,583
I'm offering reality,

543
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,487
community property,
a chance to be somebody.

544
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,456
A father.

545
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,758
I mean, look at you. What are you now?
You're nothing.

546
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:46,362
No, I am something, and just
because you say that I'm not

547
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,230
going to make it, doesn't mean it's true!
Oh!

548
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,466
Doesn't mean it's true.
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

549
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:54,837
God, how could I have ever
thought you could be a father?

550
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:58,508
You are not even a man.

551
00:27:58,575 --> 00:27:59,976
Oh, come on...

552
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,645
Don't you dare!

553
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,714
You'd better be careful.
You know why?

554
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:08,620
Because the last man who thought
that he could strike me...

555
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:14,859
...came to a very unpleasant
end, and he was a man.

556
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,272
(groans)
She said that I wasn't a man.

557
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,242
She said I'd never be famous.

558
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,444
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

559
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,979
(panting)

560
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,053
Feel better?

561
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,389
Yeah.

562
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,924
I don't.

563
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:50,028
He said we weren't
meant to be together.

564
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,463
We were meant to be.

565
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,432
Let's go again.

566
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,101
What are you doing?

567
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,270
I totally thought you came.
No.

568
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,639
Really?

569
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:05,544
Look, uh, would you mind
finishing yourself?

570
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,146
I really got to go.

571
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,448
- I mean, I can't leave it like this
with Constance. - You're kidding me.

572
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,050
I thought you said you hated her.

573
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,353
I guess I love her.

574
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,588
And we got a baby coming.

575
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,423
A baby what, fossil?
I don't know.

576
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,192
I guess we're going to adopt.

577
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,094
After all that shit she said to you?

578
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,830
I'm going to come back, I promise.

579
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,769
Can I at least get a hug?
Yeah.

580
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:33,110
I had a really good time.

581
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,176
(squishing thud)

582
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,013
Shit! (groans)

583
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,119
(yelling)
(groans)

584
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,990
(panting)

585
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,830
I had a really great time, too.

586
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:08,731
Oh, shit, now what am I going
to do with you?

587
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:12,696
Whoa, Constance was right.

588
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:15,934
Now I'm never going to be famous.

589
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:18,536
That's not necessarily true.

590
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:21,306
In fact, now you might
even have a better chance.

591
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,875
The only one who's going to be
famous out of this is Ben

592
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:25,310
when they find the body down here.

593
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:27,479
They'll send him to prison.

594
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:30,359
Or he'll move out.
Goddamn it.

595
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,984
Who's to say the body
has to be found here?

596
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,787
What, are you going to drag
him out of here, Casper?

597
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,956
Well, if you know someone who might,

598
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:40,626
I could certainly make it easier.

599
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:43,061
There is someone who owes me a favor.

600
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:02,012
Shit.

601
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,647
Holy shit.

602
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:05,916
Yo, yo! Yo, come over here!

603
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,390
What?

604
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,459
Holy shit.

605
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,428
Holy shit. Yo!

606
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:43,455
(sighs)

607
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,162
(knocking)
Knock, knock.

608
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,264
My dear--

609
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:53,934
look at you.

610
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:56,804
Even this hideous place

611
00:31:56,872 --> 00:32:00,241
can't dim
your charming girlish spirit.

612
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,643
Hello, Constance.
What a surprise.

613
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,746
Well, I hope it is a good one.

614
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,450
You know, I've been
thinking about you so much

615
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:11,987
and about this ordeal
that you've been through.

616
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:14,656
And being pregnant on top
of everything else.

617
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,425
My goodness, that poor baby.

618
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:19,227
Babies, it's twins.

619
00:32:19,295 --> 00:32:22,164
Oh, of course.
Babies.

620
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,902
And is everything all right
with the babies?

621
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,971
They're growing very fast.

622
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,108
You can't believe how much food
I've been consuming.

623
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,810
Even in here, I'm just ravenous.

624
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:34,778
That's a good thing.

625
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:36,280
Oh, Vivien, Vivien,

626
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:42,719
I want you to know that I
intend to be there for you.

627
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:45,856
Whatever help you need.

628
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,525
I mean, babies are my thing.
I have a special gift.

629
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,560
And I've been a
single mother, I mean...

630
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:55,631
I know how we tell ourselves
that we don't need a man.

631
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,133
We can do it alone.
But the secret, Vivien?

632
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,437
The secret is community.

633
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,039
Sisterhood.

634
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:07,277
Constance, I don't want to
be rude or seem ungrateful,

635
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:09,413
I'm just so tired, and I just...

636
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,114
Probably from the meds.
I need to nap.

637
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:12,649
Of course, honey.

638
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:14,919
Oh, I'll just disappear...

639
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:16,720
Vivien, you know,

640
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,692
I know the pain of being doubted
by everyone around you.

641
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:26,698
It ravages the soul.

642
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,472
Well, those are for you.

643
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,875
Thank you.

644
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:39,079
I-I think I might stop by
at Sweet Lady Jane's,

645
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:42,282
and pick up some pastry for
that sweet little Violet.

646
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,383
Constance.

647
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:49,656
I was raped.

648
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,862
I didn't hallucinate any of it.

649
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,233
Well, of course not.

650
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,234
Oh, honey, I never
doubted it for a minute.

651
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,069
Please don't tell
anybody that I told you,

652
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,672
because I need for them to think
that I'm coming to my senses

653
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,674
so that I can get out of here.

654
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:09,576
Of course.

655
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:14,281
You poor thing.

656
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:16,683
What you've been through...

657
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:18,618
(alarm ringing)

658
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:28,328
(alarm shuts off)

659
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:31,298
You didn't have to
trigger the alarm system

660
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:33,533
to get me over here.

661
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:36,503
I've been wracking my brains,
trying to figure it out.

662
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:38,839
I gotta hand it to you both.

663
00:34:38,906 --> 00:34:41,074
It was a terrific cover.

664
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm lost here.

665
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:47,014
Where'd you meet her?
At Whole Foods? At the gym?

666
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:49,116
I installed your
security system, remember?

667
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:52,286
We moved here in early fall.

668
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:53,654
You met Vivien...

669
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:55,923
whenever.

670
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:58,359
Started having an affair.

671
00:34:58,427 --> 00:34:59,894
Got her pregnant.
What?

672
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:01,128
She's having twins.

673
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:02,897
And only one of them is mine.

674
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:04,899
(chuckles)

675
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,901
Ah, okay.

676
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:10,671
So I guess the other one must be mine.

677
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,406
Look...

678
00:35:12,474 --> 00:35:15,075
I'm not asking you for child support.

679
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:17,112
In fact, you're not even
gonna see this baby.

680
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:20,415
I just want to hear it
from you, man to man...

681
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:22,451
All right.

682
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:23,785
Man to man.

683
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:26,322
Hear this, Ben.

684
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,360
If that was my baby,
you couldn't keep me away.

685
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,796
But the sad fact is, is
that I'm shooting blanks.

686
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,732
You can ask my ex-wife.

687
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
We tried for five years.

688
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,635
All it takes is one good swimmer.

689
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:41,072
Look... I don't know
Vivien that well.

690
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,275
But clearly she has
been a very busy girl.

691
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,478
Hey, don't talk about
my wife like that.

692
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,845
You don't know her.
And you do?

693
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:53,018
You called her a whore and a liar.

694
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,787
That was just in
the last five minutes.

695
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:57,589
Your own wife...

696
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,958
You locked her away, Ben.

697
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,696
You know what?

698
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:08,632
Maybe it's good.

699
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,767
Maybe she's safer there.

700
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,715
MOIRA:
Kinky.

701
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:28,351
You want me to try that on?

702
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,353
Looks like you went to
a lot of trouble to find it.

703
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,255
What do you know about this?

704
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,491
I know I get wet just thinking about

705
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:36,493
sliding that rubber on my body.

706
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,096
Stop it. Stop your bullshit
and listen to me.

707
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,499
You're in this house all
the time. You see everything.

708
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,733
What happened with Vivien?

709
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,102
Why do you care?
You're a man.

710
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,604
Isn't this what all men want?

711
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,741
The freedom to satiate
their needs, guilt-free?

712
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,042
Just tell me the truth.

713
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,613
I think I made a horrible mistake

714
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,049
by putting Vivien in the hospital.

715
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,818
She was attacked by someone.

716
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,891
Congratulations, Dr. Harmon.

717
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,437
You're finally beginning
to see things as they are.

718
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,983
I think we're gonna get
a pickup on my Lifetime pilot.

719
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,620
And as soon as we do, I want
to bring you on as my guest.

720
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,158
I can't focus on your...

721
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,560
career right now.

722
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:46,864
I may be looking at a rather
earth-shattering situation.

723
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,568
Could we be talking menopause baby...?

724
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,069
Why am I seeing baby pictures?

725
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,971
Tell me...

726
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:01,546
What happens when a human...

727
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:04,215
copulates with someone
from the spirit world?

728
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,118
Spirits aren't known
for their potency.

729
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:10,021
Yes, but...

730
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:14,125
what if there is,
in fact, a conception?

731
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:17,028
You do know about the box.

732
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:20,632
The Pope's box?

733
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,333
What the hell are you talking about?

734
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:27,571
When a new Pope has been chosen...

735
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,641
and the bells of
St. Peter's chime...

736
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:34,411
<i>...he is shown into</i>
<i>a small chamber</i>

737
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,814
<i>next to the Sistine Chapel.</i>

738
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,350
They call it <i>the Room of Tears,</i>

739
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:42,987
<i>named for the sublime mixture</i>
<i>of joy and sorrow</i>

740
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,757
<i>that he must contemplate</i>
<i>at this moment.</i>

741
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,927
<i>He is brought a key to this box.</i>

742
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:54,033
<i>It has been said that this box</i>
<i>contains the ultimate secret.</i>

743
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,169
<i>It holds the secret</i>

744
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,837
<i>of the end of the world.</i>

745
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,774
Well, for Christ's sakes, Billie Dean,

746
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,275
the cameras aren't rolling in here.

747
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:03,776
Will you just cut to the chase?

748
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:06,646
This piece of paper
reveals the precise nature

749
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:08,547
of the Anti-Christ.

750
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:14,085
"A child born of human and spirit

751
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:16,186
will usher in the end of times."

752
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,860
It is the essence of evil.

753
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,829
A perversion of
the Immaculate Conception.

754
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,332
What are you talking about?

755
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,100
Oh, come on, honey.

756
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,037
The Holy Ghost merely whispered
in the Virgin Mary's ear

757
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,572
and she begat the son of God.

758
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:41,651
If the devil's going to use
a human womb for his spawn,

759
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:45,048
he's going to want a little
more bang for his buck.

760
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:52,176
