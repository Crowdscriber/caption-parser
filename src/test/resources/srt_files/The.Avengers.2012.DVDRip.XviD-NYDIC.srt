1
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,095
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

2
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,655
It is on a little world, a human world.

3
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,538
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:46,339
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

5
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:50,779
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

6
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:56,180
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

7
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:00,017
<i>A world will be his.</i>

8
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:03,214
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

9
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:09,054
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

10
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,738
<i>All personnel,</i>

11
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:26,098
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

12
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,104
How bad is it?

13
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:01,456
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

14
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,703
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

15
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:09,622
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

16
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,895
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

17
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:13,060
Spontaneous event.

18
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,294
It just turned itself on?

19
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:15,495
Where are the energy levels now?

20
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,776
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

21
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:19,135
How long to get everyone out?

22
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:20,620
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

23
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,020
Do better.

24
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:24,823
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

25
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:26,345
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

26
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,662
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

27
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,096
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

28
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,215
I need you to make sure

29
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:33,939
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

30
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:36,063
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

31
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,905
Until such time as the world ends,

32
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,983
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

33
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,226
Clear out the tech below.

34
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,816
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

35
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,062
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,582
With me.

37
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,502
Talk to me, Doctor.

38
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:54,547
Director.

39
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:56,340
Is there anything we know for certain?

40
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:58,698
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

41
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:01,581
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

42
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:05,144
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

43
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:06,303
I assume you pulled the plug.

44
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:08,146
She's an energy source.

45
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:11,260
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

46
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:12,503
If she reaches peak level...

47
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,985
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

48
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,508
But we don't have the harness.

49
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:18,857
My calculations are far from complete.

50
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,823
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

51
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:23,667
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

52
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,301
That can be harmful.

53
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,862
Where's Agent Barton?

54
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,667
The Hawk?

55
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,466
Up in his nest, as usual.

56
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,588
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

57
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,545
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

58
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,183
<i>so you could keep
a close eye on things.</i>

59
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,709
Well, I see better from a distance.

60
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,787
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

61
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,266
Doctor, it's spiking again.

62
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,789
No one's come or gone.

63
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,548
And Selvig's clean.

64
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,945
No contacts, no IMs.

65
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,149
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

66
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:56,310
"At this end"?

67
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:00,186
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

68
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,179
Doors open from both sides.

69
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,185
Not yet.

70
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:13,307
Sir, please put down the spear.

71
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,152
You have heart.

72
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,911
Please don't.

73
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:25,787
I still need that.

74
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,398
This doesn't have to get any messier.

75
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:28,748
Of course it does.

76
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,756
I've come too far for anything else.

77
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,312
I am Loki, of Asgard

78
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,274
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

79
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,832
Loki,

80
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,547
brother of Thor.

81
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,114
We have no quarrel with your people.

82
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,153
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

83
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,312
Are you planning to step on us?

84
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,598
I come with glad tidings

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,631
of a world made free.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,955
Free from what?

87
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,434
Freedom.

88
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,474
Freedom is life's great lie.

89
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,956
Once you accept that, in your heart,

90
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,078
you will know peace.

91
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,716
Yeah, you say "peace,"

92
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,673
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

93
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,270
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

94
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,755
This place is about to blow

95
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,519
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

96
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:23,950
He means to bury us.

97
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,230
Like the pharaohs of old.

98
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,319
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

99
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,638
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

100
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:30,957
Well, then.

101
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,118
I need these vehicles.

102
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:53,079
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

103
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:57,357
<i>Hill!</i>

104
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:58,991
Do you copy?

105
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:00,957
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

106
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:16,203
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

107
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,242
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

108
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,083
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

109
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,566
<i>Director?</i>

110
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:42,325
Director Fury, do you copy?

111
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,727
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

112
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,281
I have men down. Hill?

113
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,409
A lot of men still under.

114
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,250
I don't know how many survivors.

115
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,567
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

116
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,410
I want every living soul
not working rescue

117
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:55,487
looking for that briefcase.

118
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:56,681
Roger that.

119
00:10:56,892 --> 00:11:00,044
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

120
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,606
<i>As of right now,</i>

121
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,212
we are at war.

122
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:07,081
What do we do?

123
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:46,004
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

124
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,693
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

125
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:48,930
Believe me

126
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:50,044
this is better.

127
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,772
Who are you working for?

128
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,648
Lermentov, yes?

129
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:57,934
Does he think

130
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:00,254
we have to go through him

131
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:01,935
to move our cargo?

132
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:07,493
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

133
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,693
Solohob

134
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,852
a bagman, a front.

135
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:18,210
Your outdated information betrays you.

136
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,376
The famous Black Widow

137
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:28,175
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

138
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:32,054
You really think I'm pretty?

139
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:36,647
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

140
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:40,374
to move the tanks.

141
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,812
Tell him he is out.

142
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:45,776
Well...

143
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:50,210
...you may have to write it down.

144
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,218
It's for her.

145
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:04,767
You listen carefully

146
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,367
<i>You're at 1- 14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

147
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,655
<i>We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.</i>

148
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,376
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

149
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,535
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

150
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,776
<i>- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working.</i>

151
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,208
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

152
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,978
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

153
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,858
This moron is giving me everything.

154
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,774
I don't give everything.

155
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,459
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

156
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,535
<i>Natasha...</i>

157
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:37,494
Barton's been compromised.

158
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:42,333
Let me put you on hold.

159
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:23,338
Where is Barton now?

160
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:24,936
<i>- We don't know.
- But he's alive?</i>

161
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:27,816
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

162
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:30,019
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

163
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:33,181
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

164
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:36,740
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

165
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,420
Who are you?

166
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:02,900
Get out!

167
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,414
There is sickness here!

168
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:06,500
You're a doctor.

169
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,373
My father's not waking up!

170
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,257
He has a fever and he's moaning

171
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,420
but his eyes won't open.

172
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,501
Slow down.

173
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:16,021
My father...

174
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,261
Like them?

175
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,300
Please.

176
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,583
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

177
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,016
You know, for a man

178
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:55,376
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

179
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,705
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

180
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:02,504
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

181
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,097
Then what is it? Yoga?

182
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:09,265
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

183
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:13,708
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

184
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:15,468
Just you and me.

185
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,625
And your actress buddy?

186
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:20,706
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

187
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,303
I did.

188
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:23,498
Who are you?

189
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,778
Natasha Romanoff.

190
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,263
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

191
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:32,064
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

192
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,625
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

193
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,743
S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,425
How did they find me?

195
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,148
We never lost you, Doctor.

196
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,305
We've kept our distance.

197
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,228
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

198
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,379
off your scent.

199
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,825
Why?

200
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,226
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

201
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,989
But now we need you to come in.

202
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,708
What if I say no?

203
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,947
I'll persuade you.

204
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:03,143
And what if the other guy says no?

205
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,389
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

206
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,059
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

207
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,706
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

208
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,828
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

209
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:19,624
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

210
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,908
This

211
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:24,387
is the Tesseract.

212
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:27,265
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

213
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:32,063
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

214
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:34,628
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

215
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:39,426
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

216
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:42,431
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

217
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,306
If there was, that's where I'd be.

218
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:47,943
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

219
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:49,348
Not that he's told me.

220
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:51,624
And he tells you everything?

221
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,593
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

222
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:54,703
He needs me in a cage?

223
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:55,789
No one's going to put you in a...

224
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:56,909
Stop lying to me!

225
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,468
I'm sorry. That was mean.

226
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,464
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

227
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,468
Why don't we do this the easy way

228
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:11,869
where you don't use that

229
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:15,829
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

230
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,823
Okay?

231
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,069
Natasha?

232
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:26,504
Stand down.

233
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:28,915
<i>We're good here.</i>

234
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,155
"Just you and me."

235
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,704
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

236
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,225
<i>You're dealing
with forces you can't control.</i>

237
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:42,946
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

238
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,829
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

239
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:49,268
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

240
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:51,911
Not Asgard. Loki.

241
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,790
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

242
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:55,906
<i>His brother.</i>

243
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:57,993
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

244
00:18:58,197 --> 00:18:59,152
but he's worlds away.

245
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,035
We can't depend on him to help, either.

246
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,112
It's up to us.

247
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:04,751
<i>Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

248
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,145
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

249
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:09,395
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

250
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,117
We need a response team.

251
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,513
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

252
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,436
This isn't about the Avengers.

253
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:16,707
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

254
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:19,034
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network</i>

255
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,716
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

256
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:22,072
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

257
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:24,029
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

258
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,355
We need a response team.

259
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,193
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

260
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:33,392
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

261
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,907
<i>You believe?</i>

262
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,555
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

263
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:42,436
No, it's won by soldiers.

264
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,998
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

265
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,679
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

266
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,830
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

267
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,834
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

268
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,396
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

269
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:39,834
Trouble sleeping?

270
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,683
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

271
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:48,917
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

272
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:57,242
When I went under,
the world was at war.

273
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:59,195
I wake up, they say we won.

274
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,362
They didn't say what we lost.

275
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:04,154
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

276
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,156
Some, very recently.

277
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:08,793
Are you here with a mission, sir?

278
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:09,879
I am.

279
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,596
Trying to get me back in the world?

280
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,676
Trying to save it.

281
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:20,075
HYDRA's secret weapon.

282
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,275
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

283
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:23,474
when he was looking for you.

284
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:25,597
He thought what we think.

285
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:29,804
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

286
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,920
That's something
the world sorely needs.

287
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,480
Who took it from you?

288
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,038
He's called Loki.

289
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:40,759
He's not from around here.

290
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:43,197
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

291
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:44,475
if you're in.

292
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:47,322
The world has gotten even stranger

293
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:48,481
than you already know.

294
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:51,434
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

295
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,638
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

296
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:56,645
There's a debriefing packet

297
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:59,041
waiting for you back at your apartment.

298
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:03,158
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

299
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,436
that we ought to know now?

300
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,922
You should have left it in the ocean.

301
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:41,082
<i>Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.</i>

302
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,563
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

303
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:43,644
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

304
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,839
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

305
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:47,408
of self-sustaining clean energy.

306
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:49,485
<i>Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over</i>

307
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:50,758
<i>and it actually works.</i>

308
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:52,357
<i>I assume.</i>

309
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:53,804
Light her up.

310
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,085
<i>How does it look?</i>

311
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,810
Like Christmas, but with more me.

312
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,682
<i>We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.</i>

313
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,879
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

314
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,445
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

315
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,043
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

316
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,326
<i>Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?</i>

317
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,519
<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>

318
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,845
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

319
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,849
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.</i>

320
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:21,366
<i>I'm not in.</i>

321
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,239
I'm actually out.

322
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:32,685
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

323
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,530
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

324
00:23:39,892 --> 00:23:42,725
Levels are holding steady, I think.

325
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:45,002
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

326
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:46,327
Which brings me to my next question.

327
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,369
How does it feel to be a genius?

328
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:50,722
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

329
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:55,244
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

330
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:58,923
No, all this came from that.

331
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,328
Give yourself some credit. Please.

332
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:03,251
Stark Tower is your baby.

333
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:05,728
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

334
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:07,242
12%?

335
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,442
An argument can be made for 15.

336
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,086
12%? My baby?

337
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:11,806
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

338
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,730
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

339
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,123
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

340
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:17,652
That was on you.

341
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,805
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

342
00:24:20,014 --> 00:24:22,574
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

343
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:25,004
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

344
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,091
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

345
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:28,683
It's not going to be that subtle.

346
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,122
I'll tell you what.

347
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,689
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

348
00:24:32,894 --> 00:24:34,213
On the lease.

349
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:37,130
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

350
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:38,529
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

351
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:41,010
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

352
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:43,092
<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>

353
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,605
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

354
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,732
<i>- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.</i>

355
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:49,653
Then leave it urgently.

356
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,204
Security breach. It's on you.

357
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:55,009
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

358
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,130
"Phil"?

359
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,245
I can't stay.

360
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,605
His first name is "Agent."

361
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:00,374
Come on in. We're celebrating.

362
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,294
Which is why he can't stay.

363
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:04,373
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

364
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:05,565
I don't like being handed things.

365
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:07,175
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

366
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:08,650
So, let's trade.

367
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,409
Thank you.

368
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,692
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

369
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:15,771
every other Thursday.

370
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:16,892
This isn't a consultation.

371
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,211
Is this about the Avengers?

372
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,369
Which I know nothing about.

373
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:23,011
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

374
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,536
And I didn't even qualify.

375
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:25,692
I didn't know that either.

376
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,610
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

377
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,931
don't play well with others.

378
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:31,172
That I did know.

379
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,855
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

380
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:35,247
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

381
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:36,413
Half a mo.

382
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,728
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

383
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:45,451
I was having 12% of a moment.

384
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:48,973
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

385
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,055
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

386
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,930
What is all this?

387
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:54,617
This is

388
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:56,254
this.

389
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,618
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

390
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:05,728
Tomorrow.

391
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:08,054
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

392
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:09,897
Well, what if I didn't?

393
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:11,818
- Lf you didn't?
- Yeah.

394
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,089
You mean when you've finished?

395
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,291
Well, then...

396
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,528
Square deal. Fly safe.

397
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,649
Work hard.

398
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,093
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

399
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,940
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

400
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:38,016
I want to hear

401
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:39,733
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

402
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:41,010
She moved back to Portland.

403
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:44,213
What? Boo!

404
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:54,251
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

405
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:01,337
So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

406
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,021
A lot of people were.

407
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,780
You were the world's first superhero.

408
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:08,056
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

409
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,496
Erskine's original formula.

410
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:11,821
Didn't really go his way, did it?

411
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:13,622
Not so much.

412
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,542
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

413
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,937
He's like a smart person.

414
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:24,052
I gotta say,

415
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,692
it's an honour to meet you officially.

416
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:28,856
I've sort of met you. I mean,

417
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,741
I watched you while you were sleeping.

418
00:27:32,504 --> 00:27:34,620
I mean, I was present

419
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:37,975
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

420
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:40,379
You know, it's really just a huge honour

421
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:42,381
to have you on board this...

422
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,541
I hope I'm the man for the job.

423
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:47,497
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

424
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:50,457
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

425
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:52,098
I had a little design input.

426
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:53,499
The uniform?

427
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,094
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

428
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:58,499
old-fashioned?

429
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,375
With everything that's happening

430
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:03,143
and the things that are about
to come to light,

431
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:07,295
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

432
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,340
The Chitauri grow restless.

433
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:43,185
Let them gird themselves.

434
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,025
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

435
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:46,342
Battle?

436
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:50,105
Against the meagre might of Earth?

437
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,027
Glorious, not lengthy.

438
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:56,857
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

439
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,457
You question us?

440
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:01,704
You question him,

441
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:04,223
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

442
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:07,226
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

443
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:10,182
when you were cast out, defeated?

444
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:12,186
I was a king!

445
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,505
The rightful king of Asgard,

446
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:15,944
betrayed.

447
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,103
Your ambition is little

448
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,948
and born of childish need.

449
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:24,060
We look beyond the Earth

450
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,102
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

451
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,902
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

452
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,545
I don't threaten.

453
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,498
But until I open the doors,

454
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,180
until your force is mine to command,

455
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,628
you are but words.

456
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,618
You will have your war, Asgardian.

457
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,262
If you fail,

458
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:55,429
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

459
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:59,829
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

460
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,182
no crevice where he cannot find you.

461
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:07,350
You think you know pain?

462
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:12,990
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

463
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:41,982
Stow the captain's gear.

464
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:43,068
Yes, sir.

465
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,546
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

466
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:48,982
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

467
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:50,109
They need you on the bridge.

468
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:51,667
They're starting the face-trace.

469
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:52,909
See you there.

470
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:58,553
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

471
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,302
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

472
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:04,267
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

473
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:05,623
Trading cards?

474
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,905
They're vintage. He's very proud.

475
00:31:09,595 --> 00:31:10,823
Dr Banner.

476
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:13,983
Yeah, hi.

477
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,664
They told me you would be coming.

478
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,103
Word is, you can find the Cube.

479
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,912
Is that the only word on me?

480
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:21,430
Only word I care about.

481
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,396
It must be strange for you, all of this.

482
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,636
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

483
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,304
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

484
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,155
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

485
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:37,835
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

486
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:43,669
Is this a submarine?

487
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,151
Really?

488
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:48,872
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

489
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,473
No, no, this is much worse.

490
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,674
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

491
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,189
Increase collective to 8.0%.

492
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,275
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

493
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,833
Increase output to capacity.

494
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,036
Power plant performing at capacity.

495
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,639
We are clear.

496
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,274
All engines operating.

497
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:08,918
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

498
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,595
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

499
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:12,916
Let's vanish.

500
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,430
Engage retro-reflection panels.

501
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:31,677
Reflection panels engaged.

502
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:33,601
Gentlemen.

503
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:46,512
Doctor, thank you for coming.

504
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,240
Thanks for asking nicely.

505
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,957
So, how long am I staying?

506
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:54,881
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

507
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,152
you're in the wind.

508
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,035
Where are you with that?

509
00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,915
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

510
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:00,998
camera on the planet.

511
00:34:01,564 --> 00:34:03,282
Cell phones, laptops...

512
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:06,955
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

513
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,358
That's still not gonna find them in time.

514
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:09,519
You have to narrow your field.

515
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:11,601
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

516
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,362
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

517
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,202
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

518
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:16,723
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

519
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,996
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

520
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:22,594
At least we could rule out a few places.

521
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,563
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

522
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:25,874
Agent Romanoff,

523
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:28,195
could you show Dr Banner
to his laboratory, please?

524
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,435
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

525
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:33,683
Put it over there.

526
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,641
Where did you find all these people?

527
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,679
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

528
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:42,161
Is this the stuff you need?

529
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:43,281
Yeah, iridium.

530
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,960
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

531
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,724
It's very hard to get hold of.

532
00:34:47,926 --> 00:34:49,405
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
Knows you need it.

533
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:50,925
Well, I didn't know.

534
00:34:51,126 --> 00:34:52,275
Hey!

535
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,681
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

536
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,957
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

537
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:58,041
I know.

538
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,678
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

539
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:02,960
My next target.

540
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:04,082
Tell me what you need.

541
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:09,199
I need a distraction.

542
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:11,440
And an eyeball.

543
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:20,362
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

544
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:21,557
No, no. It's fine.

545
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,001
It's a vintage set.

546
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,403
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

547
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:31,883
Near mint.

548
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,407
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

549
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:36,122
We got a hit. A 67% match.

550
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:38,166
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

551
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:40,084
Location?

552
00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:43,161
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 K�nigstrasse.

553
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:44,563
He's not exactly hiding.

554
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:45,838
Captain,

555
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:47,124
you're up.

556
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:17,366
Kneel before me.

557
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:22,885
I said

558
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:26,967
kneel!

559
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,129
Is not this simpler?

560
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,690
Is this not your natural state?

561
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:48,970
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

562
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:51,453
that you crave subjugation.

563
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:55,608
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

564
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:58,287
in a mad scramble for power,

565
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,378
for identity.

566
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:06,176
You were made to be ruled.

567
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,337
In the end,

568
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,774
you will always kneel.

569
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,737
Not to men like you.

570
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,571
There are no men like me.

571
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,173
There are always men like you.

572
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,172
Look to your elder, people.

573
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,654
Let him be an example.

574
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:41,649
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

575
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,898
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

576
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:46,500
we ended up disagreeing.

577
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,578
The soldier.

578
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:51,735
The man out of time.

579
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,496
I'm not the one who's out of time.

580
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:59,296
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

581
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:20,336
Kneel.

582
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:21,816
Not today!

583
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:25,051
The guy's all over the place.

584
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:30,653
<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>

585
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:48,695
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

586
00:40:56,425 --> 00:40:57,824
<i>Good move.</i>

587
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:00,493
Mr Stark.

588
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:02,260
<i>Captain.</i>

589
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:10,744
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

590
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,140
Not a word.

591
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,257
<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>

592
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,141
I don't like it.

593
00:41:18,506 --> 00:41:20,383
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

594
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:22,178
I don't remember it being that easy.

595
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,745
This guy packs a wallop.

596
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:27,382
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

597
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,900
What's your thing, Pilates?

598
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,022
What?

599
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:32,142
It's like calisthenics.

600
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:34,223
You might have missed
a couple of things

601
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:35,985
doing time as a Capsicle.

602
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,340
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

603
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:42,300
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

604
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,180
Where's this coming from?

605
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:50,576
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

606
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:53,183
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

607
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,384
What are you doing?

608
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:25,188
<i>And now there's that guy.</i>

609
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:27,061
Another Asgardian?

610
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:29,022
<i>- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.</i>

611
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,698
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

612
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,662
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

613
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,065
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

614
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,548
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

615
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,705
I don't see how I can.

616
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,425
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

617
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:49,099
There's only one God, ma'am.

618
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:51,506
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

619
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:07,671
Where is the Tesseract?

620
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:09,100
I missed you, too.

621
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:10,912
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

622
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:12,911
You should thank me.

623
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,308
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

624
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:18,151
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

625
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:19,671
to your precious Earth?

626
00:43:23,632 --> 00:43:24,860
I thought you dead.

627
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,786
Did you mourn?

628
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,951
We all did. Our father...

629
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:33,071
Your father.

630
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:37,626
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

631
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:42,223
We were raised together.

632
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,947
We played together,
we fought together.

633
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:46,583
Do you remember none of that?

634
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,671
I remember a shadow.

635
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:53,026
Living in the shade of your greatness.

636
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,228
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

637
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:58,265
I, who was, and should be, king!

638
00:43:58,474 --> 00:44:00,465
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

639
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:02,346
for your imagined slights?

640
00:44:02,554 --> 00:44:05,513
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

641
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:10,265
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

642
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,592
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

643
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,433
while you idly fret.

644
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,705
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

645
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,394
You think yourself above them?

646
00:44:19,435 --> 00:44:20,390
Well, yes.

647
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:22,950
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

648
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:25,075
A throne would suit you ill.

649
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:32,715
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

650
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:36,909
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

651
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:39,153
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

652
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,311
and when I wield it...

653
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:42,188
Who showed you this power?

654
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:44,591
Who controls the would-be king?

655
00:44:44,797 --> 00:44:46,515
- I am a king!
- Not here!

656
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,945
You give up the Tesseract!

657
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:50,511
You give up this poisonous dream!

658
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:54,436
You come home.

659
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,266
I don't have it.

660
00:45:02,277 --> 00:45:03,996
You need the Cube to bring me home.

661
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,348
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

662
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,190
You listen well, brother.

663
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:12,227
I'm listening.

664
00:45:20,998 --> 00:45:22,590
Do not touch me again.

665
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:24,312
Then don't take my stuff.

666
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,669
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

667
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:29,434
Shakespeare in the Park?

668
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:33,751
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

669
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:36,638
This is beyond you, metal man.

670
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,875
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

671
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,311
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

672
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,874
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

673
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,918
<i>Tourist.</i>

674
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,069
Okay.

675
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:24,440
Power at 400% capacity.

676
00:46:24,642 --> 00:46:26,121
How about that?

677
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:25,114
Hey!

678
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:28,714
That's enough.

679
00:47:32,445 --> 00:47:34,083
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

680
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,480
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

681
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:39,120
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

682
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,201
Yeah... No.

683
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:41,845
<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>

684
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,516
You want me to put the hammer down?

685
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,359
Are we done, here?

686
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,123
In case it's unclear,

687
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,528
if you try to escape,

688
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,765
if you so much as scratch that glass,

689
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:20,759
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

690
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,327
You get how that works?

691
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,805
Ant, boot.

692
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:32,683
It's an impressive cage.

693
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,086
Not built, I think, for me.

694
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,761
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

695
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:40,769
Oh, I've heard.

696
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:42,847
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

697
00:49:43,812 --> 00:49:45,370
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

698
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:48,562
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

699
00:49:48,772 --> 00:49:51,730
<i>that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?</i>

700
00:49:51,932 --> 00:49:54,162
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

701
00:49:54,372 --> 00:49:56,091
You threaten my world with war.

702
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,329
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

703
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:02,162
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

704
00:50:02,373 --> 00:50:05,251
You have made me very desperate.

705
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:07,284
You might not be glad that you did.

706
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:13,564
It burns you to have come so close.

707
00:50:14,974 --> 00:50:17,568
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

708
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:20,450
unlimited power.

709
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,531
And for what?

710
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:27,772
A warm light for all mankind to share.

711
00:50:28,014 --> 00:50:31,131
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

712
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:39,173
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

713
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:48,574
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

714
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,606
Loki's gonna drag this out.

715
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:54,126
So, Thor, what's his play?

716
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:56,770
He has an army called the Chitauri.

717
00:50:56,976 --> 00:50:59,774
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

718
00:51:00,176 --> 00:51:02,167
He means to lead them
against your people.

719
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:03,889
They will win him the Earth,

720
00:51:04,016 --> 00:51:05,734
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

721
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:07,608
An army

722
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,408
from outer space.

723
00:51:09,616 --> 00:51:11,925
So, he's building another portal.

724
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:13,411
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

725
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,492
Selvig?

726
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,887
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

727
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:19,133
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

728
00:51:19,297 --> 00:51:20,730
along with one of ours.

729
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:22,450
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

730
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:23,805
He's not leading an army from here.

731
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:25,655
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

732
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:27,575
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

733
00:51:27,697 --> 00:51:28,925
You could smell crazy on him.

734
00:51:29,137 --> 00:51:30,809
Have care how you speak.

735
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:33,454
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

736
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:34,893
And he is my brother.

737
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:36,895
He killed 80 people in two days.

738
00:51:37,738 --> 00:51:38,693
He's adopted.

739
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:41,053
I think it's about the mechanics.

740
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:43,135
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

741
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:44,293
It's a stabilising agent.

742
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,686
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

743
00:51:45,818 --> 00:51:47,297
I'll fly you to Portland.

744
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:48,977
Keep love alive.

745
00:51:49,178 --> 00:51:50,975
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

746
00:51:51,138 --> 00:51:52,891
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

747
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:56,250
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

748
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:58,609
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

749
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:01,128
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

750
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:03,935
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

751
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:06,728
<i>That man is playing Galaga.</i>

752
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:10,970
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

753
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,179
How does Fury even see these?

754
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,295
He turns.

755
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,138
Sounds exhausting.

756
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,295
The rest of the raw materials,

757
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,173
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

758
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,699
The only major component
he still needs

759
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,256
is a power source
of high-energy density.

760
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,577
Something to kick-start the Cube.

761
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,614
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

762
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:34,776
Last night.

763
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:38,333
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

764
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:39,496
Am I the only one who did the reading?

765
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:42,334
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

766
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,135
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

767
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:46,740
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

768
00:52:46,941 --> 00:52:49,057
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

769
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:50,331
the quantum tunnelling effect.

770
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,497
Well, if he could do that,

771
00:52:51,662 --> 00:52:54,017
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

772
00:52:54,222 --> 00:52:56,531
Finally, someone who speaks English.

773
00:52:56,742 --> 00:52:58,619
Is that what just happened?

774
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,733
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

775
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:03,854
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

776
00:53:04,062 --> 00:53:05,780
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

777
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,938
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

778
00:53:09,422 --> 00:53:10,412
Thanks.

779
00:53:10,623 --> 00:53:13,012
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

780
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,451
I was hoping you might join him.

781
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:15,778
I would start with that stick of his.

782
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,892
It may be magical,

783
00:53:17,023 --> 00:53:18,251
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

784
00:53:18,383 --> 00:53:21,295
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

785
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,255
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

786
00:53:23,463 --> 00:53:24,976
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

787
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:26,821
into his personal flying monkeys.

788
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:28,662
Monkeys? I do not understand.

789
00:53:28,783 --> 00:53:29,739
I do.

790
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:34,421
I understood that reference.

791
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:36,578
Shall we play, Doctor?

792
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:38,422
This way, sir.

793
00:53:51,825 --> 00:53:53,338
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

794
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:55,456
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

795
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:57,383
But it's going to take weeks to process.

796
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:58,734
If we bypass their mainframe

797
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:00,093
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

798
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:03,263
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

799
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:06,262
All I packed was a toothbrush.

800
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:08,819
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

801
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:10,982
Top ten floors, all R&D.

802
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:12,705
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

803
00:54:12,906 --> 00:54:15,295
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

804
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:17,940
I kind of broke Harlem.

805
00:54:18,146 --> 00:54:19,898
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

806
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:21,824
No tension, no surprises.

807
00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:24,699
- Hey!
- Nothing?

808
00:54:24,906 --> 00:54:25,861
Are you nuts?

809
00:54:25,986 --> 00:54:26,941
Jury's out.

810
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,136
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

811
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:29,222
What's your secret?

812
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:30,746
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

813
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:31,976
Is everything a joke to you?

814
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:33,222
Funny things are.

815
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:35,019
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

816
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,341
isn't funny.

817
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:37,422
No offence, Doc.

818
00:54:37,547 --> 00:54:38,980
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

819
00:54:39,107 --> 00:54:41,826
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

820
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:44,415
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

821
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,139
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

822
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:47,701
Do you think I'm not?

823
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:50,501
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

824
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:52,300
What isn't he telling us?

825
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:54,100
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

826
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,902
You think Fury's hiding something?

827
00:54:56,028 --> 00:54:59,065
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

828
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:00,860
His secrets have secrets.

829
00:55:00,988 --> 00:55:02,421
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

830
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:06,627
I just want to finish my work here, and...

831
00:55:06,749 --> 00:55:07,704
Doctor?

832
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,184
"A warm light for all mankind."

833
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:17,300
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

834
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:18,828
I heard it.

835
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,144
I think that was meant for you.

836
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:24,662
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

837
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:25,824
it was still all over the news.

838
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,941
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

839
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,424
building in New York?

840
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,099
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

841
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,539
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

842
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,422
It's just the prototype.

843
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,427
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

844
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,183
That's what he's getting at.

845
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,778
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

846
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,583
What are they doing
in the energy business

847
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,985
in the first place?

848
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,944
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

849
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:53,141
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

850
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:54,226
I'm sorry. Did you say...

851
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,262
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

852
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:57,904
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

853
00:55:58,031 --> 00:55:59,146
S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.

854
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:00,226
Blueberry?

855
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,148
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

856
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:04,991
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

857
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,625
Historically, not awesome.

858
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:08,947
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

859
00:56:09,072 --> 00:56:10,585
This is a man who means to start a war

860
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:12,191
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

861
00:56:13,432 --> 00:56:15,787
We have orders.
We should follow them.

862
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,183
Following's not really my style.

863
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:21,627
And you're all about style, aren't you?

864
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:22,741
Of the people in this room,

865
00:56:22,872 --> 00:56:24,386
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

866
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:25,787
and, B, not of use?

867
00:56:25,913 --> 00:56:30,065
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

868
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:33,662
Just find the Cube.

869
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:47,905
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

870
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:51,027
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

871
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:53,472
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

872
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:55,266
He does have the jump on us.

873
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:57,988
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

874
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,866
It's going to blow up in his face.

875
00:56:59,994 --> 00:57:02,189
And I'm going to be there when it does.

876
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:04,545
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

877
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:07,823
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

878
00:57:09,355 --> 00:57:12,791
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

879
00:57:12,915 --> 00:57:16,112
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

880
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:17,907
It's a nightmare.

881
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:20,708
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

882
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:22,747
to crawl its way into my heart.

883
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:24,832
This stops it.

884
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:27,186
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

885
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:29,948
not just armour.

886
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:32,951
It's a terrible privilege.

887
00:57:33,276 --> 00:57:35,551
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

888
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:36,631
It's different.

889
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:40,153
Hey, I read all about your accident.

890
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:43,474
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

891
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:45,952
So you're saying that the Hulk...

892
00:57:47,357 --> 00:57:49,632
The other guy saved my life?

893
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:51,186
That's nice.

894
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:55,666
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

895
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,748
I guess we'll find out.

896
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:01,990
You may not enjoy that.

897
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:03,995
And you just might.

898
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:02,120
<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>

899
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:03,913
we moved Jane Foster.

900
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,316
They've got an excellent
observatory in Troms�.

901
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:09,831
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

902
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:13,590
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

903
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:15,430
She'll be safe.

904
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:16,880
Thank you.

905
00:59:18,601 --> 00:59:20,558
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

906
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,990
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

907
00:59:24,122 --> 00:59:25,191
Erik is a good man.

908
00:59:25,322 --> 00:59:26,277
He talks about you a lot.

909
00:59:28,082 --> 00:59:29,993
You changed his life.

910
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:33,439
You changed everything around here.

911
00:59:33,562 --> 00:59:35,598
They were better as they were.

912
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:38,153
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

913
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:41,832
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

914
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:43,715
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

915
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:46,755
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

916
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:49,241
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

917
00:59:49,363 --> 00:59:51,160
Well, they are repulsive.

918
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:54,593
And they trample everything
in their path.

919
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:05,161
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

920
01:00:05,284 --> 01:00:07,514
and your people paid the price.

921
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:09,362
And now, again.

922
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:14,159
In my youth, I courted war.

923
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:17,755
War hasn't started yet.

924
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:20,563
You think you could make Loki tell us

925
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:21,913
where the Tesseract is?

926
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:25,162
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

927
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:29,801
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

928
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:31,961
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

929
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,121
A lot of guys think that

930
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:36,678
until the pain starts.

931
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,319
What are you asking me to do?

932
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:43,882
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

933
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:44,995
Loki is a prisoner.

934
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:47,356
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

935
01:00:47,486 --> 01:00:48,999
that wants to be here?

936
01:01:01,087 --> 01:01:04,045
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

937
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,759
But you figured I'd come.

938
01:01:06,407 --> 01:01:07,920
After.

939
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:12,043
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

940
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,682
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

941
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:18,200
And I would cooperate.

942
01:01:18,328 --> 01:01:20,239
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

943
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:22,279
I would say I've expanded his mind.

944
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,599
And once you've won,

945
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:28,676
once you're king of the mountain,

946
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,117
what happens to his mind?

947
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:36,047
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

948
01:01:36,169 --> 01:01:38,888
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

949
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:44,406
Tell me.

950
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:51,686
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

951
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,764
Well, I made a name for myself.

952
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,768
I have a very specific skill set.

953
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:04,405
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

954
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:08,726
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

955
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,648
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

956
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,130
He made a different call.

957
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:19,923
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

958
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,565
Not let you out.

959
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:23,488
No, but I like this.

960
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:27,647
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

961
01:02:27,771 --> 01:02:29,762
Regimes fall every day.

962
01:02:29,891 --> 01:02:32,325
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

963
01:02:32,451 --> 01:02:33,406
Or I was.

964
01:02:34,652 --> 01:02:36,244
And what are you now?

965
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:39,525
It's really not that complicated.

966
01:02:39,652 --> 01:02:43,565
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

967
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:46,011
Can you?

968
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:50,921
Can you wipe out that much red?

969
01:02:52,052 --> 01:02:53,771
Dreykov's daughter,

970
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:56,885
S�o Paulo,

971
01:02:57,893 --> 01:03:00,282
the hospital fire?

972
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:03,368
Barton told me everything.

973
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:06,451
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

974
01:03:06,573 --> 01:03:08,962
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

975
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:10,412
will change anything?

976
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:13,094
This is the basest sentimentality.

977
01:03:13,214 --> 01:03:15,364
This is a child at prayer.

978
01:03:15,494 --> 01:03:16,722
Pathetic!

979
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:19,962
<i>You lie and kill</i>

980
01:03:20,094 --> 01:03:23,006
<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>

981
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:29,011
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

982
01:03:29,134 --> 01:03:31,728
<i>something that makes up
for the horrors.</i>

983
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:35,164
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

984
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:38,924
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

985
01:03:39,495 --> 01:03:42,851
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

986
01:03:42,975 --> 01:03:45,125
Slowly, intimately,

987
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,530
in every way he knows you fear.

988
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:50,613
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

989
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:54,046
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

990
01:03:54,176 --> 01:03:57,168
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

991
01:03:58,696 --> 01:04:00,209
You're a monster.

992
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:03,769
Oh, no.

993
01:04:04,616 --> 01:04:06,129
You brought the monster.

994
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:10,529
So, Banner.

995
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:12,652
That's your play.

996
01:04:12,777 --> 01:04:13,766
What?

997
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:16,289
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

998
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:17,816
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

999
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:18,972
Send Thor as well.

1000
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:21,851
Thank you

1001
01:04:21,977 --> 01:04:24,047
for your cooperation.

1002
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:32,657
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1003
01:04:32,778 --> 01:04:35,167
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1004
01:04:35,298 --> 01:04:37,095
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1005
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:38,731
We are. The model's locked

1006
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:40,086
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1007
01:04:40,218 --> 01:04:41,173
When we get a hit,

1008
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,175
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1009
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:47,370
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1010
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:48,567
What is "Phase 2"?

1011
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:53,418
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1012
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:55,211
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1013
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:57,933
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1014
01:04:58,059 --> 01:04:59,458
This does not mean that we're making...

1015
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:00,534
I'm sorry, Nick.

1016
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:02,854
What were you lying?

1017
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:04,173
I was wrong, Director.

1018
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:05,288
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1019
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:06,408
Did you know about this?

1020
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:07,813
You want to think about
removing yourself

1021
01:05:07,939 --> 01:05:09,213
from this environment, Doctor?

1022
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,410
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1023
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,655
Loki is manipulating you.

1024
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,293
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1025
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,012
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1026
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,209
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1027
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,568
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1028
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,258
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1029
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,929
Is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1030
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,609
Because of him.

1031
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:27,815
Me?

1032
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,016
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1033
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:34,178
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

1034
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,417
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1035
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:39,977
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1036
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:42,251
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1037
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:44,258
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1038
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:46,258
And you're not the only threat.

1039
01:05:46,381 --> 01:05:49,419
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1040
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:51,211
that can't be controlled.

1041
01:05:51,342 --> 01:05:52,411
Like you controlled the Cube?

1042
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:53,736
Your work with the Tesseract

1043
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:56,330
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1044
01:05:56,462 --> 01:05:57,781
It is a signal to all the realms

1045
01:05:57,902 --> 01:06:00,462
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1046
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,617
A higher form?

1047
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:02,697
You forced our hand.

1048
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:03,777
We had to come up with something.

1049
01:06:03,902 --> 01:06:04,857
A nuclear deterrent.

1050
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:06,893
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1051
01:06:07,022 --> 01:06:09,298
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1052
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,698
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1053
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:13,381
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1054
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:14,572
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1055
01:06:14,703 --> 01:06:16,500
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1056
01:06:16,623 --> 01:06:19,376
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1057
01:06:19,503 --> 01:06:21,300
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1058
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:22,822
Are you boys really that na�ve?

1059
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:24,740
S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.

1060
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:26,091
Captain America's on threat watch?

1061
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:27,178
We all are.

1062
01:06:27,303 --> 01:06:28,657
Wait, you're on that list?

1063
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,263
Are you above or below angry bees?

1064
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:32,420
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1065
01:06:32,544 --> 01:06:33,738
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1066
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,253
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1067
01:06:43,304 --> 01:06:46,102
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.</i>

1068
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:48,295
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

1069
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,416
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

1070
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:53,059
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

1071
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:03,181
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1072
01:07:03,305 --> 01:07:04,943
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1073
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:06,259
I mean, what are we, a team?

1074
01:07:06,385 --> 01:07:09,219
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1075
01:07:09,346 --> 01:07:11,223
We're a time bomb.

1076
01:07:11,346 --> 01:07:13,098
You need to step away.

1077
01:07:13,226 --> 01:07:14,978
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1078
01:07:15,106 --> 01:07:17,142
You know damn well why. Back off!

1079
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,382
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1080
01:07:19,506 --> 01:07:22,976
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1081
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:24,505
Take that off, what are you?

1082
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:26,857
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1083
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:30,744
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1084
01:07:30,867 --> 01:07:31,822
I've seen the footage.

1085
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,097
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1086
01:07:35,507 --> 01:07:37,338
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1087
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,856
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1088
01:07:39,987 --> 01:07:42,023
I think I would just cut the wire.

1089
01:07:44,547 --> 01:07:46,664
Always a way out.

1090
01:07:46,788 --> 01:07:47,982
You may not be a threat

1091
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:49,939
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1092
01:07:50,068 --> 01:07:52,423
A hero? Like you?

1093
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:54,504
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1094
01:07:54,628 --> 01:07:58,098
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1095
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:25,069
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1096
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:29,340
You people are so petty and tiny.

1097
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,425
Yeah, this is a team.

1098
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:31,744
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1099
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:32,939
Dr Banner back to his...

1100
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,662
Where? You rented my room.

1101
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:36,189
The cell was just in case...

1102
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,789
In case you needed to kill me.

1103
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:40,708
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1104
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,109
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1105
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:50,509
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1106
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,220
So I moved on.

1107
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,070
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1108
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:57,307
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1109
01:08:57,431 --> 01:08:58,750
and put everyone here at risk.

1110
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:00,862
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1111
01:09:00,991 --> 01:09:02,743
You want to know how I stay calm?

1112
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,502
Dr Banner,

1113
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:09,546
put down the sceptre.

1114
01:09:17,952 --> 01:09:19,067
Got it.

1115
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:20,827
Sorry, kids,

1116
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,624
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1117
01:09:22,752 --> 01:09:23,708
You located the Tesseract?

1118
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,788
I could get there fastest.

1119
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:26,949
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1120
01:09:27,073 --> 01:09:28,347
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1121
01:09:28,473 --> 01:09:29,428
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1122
01:09:29,553 --> 01:09:30,781
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1123
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:31,868
Put on the suit.

1124
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,191
Oh, my God.

1125
01:09:51,074 --> 01:09:52,029
Put on the suit.

1126
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:53,382
Yeah.

1127
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:57,706
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1128
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:03,393
<i>- Hill!
- External detonation.</i>

1129
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:04,709
Number three engine is down.

1130
01:10:04,835 --> 01:10:05,790
We've been hit.

1131
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,030
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1132
01:10:07,155 --> 01:10:08,110
Talk to me.

1133
01:10:08,235 --> 01:10:09,793
Turbine looks mostly intact

1134
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,712
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1135
01:10:11,835 --> 01:10:13,188
while we're in the air.

1136
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:15,749
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1137
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,786
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1138
01:10:17,915 --> 01:10:19,553
<i>- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.</i>

1139
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:22,827
<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section</i>

1140
01:10:22,956 --> 01:10:23,911
<i>then get to the armoury.</i>

1141
01:10:24,036 --> 01:10:25,105
Romanoff?

1142
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:29,995
We're okay.

1143
01:10:32,476 --> 01:10:33,670
We're okay, right?

1144
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:46,906
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:48,675
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1146
01:10:48,797 --> 01:10:50,515
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1147
01:10:52,197 --> 01:10:53,630
Let's go, Level 4.

1148
01:10:54,557 --> 01:10:57,230
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1149
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:06,193
Doctor?

1150
01:11:08,478 --> 01:11:09,433
Bruce?

1151
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:13,233
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1152
01:11:14,558 --> 01:11:15,547
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1153
01:11:15,678 --> 01:11:16,633
Are you hurt?

1154
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:21,915
We're going to be okay. All right?

1155
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:24,678
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1156
01:11:24,799 --> 01:11:26,118
You will walk away and never ever...

1157
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,230
Your life?

1158
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,035
Bruce.

1159
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,431
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1160
01:12:23,562 --> 01:12:25,359
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1161
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:27,393
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1162
01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:29,194
Is the sun coming up?

1163
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:32,038
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1164
01:12:32,162 --> 01:12:33,754
Get us over water.

1165
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,873
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1166
01:12:38,043 --> 01:12:39,271
Thanks.

1167
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,598
Stark!

1168
01:12:46,203 --> 01:12:47,795
Stark, I'm here!

1169
01:12:47,923 --> 01:12:49,356
<i>Good.</i>

1170
01:12:50,523 --> 01:12:52,434
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1171
01:12:52,563 --> 01:12:54,155
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1172
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:55,238
back online

1173
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:56,762
before I can access the rotors,

1174
01:12:56,884 --> 01:12:58,636
work on dislodging the debris.

1175
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:02,563
<i>I need you to get to that
engine control panel</i>

1176
01:13:02,684 --> 01:13:06,199
<i>and tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

1177
01:13:18,005 --> 01:13:19,484
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1178
01:13:20,165 --> 01:13:22,599
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1179
01:13:22,725 --> 01:13:24,397
Well, you're not wrong.

1180
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:28,327
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1181
01:14:28,448 --> 01:14:29,403
Try to think!

1182
01:14:39,129 --> 01:14:40,926
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

1183
01:14:41,049 --> 01:14:42,448
What's our next move?

1184
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:43,524
<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>

1185
01:14:43,649 --> 01:14:45,765
<i>this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.</i>

1186
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:47,208
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1187
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:49,001
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1188
01:14:49,129 --> 01:14:51,040
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1189
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:52,522
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1190
01:14:52,649 --> 01:14:53,924
Speak English!

1191
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,279
You see that red lever?

1192
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,566
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

1193
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,408
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1194
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:53,571
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1195
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:57,642
Grenade!

1196
01:16:12,174 --> 01:16:13,448
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1197
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:15,530
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.</i>

1198
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,645
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1199
01:16:24,654 --> 01:16:26,770
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.</i>

1200
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:28,373
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1201
01:16:28,494 --> 01:16:30,530
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1202
01:16:31,695 --> 01:16:32,650
Get his attention.

1203
01:16:32,775 --> 01:16:36,768
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1204
01:16:36,895 --> 01:16:38,123
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

1205
01:16:38,255 --> 01:16:39,574
<i>Copy.</i>

1206
01:16:51,016 --> 01:16:52,335
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1207
01:16:56,456 --> 01:16:57,411
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1208
01:17:08,576 --> 01:17:10,056
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1209
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:17,776
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1210
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:37,571
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

1211
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:47,732
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1212
01:18:47,862 --> 01:18:49,659
<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>

1213
01:18:50,182 --> 01:18:51,934
<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>

1214
01:18:52,062 --> 01:18:54,451
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

1215
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:56,459
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1216
01:18:57,582 --> 01:18:59,618
This is Agent Romanoff.

1217
01:18:59,742 --> 01:19:01,141
I copy.

1218
01:19:05,582 --> 01:19:06,537
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1219
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,062
Yeah, I noticed.

1220
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:36,893
No!

1221
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:46,779
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1222
01:20:28,027 --> 01:20:30,177
The humans think us immortal.

1223
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:32,706
Should we test that?

1224
01:20:35,387 --> 01:20:36,536
Move away, please.

1225
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:42,260
You like this?

1226
01:20:43,187 --> 01:20:46,305
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1227
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:49,618
Even I don't know what it does.

1228
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:51,582
Do you want to find out?

1229
01:20:53,508 --> 01:20:54,907
No!

1230
01:22:01,591 --> 01:22:02,945
Natasha?

1231
01:22:33,233 --> 01:22:34,905
You're going to lose.

1232
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:38,022
Am I?

1233
01:22:39,273 --> 01:22:41,663
It's in your nature.

1234
01:22:43,754 --> 01:22:45,984
Your heroes are scattered.

1235
01:22:46,114 --> 01:22:49,663
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1236
01:22:49,794 --> 01:22:51,352
Where is my disadvantage?

1237
01:22:51,994 --> 01:22:53,985
You lack conviction.

1238
01:22:54,794 --> 01:22:55,749
I don't think I'm...

1239
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:03,955
So, that's what it does.

1240
01:23:05,955 --> 01:23:08,947
<i>All hands
to crash stations immediately.</i>

1241
01:23:35,436 --> 01:23:36,391
Cap, hit the lever.

1242
01:23:36,756 --> 01:23:39,225
I need a minute here!

1243
01:23:39,357 --> 01:23:40,392
Lever

1244
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:41,586
now!

1245
01:23:53,077 --> 01:23:54,146
<i>Help!</i>

1246
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:29,638
Sorry, boss.

1247
01:24:29,759 --> 01:24:31,397
The god rabbited.

1248
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:32,918
Just stay awake.

1249
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:34,597
Eyes on me.

1250
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,198
No, I'm clocking out here.

1251
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:37,753
Not an option.

1252
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,597
It's okay, boss.

1253
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,396
This was never gonna work

1254
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,748
if they didn't have something

1255
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,519
to...

1256
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:18,194
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1257
01:25:19,522 --> 01:25:21,160
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

1258
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,681
<i>They're here.</i>

1259
01:25:25,762 --> 01:25:27,320
<i>They called it.</i>

1260
01:25:43,123 --> 01:25:44,681
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1261
01:25:47,883 --> 01:25:49,919
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1262
01:25:53,283 --> 01:25:54,875
We're dead in the air up here.

1263
01:25:55,003 --> 01:25:57,962
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1264
01:25:58,084 --> 01:26:00,393
Banner, Thor...

1265
01:26:01,644 --> 01:26:03,475
I got nothing for you.

1266
01:26:03,604 --> 01:26:06,402
I lost my one good eye.

1267
01:26:09,324 --> 01:26:12,202
Maybe I had that coming.

1268
01:26:16,245 --> 01:26:17,473
Yes,

1269
01:26:18,605 --> 01:26:21,802
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1270
01:26:23,205 --> 01:26:25,036
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1271
01:26:25,165 --> 01:26:28,077
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1272
01:26:31,885 --> 01:26:35,845
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1273
01:26:37,646 --> 01:26:40,843
called the Avengers Initiative.

1274
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:44,042
The idea was to bring together a group

1275
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:46,600
of remarkable people

1276
01:26:47,366 --> 01:26:50,085
to see if they could become
something more.

1277
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:55,400
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1278
01:26:55,527 --> 01:26:58,724
to fight the battles that we never could.

1279
01:27:01,367 --> 01:27:05,997
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1280
01:27:08,247 --> 01:27:09,839
In heroes.

1281
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:19,087
Well,

1282
01:27:19,928 --> 01:27:22,488
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1283
01:27:41,969 --> 01:27:44,358
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

1284
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,243
Did I hurt anybody?

1285
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:02,282
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1286
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:05,561
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1287
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,359
Lucky.

1288
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,048
Or just good aim.

1289
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,683
You were awake when you fell.

1290
01:28:12,691 --> 01:28:14,647
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1291
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:16,329
Right through the ceiling.

1292
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:20,239
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1293
01:28:20,371 --> 01:28:21,440
Here.

1294
01:28:22,771 --> 01:28:24,841
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1295
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:27,280
to a regular-size feller.

1296
01:28:29,531 --> 01:28:30,759
Thank you.

1297
01:28:31,732 --> 01:28:32,926
Are you an alien?

1298
01:28:33,492 --> 01:28:34,641
What?

1299
01:28:34,932 --> 01:28:36,206
From outer space, an alien.

1300
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:37,767
No.

1301
01:28:38,132 --> 01:28:41,124
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1302
01:28:51,533 --> 01:28:53,763
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1303
01:28:56,973 --> 01:28:58,964
You know that?

1304
01:28:59,773 --> 01:29:01,570
Is that what you know?

1305
01:29:03,933 --> 01:29:06,686
I've got no window.

1306
01:29:07,453 --> 01:29:08,773
I have to flush him out.

1307
01:29:09,653 --> 01:29:11,406
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1308
01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:13,013
You don't understand.

1309
01:29:14,894 --> 01:29:18,011
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1310
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:22,767
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1311
01:29:25,814 --> 01:29:28,089
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1312
01:29:29,575 --> 01:29:31,850
You know that I do.

1313
01:29:39,135 --> 01:29:40,124
Why am I back?

1314
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:42,534
How did you get him out?

1315
01:29:42,655 --> 01:29:45,374
Cognitive recalibration.

1316
01:29:45,495 --> 01:29:48,089
I hit you really hard on the head.

1317
01:29:48,215 --> 01:29:49,251
Thanks.

1318
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:55,048
Natasha...

1319
01:29:55,696 --> 01:29:56,731
How many agents did I...

1320
01:29:56,856 --> 01:29:58,255
Don't.

1321
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:00,492
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1322
01:30:01,056 --> 01:30:02,694
This is Loki.

1323
01:30:02,816 --> 01:30:05,330
This is monsters and magic,

1324
01:30:05,456 --> 01:30:07,014
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1325
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:08,616
Loki, did he get away?

1326
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:09,692
Yeah.

1327
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:12,167
I don't suppose you know where.

1328
01:30:12,297 --> 01:30:14,015
I didn't need to know.

1329
01:30:14,137 --> 01:30:15,809
I didn't ask.

1330
01:30:18,937 --> 01:30:21,326
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1331
01:30:21,657 --> 01:30:22,612
Today.

1332
01:30:22,737 --> 01:30:24,011
We got to stop him.

1333
01:30:24,657 --> 01:30:25,851
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1334
01:30:25,977 --> 01:30:27,855
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1335
01:30:29,018 --> 01:30:30,292
Well,

1336
01:30:31,938 --> 01:30:34,008
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1337
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:36,732
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1338
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:40,971
Now you sound like you.

1339
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:43,057
But you don't.

1340
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:47,618
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1341
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:52,290
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1342
01:30:53,979 --> 01:30:55,856
What did Loki do to you?

1343
01:30:56,579 --> 01:30:58,888
He didn't. I just...

1344
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:03,978
Natasha.

1345
01:31:05,979 --> 01:31:07,891
I've been compromised.

1346
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,896
I got red in my ledger.

1347
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,931
I would like to wipe it out.

1348
01:31:32,301 --> 01:31:33,734
Was he married?

1349
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:35,214
No.

1350
01:31:35,341 --> 01:31:39,380
There was a cellist, I think.

1351
01:31:40,901 --> 01:31:42,254
I'm sorry.

1352
01:31:42,941 --> 01:31:44,533
He seemed like a good man.

1353
01:31:45,782 --> 01:31:46,817
He was an idiot.

1354
01:31:46,942 --> 01:31:49,092
Why? For believing?

1355
01:31:49,222 --> 01:31:50,575
For taking on Loki alone.

1356
01:31:50,702 --> 01:31:52,340
He was doing his job.

1357
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:54,896
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1358
01:31:55,022 --> 01:31:56,011
He should have...

1359
01:31:56,142 --> 01:31:57,655
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1360
01:31:57,782 --> 01:31:59,818
Right, I've heard that before.

1361
01:31:59,942 --> 01:32:01,375
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1362
01:32:01,502 --> 01:32:03,220
We are not soldiers.

1363
01:32:07,503 --> 01:32:09,175
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1364
01:32:09,303 --> 01:32:10,418
Neither am I.

1365
01:32:10,543 --> 01:32:12,659
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1366
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:14,102
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1367
01:32:14,223 --> 01:32:16,339
and get this done.

1368
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:17,418
Loki needs a power source.

1369
01:32:17,543 --> 01:32:18,498
If we can put together a list...

1370
01:32:18,623 --> 01:32:19,578
He made it personal.

1371
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:20,732
That's not the point.

1372
01:32:20,863 --> 01:32:23,138
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1373
01:32:23,263 --> 01:32:25,095
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1374
01:32:25,224 --> 01:32:26,179
To tear us apart.

1375
01:32:26,304 --> 01:32:28,101
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1376
01:32:28,224 --> 01:32:30,579
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1377
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:32,183
That's what he wants.

1378
01:32:32,304 --> 01:32:34,693
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1379
01:32:34,824 --> 01:32:35,893
He wants an audience.

1380
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:38,176
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1381
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:41,102
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1382
01:32:41,224 --> 01:32:43,658
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1383
01:32:43,784 --> 01:32:45,298
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1384
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:49,054
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1385
01:32:50,745 --> 01:32:52,258
Son of a bitch.

1386
01:33:03,065 --> 01:33:04,055
Time to go.

1387
01:33:04,186 --> 01:33:05,665
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1388
01:33:05,786 --> 01:33:06,741
Can you fly one of those jets?

1389
01:33:08,266 --> 01:33:09,460
I can.

1390
01:33:13,186 --> 01:33:14,175
You got a suit?

1391
01:33:14,306 --> 01:33:15,261
Yeah.

1392
01:33:15,386 --> 01:33:16,785
Then suit up.

1393
01:33:43,308 --> 01:33:44,536
Hey, you guys aren't
authorised to be in here.

1394
01:33:44,668 --> 01:33:46,898
Son, just don't.

1395
01:33:48,868 --> 01:33:49,823
Sir.

1396
01:33:49,948 --> 01:33:51,097
Agent Hill.

1397
01:33:51,628 --> 01:33:53,107
Those cards,

1398
01:33:55,148 --> 01:33:59,426
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1399
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:05,182
They needed the push.

1400
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:10,344
<i>We have an unauthorised departure
from Bay 6.</i>

1401
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:12,463
They found him.

1402
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:16,818
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1403
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,099
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1404
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:33,782
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>

1405
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:37,585
<i>but the device
is already self-sustaining.</i>

1406
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,780
<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>

1407
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:41,659
It's too late!

1408
01:34:43,631 --> 01:34:45,030
She can't stop now.

1409
01:34:46,031 --> 01:34:48,386
She wants to show us something!

1410
01:34:48,511 --> 01:34:50,467
A new universe.

1411
01:34:50,591 --> 01:34:52,070
<i>Okay.</i>

1412
01:34:58,831 --> 01:35:00,629
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1413
01:35:00,752 --> 01:35:02,549
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1414
01:35:02,672 --> 01:35:04,390
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1415
01:35:05,552 --> 01:35:06,507
<i>Plan B.</i>

1416
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:09,623
<i>Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.</i>

1417
01:35:09,752 --> 01:35:11,902
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1418
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:33,745
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1419
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:37,108
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1420
01:35:37,233 --> 01:35:38,632
You should have left
your armour on for that.

1421
01:35:38,753 --> 01:35:40,107
Yeah.

1422
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,269
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1423
01:35:41,394 --> 01:35:43,908
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1424
01:35:44,674 --> 01:35:46,869
Would you like a drink?

1425
01:35:46,994 --> 01:35:48,063
Stalling me won't change anything.

1426
01:35:48,194 --> 01:35:50,230
No, no. Threatening.

1427
01:35:50,354 --> 01:35:51,673
No drink? Are you sure?

1428
01:35:51,794 --> 01:35:53,273
I'm having one.

1429
01:35:54,274 --> 01:35:58,028
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1430
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:00,228
What have I to fear?

1431
01:36:00,355 --> 01:36:01,993
The Avengers.

1432
01:36:03,995 --> 01:36:06,225
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1433
01:36:06,355 --> 01:36:07,913
"Earth's mightiest heroes"- type thing.

1434
01:36:08,035 --> 01:36:09,832
Yes, I've met them.

1435
01:36:09,955 --> 01:36:10,944
Yeah.

1436
01:36:11,075 --> 01:36:12,190
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1437
01:36:12,315 --> 01:36:13,270
I'll give you that one.

1438
01:36:13,395 --> 01:36:15,511
But let's do a head count, here.

1439
01:36:15,635 --> 01:36:18,024
Your brother, the demigod,

1440
01:36:19,676 --> 01:36:23,112
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1441
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:26,273
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1442
01:36:26,396 --> 01:36:29,354
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1443
01:36:29,956 --> 01:36:32,789
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1444
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:33,871
That was the plan.

1445
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:35,907
Not a great plan.

1446
01:36:36,036 --> 01:36:37,993
When they come,

1447
01:36:38,117 --> 01:36:39,516
and they will,

1448
01:36:39,637 --> 01:36:40,831
they'll come for you.

1449
01:36:40,957 --> 01:36:41,912
I have an army.

1450
01:36:42,037 --> 01:36:43,152
We have a Hulk.

1451
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:44,956
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1452
01:36:45,077 --> 01:36:46,908
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1453
01:36:47,037 --> 01:36:50,871
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1454
01:36:50,997 --> 01:36:53,227
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1455
01:36:53,357 --> 01:36:55,268
but it's all on you.

1456
01:36:56,037 --> 01:36:57,073
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1457
01:36:57,238 --> 01:37:00,230
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1458
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:05,110
How will your friends have time for me

1459
01:37:05,238 --> 01:37:06,956
when they are so busy fighting you?

1460
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:15,067
This usually works.

1461
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:17,918
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1462
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:19,870
One out of five...

1463
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:24,074
Jarvis, anytime now.

1464
01:37:25,759 --> 01:37:28,398
You will all fall before me.

1465
01:37:28,519 --> 01:37:29,838
Deploy!

1466
01:37:29,959 --> 01:37:31,312
Deploy!

1467
01:37:57,401 --> 01:38:00,234
<i>And there's one other
person you pissed off.</i>

1468
01:38:01,321 --> 01:38:02,515
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1469
01:38:25,322 --> 01:38:26,755
Right.

1470
01:38:26,882 --> 01:38:28,076
Army.

1471
01:39:37,486 --> 01:39:38,714
Loki!

1472
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:40,802
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1473
01:39:40,926 --> 01:39:41,915
You can't.

1474
01:39:42,046 --> 01:39:43,843
There is no stopping it.

1475
01:39:43,966 --> 01:39:45,684
There is only

1476
01:39:45,806 --> 01:39:46,875
the war.

1477
01:39:47,006 --> 01:39:48,075
So be it.

1478
01:40:09,287 --> 01:40:10,959
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.</i>

1479
01:40:11,087 --> 01:40:13,124
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1480
01:40:13,248 --> 01:40:14,886
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1481
01:40:32,209 --> 01:40:33,483
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1482
01:40:33,609 --> 01:40:35,281
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1483
01:40:41,889 --> 01:40:43,686
- Nat?
- I see him.

1484
01:41:26,211 --> 01:41:28,327
We got to get back up there.

1485
01:42:17,574 --> 01:42:19,166
Stark, are you seeing this?

1486
01:42:19,894 --> 01:42:22,249
<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>

1487
01:42:22,374 --> 01:42:23,693
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1488
01:42:23,814 --> 01:42:24,803
<i>Banner?</i>

1489
01:42:24,934 --> 01:42:25,923
Just keep me posted.

1490
01:42:26,614 --> 01:42:28,685
<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>

1491
01:42:30,855 --> 01:42:32,652
Look at this!

1492
01:42:32,775 --> 01:42:33,730
Look around you!

1493
01:42:34,695 --> 01:42:38,404
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1494
01:42:38,535 --> 01:42:39,968
It's too late.

1495
01:42:41,415 --> 01:42:42,609
It's too late to stop it.

1496
01:42:42,735 --> 01:42:46,444
No. We can, together.

1497
01:42:52,776 --> 01:42:54,812
Sentiment.

1498
01:43:21,257 --> 01:43:23,691
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1499
01:43:24,817 --> 01:43:25,772
Loki.

1500
01:43:36,938 --> 01:43:38,656
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1501
01:43:43,898 --> 01:43:45,776
We got this. It's good. Go.

1502
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:47,218
Do you think you can hold them off?

1503
01:43:47,339 --> 01:43:48,294
Captain,

1504
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:52,938
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1505
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,338
Just like Budapest all over again.

1506
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:23,329
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1507
01:44:38,821 --> 01:44:39,776
It's going to be an hour

1508
01:44:39,901 --> 01:44:41,129
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1509
01:44:41,261 --> 01:44:42,979
National Guard?

1510
01:44:43,901 --> 01:44:45,335
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1511
01:44:45,582 --> 01:44:46,537
Do we?

1512
01:44:47,702 --> 01:44:48,851
You need men in these buildings.

1513
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:50,415
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1514
01:44:50,542 --> 01:44:51,691
right into the line of fire.

1515
01:44:51,822 --> 01:44:53,653
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1516
01:44:53,782 --> 01:44:55,295
You keep them off the streets.

1517
01:44:55,422 --> 01:44:57,936
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1518
01:44:58,062 --> 01:44:59,620
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1519
01:45:13,103 --> 01:45:14,252
I need men in those buildings.

1520
01:45:14,383 --> 01:45:16,374
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1521
01:45:16,503 --> 01:45:18,971
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1522
01:45:28,944 --> 01:45:30,457
Well, we got its attention.

1523
01:45:30,584 --> 01:45:32,381
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1524
01:46:00,705 --> 01:46:01,660
What's the story upstairs?

1525
01:46:01,785 --> 01:46:03,617
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1526
01:46:03,746 --> 01:46:06,260
<i>Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.</i>

1527
01:46:06,386 --> 01:46:07,944
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1528
01:46:08,066 --> 01:46:09,294
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1529
01:46:09,826 --> 01:46:10,815
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1530
01:46:10,946 --> 01:46:11,901
Save it.

1531
01:46:12,026 --> 01:46:13,300
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1532
01:46:13,426 --> 01:46:14,415
and that's what we need.

1533
01:46:14,546 --> 01:46:16,138
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1534
01:46:16,266 --> 01:46:19,099
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1535
01:46:26,147 --> 01:46:29,776
So, this all seems horrible.

1536
01:46:30,227 --> 01:46:31,296
I've seen worse.

1537
01:46:31,827 --> 01:46:32,782
Sorry.

1538
01:46:32,907 --> 01:46:35,467
No, we could use a little worse.

1539
01:46:35,587 --> 01:46:37,896
<i>- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?</i>

1540
01:46:38,027 --> 01:46:39,221
Just like you said.

1541
01:46:39,347 --> 01:46:41,942
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1542
01:46:48,148 --> 01:46:50,139
I don't see how that's a party.

1543
01:46:57,668 --> 01:46:58,623
Dr Banner.

1544
01:47:00,309 --> 01:47:02,027
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1545
01:47:03,029 --> 01:47:05,384
That's my secret, Captain.

1546
01:47:07,029 --> 01:47:08,223
I'm always angry.

1547
01:47:19,229 --> 01:47:20,788
<i>Hold on!</i>

1548
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:50,950
Send the rest.

1549
01:47:57,431 --> 01:47:58,626
Guys.

1550
01:47:58,752 --> 01:47:59,901
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1551
01:48:00,032 --> 01:48:01,147
All right, listen up.

1552
01:48:01,272 --> 01:48:03,945
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1553
01:48:04,072 --> 01:48:05,346
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1554
01:48:05,472 --> 01:48:07,269
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1555
01:48:07,392 --> 01:48:08,711
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1556
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,947
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1557
01:48:10,072 --> 01:48:11,551
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1558
01:48:11,672 --> 01:48:12,821
<i>- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.</i>

1559
01:48:12,952 --> 01:48:13,987
<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1560
01:48:17,432 --> 01:48:19,708
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1561
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:20,948
Slow them down.

1562
01:48:21,073 --> 01:48:23,143
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1563
01:48:25,353 --> 01:48:26,911
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1564
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,022
We keep the fighting here.

1565
01:48:28,153 --> 01:48:29,108
And Hulk...

1566
01:48:31,713 --> 01:48:32,748
Smash.

1567
01:49:24,156 --> 01:49:25,225
Sir.

1568
01:49:26,236 --> 01:49:27,191
The Council is on.

1569
01:49:31,876 --> 01:49:34,993
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1570
01:49:36,757 --> 01:49:38,713
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1571
01:49:38,837 --> 01:49:40,987
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1572
01:49:41,117 --> 01:49:42,232
So find a tight corner.

1573
01:49:42,357 --> 01:49:43,631
I will roger that.

1574
01:50:05,678 --> 01:50:06,793
Oh, boy.

1575
01:50:13,518 --> 01:50:15,077
Nice call.

1576
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,348
What else you got?

1577
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:19,152
<i>Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1578
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:21,395
And he didn't invite me.

1579
01:50:59,281 --> 01:51:00,839
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1580
01:51:00,961 --> 01:51:02,155
if we don't close that portal.

1581
01:51:02,281 --> 01:51:03,873
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1582
01:51:04,001 --> 01:51:06,151
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1583
01:51:08,001 --> 01:51:09,878
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1584
01:51:10,921 --> 01:51:11,956
I got a ride.

1585
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,031
I could use a boost, though.

1586
01:51:16,522 --> 01:51:17,477
Are you sure about this?

1587
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:20,356
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1588
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:48,080
Okay, turn, turn.

1589
01:51:48,203 --> 01:51:49,875
Less! Less!

1590
01:53:09,207 --> 01:53:12,041
<i>Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.</i>

1591
01:53:12,168 --> 01:53:13,840
<i>They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.</i>

1592
01:53:13,968 --> 01:53:15,799
I'm on it.

1593
01:53:35,089 --> 01:53:36,807
Everyone! Clear out!

1594
01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:07,082
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1595
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,929
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1596
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:11,690
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1597
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:13,324
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1598
01:54:13,451 --> 01:54:14,804
I have elected to ignore it.

1599
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:18,128
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

1600
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:19,206
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1601
01:54:19,331 --> 01:54:21,925
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1602
01:54:22,051 --> 01:54:24,042
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1603
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:26,048
I will not order a nuclear strike

1604
01:54:26,211 --> 01:54:27,564
against a civilian population.

1605
01:54:27,691 --> 01:54:30,001
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

1606
01:54:30,132 --> 01:54:32,771
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1607
01:54:36,372 --> 01:54:38,010
You.

1608
01:54:40,172 --> 01:54:41,287
Hawkeye!

1609
01:54:42,692 --> 01:54:43,647
Nat, what are you doing?

1610
01:54:44,532 --> 01:54:45,487
A little help?

1611
01:54:50,573 --> 01:54:51,528
I got him.

1612
01:55:17,014 --> 01:55:17,969
Enough!

1613
01:55:18,294 --> 01:55:20,649
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1614
01:55:20,774 --> 01:55:23,413
I am a god, you dull creature.

1615
01:55:23,534 --> 01:55:24,967
And I will not be bullied by...

1616
01:55:34,415 --> 01:55:36,212
Puny god.

1617
01:55:44,015 --> 01:55:45,414
The sceptre...

1618
01:55:46,536 --> 01:55:47,685
Doctor.

1619
01:55:49,496 --> 01:55:52,215
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1620
01:55:52,336 --> 01:55:53,928
The Tesseract can't fight,

1621
01:55:54,056 --> 01:55:56,012
but you can't protect against yourself.

1622
01:55:56,136 --> 01:55:57,091
It's not your fault.

1623
01:55:57,216 --> 01:55:58,410
You didn't know what you were doing.

1624
01:56:01,336 --> 01:56:03,406
Actually, I think I did.

1625
01:56:03,536 --> 01:56:06,370
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1626
01:56:07,537 --> 01:56:08,890
Loki's sceptre.

1627
01:56:09,017 --> 01:56:11,485
It may be able to close the portal.

1628
01:56:13,497 --> 01:56:15,567
And I'm looking right at it.

1629
01:56:27,058 --> 01:56:30,767
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1630
01:56:37,138 --> 01:56:40,289
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1631
01:56:40,418 --> 01:56:42,693
<i>I wouldn't consider him a role model.</i>

1632
01:57:49,462 --> 01:57:51,180
<i>Director Fury is no longer in command.</i>

1633
01:57:51,302 --> 01:57:53,258
<i>Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.</i>

1634
01:57:53,382 --> 01:57:55,850
<i>7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.</i>

1635
01:57:56,702 --> 01:57:58,693
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1636
01:57:59,182 --> 01:58:01,093
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1637
01:58:01,222 --> 01:58:02,451
We need to shut it down!

1638
01:58:02,583 --> 01:58:04,699
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1639
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:36,054
Stark, do you hear me?

1640
01:58:36,184 --> 01:58:38,220
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1641
01:58:38,744 --> 01:58:40,063
<i>How long?</i>

1642
01:58:40,184 --> 01:58:42,176
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

1643
01:58:42,305 --> 01:58:43,863
<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1644
01:58:43,985 --> 01:58:45,941
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1645
01:58:46,065 --> 01:58:47,657
<i>I just did.</i>

1646
01:59:00,025 --> 01:59:01,300
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1647
01:59:01,426 --> 01:59:04,418
<i>Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>

1648
01:59:26,267 --> 01:59:28,542
Are you ready for another bout?

1649
01:59:29,187 --> 01:59:30,176
What, are you getting sleepy?

1650
01:59:35,547 --> 01:59:37,219
Right at the crown!

1651
01:59:42,988 --> 01:59:44,706
I can close it.

1652
01:59:44,828 --> 01:59:46,784
Can anybody copy?

1653
01:59:46,908 --> 01:59:47,977
I can shut the portal down.

1654
01:59:48,108 --> 01:59:50,064
<i>- Do it!
- No, wait.</i>

1655
01:59:50,188 --> 01:59:51,382
Stark, these things are still coming.

1656
01:59:51,508 --> 01:59:52,463
I got a nuke coming in.

1657
01:59:52,588 --> 01:59:54,419
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1658
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:05,461
And I know just where to put it.

1659
02:00:12,349 --> 02:00:14,624
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

1660
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,068
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1661
02:00:16,189 --> 02:00:20,103
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1662
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:22,186
Might as well.

1663
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:26,305
<i>The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.</i>

1664
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:29,024
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

1665
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:30,549
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1666
02:00:30,670 --> 02:00:32,865
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,</i>

1667
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:35,788
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

1668
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:37,343
<i>We have limited information
on the team</i>

1669
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:41,066
<i>but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1670
02:01:51,394 --> 02:01:53,146
Come on, Stark.

1671
02:01:59,515 --> 02:02:00,584
Close it.

1672
02:02:19,836 --> 02:02:20,791
Son of a gun.

1673
02:02:25,356 --> 02:02:26,914
He's not slowing down.

1674
02:02:44,237 --> 02:02:45,636
Is he breathing?

1675
02:03:12,358 --> 02:03:13,712
What the hell?

1676
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:18,355
What just happened?

1677
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:20,674
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1678
02:03:24,799 --> 02:03:26,391
We won.

1679
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:29,867
All right, yay!

1680
02:03:29,999 --> 02:03:31,876
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1681
02:03:31,999 --> 02:03:35,072
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1682
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,433
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1683
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,035
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1684
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,752
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1685
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:43,559
We're not finished yet.

1686
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,356
And then shawarma after.

1687
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:13,272
If it's all the same to you,

1688
02:04:16,442 --> 02:04:18,034
I'll have that drink now.

1689
02:04:25,602 --> 02:04:27,558
<i>Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed</i>

1690
02:04:27,682 --> 02:04:29,320
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1691
02:04:29,442 --> 02:04:30,921
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1692
02:04:31,042 --> 02:04:32,920
<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>

1693
02:04:33,043 --> 02:04:34,522
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,</i>

1694
02:04:34,643 --> 02:04:35,598
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1695
02:04:35,723 --> 02:04:38,032
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there.</i>

1696
02:04:38,163 --> 02:04:39,881
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

1697
02:04:40,003 --> 02:04:41,152
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1698
02:04:41,283 --> 02:04:42,921
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1699
02:04:43,043 --> 02:04:44,317
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1700
02:04:44,443 --> 02:04:45,762
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes...</i>

1701
02:04:45,883 --> 02:04:46,872
<i>I don't know.</i>

1702
02:04:47,003 --> 02:04:49,358
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

1703
02:04:49,483 --> 02:04:52,442
<i>It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1704
02:04:52,564 --> 02:04:55,840
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

1705
02:04:55,964 --> 02:04:57,795
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

1706
02:04:57,924 --> 02:04:59,152
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

1707
02:04:59,284 --> 02:05:01,354
<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>

1708
02:05:01,484 --> 02:05:03,520
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

1709
02:05:03,644 --> 02:05:06,354
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1710
02:05:06,484 --> 02:05:07,439
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

1711
02:05:07,564 --> 02:05:08,883
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1712
02:05:09,004 --> 02:05:11,678
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1713
02:05:13,645 --> 02:05:16,682
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1714
02:05:18,725 --> 02:05:22,081
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

1715
02:05:22,205 --> 02:05:23,638
<i>I would just...</i>

1716
02:05:24,405 --> 02:05:26,600
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1717
02:05:28,965 --> 02:05:30,399
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1718
02:05:30,526 --> 02:05:32,835
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1719
02:05:32,966 --> 02:05:35,036
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1720
02:05:35,166 --> 02:05:36,679
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1721
02:05:36,806 --> 02:05:38,956
<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>

1722
02:05:39,366 --> 02:05:41,596
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

1723
02:05:41,726 --> 02:05:43,205
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1724
02:05:43,326 --> 02:05:44,315
I didn't make it.

1725
02:05:44,446 --> 02:05:46,596
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1726
02:05:46,726 --> 02:05:48,444
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1727
02:05:48,566 --> 02:05:50,125
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1728
02:05:50,247 --> 02:05:51,885
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

1729
02:05:52,007 --> 02:05:54,475
<i>I think he will be.</i>

1730
02:06:07,407 --> 02:06:09,968
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started,</i>

1731
02:06:10,088 --> 02:06:12,443
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

1732
02:06:12,968 --> 02:06:13,923
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1733
02:06:14,048 --> 02:06:17,563
<i>They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.</i>

1734
02:06:18,088 --> 02:06:20,556
Every world knows it.

1735
02:06:20,968 --> 02:06:22,959
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1736
02:06:23,088 --> 02:06:24,760
<i>A statement?</i>

1737
02:06:27,368 --> 02:06:28,768
<i>A promise.</i>

1738
02:06:37,129 --> 02:06:38,608
<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>

1739
02:06:39,689 --> 02:06:41,600
They've gone their separate ways.

1740
02:06:41,729 --> 02:06:44,527
Some, pretty extremely far.

1741
02:06:45,249 --> 02:06:47,080
If we get into a situation like this again,

1742
02:06:47,209 --> 02:06:48,689
what happens then?

1743
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:49,765
They'll come back.

1744
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:52,848
Are you really sure about that?

1745
02:06:52,970 --> 02:06:53,925
I am.

1746
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:56,639
Why?

1747
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:59,766
Because we'll need them to.

1748
02:09:44,339 --> 02:09:46,728
Humans.

1749
02:09:47,979 --> 02:09:52,131
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1750
02:09:53,059 --> 02:09:55,129
They stand.

1751
02:09:55,939 --> 02:10:02,129
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1752
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,573
To challenge them

1753
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:15,249
is to court death.
