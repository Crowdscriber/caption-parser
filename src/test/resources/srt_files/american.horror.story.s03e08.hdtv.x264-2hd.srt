00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:44,390
Let me guess.

3
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,392
You work the late shift,

4
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,427
some shit-hole diner.

5
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:50,963
Now you're taking
the shortcut home.

6
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,899
You don't go home till I say.

7
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:01,657
Make me fight for it,

8
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:04,043
I'll carve you up
in big thick slices,

9
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,462
then plug every hole you got.

10
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:10,416
What you did?

11
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,283
What I do.

12
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,718
This works, too.

13
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,622
<i>Queenie.</i>

14
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,092
<i>Queenie.</i>

15
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:24,755
What the hell are you doing?

16
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,974
Nothing you'd understand.

17
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,734
This is voodoo.

18
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:31,203
You're a witch.
We need you back in the coven.

19
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:33,372
Marie Laveau set me straight.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,940
You were never my friends.

21
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,496
Oh, boo-friggin'-hoo.

22
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,365
You switched
because girls were mean to you?

23
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,401
Fiona slit my throat.
You don't see me bitching out.

24
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,003
We know our coven's
a shit show right now.

25
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,606
But things are changing.
A new Supreme is rising.

26
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:49,642
And who's that? You?

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,645
Fiona filled my head
with that bullshit, too.

28
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,481
That bitch will say anything
if it gets her what she wants.

29
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,172
This isn't for you. Yet.

30
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,428
Holy shit.

31
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,888
You just killed an innocent man!

32
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,390
Innocent? Shows what you know.

33
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,898
This bastard raped three
schoolgirls that we know of,

34
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:20,865
probably more.

35
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,167
Marie Laveau needs a dark heart,

36
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,936
and I'm gonna give it to her.

37
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,008
Voodoo Queen is making
a special potion

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,644
to give me more powers.

39
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,912
Fiona ever do that?

40
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,346
Huh?

41
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:38,442
Voodoo, witchcraft.

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,179
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

43
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,614
War is coming.

44
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:46,067
And you're gonna lose.

45
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:52,768

00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:56,230
<i>Meningeal carcinomatosis.</i>

47
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,405
<i>That's what the doctor</i>
<i>called it.</i>

48
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:01,408
<i>Tiny seedlings</i>
<i>that the cancer planted</i>

49
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,745
<i>in the lining of my spine.</i>

50
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,265
<i>The little bastards</i>
<i>are Satan's diet pill.</i>

51
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,486
<i>I used to think</i>
<i>I understood pain.</i>

52
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,937
<i>A burn, a cut, a broken bone.</i>

53
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,562
<i>Heartbreak.</i>

54
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:20,661
<i>But this is as if I've been</i>
<i>dipped in the River Styx</i>

55
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,332
<i>and all the suffering</i>
<i>of all the souls that ever were</i>

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,369
<i>or will be has soaked my body.</i>

57
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:32,140
<i>My body doesn't belong to me--</i>

58
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,547
<i>not that I'd want it</i>
<i>in this state.</i>

59
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,211
<i>I'm starting</i>
<i>to look less Samantha</i>

60
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,014
<i>and more Endora every day.</i>

61
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,983
<i>And what could be more painful</i>

62
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,153
<i>than having to tell your child</i>
<i>that you're going to die?</i>

63
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:48,351
<i>The doctors say it's terminal.</i>

64
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,014
Do me a favor.

65
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:53,160
Die before Thanksgiving,
so none of us have to suffer

66
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:56,964
through that mess of raisins
and Styrofoam you call stuffing.

67
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:02,236
<i>They say love</i>
<i>is the best medicine.</i>

68
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,272
You are so beautiful.

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,109
You're just a fool in love.

70
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:11,011
You like the way I look,

71
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,047
take a picture.

72
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:16,250
A month from now, I'll be a...

73
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:20,821
a balding and
toothless skeleton.

74
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,024
So run away with me.

75
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:26,977
Paris.

76
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,063
Rome. Marrakesh.

77
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,466
We can spend
that month together.

78
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:45,279
I don't want you
watching me decay.

79
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,548
Are you scared?

80
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:51,385
I'm not scared of dying.

81
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:54,555
I'm scared of living like this.

82
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:58,992
The constant pain
and the ugliness.

83
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:03,163
You ever consider
making it stop?

84
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,233
No.

85
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:08,602
I wouldn't give anyone
the satisfaction

86
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,904
of me killing myself.

87
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:12,573
Mm.
I'll stay alive

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,541
just to spite them.

89
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:16,977
You know,

90
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,380
the only reason...

91
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,986
...my cancer is
moving so fast

92
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,622
and my hair's falling
out like dead weight...

93
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:36,363
...is because one of those
girls is coming into her own.

94
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,199
<i>Flexing her muscle.</i>

95
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,469
<i>I just have to figure out</i>

96
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:45,739
<i>which one of those</i>
<i>little pecker-heads it is.</i>

97
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,344
Bitch.

98
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:52,429
Her name is Nan.

99
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:53,597
Dark-sided.
The whole lot of them.

100
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,731
They worship the devil.

101
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,433
That's not true, Mother.

102
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:58,435
Where else could they get
their dark power from?

103
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,220
Look what they did to you.

104
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,688
You don't get it!
They saved me!

105
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:06,193
Only Jesus can save you.

106
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:08,228
But only if you repent.

107
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,448
Only if you cleanse yourself
of all the impurities.

108
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:16,119
"Let the wicked forsake
their ways and the unrighteous

109
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:17,204
their thoughts."

110
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:20,007
Nothing happened in that house.

111
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:22,426
You brought this on yourself.
You had no business going

112
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,644
to that house.
You don't have

113
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,345
to do this, Mother.
Oh, but I do.

114
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,681
You're unclean.

115
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,183
From the inside out.

116
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,101
But we're going to fix that.

117
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:35,422
Take off your pants.

118
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,523
<i>Don't! No, no! No! No!</i>

119
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,775
She's hurting him.

120
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,611
Sit down, Nan.

121
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:34,581
Let go of everything
outside this room right now.

122
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,084
Losing Queenie
is a terrible failure.

123
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,318
My failure.

124
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,822
But as of now,
she's dead to me.

125
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,491
And no one else will slip
through the cracks.

126
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,059
Let's get back
to the battle plan.

127
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,562
It begins with killing Fiona.

128
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,330
- We can't afford to wait.
- I should be the one.

129
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,032
I want to slit her throat.
No.

130
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,967
You have to stay hidden
until it's time.

131
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,269
She cannot know you're back.

132
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,837
We have one shot.

133
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,871
That's it.

134
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:58,939
Our plan has to be flawless.

135
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:01,241
So does the execution.

136
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,176
Failure turns this into

137
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:04,378
a suicide mission.

138
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,179
Where the hell is Spalding?

139
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,732
Delphine?
I'll get it.

140
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,027
Misty?

141
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,879
You have to save me.

142
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,302
I knew the world could be
a dark and evil place.

143
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,505
It drove me to my haven
in the swamp.

144
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:35,175
I had my Stevie. My garden.

145
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,011
I tried to
disappear into nature.

146
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:40,414
But I have been found.

147
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,126
Aw.

148
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:56,463
Aw, you probably have no idea
where you are.

149
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,465
Hmm.

150
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,535
You've been through
a terrifying ordeal,

151
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,637
but you came back.

152
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,138
You're safe now.

153
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,907
Not likely, my dear.

154
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,843
There's a man in the woods
with a gun circling the shack.

155
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:14,114
I saw the assassin when
he nearly stepped on my face.

156
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,354
Do you hear that?

157
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:23,190
No.

158
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,126
The cicadas
have stopped singing.

159
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:41,608
We hid in the swamp
through the night.

160
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,994
Made our way here
when I was sure he was gone.

161
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,662
Who's there?

162
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,798
A witch.

163
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:48,915
Seeking safety.

164
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,650
Somebody is looking to kill me.

165
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,802
You're Misty Day.

166
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,271
You were set on fire
and left for dead.

167
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,474
Whatever troubles you had,
they are ours now.

168
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,010
You're under
the protection of this coven.

169
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,146
This is your house.

170
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,214
Could my friend stay, also?

171
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,364
I left her out back
in the greenhouse.

172
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:32,342
Hello?

173
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:34,994
Don't worry.
You're amongst friends.

174
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:39,633
Of course I am, Cordelia.

175
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,935
So long as Fiona isn't with you.

176
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,272
Myrtle? Oh, my God.

177
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,207
I thought I'd never
see you again.

178
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,976
Poor choice of words, girl.

179
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,678
But given
my wretched appearance,

180
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,681
maybe it's a good thing
you're blind as a butter knife.

181
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,083
How did your hair
grow back so quick?

182
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,286
Oh, little bird,

183
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:02,189
I've been buying in bulk
from North Korea for years.

184
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:05,659
What have they done to you?

185
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,395
I've lost my eyes.

186
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:11,498
You were burned at the stake,

187
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,534
and our own Supreme murdered
one of her witches.

188
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,336
I'm afraid
this coven has fallen

189
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,405
on hard times.

190
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:19,840
Or maybe it's the <i>best</i> of times.

191
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,441
Resurrection

192
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,376
is a feat more difficult

193
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:26,179
than all the tests
of the Seven Wonders.

194
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,248
Those of us who
have recently died

195
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:31,435
have been brought back to life
by the hand of one person here.

196
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:33,892
Misty Day.

197
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,191
Behold, our next Supreme.

198
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,508
Our journey starts today.

199
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:50,117
Sort some sounds
and read the books,

200
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,017
and we'll be on our way.

201
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,142
I can't.

202
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,704
Not now.

203
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:01,147
We're doing a thing downstairs,
so you have to stay here, okay?

204
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,982
And get real smart.

205
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,300
So you can finally tell me
what's going on in your head.

206
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,523
Relax.

207
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:11,712
We're sharing him, remember?

208
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,168
What's this?

209
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,570
We're gonna be busy all night.

210
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,772
Now he has something to do.

211
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,741
Why can't he watch porn and
jerk off like any other guy?

212
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,577
And why can't he learn something

213
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,445
so he can rejoin society
and have a life?

214
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,550
Be good, baby.

215
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,819
We'll have fun later.

216
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:59,839
See if you can guess...

217
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,729
Mothballs and history.

218
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:10,867
It's a cocktail I swoon for.

219
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,685
- I feel like a queen.
- How does

220
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,721
putting on this smelly old stuff
help us get rid of Fiona?

221
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,856
It's part of a ceremony
called the "Sacred Taking,"

222
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,859
which allows for the ascension
of the new Supreme.

223
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,228
And we're sure Misty's
the next Supreme?

224
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,597
I'm certain of her credentials.

225
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:25,999
She's brought back

226
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,269
more people from the dead
than Jesus Christ.

227
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,203
Disappointed?

228
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:32,438
You thought it was you,
didn't you?

229
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,140
Well, I knew it wasn't you,

230
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,976
because when Fiona cut
your throat, you died.

231
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,145
It could be any one of us.

232
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,180
Not really.
It's pretty obvious.

233
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,682
And what does that mean?

234
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,851
Being the Supreme
isn't something to wish for.

235
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,754
It's not a gift. It's a burden.

236
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,590
How many of these
women had happy lives?

237
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,760
They had the power,

238
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,562
but with it came the crushing
responsibility of the coven.

239
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,098
They all bowed
under the weight,

240
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,869
except my mother"
who ran from it.

241
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,873
Can I say something?

242
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,109
I don't want to be the Supreme.

243
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,978
Nobody gets to choose.

244
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,796
When Fiona dies,

245
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:17,216
whoever it is... will be.

246
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,722
Now, give me your hands.

247
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,923
We're ready to begin.

248
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,864
<i>The Sacred Taking is a ritual</i>
<i>used in times of crisis</i>

249
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,233
<i>to ensure the survival</i>
<i>of the coven.</i>

250
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:36,069
<i>It has been invoked three times</i>
<i>in our history.</i>

251
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,272
<i>The first, during</i>
<i>the Salem Witch Trials in 1692.</i>

252
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:43,910
<i>The coven had decided</i>
<i>to flee south,</i>

253
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,878
<i>away from Salem</i>
<i>and the persecution</i>

254

<i>and Terminer.</i>

<i>The reigning Supreme</i>
<i>at that time, Prudence Mather,</i>

<i>suffered from consumption,</i>

257
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,589
<i>and knew she would be too weak</i>
<i>to make the journey.</i>

258
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,761
<i>She gathered her witches</i>
<i>and invoked the Sacred Taking.</i>

259
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,134
<i>It's the most hallowed</i>
<i>sacrifice a Supreme can make.</i>

260
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:11,604
<i>Prudence took her own life,</i>

261
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:14,140
<i>which allowed a new Supreme</i>
<i>to rise</i>

00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,542
<i>and lead them to safety.</i>

running in the ditch... ♪

327
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:00,239
Going somewhere?

328
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,809
Oh.

329
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:06,578
Is everyone back from the dead,

330
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:09,548
or have I already died
and gone to heaven?

331
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:13,218
Well, I suppose
it would be hell, you know.

332
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:16,922
I've been resurrected by
our new Supreme, young Madison.

333
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,192
She rather reminds me
of you in your youth,

334
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:23,195
thin as a pin with a dreadful
case of the "me, me, mes."

335
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,363
Yes.

336
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,150
Well, I wish her the best.

337
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:32,704
I will be... on the island...

338
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,239
of Patmos.

339
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,958
That's not one of
the choices, darling.

340
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:39,044
Take your own life
or be burned, I believe it was.

341
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:42,581
No, I'm not ready.

342
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,418
I have finally

343
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:49,746
found someone belong to.

344
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:56,028
Someone I truly love.

345
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:58,931
No details, darling.
I couldn't bear it.

346
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:02,201
I am very ill, Myrtle.

347
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,061
I won't st long.

348
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,762
And he wants

349
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,464
to take care of me.

350
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,400
You haven't thought
through this, Fiona.

351
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,970
Maybe it's your weakened state.

352
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,468
You're still
my beautiful angel.

353
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,393
<i>This dream of a perfect</i>
<i>love you're clinging to</i>

354
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:32,297
<i>is just a nasty trick</i>
<i>life is playing on you.</i>

355
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,967
You will die the same way
you lived your life--

356
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:39,037
alone and disappointed
by everyone.

357
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,444
What's the matter?

358
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:50,348
Huh?

359
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,417
<i>He won't stay till the end.</i>

360
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,386
<i>They promise,</i>

361
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:56,888
but... they don't.

362
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:59,891
<i>You are nothing...</i>

363
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:03,528
but an envious old bitch.

364
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:24,482
Where are you going?

365
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,986
This is taking too long
for you to die.

366
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,725
<i>Don't... don't leave.</i>

367
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:35,727
The smells--
they make me sick.

368
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:40,698
Your breath, your piss,

369
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,501
your shit-- this whole room
smells of death!

370
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:45,670
I know. I' die soon.

371
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:46,838
I promise.

372
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:57,015
How'd it go?

373
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,484
Boffo.

374
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:01,219
She thinks
I'm the next Supreme.

375
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,388
Why can't it be me?
Because you have

376
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:05,257
no style and your pits
smell like fish sticks.

377
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:09,694
Do you think I could
be the Supreme?

378
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:15,200
You guys suck balls.

379
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:21,456
Nan...

380
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:45,897
Luke?

381
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:55,240
Luke?

382
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:05,650
Luke?

383
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:11,056
Oh, God.

384
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:14,426
You're preparing the corpse.

385
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:18,730
Be a dear, will you?

386
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,099
Come hold this mirror for me.

387
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,368
My hand shakes so
from those meds.

388
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:33,978
Life is a carnival, Myrtle.

389
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,583
Oh, my God.

390
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,419
Do you remember Levon?

391
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:44,155
The drummer with The Band.

392
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:46,791
Great God, he was something.

393
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:49,160
I was so crazy about him.

394
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:53,798
We had such a...

395
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:57,402
wild six months
together in Woodstock.

396
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,704
Anyway, the point is...

397
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:06,411
...some play it safe
on the merry-go-round,

398
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:10,181
others go for the thrills
on the roller coaster.

399
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:15,653
I mean, I could sit here
and boo-hoo my choices,

400
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,723
torment myself...

401
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:22,193
over the selfish detours
I have taken.

402
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:28,733
But what good
would it do now? Hmm?

403
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:32,537
Do me a favor, get me
my fur from the closet.

404
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,811
They were all over me
at season.

405
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,249
But Levon, mm...

406
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:45,917
Oh, my.

407
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:48,786
It was preemptive, I suppose,

408
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:50,955
my leaving.

409
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:55,393
Get out of town before
they run you out on a rail.

410
00:25:57,897 --> 00:25:59,931
I've always been rigorous

411
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,834
about not staying too long
at the party.

412
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:04,636
Bad form.

413
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:07,005
Know when it's over.

414
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,809
Look after my beautiful Delia,
will you?

415
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:15,713
My most...

416
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:19,050
terrible failure.

417
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:22,820
One that'll torment me
into eternity, I imagine.

418
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:30,128
And you've chosen the
perfect color for your lips.

419
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:32,263
I could never
pull off the corals.

420
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:43,308
Make sure they hang my portrait
in the place I chose.

421
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:48,379
Don't let them store me
in the basement

422
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:51,149
with that disgraced...
Russian witch.

423
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:15,573
Half of it's paste,

424
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:19,177
but goddamn half of it's good.

425
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:34,626
Madame.

426
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:36,227
Wake up.

427
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:44,235
Spalding?

428
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,336
You need to take this. We must
purge you of this poison.

429
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:55,684
You can speak.

430
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:56,702
Yes.

431
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,626
I was murdered.

432
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,328
Those idiot girls thought
they could silence me,

433
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,430
but they've only given me voice

434
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,432
here in the spirit world.

435
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,032
300 years,

436
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:10,369
my family has been
a clan of watchers.

437
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:13,873
And now...

438
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:16,275
I see everything.

439
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:25,852
Take this.

440
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,656
No, Spalding...

441
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:32,925
you don't understand.

442
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:35,528
I am finally...

443
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,864
trying to do...

444
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:40,600
something decent...

445
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,636
something noble for e coven.

446
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,739
Horseshit.

447
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:52,678
You're making a martyr
of yourself by giving up.

448
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:55,047
You've been tricked.

449
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:59,318
You've allowed a pack
of lesser witches to buffalo you

450
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:01,254
into this ignominious end.

451
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,623
I won't permit it.

452
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:06,859
I don't understand.

453
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,428
They've been running
a number on you.

454
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:10,930
Huh?

455
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:13,432
Madison Montgomery
is not the next Supreme.

456
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,635
She didn't conquer death.

457
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:18,905
She was brought back
by some dirty little...

458
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:21,774
swamp witch.

459
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,610
They've been leading
you to your doom

460
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:26,812
with lies.

461
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,015
Lies...

462
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:31,951
you swallowed more easily

463
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:34,620
than those pills.

464
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,088
Huh?

465
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,760
Oh, Spalding...

466
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:17,763
you've always been
my silent sentinel.

467
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:22,201
And I will avenge your murder.

468
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:27,373
Right after
I've avenged my own.

469
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:41,754
Delphine?

470
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,494
Is that a Jumpin' Jack
with cheese I smell?

471
00:30:57,404 --> 00:30:59,005
Mmm.

472
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,406
Oh!

473
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:01,907
Heaven.

474
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,410
Ain't they feeding you?

475
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:07,747
All they ever do is bleed me
for her poultice.

476
00:31:07,814 --> 00:31:11,917
Come tomorrow, I'm
gonna be dry as a bone.

477
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:20,393
Whatever did I do
to deserve this betrayal?

478
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,729
Didn't you like my pot pie

479
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:26,265
and my peach crumble

480
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,101
I learned how to make
just for you?

481
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:34,206
You put me in here.

482
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:36,175
You can get me out.

483
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:38,344
Only for a minute,

484
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:41,414
just so I can stretch my legs.

485
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:45,418
This cage is just
un-unfit for a human.

486
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,520
Which is why
it's so perfect for you.

487
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:49,422
What I told you

488
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:51,223
about feeding the animals?

489
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,692
Queenie?

490
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,093
I'm sorry, reine.

491
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:57,563
Mm.

492
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:08,874
You know,

493
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:12,278
when I had the idea
to have you brought back to me,

494
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:16,949
I thought of all the many ways
I could dispose of you.

495
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,819
But I've found
it give me great pleasure

496
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:23,089
just to know you in a cage.

497
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:25,524
Shut your mouth, Negress.

498
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:29,228
Bring me something to
drink in a clean glass,

499
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:31,063
so I can enjoy my
food in silence.

500
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:32,498
I'm not your damn maid!

501
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,166
And if I were you,

502
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:36,936
I wouldn't be so eager
to show my arrogance

503
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:38,738
from that side of the cage.

504
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:42,374
What you gonna do? Kill me?

505
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,579
I can't die.

506
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:52,418
Eh, throw me back in the box.

507
00:32:52,485 --> 00:32:54,887
I seen enough of this world.

508
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:56,789
I'll take no part

509
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:59,291
in a country that has a darkie
in the White House.

510
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:04,497
Hundred years from now,
when they dig me up again,

511
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:07,800
the natural order
will be restored.

512
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:18,110
You think I only have
those two choices?

513
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:20,412
The mistake you make is

514
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,615
from a lack of imagination.

515
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:25,518
I'm not afraid of you.

516
00:33:25,585 --> 00:33:28,320
I wouldn't give you
that satisfaction.

517
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:35,161
Dear God!
Oh, my God!

518
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:37,429
You know, you're right,
Delphine.

519
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:40,499
This gave me no satisfaction.

520
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:44,253
But we've only just begun.

521
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,715
We can't go next door.

522
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:53,667
It's the first place
she'll look.

523
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:55,180
Then where?

524
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:56,228
I don't care.
Anywhere.

525
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,498
Just us.

526
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,084
You mean
boyfriend-girlfriend?

527
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:04,340
Yes, there's an intruder
in my house right now.

528
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:06,066
I'm staring at her.

529
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:07,835
She's armed and dangerous.
That's a lie!

530
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:10,804
How dare you come into my house
after what you've done.

531
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:12,506
Stay away from her!

532
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:14,074
We're leaving, Mother.
You can't stop us.

533
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:15,209
The hell I can't.

534
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:16,710
I'm your mother.

535
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:19,313
I made you and I can unmake you.

536
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:28,489
No!

537
00:34:29,924 --> 00:34:31,608
Luke.

538
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:33,760
Don't leave me!

539
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:35,946
I'm your Supreme.

540
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:54,431
How about something
less doleful, Myrtle?

541
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:57,635
It's Schubert's last sonata.

542
00:34:57,702 --> 00:35:00,537
It's all about acceptance
of death.

543
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:02,406
This is
so incredibly

544
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:04,742
stressful and weird.

545
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,844
You don't feel anything?

546
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:09,830
My stomach feels like
a storm's about to hit,

547
00:35:09,915 --> 00:35:12,483
but it's probably
just my nerves.

548
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,753
I'm not exactly what you call
a natural born leader.

549
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,588
Neither was
King George,

550
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,657
but one rises to the occasion.

551
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:21,792
Your feet should be
getting warmer.

552
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:24,094
I'm told it starts

553
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:25,646
as a tingle in the cooch.

554
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:31,001
For me, it started
as a classic migraine.

555
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:33,938
Auras, nausea,

556
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,607
pain behind the eyes.

557
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:38,108
You know, Myrtle,

558
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:41,845
Schubert was emotional,
not mawkish.

559
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:48,252
So where...

560
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,988
is this gifted little
swamp witch

561
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:53,424
that everyone's been
talking about?

562
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:01,131
I'm going with him.

563
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,609
Well, well, well.

564
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:15,245
So you're the swamp witch
I've heard so much about.

565
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:17,548
It's not every day

566
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:20,184
we see a witch with
the power of resurgence.

567
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:24,521
According to my daughter,
a power fit for a Supreme.

568
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:25,823
Hey, ladies,

569
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,425
you can't be in here.
Yes, we can.

570
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:31,996
You're gonna tell us
what happened here, Officer.

571
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:34,068
There was a shooting.

572
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:36,237
Maybe a robbery gone wrong.

573
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:37,538
Son has a grievous head wound.

574
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:39,006
Mother is dead.

575
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,441
We're waiting on the coroner.

576
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:45,846
That's perfect.

577
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:47,431
Here's one

578
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:50,117
you can... use your talent on.

579
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:15,276
They think maybe
it was a robbery.

580
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,244
And my mother? Misty?

581
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:19,280
I saw Fiona go inside.

582
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:21,081
Lead me.

583
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:31,225
Wait.

584
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,161
There's something here.

585
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,673
This was no robbery.

586
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:22,576
He was after us.

587
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,947
This road goes two ways.

588
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,565
See if you can guess

589
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,017
which road
the friends will take.

590
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,418
- Click...
- This...

591
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:33,220
This road goes two ways.

592
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:35,522
Click on the microphone button

593
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:37,257
and say the word.

594
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,480
It's not you.
We're under attack.

595
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,949
None of us are safe.
I have to get you out of here.

596
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:03,717
No!

597
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:08,622
This... road...

598
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,025
goes...

599
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:15,696
two... ways.

600
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:20,768
What does it mean, Kyle?

601
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:26,507
I...

602
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,708
love...

603
00:39:29,677 --> 00:39:32,212
...you.

604
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:41,472
I love you, too.

605
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,437
Where are all the servants?

606
00:39:57,489 --> 00:39:59,740
I might have slept until noon.

607
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,780
You didn't really
make this coffee

608
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:08,515
all on your own, did you?

609
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,350
I'm not entirely helpless,
Mother.

610
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:13,020
Oh, no, of course not.

611
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:15,656
Though I do think we might
move your bed downstairs.

612
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:18,792
I mean, we wouldn't
want you to have a...

613
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,961
accident coming
down those steps.

614
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:21,862
Wouldn't we?

615
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,397
I'd much rather be found

616
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,765
at the bottom of those stairs

617
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:25,999
than be burned at the stake.

618
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:28,635
According to Auntie Myrtle,

619
00:40:28,703 --> 00:40:30,264
that just hurts like hell.
Oh, Cordelia.

620
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,905
You don't really think I'd do

621
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:33,340
something like that
to my own daughter?

622
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,641
Cut the shit, Fiona.

623
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,176
We both know I tried

624
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:38,078
to orchestrate
your death last night.

625
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,546
Yes.

626
00:40:39,614 --> 00:40:41,315
And very nearly succeeded.

627
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:43,817
If you're waiting for me
to get down on my knees

628
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,619
and beg for your forgiveness,
you can forget it.

629
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,421
It's not gonna happen.

630
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,789
Beg?

631
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:51,158
I might throw you a parade.

632
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:54,228
What you and your girls
demonstrated last night

633
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,213
was real grit.

634
00:40:56,297 --> 00:40:58,966
I finally have hope for
the future of this coven.

635
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:03,270
And you,

636
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,338
my dear...

637
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,311
...I'm so proud of.

638
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:16,183
You really are my daughter.

639
00:41:19,704 --> 00:41:21,688
Now you're proud?

640
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:26,560
Hell...

641
00:41:26,628 --> 00:41:29,163
if I knew how easy it was
to win your approval,

642
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,265
I would have made
an attempt on your life

643
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:32,733
way before now.

644
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:36,970
What's this?

645
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,338
A silver bullet.

646
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:41,308
I found it last night
in the street.

647
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,609
It's blessed.

648
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:43,977
Mm-hmm.

649
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,445
Witch hunters.

650
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:47,881
I'll admit, when I found it,

651
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:49,416
I was glad you were
still with us.

652
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:52,452
We need you now, Fiona.

653
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,721
More than ever.

654
00:41:58,178 --> 00:42:00,761
Where are the servants?

655
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:50,957
Who was it?

656
00:42:51,077 --> 00:42:52,732
I don't know.

657
00:42:53,622 --> 00:43:04,416
