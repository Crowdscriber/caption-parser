1
00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:02,472
Please, please, please, please.

2
00:00:02,473 --> 00:00:03,853
Okay, what is this?

3
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:04,993
We're making sure I'm tall enough

4
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:06,495
to ride all the rides
at Disneyland.

5
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:07,919
Without having
to spike up my hair.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,029
Buddy...

7
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:10,376
We are good to go.

8
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,421
Sweet!

9
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:12,595
I have been waiting
for this day

10
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,583
ever since the doctor pointed

11
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:16,328
to the ultrasound of
your mom's womb and said,

12
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:18,703
"either that's a fifth limb,
or you got a boy."

13
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:19,511
Okay, no. Gross.

14
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:20,035
All right...

15
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:22,402
I want everybody
to eat a lot at home

16
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:24,432
because "the happiest
place on earth"

17
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,832
is also home to the most
expensive churro on Earth.

18
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,632
Come on. This is gonna be awesome.

19
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,921
Who doesn't love
a day at Disneyland?

20
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:32,561
Can't you and mom
go without me?

21
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:34,584
You're the kid.
I think we need you to get in.

22
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,504
Well, it couldn't come
on a worst day.

23
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,634
The technology sector is tanking.

24
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,405
We're doing a stock market
project in school,

25
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,972
and today's the last day.

26
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:44,306
We all get a thousand
fake dollars to invest,

27
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:45,917
and as the market
closed yesterday,

28
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,269
I'm in the lead.

29
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:50,240
I may not be the tallest
or the most athletic,

30
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,177
but someday
I will be the richest,

31
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,324
which is good because
the ladies love that,

32
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:57,121
and I've grown accustomed
to a certain lifestyle.

33
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:00,243
Do you really wants girls who
only want you for your money?

34
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:01,882
I'd like to have that option.

35
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,745
Manny, put the stock away
and put your ears on.

36
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,646
Mom, I don't think you have
to wear one of these.

37
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:09,800
Be a kid! Put them on!

38
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,266
Really? Those shoes?

39
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:12,944
What?

40
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,803
Do you know how much walking
you have to do at Disneyland?

41
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:18,470
Why do you think they have
so many fat people on scooters?

42
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,403
I like wearing the high heels.
I'm fine.

43
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:22,586
It's just like that jacket
you refuse to bring

44
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,474
when I say, "take a jacket."

45
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,170
"Don't tell me what to do!
I'm fine!"

46
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,521
Huh? And you're not fine.

47
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,062
You're cold and shivering,

48
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:31,379
and I look like the jerk who
won't give his wife a jacket,

49
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,614
so I do, and then
I'm cold and shivering,

50
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,045
and I brought a jacket.

51
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:37,766
Are you done with your
boring jacket story?

52
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,796
Because we're going to hit traffic.

53
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,422
Tell you one thing.
I'm not gonna give you my shoes.

54
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:45,752
Ah! That must be Ethan.

55
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:46,937
Who's Ethan?

56
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:47,947
Didn't I tell you?

57
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,744
My friend Bethenny's nephew
is coming with us today.

58
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,228
He moved to town
to go to college.

59
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,393
He's very nice, very smart,
big hockey player.

60
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:56,337
I know what you're doing.

61
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,336
Really? She was so subtle.

62
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:00,010
Haley has a thing for bad boys,

63
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:02,174
which was so me.

64
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,326
Clearly.

65
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,593
So if she's going to be
leaving the nest soon,

66
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,622
we'd prefer it was not
on the back of a motorcycle.

67
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:10,889
My college roommate
had a motorcycle.

68
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:14,357
Man, I had some good times
on the back of that thing.

69
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:16,881
I can't believe you did this.

70
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:19,298
I'm not gonna babysit Bethenny's nephew.
Alex can have him.

71
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,353
Okay, I don't need your rejects.

72
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:24,035
Hi. Hi, Ethan!
I'm so glad you could make it.

73
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:24,750
Thanks for inviting me.

74
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,574
Sure.

75
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:26,991
Hi. I'm Al--

76
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:29,748
My 14-year-old sister.
Ethan, was it?

77
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,813
Yeah.

78
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,090
Synced by YYeTs, corrected by gloriabg
www.addic7ed.com

79
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,463
And that's my grandpa
and his wife Gloria

80
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:48,513
and her son Manny.

81
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,781
Wow. You guys have a big family.

82
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,623
Big family.

83
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,654
She likes him!

84
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:55,530
Yeah, who wouldn't?

85
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,946
Where'd you find him,
a Tommy Hilfiger catalog?

86
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:00,229
He got a 2200 on his S.A.T.s.

87
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,614
And those eyes...

88
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,352
Okay, did you get him
for Haley or for you?

89
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:04,525
Mitchell.

90
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:06,041
You know, I haven't been here

91
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,481
since dad brought us
when we were kids.

92
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:11,330
Ohh, yeah. Remember?
You cried in the Abraham Lincoln thing.

93
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:12,643
Hey, he's a great president,

94
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,819
and it was the first
robot I ever saw.

95
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:16,775
When Claire and Mitchell were young,

96
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:19,305
their mom and I were gonna
take them to Disneyland.

97
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,530
But that morning, Dede and I
got in this huge fight

98
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:24,221
over something or other--
surprise, surprise--

99
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:26,321
and I ended up taking
them on my own.

100
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,677
Claire's biggest fear
was running into the evil queen.

101
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:32,833
My biggest fear was
that I married her.

102
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:35,531
Okay, people over 46 inches,

103
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,695
first stop-- Indiana Jones!

104
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:39,255
Have fun on the teacups, Lily.

105
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,278
Okay, let's do this.

106
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,969
Oh, okay, wait just
a second here, everybody.

107
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:44,982
All right.

108
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,348
Is that a leash?

109
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,509
No, it's a child safety tether.
This way, sweetie.

110
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:52,329
It-- it's a leash.

111
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:53,803
Don't-- don't judge us.

112
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:55,046
Go on.

113
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:56,939
We have a runner.

114
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,281
Lily is going through a phase--

115
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,710
at least... Oh, we hope it's a phase.

116
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,762
She bolts every chance she gets.

117
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,128
Lily!

118
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,655
Lily!

119
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:05,871
Lily!

120
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,053
So we had no choice

121
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:09,283
to put her on a child safety tether.

122
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:10,442
It's a leash.

123
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,386
And we did have a choice.

124
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,434
Lily, sweetie, don't pull.

125
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:17,806
Lily, heel!

126
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,033
Dad.

127
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,666
If I'd had known you guys
were gonna do this,

128
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,737
I'd have brought Stella.

129
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:22,577
It was Cam's idea.

130
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:23,637
So much for the united front.

131
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,560
I'll have you know, despite
all your jokes, Lily enjoys it.

132
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:29,255
Okay, sweetie, you're not helping.
You're not helping.

133
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:31,095
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You guys, is that Dylan?

134
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:31,780
What?

135
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,753
Oh, jeez.

136
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:34,076
Dylan?!

137
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:35,920
Oh. Hey!

138
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:38,644
Uh, what are you... I didn't
even know you were in town.

139
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,835
Either did I...

140
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,461
Know you were in town.

141
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:43,428
This town. Anaheim.

142
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:45,005
I thought you were still in Wyoming.

143
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:47,298
I was, uh...

144
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,499
But, um...

145
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,406
Oh, shoot.

146
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,317
You know, I, uh, gotta meet up
with some friends

147
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,318
and I'm... really late.

148
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:55,787
It was nice to see you, Haley,

149
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:56,760
and everybody.

150
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:57,791
Hi.

151
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,476
And dude I don't know.

152
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,234
I'm Ethan.
It's nice to meet you.

153
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,170
And polite dude I don't know.

154
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,285
Did Haley used to date
that guy or something?

155
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:12,533
Yep. You date her, that's
the club you're joining.

156
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,025
Of course he would
still look amazing.

157
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,195
Does he? I hadn't noticed.

158
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:20,431
Did you know that Ethan
plays the trumpet?

159
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:23,049
No great surprise
with those lips of his, huh?

160
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,164
Coo-coo-ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson.

161
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,148
Okay, buddy, moment of truth.

162
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:31,344
Yes!

163
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:35,359
- This is gonna be so awesome!
- Yeah!

164
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,857
In 45 minutes,
this is gonna be so awesome!

165
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,203
Yeah!

166
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,571
Look, Reuben,

167
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,397
I have some underperformers
I have to unload,

168
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:51,539
and I don't have access
to a computer.

169
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:53,324
Log in as moneydelgado--

170
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:54,264
Manny!

171
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:55,203
By all means, Reuben,

172
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,060
go get a popsicle
while the Nikkei closes.

173
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:58,427
I wanna be a pauper.

174
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:00,682
Mom, my stocks just took a dive.

175
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:02,583
Your phone is about
to take a dive.

176
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,617
Come on! Where do we want to go next?

177
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,854
Oh! Ethan and I want
to try the haunted mansion.

178
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,409
There is no you and Ethan.

179
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,529
Let's go to the jungle cruise.
It's right there.

180
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,230
Why? Tired of walking
in those heels?

181
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,584
No. You tired of being
with a hot wife?

182
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:18,949
Well, well, well.
What do you know?

183
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,228
Another caring parent
with a child safety tether.

184
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,918
See? We're not the only
people who use them.

185
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,325
Hi! Aren't they adorable?

186
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:25,609
Oh, and look at your cutie!

187
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,940
Oh, well, yes.
She just wanted to say hi.

188
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,597
Oh. Sorry.
They're a little feisty today.

189
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,148
Oh! No problem.
She's friendly.

190
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,615
Rex, gentle.

191
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:34,357
Oh, his-- his name's Rex, huh?

192
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,109
Yeah.

193
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,046
Oh, okay. Lily, no, sweetie.
Lily, um...

194
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,766
Oh. Sorry. He-- he just gets excited.

195
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:39,503
Oh, yeah, no-- oh, no problem.

196
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:40,906
Lily, stop moving, sweetie.
Stop moving.

197
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:41,939
Okay, you got this.

198
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,651
Okay. Okay. Good girl! Good girl!
Sorry.

199
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,571
You know what the fight
with Dede was about?

200
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:53,004
I taped a football game over
an episode of "Dallas."

201
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:56,059
Who bails on a family trip
to Disneyland

202
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,250
over something like that?

203
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,016
Ironically, Dallas
was playing in the game.

204
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:02,140
And I remember pointing
that out to her,

205
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,046
and then I remember

206
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,366
a video cassette flying at my head.

207
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:06,962
You do not play the cello.

208
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:08,917
I do. Even geekier-- I'm good.

209
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:09,962
Okay, answer me this--

210
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,515
I will answer you this.

211
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:14,075
Why do people carry cellos around?

212
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,246
You know, people aren't expected
to lug a piano around.

213
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:16,955
What's the cutoff?

214
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:20,466
I know, right?
Like, go where the cello is.

215
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,485
Oh, look at this.
I think I've inadvertently

216
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,789
set up my 14-year-old
with a college boy.

217
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,574
The boy was your doing?

218
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,976
Yes. Yes, and he was perfect,

219
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:32,401
and Haley was into him until,
of course, we ran into Dylan.

220
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,599
I mean, come on, dad.
What are the odds of that happening?

221
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,780
It's a small world.

222
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,328
Yes, it is.

223
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,009
- You see what I did there?
- I did.

224
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,655
- 'Cause it's a ride.
- I got it. Got it, dad. I got it.

225
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,607
It's so frustrating because...

226
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,217
I know I can't run
Haley's like for her,

227
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:45,396
but if she would let me,
I would be so good at it.

228
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:48,070
Right, 'cause parents always know
what's best for their kids.

229
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,551
You remember that nice
girl at the office

230
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,901
I tried to fix Mitch up with?

231
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:53,541
No offense, dad,
but I think I probably have

232
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,767
a better sense of what
my kids need than you did.

233
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,621
I think it's cute you think that.

234
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,664
Mom!

235
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,472
It was so awesome!

236
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,384
The jeep was jerking around...

237
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,213
And--and there was a lot
of sharp turns and big drops.

238
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:06,222
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

239
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:06,950
It just kept going.

240
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,481
Wow. You okay?

241
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,381
Great. Why wouldn't I be?

242
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,610
Because you're kinda leaning on me.

243
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,645
Well, isn't that
what a marriage is?

244
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:16,500
Ohh. Oh, Alex, stop touching him.

245
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:18,444
Oh. You look like hell.

246
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,855
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

247
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,822
I think that ride
did something to me.

248
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:23,381
The fluid in your
inner ear is thickening.

249
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,750
That's what happens
when you get old.

250
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,356
It is?

251
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:27,420
Yeah, you can't take the motion.

252
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,904
I gotta pop a dramamine
to get in my swivel chair.

253
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,962
That is not it.
I'm king of the roller coasters.

254
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:33,940
I think I just put

255
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,443
too big of a whipped cream smile
on my pancake this morning.

256
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:37,684
You guys wanna
go on Matterhorn?

257
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,861
Luke, I think me and your dad
are gonna sit this one out,

258
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,742
maybe get one them big pickles.

259
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:44,809
No! You're gonna have to eat
that pickle on your own, Jay.

260
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,910
I still got a few good years left.

261
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:48,097
Luke, wait up!

262
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,451
I'll race you there!

263
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,013
I'm good. I'm good.

264
00:08:58,585 --> 00:08:59,990
Okay, everybody's looking at us.

265
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,512
I haven't been judged by this many people

266
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,515
since I forgot my canvas
bags at whole foods.

267
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:04,527
Yeah, well, maybe they're staring

268
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,625
because we have what they want.

269
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,950
Whoa! Oh, a pet daughter.
'Cause that...

270
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,500
You know, I don't care
what people think.

271
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:10,860
If I thought it would keep
my daughter safe,

272
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,127
I would have a kangaroo pouch
sewn into my midriff.

273
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:15,557
That's gonna work out really
well for you as a single parent.

274
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,988
Okay, we just got a glare
from Mr. Socks-with-sandals.

275
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,400
All right, that's it.

276
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,212
Lily, I'm gonna take off this leash.

277
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:21,923
I think it's a mistake.

278
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:23,291
But I don't want you to run away,

279
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:24,998
'cause that would be
very, very unsafe,

280
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,088
and if we lost you,

281
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,601
you'd be very scared,
and we'd be very sad. Okay?

282
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,151
Okay.

283
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:30,882
All right.

284
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,889
See, Cam? You treat her
like a human being

285
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,428
and she acts like one.

286
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,010
Chip 'n Dale!

287
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,466
Oh, great. Now she's chasing squirrels.
Lily!

288
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:39,900
Honey, come on!

289
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,699
Lily! Lily!

290
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,690
Hey! How was Splash Mountain?

291
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,878
It was great! Maybe we go again.

292
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,974
No, thanks.
There was no reception in there.

293
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,878
You know how many bars I had?
Zip-a-Dee-doo-dah.

294
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:56,888
Reuben, talk to me!

295
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,614
Must be nice to get out
of those shoes for a minute.

296
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,105
I don't know what you talking about.

297
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:03,127
Nothing. I'm just making conversation.

298
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:04,895
Hey. Check it out.

299
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,145
I bought one of those
souvenir photos

300
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,936
with you and Manny on the ride.

301
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,772
Boy, it looks like
you're having a good time.

302
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,982
Wait a minute.
What's that in your hand?

303
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:15,741
Are those shoes?

304
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,492
I'm not even sure
that that is us, Jay.

305
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,913
Why are you walking
around in pain?

306
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,067
Just admit the shoes
were a bad idea.

307
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,869
I am not in pain.

308
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,701
I just didn't want my favorite
walking shoes to get wet there.

309
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:28,175
Okay, my bad.

310
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,259
Well, we've gotta meet
everybody in Tomorrowland,

311
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,310
so we'd better get movin'

312
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,979
'cause it's all the way
on the other side of the park.

313
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,411
I'm fine.

314
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:38,085
You just try to keep up with us.

315
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,877
I can't take this.

316
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,252
Dad, throw your hands up! It's fun!

317
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,797
Oh, yeah, it is fun!

318
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:59,114
Reuben, if you heard about
that stock at a birthday party,

319
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,256
it's already too late.

320
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:01,316
Gloria!

321
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:03,699
Gloria, sit down for a second.

322
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,726
I'm fine, Jay.

323
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:05,724
Please?

324
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,521
Look...

325
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,049
You may not be in pain...

326
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,583
Okay.

327
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,941
But I'm in pain just
thinking you're in pain.

328
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,861
So humor me for one minute.

329
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:15,542
What are those?

330
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:19,414
There wasn't a big selection
at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique.

331
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:20,785
Are you crazy?

332
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:24,418
I cannot walk around
in public with these...

333
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,213
things.
They're so yellow and so ugly.

334
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:29,754
And... and they're so softy

335
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,545
and so comfortable.

336
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:33,224
Jay, what is this?

337
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:36,215
Thank you for going
shopping for me.

338
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,487
Thank you for worrying
about my feet.

339
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:42,209
Thank you for giving me
your jacket when I'm cold.

340
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,863
You're such a good man, Jay.

341
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:45,307
Thank you. Mmm.

342
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,377
I didn't expect you to be so...

343
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,160
So nice.

344
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:55,080
Why are you so surprised?

345
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,455
Now please don't go all Latin
on me when I say this.

346
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,602
Is it possible

347
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,311
you get angry from time to time

348
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,895
because you're always wearing...

349
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:09,163
uncomfortable shoes?

350
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,838
Maybe.

351
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:17,620
Can you get me a couple of more?

352
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:19,280
Maybe they have purple?

353
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,148
Whatever you want, honey.

354
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:23,314
All I'm saying is,

355
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,049
it seemed like you
were pretty into Ethan

356
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,196
until Dylan showed up.

357
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:29,130
Don't get me wrong.
Ethan's nice, but he's no Dylan.

358
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:30,664
Maybe that's a good thing?

359
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,917
Why? Because Dylan's a free spirit?

360
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,037
He's too edgy for you?
He plays by his own rules?

361
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,247
Oh, my God.

362
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:38,423
What?

363
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,716
I beg of you to turn around

364
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:44,314
and experience with me
the greatest moment of my life.

365
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,231
Your rebel boyfriend's a Dapper Dan.

366
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:53,086
Maybe that's not him.

367
00:12:57,921 --> 00:12:58,397
Dylan!

368
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:00,138
Uh, uh, sorry.

369
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:01,033
Sorry. Um...

370
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,994
It certainly seems like him.

371
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:06,770
Oh, my God. He looked like

372
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:09,210
those old pictures of dad
from High School.

373
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:11,514
So anyway, I've really been
into street art lately.

374
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,642
Oh, there's a really great exhibit downtown.
I'll take you.

375
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:16,337
Oh, on what, your razor scooter?
Mom wants you.

376
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:16,965
I-I-I...

377
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:20,121
Ethan! I've been looking
all over for you!

378
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,419
I remember I was on
Pirates of the Caribbean,

379
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:29,150
and this whole fight with
Dede was really eating at me.

380
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:32,063
And there was this angry
animatronic wench

381
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:34,441
with a rolling pin, chasing
some poor pirate around.

382
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:37,291
They were on a track,
running in circles,

383
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,014
so he could never
get away from her.

384
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,120
And I remember thinking,

385
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,941
I can't save you, buddy,
but I'm getting off this ride.

386
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,411
And-- and we were
going around a corner,

387
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,931
and I was screaming
and I swallowed a bug.

388
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:53,676
Oh, being tail is everything
that I dreamed it would be.

389
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:54,502
What should we do next?

390
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:55,545
Sit down.

391
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:56,452
Where we gonna sit down?

392
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,701
The ground. Here,
this is good right here. Oh!

393
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:00,536
Are you okay, dad?

394
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:02,469
No, I'm not okay.

395
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:05,881
I hate to tell you this,
but these rides are killing me.

396
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:07,660
B-but you're
the king of roller coasters.

397
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:08,761
I know!

398
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:11,310
Something happens
when you get older.

399
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:13,367
Guess you can't take it.

400
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,796
One of my favorite
things in the world

401
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:18,529
is doing stupid
fun stuff with you,

402
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,928
like pogo stick basketball

403
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,957
or trying to get a swing to go
all the way around.

404
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,288
Next time, we should sit
on a fire extinguisher.

405
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,974
Yes, or a bottle of coke
and some mentos.

406
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,936
Honestly, though,
the way I'm feeling right now,

407
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,031
I don't know if there's
gonna be a next time.

408
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:35,827
Dad, we can always
find cool stuff to do.

409
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:38,340
Even if you're old
and in a wheelchair,

410
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,328
I'll take you to the mall

411
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,014
and push you as fast
as you wanna go.

412
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,612
Really? You'd do that?

413
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:44,732
Heck, yeah.

414
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,108
And we'll pop some wheelies, too.

415
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:46,931
That sounds fun.

416
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,724
And I'll take you to the top
of a huge hill and just let go.

417
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,728
Okay, we'll nail down
the specifics later,

418
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:54,283
but that... that's really nice.

419
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,250
So do you still wanna talk or--

420
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,620
No, go. Ride Space Mountain.

421
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:01,977
Uh, at the end,
when they take a picture,

422
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,549
do something hilarious
for both of us.

423
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,919
You're gonna die.

424
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,017
When you see it,
not 'cause you're old.

425
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,506
Lily! Lily, stop!

426
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:13,626
Dad! Dad, grab her!

427
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:15,555
Hey, I gotcha, you little monkey!

428
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,618
Thank you.

429
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:17,901
Hey, Cam, I got her.

430
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:19,708
We're in Fantasyland.
Where are you?

431
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,441
Okay, it's Toontown, not Toonton.

432
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:24,123
You've been watching too much PBS.

433
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:25,008
Thank you.

434
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,533
All right, honey, come here.

435
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:29,170
I don't like this thing.

436
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:29,640
Yeah?

437
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,440
Well, I don't like running
like a crazy person

438
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:34,290
through Downton Disney--
Downtown Disney.

439
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:35,996
I don't know what to do.

440
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:38,117
Well, the leash is not the answer.
You want my help?

441
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:38,916
Yes, please!

442
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,046
'Cause I can fix this for you
in about two minutes.

443
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,703
Come on, baby girl.
Come with me.

444
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,138
We'll be right back.

445
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:45,055
Okay.

446
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:46,791
Where we going?
Oh, this way?

447
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:52,437
Manny, you don't sound very happy

448
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:54,651
for a kid that is flying
an elephant.

449
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,314
I lost to Durkas. It's not fair.

450
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,987
He wanted to buy IBM because
he thought it was funny to say.

451
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:03,536
Well, I'm glad that you lost.
Fake money has changed you.

452
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:07,129
Where is the Manny that used
to stop to smell the roses?

453
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,586
He took a bath
on a solar start-up in San Jose.

454
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:12,771
You have been so busy burying
your face in your phone

455
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,021
that you barely said
hello to your family,

456
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:17,792
you gave Winnie the Pooh
the cold shoulder,

457
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:18,828
and you haven't even noticed

458
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,368
that pretty girl
in the blue elephant

459
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:23,435
that has been smiling at you.

460
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:27,113
Not my type, but
still it's nice to be noticed.

461
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:28,064
You see what happens

462
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,446
when you're not burying
your head in business?

463
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,523
You're right.
I'll try to be more present.

464
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:37,258
What the heck's on your feet?

465
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,368
They're slippers!
They're like pillows.

466
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,178
Attagirl.

467
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,677
You're welcome.

468
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:48,333
Look. Your dad got her
baby high heels,

469
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,224
which we said we were
never gonna let her wear.

470
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:50,918
I love 'em.

471
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,514
You look gorgeous, sweetie.

472
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,095
Oh, my gosh. You felt
people judged us before?

473
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,413
Wait till they meet little Miss Anaheim.

474
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,820
Who cares? Look at her.
She can barely move.

475
00:16:58,232 --> 00:16:59,504
Thank you, dad.

476
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,159
You know what? She's got pretty
good gams for a 3-year-old.

477
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:07,415
Cheese!

478
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,502
Got it. Thanks, Little John.

479
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:10,532
Thank you!

480
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,629
Ooh, they have corn dogs.

481
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,551
We gotta get one before we go back.
They are legendary.

482
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:16,158
I'll be right back.

483
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,192
Okay.

484
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:18,969
Haley!

485
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,296
It's me. Dylan.

486
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,995
I'm in the bear suit.
I borrowed it to talk to you.

487
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,896
Why are you dancing like that?

488
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:28,333
This is what Little John does.
Maybe.

489
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:29,950
I don't know what movie
this dude is from.

490
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:31,695
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

491
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,286
Well, I'm not talking to you.

492
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,742
No, you can talk.

493
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:37,901
I know, but I'm mad.

494
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:40,029
You came back to town
and didn't even call me.

495
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,867
I was embarrassed.

496
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,675
I lost my job at the dude ranch,

497
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,898
and I wanted to get
my act together first.

498
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,001
But the four dweebs on a bike act?

499
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,393
Hey, the Dapper Dans
are a main street tradition

500
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,401
since 1959.

501
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,023
Hey, what's going on?

502
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,055
Nothing.

503
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,992
I still love her, Ethan.

504
00:17:58,669 --> 00:17:59,842
Okay, how do you know my name?

505
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:00,751
It's Dylan.

506
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,653
Look, I don't wanna harsh your day,

507
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:07,389
but I never stopped
loving Haley and I never will!

508
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:08,727
I-is this some sort of joke?

509
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:10,246
Do I look like I'm joking?

510
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:11,835
Dylan, let's not do this now.

511
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:15,169
It has to be now.
I've got a parade at 3:00.

512
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,551
Hey, seriously, dude, back off.

513
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:19,362
Okay, that was my face.

514
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:22,351
And you're the one
who needs to back off.

515
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:26,297
You...

516
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:28,979
Okay. This thing's kinda heavy.

517
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,712
I can't get up.

518
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:33,049
Ethan? Ethan, what is going on?
What are you doing?

519
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,525
Uh, hi, Mrs. Dunphy.

520
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:35,658
Help me up.

521
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:37,371
No.

522
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,316
If I could get up, I would-- uhh!

523
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,413
Come on, Lily sweetie.
Keep up, honey.

524
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:49,677
Come on. Phil, you don't look
like you're doing very well.

525
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,521
Maybe because I officially
became an old man

526
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:53,285
back there at Thunder Mountain.

527
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,932
Oh, my goodness.
You are burning up.

528
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:57,544
You might have the flu.

529
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:00,688
A bunch of guys
at work had the flu,

530
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,572
and we all drink orange juice
out of the same carton.

531
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,148
We should get cups.

532
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,904
Luke, did you hear that?!
I have the flu!

533
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:08,864
Oh, gosh, no.

534
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:10,630
Glad we didn't share that pickle.

535
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,072
Hey, everybody.

536
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,682
Oh, hey, hey, guys.
Where's Ethan?

537
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:16,628
Oh, he's staying.
He ran into some friends.

538
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:18,100
But Dylan got fired, so...

539
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:21,453
don't freak out.
We have to give him a ride home.

540
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,073
And we're back together.

541
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,300
Yay.

542
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:28,119
Hey, no one goes home
till we hit the Lincoln thing.

543
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,038
Yawn.

544
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,823
Don't even try to fight it.

545
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,328
Yeah, he made us go
when we were kids.

546
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:36,603
Come on, people! It's a robotic president!
What's not to love?

547
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:37,949
A robotic president?

548
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,108
So my plan was,
drive Claire and Mitchell home,

549
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:42,430
put them to bed,

550
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,086
pour myself a big
tumbler of scotch,

551
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:47,372
and tell Dede it was over.

552
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,901
But on the way out,
we made one last stop.

553
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,860
If destruction be our lot,

554
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,606
we ourselves

555
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,845
must be its author and finisher.

556
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,761
As a nation of free men,

557
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,837
we must live through all times...

558
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:05,904
I don't know what happened.

559
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,443
Maybe it's what robot Lincoln
said about a man's duty

560
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:11,365
or keeping the union together.

561
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:13,315
Maybe I just chickened out.

562
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,462
But I realized that
staying with my kids

563
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:18,844
was more important
than leaving my wife.

564
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,823
Now that's not the right
decision for everyone,

565
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,222
but it was the right
decision for me.

566
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,928
And in that faith,

567
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,529
let us, to the end,

568
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:31,045
dare to do our duty

569
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,515
as we understand it.

570
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,649
So I stuck it out until
they were grown...

571
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:39,016
Jay, you want to join me
in the jacuzzi?

572
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:41,526
And the universe rewarded me.

573
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:47,432
Here we go!

574
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,340
Hey, dad, roller coast fist bump.

575
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:00,904
What was that?

576
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,610
Is this gonna be so awesome!

577
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,855
Close your eyes.
It makes it more fun.

578
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,778
Oh, yeah. That is more fun.

579
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:24,473
