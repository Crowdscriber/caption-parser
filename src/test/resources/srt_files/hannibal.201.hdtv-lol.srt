that previously
had no connections.

You catch these killers
by getting into their heads.

This is a loss.

Will may be convicted of five murders
while I am only maybe convicted of one.

Well, you're not on trial.

And so will you.

I mean, according to
Will Graham, this was all you.

Will was your bloodhound.
You can't ignore where

56
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:10,680
- he points.
- I'm not ignoring it.

57
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:17,103
You have to investigate me. It's
in my best interest, and yours.

Yes, it is.

But I also can't ignore

60
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:23,743
the fact that
my bloodhound went mad

61
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:25,728
before he pointed
in your direction.

62

We can't define Will
only by his maddest edges.

According to Dr. Bloom,

81
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,841
you were warned against putting someone
with Will Graham's issues into the field.

82
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,485
Yes. That's correct.

83
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,938
Were you aware that Dr. Bloom
would be filing this report?

84
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,708
Yes. She told me
what she was going to do.

85
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,726
Did you advise her

86
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,529
- against it?
- I told her she should do

87
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:45,116
whatever she felt was
necessary. Evidently,

88
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,887
she felt it was necessary
to file the report.

89
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,239
These are allegations
of misconduct.

90
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,242
- It's damning stuff, Jack.
- I never stated anywhere

91
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,827
that this was misconduct.

92
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,846
In my opinion,
it was a lapse in judgment.

93
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,131
A lapse in judgment is
misconduct.

94
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,102
There'll be an internal
investigation.

95
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,055
There should be.

96
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,923
A federal

97
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,111
examiner is someone who arrives
at a battlefield

98
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,880
after the battle
and bayonets the wounded.

99
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,903
You have wounded
Agent Crawford.

100
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:23,888
Who do you think is gonna be
getting the bayonet?

101
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,347
There is a general desire

102
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,132
to see this go away

103
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,851
quickly and quietly.

104
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,420
In light of that,
Dr. Bloom,

105
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:43,741
I would greatly appreciate it
if you would recant your report.

106
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,344
No. Will Graham's life has
been destroyed.

107
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,480
How that happened has to be
a matter of record.

108
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm sorry, Jack.

109
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,972
Dr. Bloom is not
easily swayed.

110
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:01,809
This is going to get ugly.

111
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,828
It already has.

112
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:13,454
- Was there a storm?
- Ah, it looks like someone's

113
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:17,508
- blasting beaver dams again.
- Aw, man.

114
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,498
It smells real bad down here!

115
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,885
Probably dead beavers!

(He shouts.)

117
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,573
Get me out of here! Ah!

118
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:02,670
Will Graham has asked
to see me.

119
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,159
I would like to see him.

120
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:14,132
I continue to be curious
about the way he thinks,

121
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,635
despite all that's happened.

122
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,671
He's still influencing you.

123
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,428
Will Graham asking to see you betrays
his clear intent to manipulate you.

124
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,532
And if I agree to see Will?

125
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,453
It betrays your clear intent
to manipulate him.

126
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:40,274
I miss him.

127
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,747
You are obsessed
with Will Graham.

128
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,085
I'm intrigued.

129
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,439
Obsessively.

130
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,258
And he will
take advantage of that.

131
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,995
Will is my friend.

132
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,249
Why?

133
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,301
Why is he your friend?

134
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:13,341
He sees his own mentality
as grotesque but useful.

135
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,478
Like a chair of antlers.

136

He can't repress who he is.

There's an honesty in that
I admire.

138
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:27,005
I imagine there's an honesty
in that you can relate to.

Dr. Lecter.

144
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,842

145
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,296
Not lost.

146

with the same, um...

150

tone, timbre, accent,

151
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:43,981
as if the words were
coming out of my mouth.

152
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:48,920
- And now?
- Now...

153
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,525
...my inner voice sounds
like you.

154
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,699
I can't get you out of my head.

155
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:08,222
Friendship can sometimes involve a
breach of individual separateness.

156
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:11,726
You're not my friend.

157
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,563
The, uh, light from friendship
won't reach us

158
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:18,850
for a million years. That's how
far away from friendship we are.

159
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,104
I imagine it's easier
to believe I am responsible

160
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,656
for those murders than it is
to accept that you are.

161
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,492
Sure is.

162
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:36,801
Your inner voice can provide a method
of taking control of your behavior,

163
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,687
accepting responsibility
for what you've done.

164
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:44,041
Giving your thoughts words
encourages clarity.

165
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,076
Oh, I have clarity.

166
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,097
About you.

167
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,853
Our conversations, Will,
were only ever about you

168
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,423
opening your eyes to the truth
of who you are.

169
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:01,592
What you did to me

170
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,761
is in my head,

171
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,780
and I will find it.

172
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:14,088
I'm going to remember,
Dr. Lecter,

173
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:17,608
and when I do,

174
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,311
there will be a reckoning.

175
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:25,299
I have huge faith in you, Will.

176
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:29,453
I always have.

177
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:04,583
I'm amazed what falls off
the best of us when moving through a room.

178
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:07,227
Lessons learned
from cellular decay:

179
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,906
Enjoy
the world while we have it

180
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:10,107
and give a little bit back.

181
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,774
When possible, I try to leave
an indelible mark wherever I go.

182
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:15,913
Hopefully not with your DNA.

183
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,353
How long
will you have my suits?

184
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,889
You might want to think about
supplementing your wardrobe.

185
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,690
- I frequently do.
- You know,

186
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,443
this is just a formality.
Nobody expects

187
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,278
to find anything.

188
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:34,448
Except for maybe Will Graham.

189
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:39,048
He'll have to be disappointed.
The beauty of what you do, Ms. Katz,

190
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,103
is in its certainty.

191
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:43,240
It'll be your evidence
that convicts Will.

192
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,294
Well, I found enough of it.

193
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,297
No need to infer or intuit
or trust.

194
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:52,917
So much simpler
than psychiatry.

195
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:56,587
Will is doing his best
to understand where he is

196
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:58,138
and why.

197
00:17:58,173 --> 00:18:02,059
You were supposed
to protect him.

198
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,395
From himself?

199
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,814
Yeah.

200
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,650
I'm not mad at you -
not any more than I'm mad

201
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:14,271
at myself. We all missed it,
whatever it was - is.

202
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,273
We all are not suspects.

203
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:21,028
You're not a suspect;
You're the new Will Graham.

204
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,942
Thank you for coming,
Dr. Lecter.

205
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:54,812
Jack, what can I do for you?

206
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,815
I was hoping you would help me
with a psychological profile.

207
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:00,034
(Man): We found
another body.

208
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:02,319
(Camera click)

209
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:04,187
This way, doctor.

210
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:18,135
This is the fourth body
we've recovered so far. There's

211
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,171
- at least one more down there.
- How long have they been here?

212
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,340
Hard to say,
but someone went through a lot

213
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:25,559
of trouble to make sure
that they were well preserved.

214
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,728
They've been coated
in some kind of resin.

215
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:30,814
The big one was partially sealed,
rotting from the inside out.

216
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,816
The other three look
like they were embalmed.

217
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:36,219
(Jack): Whatever he's doing, he's
still figuring out how to do it.

218
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,824
Were they injected
with silicone?

219
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,028
- They were injected with something.
- Silicone?

220
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:47,164
A technique for making
resin-coated models out of fish.

221
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:49,199
Helps the body retain shape

222
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,234
in death.

223
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:55,539
He's making human models.

224
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:57,591
You make models of things
that you want to keep;

225
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,593
these were tossed in the river.

226
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:03,380
Maybe they were imperfect.

227
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,052
(Jack): These are
his discards.

228
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:21,264
I'm giving you informed consent
to discuss me as your patient.

229
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:23,400
With whom?

230
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,435
Jack Crawford.

231
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:33,577
Disclosure of patient
information should be limited

232
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:36,280
to the requirements
of the situation.

233
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:40,050
What is the situation,
Hannibal?

234
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:44,354
Will Graham made accusations.

235
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,290
Jack's only being thorough.

236
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:50,728
You're keeping
Agent Crawford close.

237
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,297
We share an obsession.

238
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,654
I got to be Will Graham today.

239
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:04,274
I consulted
at an FBI crime scene.

240
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,363
I stood in Will's shoes,

241
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:12,750
looked through his eyes,
and I saw death...

242
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,422
...how I imagined
he would see it.

243
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,614
Why would you be inviting
the scrutiny of the FBI?

244
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:31,401
I'm being as open and honest
as I know how.

245
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:37,775
You maintain an air
of transparency...

246
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,931
...while putting me
in the position to lie for you.

247
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,415
Again.

248
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:49,553
You're not just lying for me.

249
00:21:56,878 --> 00:22:01,064
How far will this flirtation
with the FBI go?

250
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:07,871
It would seem Jack Crawford is less
suspicious of me than you are.

251
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:10,924
Jack Crawford doesn't know
what you're capable of.

252
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:16,680
Neither do you.

253
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,132
Come on! Come on!
(Dog barking)

254
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:40,870
Whoa!
(She laughs.)

255
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:44,290
- (Will): <i>And how are the dogs?</i>
<i>- (Alana): Good. Well,</i>

256
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:47,293
<i>Winston keeps running away,</i>
<i>but the others are adjusting.</i>

257
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,211
Where does Winston go?

258
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,209
Home.

259
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:58,504
- Well, he's not gonna find me there.
- Not today.

260
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:01,924
<i>But maybe someday he might.</i>

261
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:03,726
<i>With the right defense.</i>

262
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,763
I don't currently have
legal representation.

263
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:11,717
- You keep firing your lawyers.
- No, they're the FBI's lawyers.

264
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:15,354
Then I'll find you a lawyer who's
not affiliated with the FBI.

265
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,479
What defense
do you think I have?

266
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:25,698
Automatism.

267
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:28,317
Allows a defendant to argue
they shouldn't be held

268
00:23:28,352 --> 00:23:31,921
criminally liable for their
actions due to unconsciousness.

269
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:34,907
- Unconsciousness?
- Will...

270
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,595
...your mind was on fire.

271
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,247
You had no control
of what you were doing,

272
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:44,249
much less remember doing it.

273
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:46,469
What if I could remember?

274
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:52,108
What if I could remember
how this was done to me?

275
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:57,613
What if you could remember
how you did it?

276
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:00,533
You believe Hannibal.

277
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,953
I believe the Will Graham
standing in front of me now

278
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,122
is incapable of that violence.

279
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:10,376
<i>I believe you lost your mind,</i>
<i>and for periods of</i>

280
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,778
<i>time, you weren't</i>
<i>the Will Graham I know.</i>

281
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:14,780
I hear Hannibal's voice

282
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,883
in the well of my mind.

283
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:20,603
I hear him saying words
that he's never said to me.

284
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:23,756
It isn't my imagination.
It's... it's something else.

285
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:33,449
Have you ever helped a patient
recover memories?

286
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:35,484
(Metronome ticking)

287
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,645
Close your eyes.

288
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:56,739
(Whispering): Feel the happiness
in your limbs.

289
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:04,880
Imagine yourself in a safe...

290
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:08,300
and relaxing place.

291
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:16,892
Safe to relax completely.

292
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:25,651
No matter how deeply you go...

293
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:29,354
<i>my voice will go with you.</i>

294
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:16,752
This... this isn't working.

295
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:18,754
(Will panting)

296
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,956
What did you see?

297
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,844
Will,

298
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:26,879
what did you see?

299
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,394
Salted and ash-baked celeriac

300
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:45,564
with foraged <i>sel fou.</i>

301
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,566
Frederick, you have tested me.

302
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:50,102
♪
(Classical piano music)

303
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,437
It's rare that I cook
a meatless meal.

304
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:55,941
I lost a kidney; I have to
watch my protein intake.

305
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,627
You didn't lose it, Frederick;
it was taken from you.

306
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:01,613
I remain impressed
with your recovery.

307
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:04,416
One can grow to love beets.

308
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,754
Alana Bloom was

309
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:10,756
visiting with your former
patient today.

310
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,624
Will was never my patient.

311
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:15,427
The irony is
that he is my patient,

312
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:17,462
but he refuses to speak to me.

313
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,901
Makes me feel
like I'm fumbling with his head

314
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:24,303
like a freshman
pulling at a panty girdle.

315
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:28,473
Will is going to be a challenge
for any psychiatrist.

316
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:30,642
He is so lucid, so perceptive.

317
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,529
He's trained
in criminal psychology,

318
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,915
and he is a mass murderer.

319
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:37,616
He's a prize patient.

320
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,168
Or should be.

321
00:27:39,202 --> 00:27:42,454
How was Dr. Bloom's visit?

322
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:45,591
He asked her to hypnotize him
so he could

323
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:48,961
recover his memories.
This is delicious.

324
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:53,766
Was he successful?

325
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,935
Only in playing
Dr. Bloom.

326
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:58,754
It's sad to see
a brilliant psychiatrist

327
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:01,340
fall for such hoary
old chestnuts.

328
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,143
She wants to believe him;
I do too.

329
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:07,112
You do realize you're his
favorite topic of conversation.

330
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:10,649
Hannibal, Hannibal, Hannibal.
Not with me, of course,

331
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:13,002
but with everyone else
who will listen. He tells

332
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:15,854
everyone that you are
a monster.

333
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:21,377
Well, in that case, you are dining with
a psychopathic murderer, Frederick.

334
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:52,091
(Man): You have nice skin.

335
00:28:58,898 --> 00:29:02,217
(Honking continuously)

336
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:14,847
(Alarm chirps.)
(Honking stops.)

337
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:29,332
Dental medical records

338
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,120
placed the six - all adults,
both men and women,

339
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:34,714
different ages, different ethnicities,
all from different states;

340
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:38,293
nothing in common except they all disappeared
from their homes with their vehicles.

341
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:40,796
And they all had large amounts
of heroin in their systems.

342
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,798
Enough to be
the cause of death?

343
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,299
And then some.

344
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:48,020
What's this strange skin
discoloration on these bodies?

345
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,923
We found traces of BHT,
which is a color preservative.

346
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:53,475
He wants them to look alive.

347
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,477
Shot them up
with a little China white,

348
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:57,479
injected them
with preservatives,

349
00:30:57,513 --> 00:31:00,616
then filled the bodies with
silicone so they don't emaciate,

350
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,451
then he seals them

351
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,370
with, like, a hard resin shell.

352
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,773
What are these puncture wounds?

353
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,958
Those are like eyelets.
Um, something was

354
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,960
threaded through.
They were strung up, mounted,

355
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,479
- presented.
- So how's he choosing them?

356
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,165
We got nothing.
Appears to be random,

357
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:19,968
but if this is
the discard pile,

358
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,971
I'm curious to know
how many were keepers.

359
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,090
All right, I want a list
of any missing persons

360
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:27,092
that disappeared
along with their vehicles

361
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:29,544
in the neighboring states.
Got it?

362
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:31,063
Got it.

363
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,986
(Door buzzer)

364
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,894
It's good to see you.

365
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:49,230
Don't know how I feel
about seeing you.

366
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,732
I'll let you know when I do.

367
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,535
- Does Jack know you're here?
- No,

368
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:57,238
- but he shouldn't be surprised.
- I'm surprised.

369
00:31:57,256 --> 00:32:01,093
I'm...compartmentalizing.

370
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,962
There are
a lot of people missing.

371
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,248
Ah.

372
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,975
- You have the file with you?
- Yes.

373
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:21,763
And pictures?

374
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:24,265
Yes.

375
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:26,468
The first six bodies

376
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:30,238
were found in the same place - dumped
in a river, caught in a beaver dam.

377
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,127
What's he do to 'em?

378
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,278
He targets them,
follows them home,

379
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,865
abducts them,
and preserves them.

380
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,751
You want to know how he's
choosing them, don't you?

381
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:45,554
I thought you would
have some ideas.

382
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,423
These are DMV pictures
of people who are

383
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:52,094
still missing
under similar circumstances

384
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:54,129
from three different states.

385
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,818
Tell me what you see.

386
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,850
It's a color palette.

387
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,673
(Exhaling)

388
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:37,349
(Person choking)

389
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:54,282
(Will choking)

390
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:36,908
(Choking)

391
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:44,282
(Spitting)

392
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,635
(Coughing)

393
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:40,536
(Dog whining)

394
00:36:40,587 --> 00:36:42,922
Hi, Winston.

395
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:44,957
Come here, boy.
There you go.

396
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:50,680
I suppose
you blame me too, huh?

397
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:02,475
Hello, Jack.

398
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:11,234
You need to take
better care of this dog.

399
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:14,237
Mm. I feel horrible.

400
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:18,357
I got all the dogs chipped,
but at least they're not

401
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,359
running away to anywhere
I can't find 'em.

402
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,194
He's just looking for Will.

403
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:25,832
Hmm? Yeah.

404
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:28,234
Isn't that why you're here?

405
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:31,888
Listen, uh...

406
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:36,726
...I understand why you felt
you had to file that report.

407
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,179
You questioned my judgment
when it needed to be questioned.

408
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:43,049
Yes, it did.

409
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,786
And it will help in Will's
defense if it's in the record.

410
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:51,183
Declaring Hannibal's guilt is
more important to Will

411
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,192
than establishing
his own defense.

412
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:55,361
Hannibal's not guilty.

413
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:58,164
Neither is Will.

414
00:37:58,198 --> 00:37:59,816
But he's clinging to the hope

415
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,919
Hannibal did this so he doesn't
have to face what he did.

416
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:08,207
Convince me he didn't know
what he was doing.

417
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,093
I would really like
to be convinced, Alana.

418
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:15,047
A psychopath wouldn't be
so scared of the truth, Jack.

419
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:17,517
Will's terrified,
but that's not stopping him

420
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,519
from trying to find it.

421
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:21,888
Somebody's gotta find
the truth, eh, Winston?

422
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:27,343
If Will doesn't remember
what he did...

423
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,879
he'll never accept the truth.

424
00:38:42,943 --> 00:38:44,944
(Jack):<i>Will?</i>

425
00:38:47,297 --> 00:38:49,131
Will?

426
00:38:51,618 --> 00:38:53,853
Hey, Will.

427
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,392
Hi, Jack.

428
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,661
Where were you just now?

429
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:04,213
Gone fishin'.

430
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:06,382
What are you doing here?

431
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:09,485
I needed to remind myself
of who you once were.

432
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,487
You know, that man

433
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:14,240
whose classroom
I walked into months ago.

434
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:16,275
I remember that man.

435
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,363
Memories are all I have.

436
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:23,783
Imagine how

437
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:26,953
nice it is
to stumble on a new one.

438
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,008
I was

439
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:36,345
almost certain Hannibal Lecter

440
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,331
did this to me.
And it's a funny thing, doubt.

441
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:43,853
I had nothing to prove to myself
or... or anyone else

442
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:47,139
that Hannibal was responsible -
not even a memory.

443
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:50,610
You have something now?

444
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:52,612
You've recovered a memory?

445
00:39:52,646 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes.

446
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:56,649
That's meaningless.

447
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:58,517
Not to me.

448
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,123
He did it so well.

449
00:40:04,157 --> 00:40:07,627
I... there... there wasn't
an orgy of evidence.

450
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:09,996
There was just enough
to convince you.

451
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,850
We investigated your claims
about Dr. Lecter, Will - thoroughly.

452
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:17,837
We went over every fiber
of every stitch of clothing.

453
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:19,505
We took his DNA.

454
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:23,459
We took his fingerprints.
We found nothing.

455
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:25,478
You let the fox
into the henhouse.

456
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:28,981
You stood over Cassie Boyle's body in that
field and you described yourself to me.

457
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:31,250
No, I described
Hannibal Lecter.

458
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:33,502
I can't hear this anymore.

459
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:38,741
I... I am not the intelligent
psychopath you are looking for.

460
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:46,415
Goodbye, Will.

461
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,884
(Dejected sigh)

462
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,088
You may not believe me now.

463
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:57,059
You will.

464
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:50,146
