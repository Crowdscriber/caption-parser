<b>LOOPER</b>

8
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:27,446
<i>Time travel has not yet been invented,</i>

9
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:31,346
<i>but 30 years from now, it will have been.</i>

10
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,870
<i>It will be instantly outlawed.</i>

11
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:39,872
<i>Used only in secret by the
largest criminal organizations.</i>

12
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:45,334
...

13
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,546
<i>It's nearly impossible to dispose of
a body in the future,</i>

14
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,004
<i>I'm told, for tagging techniques
and things like that,</i>

15
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:01,822
<i>So when these criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone,</i>

16
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,534
<i>they use specialized assassins
in the present, called Loopers.</i>

17
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:12,773
<i>And so, my employers in the future
nab the target,</i>

18
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:15,431
<i>they zap them back to me, their Looper.</i>

19
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:19,117
<i>He appears hands tied, head sacked.</i>

20
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,561
<i>And I the necessaries, collect my silver.</i>

21
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,121
<i>So the target is vanished from the future,</i>

22
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:30,970
<i>And I've just disposed of a body
that technically does not exist.</i>

23
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,683
<i>Clean.</i>

24
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,752
...

25
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,941
- How's your French?
- Slow.

26
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,311
- How's the coffee?
- Burned.

27
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,523
...

28
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,026
Two, Jed.

29
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,453
Hey Joe.

30
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,318
Be at the club tonight?

31
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:30,468
Yeah.

32
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,449
Four, Jed.

33
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:57,717
...

34
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,447
You walk around.

35
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:37,933
Around the bike, I'm not kidding!

36
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,240
Hey, I don't want no problems,

37
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:41,566
- you're rude, if you had a mama...
- Wide around, you shit!

38
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:42,854
she didn't raise you right.

39
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,256
That's funny, because I'm gonna pick

40
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,161
your mother later on my bike,

41
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,949
and I'll take my Blunderbuss...

42
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,839
- Hey Seth.
- Hey Joe.

43
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:53,107
- That's new.
- Yeah, thanks.

44
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:56,543
God damn thing won't fucking tart.

45
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,733
So you're going to the Belle?

46
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,490
- So you bought a slab bike?
- Yep!

47
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,795
How much did that thing set you back?
How much?

48
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,764
I was gonna pull up it tonight.

49
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:10,254
Congratulations, you're
pulling up with me instead.

50
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,608
Don't.

51
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,523
If we're going in, don't do that.

52
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:16,514
- Chicks dig the TKs.
- Ain't true, pal.

53
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,581
- Yes, they do!
- Well that's tacky. Don't do it.

54
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,313
<i>About 10% of the population
has this TK mutation.</i>

55
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,511
<i>When they first appeared,</i>

56
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,027
<i>everyone thought
we were gonna get superheroes.</i>

57
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,865
<i>But it turns out this was it.</i>

58
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,069
<i>Now it's just a bunch of assholes
who think they'll blow your mind</i>

59
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,365
<i>floating quarters.</i>

60
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:49,456
<i>It's like this whole town.</i>

61
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,244
<i>Big heads, small potatoes.</i>

62
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:02,898
Full house tonight, Joe.

63
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,319
We'll stick back stage.
Just meetin' up, in and out.

64
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,868
Cash in your Blunderbusses?

65
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:07,984
Hardly. Right, Seth?

66
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:10,734
Hardly. I'm with Joe.
Just meetin' up and in and out.

67
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:17,950
- Hey, Suzie!
- Hey!

68
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:20,746
- You're working a shit tonight?
- Yeah.

69
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,192
Yeah, but a Gat Man bought me
out already for the night.

70
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,662
Sweetie, I gotta work.

71
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,593
Joe.

72
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:45,765
What?

73
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:47,957
Zack, he's in there right now with Abe.

74
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,163
- For what?
- Closed his loop.

75
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:52,217
No shit.

76
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,814
<i>There's a reason we're called Loopers.</i>

77
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:01,535
<i>when we sign up for this job,
taking out the future's garbage,</i>

78
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:05,558
<i>we also agree to a very specific provisal.</i>

79
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,231
<i>Time travel in the future is so illegal,</i>

80
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:13,187
<i>that when our employers
wanna close our contracts,</i>

81
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,394
<i>they'll also wanna erase any trace</i>

82
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,647
<i>of their relationship
with us ever existing.</i>

83
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,728
<i>So if we're still alive 30 years from now,</i>

84
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:28,237
<i>they'll find our older self,
zap him back to us,</i>

85
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:30,878
<i>and we'll kill him like any other job.</i>

86
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:35,417
<i>This is called 'closing your loop. '</i>

87
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:40,520
<i>And you get a golden pay day,
you get a handshake,</i>

88
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:42,576
<i>and you get released from your contract.</i>

89
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:44,422
<i>Enjoy the next 30 years.</i>

90
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:49,351
<i>This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward thinking people.</i>

91
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,795
So we're... celebrating?

92
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:31,594
Look out!

93
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,752
You did it!

94
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:39,837
- Jesus.
- Fuck, Joe!

95
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:06,876
...

96
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,952
What's that, fourth loop
closed this month?

97
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,987
Loop closed! Here we go.

98
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,297
Loop closed, baby!

99
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:07,259
Yeah.

100
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,684
Seth. Jesus...

101
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:28,290
They'll be here any minute,
Are they here?

102
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:30,916
- No. Who?
- Christ.

103
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,814
Joe, Christ!

104
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,914
- What are you doing?
- Give me the gun.

105
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:37,734
- Alright...
- Come on.

106
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:39,477
- Get away from the window.
- Christ, Joe.

107
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:40,166
Quiet down.

108
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,070
You can protect me a little, right, Joe?

109
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,728
- Just so they don't...
- What did you do?

110
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,734
Jeez.

111
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:48,745
This is like a nightmare.
This is a nightmare.

112
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,482
<i>I knew then what he did,</i>

113
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,401
<i>so I don't know why I asked.</i>

114
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,215
<i>What did you do?</i>

115
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:59,508
He... he was singing.

116
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:04,862
through the gag-it-sack,
but I could hear the tune.

117
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:08,289
Deep memories...

118
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,791
My mom in a dark room,

119
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,275
taking care of me, singing that tune.

120
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:19,881
That's how I knew... it was me.

121
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,753
I...

122
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,818
Joe, I couldn't.

123
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,983
I couldn't, I had to see.

124
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:35,071
He told me...
I remember.

125
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:37,966
He told me... there's a new

126
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,404
holy terror boss in the future,

127
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,159
and he's closing all the loops.

128
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,134
The Rainmaker, they call him.

129
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:50,743
He told me and...
and then he wanted a cigarette,

130
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:54,593
so I untied him and he gives me this look.

131
00:11:57,644 --> 00:11:59,834
And he just starts running.

132
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,162
I had my Blunderbuss,
so I know I've got

133
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,170
fifteen strides 'till
he's out of my range.

134
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,594
And they come, and they go,

135
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,701
and I just watch him till he's gone.

136
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:15,014
<i>This is called, 'letting your loop run. '</i>

137
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,058
<i>It's not a good thing.</i>

138
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,020
What do I do?

139
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:23,464
You're the only friend I got, Joe.
You gotta help me.

140
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,856
Fucking idiot coming here.

141
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,445
You can't be here.

142
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,586
I'll give you some money,
that's it, then you leave.

143
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,999
Joe, a little money! Where am I gonna go?

144
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:36,466
You hop a freight train,
you beat it the hell out of town...

145
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,432
Shut up and don't move.

146
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,796
Tell Cor to watch the window outside.

147
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,915
Yeah, I'm on my way.

148
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,430
Kid Blue, Joe, come on!

149
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,432
Just a minute!

150
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,162
Open this goddamn door!

151
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:57,661
I can't do anything for you, Seth.

152
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,646
You gotta hide me! Please, Joe! Please!

153
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,526
Hide me! Please, Christ!

154
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:04,647
Please, buy me some time, and I'll go!

155
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:05,584
Please!

156
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,791
Are you gonna make me
bust this door down?!

157
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:09,703
Yeah, hold on!

158
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,927
Please...

159
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,729
Move!

160
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,608
Come on, Joe! Open up!

161
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:22,376
Ok...

162
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,011
Jeez...

163
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,995
That took a while.

164
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:39,724
You think it's easy lookin' this good?

165
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,569
Tye is gonna watch your apartment
while we go have a talk with Abe.

166
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:47,507
- There's coffee in the tin.
- Thank you.

167
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,798
Give me two minutes.

168
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:23,240
Do you know why they call that
pea shooter here a Blunderbuss?

169
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,552
Cause it's impossible to hit
anything further than 15 yards.

170
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,341
Impossible to miss anything closer.

171
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:33,072
It's a gun for fuck-up turkeys.

172
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,529
Not like a Gat.

173
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:39,124
A Gat has a range.

174
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,065
Accuracy.

175
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,852
Kid, cut it out, or you'll
blow your other foot off.

176
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,456
What the hell's goin' on out there?

177
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,835
- How you doin', Abe?
- Hey.

178
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:19,246
You didn't shoot your other
foot off, did you, Kid?

179
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:23,792
Right.

180
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:27,625
My great-grandfather
told my grandfather,

181
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,398
mens are like spiders.

182
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:33,368
It's the little ones you
gotta be careful of.

183
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,797
I don't know if I agree with that.

184
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,026
Yeah?

185
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,122
What the fuck did my
great grandfather know?

186
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,139
<i>This man is from the future.</i>

187
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:45,498
<i>He was sent back here by the mob.</i>

188
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,774
<i>A one way ticket to run the Loopers.</i>

189
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,407
<i>That's low effort, even for Abe,</i>

190
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,565
<i>so to pass the time, he recruited
some real muscle, the Gat Men.</i>

191
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,285
<i>Now he runs the city.</i>

192
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:57,879
<i>Any other city, that'd be impressive.</i>

193
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,350
How can you kids stand
to wear those chilipers?

194
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,280
- ... cravats.
- Ties.

195
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:18,171
Ridiculous. You're aware
we don't have a dress code.

196
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:19,297
Fashion.

197
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,882
You know... well, you don't know.

198
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,625
The movies that you're dressing like
are just copy of other movies.

199
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:28,082
It's Goddamn twentieth
century affectations.

200
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,778
Do something new,

201
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:34,985
Put a... glowing thing around your neck,
or use rubberized...

202
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:36,842
Just be new.

203
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,312
- OK.
- Well.

204
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:45,275
Well, it's nice chatting with you, Abe.

205
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,686
You do like you, Joe.

206
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,694
But I'm sure enough that
Seth paid you a visit,

207
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,572
and we're gonna have to do
something about this.

208
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,079
Seth?

209
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,414
You're expecting that we're
going to break your fingers

210
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:57,108
with a hammer or... something awful,

211
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,618
but, I'm gonna diffuse
that tension right now.

212
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,144
That's not gonna happen.
What is gonna happen,

213
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,909
is that I'm gonna talk for a little.
Not even that long.

214
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:08,681
And then you're gonna
give up your friend.

215
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,914
My friend? Seth!
Sorry, I'm... I'm confused.

216
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,734
Well then, I'll talk a little.

217
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:17,825
You know, you were the
youngest Looper I ever hired.

218
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:20,479
You looked Goddamn ridiculous, they said.

219
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,748
Blunderbuss up to here on you.

220
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,551
I remember they brought you in,
I forget what it was for.

221
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,317
Watch shop.

222
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:28,929
That's... yeah.

223
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,611
You rolled one of our fronts,
the watch shop.

224
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,396
And they had you, you know,

225
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,351
you know this kid,

226
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:38,116
like an animal. But you...
you looked at me,

227
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:40,268
your hair stuck to half your face,

228
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:43,349
just one eye looking at me.
I could see.

229
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,501
I could see in it happen on the TV,

230
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:50,078
the bad version of your life.
Like a vision,

231
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,886
I could see, how you'd turn bad.

232
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,079
So I changed it.

233
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:59,364
I cleaned you up,
and put a gun in your hand.

234
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:03,219
I gave you something that was yours.

235
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:04,856
And I am grateful for that, Abe.

236
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,272
I gave you something that was yours.

237
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,239
And I remember that, kid...

238
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,465
And I think if you ask yourself,

239
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:18,502
if you ask who would I sacrifice
for what's mine,

240
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:22,161
I think Seth would be deep
and cozy inside that circle.

241
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,176
Hey...

242
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,743
Now I'll show you how much I know you.

243
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:28,973
I'm not even gonna break you,

244
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,137
I'm just gonna set you back aways.

245
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:35,325
Now we know that you've
been stashing half your bars.

246
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,563
Which is smart, no law against it.

247
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:40,234
You're gonna get out,
you're gonna go overseas, right?

248
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,043
- Studying up your Mandarin?
- French.

249
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,088
French?

250
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,967
You give him up,
or you give us half your stash.

251
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:54,403
You're willing to dump your silver
in the dirt... for Seth.

252
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,159
- You gonna kill him?
- Not if we can help it.

253
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:10,797
It's too cataclysmic
a change for the future.

254
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:13,016
Now, what we'll do is
dangerous in that regards,

255
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:15,200
well not... that dangerous
than just killing him,

256
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,557
on top of which a man from
the future runs free long enough,

257
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:22,017
this... time travel shit just...

258
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,171
fries your brain like an egg.

259
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:25,972
Why the fuck French?

260
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:27,751
I'm going to France.

261
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:30,325
- You should go to China.
- I'm going to France.

262
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,935
I'm from the future,
you should go to China.

263
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,620
- I'm going to France.
- You're going...

264
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,227
Floor safe's under the rug.

265
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,882
6-7-4-2.

266
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:59,125
It's the little ones that get you.

267
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,146
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe?

268
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:09,445
On the house.

269
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,357
Call the Doc.

270
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:49,802
Be at 75 Wire street

271
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:52,247
in 15 minutes.

272
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,964
Wait!

273
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,846
Wait!

274
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:59,544
Wait.
Wait...

275
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,907
I can't remember my mother's face.

276
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,764
She used to run her hands through my hair.

277
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:14,452
Just like this...

278
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:34,355
I think I've just let my
best friend get killed tonight.

279
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,390
For silver.

280
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:43,286
Shit!

281
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:46,921
Yes. Shit...

282
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,365
Sorry.

283
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:56,171
I'm gonna give you some money.

284
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:59,014
I've been stashing my silver for years,

285
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:00,492
and I'm gonna give you half of it.

286
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,923
It means you can leave.

287
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,216
You wanna give me half your silver?

288
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:07,346
Silver's got strings.

289
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:09,357
I got my job...

290
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:12,719
you got yours.

291
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,468
It's sweet of you to worry about me,
but I'm doing fine.

292
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,303
Why don't we just stick
to 'services rendered'?

293
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:28,080
Is this what you want?

294
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:41,969
"HOP A TRAIN OUT OF TOWN. RUN."

295
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,420
- There's 24 of it.
- Count.

296
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,598
Two more trips, just do it.

297
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:43,313
Goddammit!

298
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:47,870
Look, the Kid, I'm sorry!

299
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:50,683
Tell Abe I'm gonna fix this!
I'm gonna find him.

300
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:52,786
Tell him I'm gonna kill him!

301
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:57,241
Motherfucker!

302
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,336
...

303
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,974
...

304
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,092
...

305
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:56,851
...

306
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,927
...

307
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,587
...

308
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,842
...

309
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:26,680
...

310
00:34:49,676 --> 00:34:50,586
Shit!

311
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,487
You got any aspirin?

312
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,349
All of them, please.

313
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:23,130
I'm gonna take that coat too.

314
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:43,993
What are you doing?

315
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:48,863
What are you doing, Joe?
I told you to run.

316
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:13,912
Don't do it, you idiot.

317
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:27,641
Fucking Kid Blue.

318
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:30,090
That's two more trips, just do it.

319
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:30,281
You stupid little shit.

320
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,432
Walk the pavement,
sweep the train yard,

321
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:45,682
every second that passes is bad.
Get on it!

322
00:37:47,843 --> 00:37:49,096
Little shit!

323
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,843
I can fix this.

324
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:54,048
- I can find him!
- Go home.

325
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,234
Let the grown ups work...

326
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,988
Kid Blue.

327
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,889
You bastard.
How do I find you?!

328
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:31,181
...

329
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:42,701
Coffee?

330
00:40:44,314 --> 00:40:45,908
Please.

331
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:49,251
Black, and some water.

332
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:51,062
Anything else?

333
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:53,028
Are we eatin'?

334
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:55,153
I ordered something.

335
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,552
Steak and eggs. Rare and scrambled.

336
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:59,391
Two steak and eggs, coming up.

337
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:06,006
It must hurt.

338
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,328
I wasn't sure you'd remember her.

339
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:09,711
Yeah, I put it together.

340
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,235
Clever.

341
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:19,636
You know...

342
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:22,708
There's another girl who
works here on the weekends.

343
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,456
- Jenny.
- Right.

344
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:27,708
Less letters.

345
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:29,577
That'd be better.

346
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,453
...

347
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:40,669
- How's your French coming?
- Good.

348
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:43,330
You gonna tell me how
to be learnin' Mandarin?

349
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:45,366
I never regretted learning French.

350
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:48,705
...

351
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,713
No? Well, you'll get there eventually.

352
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:54,704
Look, obviously.

353
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:57,325
Alright, listen. I know this
is a hard situation for you,

354
00:41:57,377 --> 00:41:59,155
but we both know how this has to go down.

355
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:01,314
I can't let you walk away
from this time alive.

356
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:05,001
This is my life now, I earned it,
you've had yours already.

357
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,836
So why don't you do what old men do,

358
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:09,006
and die? Get the fuck out of my way.

359
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:12,267
Why don't you take your little gun
out from between your legs and do it...

360
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:16,488
.. Boy.

361
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:23,920
It's hard staring into your eyes.

362
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,838
It's too strange.

363
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:29,329
You're face looks backwards.

364
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:31,407
Yeah.

365
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:34,871
So, do you know what's gonna happen?
You've done all this already, as me?

366
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,333
I don't wanna talk about time travel shit.

367
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,994
Cause if we start talking about it,
then we're gonna be here all day

368
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,578
talking about it,
making diagrams with straws.

369
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,420
It doesn't matter.

370
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:44,949
If I hurt myself, it changes your body.

371
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:46,598
This is what I do now,
change your memory.

372
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:48,039
It doesn't matter!

373
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,019
My memory is cloudy.

374
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:05,039
Too cloudy,

375
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:07,658
cause my memories aren't really memories,

376
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:10,773
they're just one possible eventuality now.

377
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:14,516
And they grow clearer...

378
00:43:15,104 --> 00:43:17,673
or cloudier as they become
more or less likely.

379
00:43:18,047 --> 00:43:19,885
But then they get to the present moment,

380
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:21,854
and they're instantly clear again.

381
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:25,474
I can remember what you
do after you do it.

382
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,229
And it hurts.

383
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:32,023
So even when we're apart,

384
00:43:32,054 --> 00:43:34,586
you can remember what I do after doing it?

385
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:39,117
Yes. But this is a precise
description of a fuzzy mechanism.

386
00:43:39,175 --> 00:43:41,017
It's... it's messy.

387
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,680
All I know,

388
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,090
I know two things.
I know what's happening in my head,

389
00:43:45,138 --> 00:43:47,334
and I know that
you're still gonna meet her.

390
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,715
Who?

391
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:01,669
She's gonna save your life.

392
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:10,008
For a long time she thought
we were gonna...

393
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:12,312
we'd have a baby.

394
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,619
Would have been a great mother.

395
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:21,118
She wanted it so much.

396
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,646
Yeah, but she...

397
00:44:23,816 --> 00:44:25,465
How?

398
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,081
You say she saves my life?

399
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:29,720
Yes.

400
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,210
Let's take a look at your life.

401
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,791
You're a killer, you're a junkie

402
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,776
with a fucking child mentality.

403
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:40,482
What's mine? My life, save your life?

404
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:41,836
You're asking me how?

405
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:44,146
The question is why? Why would
some sacrifice their life?

406
00:44:44,162 --> 00:44:45,510
Why would someone waste themselves?

407
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:47,920
Cut your high and mighty bullshit.
I don't need my life...

408
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:49,730
Shut your fucking child mouth.

409
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:54,376
You're so self absorbed and stupid,

410
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,759
and she's gonna clean you up
and she's gonna take...

411
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:08,823
You are gonna take her love...
like a sponge.

412
00:45:09,056 --> 00:45:11,298
And you think, maybe
I'm clear of the past,

413
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:14,027
maybe I'm safe.

414
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,773
Yesterday...

415
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:19,867
Yesterday what?

416
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,908
Thirty years from now is yesterday.

417
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:26,347
And I can remember it.

418
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:40,201
And I'm gonna tell you what happens
to this beautiful woman,

419
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:42,425
who saved your worthless fucking life.

420
00:46:24,844 --> 00:46:26,572
Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

421
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,876
Yeah, Seth said... that night.

422
00:46:32,253 --> 00:46:35,324
A new boss from the future,
he used the words 'holy terror'.

423
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:38,157
Yeah, the reign of terror.

424
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,743
Mass executions,

425
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,015
vagrant purges, everywhere at once.

426
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:44,992
Legend is that the Rainmaker
came out of nowhere.

427
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:49,088
In the span of six months, he took total
control of the five major syndicates.

428
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:50,165
That would take an army.

429
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:53,410
But he didn't have an army.
The story is that he did it alone.

430
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:56,056
Alone, alone.

431
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:57,890
- So how did he do it?
- That's the mystery.

432
00:46:57,907 --> 00:47:00,285
There's no pictures of him,
either if it's a him.

433
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:01,000
It's insane.

434
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,719
There's stories he has a synthetic jaw,

435
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:04,980
saw his mom shot, shit like that.

436
00:47:05,095 --> 00:47:07,457
But word spread about him
through the ex-Looper grapevine,

437
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:10,221
because the first thing he did
was start closing loops.

438
00:47:10,347 --> 00:47:11,438
All of them.

439
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,403
You know what this is?
This number?

440
00:47:18,443 --> 00:47:19,643
Here, wait, slow down.

441
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:21,806
It could lead us right
to the Rainmaker, Joe.

442
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:24,199
It was in the hospital records.
Write this down!

443
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,982
0, 7, 1, 5, 3, 9, 0, 2, 9, 3, 5!

444
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:40,421
This is a piece of identifying
information on the Rainmaker.

445
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:45,953
He's here. He lives here, now.
In this county.

446
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:50,082
And I'm gonna use it to find him
and I'm gonna kill him.

447
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:53,389
And I'm gonna stop him
from killing my wife.

448
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:55,817
Fuck you. And your wife.

449
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:57,145
None of this concerns me.

450
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,196
This is gonna happen to you, you stupid...

451
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:01,167
It happened to you,
it doesn't have to happen to me!

452
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,381
You got a picture right there in my watch?
Let me see it.

453
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:06,450
Show me the picture, and
as soon as I see her, I'll walk away.

454
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:08,014
I'll fucking marry someone else.

455
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:09,673
I promise.

456
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:12,234
So when I see that picture,
that fog inside your brain

457
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:14,350
should just swallow up
all the memories, right?

458
00:48:14,384 --> 00:48:15,354
She'll be gone.

459
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:18,586
If you give her up, she'll be safe.

460
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:19,513
Giving her up?

461
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,973
Yeah, give her up!
You're the one that got her killed!

462
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,415
If she never meets, you she's safe!

463
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,762
You don't understand,
we don't have to give her up.

464
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:27,764
I'm not gonna give her up.

465
00:48:28,324 --> 00:48:29,443
I'm gonna save her.

466
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:46,295
Get to the fields!
We can lose them in the fields!

467
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,258
Hop a train!
Stay out of town!

468
00:49:13,982 --> 00:49:15,991
What the hell is everybody doing?!

469
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:18,144
You wait for my signal!

470
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,112
- Out back, he's running!
- He went off the back!

471
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:32,210
Shit!

472
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,068
No, alive!

473
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:47,537
Fuck! Shit mob! Come on!

474
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,254
Come on, you piece of shit! Come on!

475
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:01,567
Get the tracker! The tracker!

476
00:50:02,558 --> 00:50:04,521
Come on! Come on!

477
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,167
Shit!

478
00:50:53,355 --> 00:50:58,150
...

479
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,727
Come on baby, time to get up.

480
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:29,341
Listen up, fucker!

481
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:32,553
I have shot and buried

482
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:35,146
three vagrants in the past year!

483
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:39,386
So I don't know care
what a hobo sob story you got!

484
00:52:39,513 --> 00:52:42,270
I get a dozen a week, pal,
it cuts no cash with me.

485
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,766
But if you show your face here again,

486
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:46,959
I will cut you the fuck in half!

487
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:30,649
Well... you found him.

488
00:53:31,746 --> 00:53:34,577
Tracking Seth's bike, that was clever.

489
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,582
And you rustled up the posse
and went out to get him.

490
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:39,715
I could do it again.

491
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,955
You can fuck up again? Really?

492
00:53:42,403 --> 00:53:44,226
I got too much riding, Kid.

493
00:53:44,258 --> 00:53:47,140
I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.

494
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,716
Put your Gat on the table.

495
00:54:08,043 --> 00:54:10,578
I wanted you to say I did good.

496
00:54:12,546 --> 00:54:14,481
It's all I wanted.

497
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:19,810
This is all I have.

498
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:27,949
Please just give me one more chance.

499
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:31,362
I'll bring him here alive,
and I'll hold him...

500
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:34,401
and you could put a bullet
in his brain yourself.

501
00:54:35,948 --> 00:54:37,647
No, no!

502
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:35,003
Hey, who's there?

503
00:55:40,222 --> 00:55:42,798
Stop right there, I will shoot you.

504
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,236
You stop! Stop right there!

505
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:54,331
I'm telling you to stop.
You stop!

506
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:11,199
...

507
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:26,375
...

508
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:27,919
...

509
00:56:27,953 --> 00:56:29,527
Hey! Look up at the light.

510
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:33,100
Look up at me.
How long since you dropped?

511
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:35,464
- Dropped?
- Dropped.

512
00:56:35,503 --> 00:56:37,107
- A day.
- A day...

513
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:38,955
I can't feel my legs.

514
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,846
That's because you're going through
withdrawal, you fucking junkie.

515
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:44,461
You gotta help me.
I'm gonna die.

516
00:56:44,645 --> 00:56:46,461
I'm thirsty...

517
00:56:47,328 --> 00:56:49,504
Water. Water!

518
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:21,448
Sid!

519
00:57:23,295 --> 00:57:24,371
Come inside, baby.

520
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:28,883
- Who's that man?
- He's just a vagrant, baby.

521
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,117
- No, he's not.
- Yeah?

522
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:33,115
His shoes are too shiny.

523
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:35,370
Well, you're a smart monkey.

524
00:57:35,481 --> 00:57:37,710
- Is he sick?
- Yep.

525
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:40,303
- Will he get better?
- Yeah.

526
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:41,294
Promise?

527
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:44,198
Just go to sleep, okay, baby boy?

528
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:50,560
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Sara.

529
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:27,450
Hey!

530
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:40,365
The first time I saw her face,
the first time I saw her face...

531
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:42,060
Look at me.

532
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:44,234
No!

533
00:58:44,864 --> 00:58:46,942
The first time I saw her face...

534
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,452
The first time I saw her face...
the first time I saw her face...

535
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:36,613
Morning, monkey. Want something to eat?

536
00:59:36,749 --> 00:59:38,579
The man's up.

537
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:41,955
Is he staying here now?

538
00:59:42,223 --> 00:59:43,516
No.

539
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,697
Toss it.

540
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:53,786
- I'm about to finish cleaning it.
- Put it down.

541
00:59:57,792 --> 01:00:00,436
- How are you feeling?
- I'd say I'm a 30%.

542
01:00:00,593 --> 01:00:03,073
You take it slow, by the end
of the week you'll be a 50.

543
01:00:06,074 --> 01:00:08,351
I took you in so you wouldn't die.
Now you're not gonna die,

544
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:11,233
so just take the morning to rest,
then you need to get off my farm.

545
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,418
- I can't do that.
- I'm sorry?

546
01:00:13,475 --> 01:00:15,148
I'm gonna stay here for a little while.

547
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:17,544
- I'm not cool with that.
- I'm sorry.

548
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:18,440
Well, I'm sorry too,

549
01:00:18,456 --> 01:00:20,614
you just lost your
'take the morning to rest' privileges,

550
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,536
get off my farm.

551
01:00:21,554 --> 01:00:23,493
- No.
- Get off my farm.

552
01:00:24,097 --> 01:00:26,679
You couldn't scare a retarded
hobo with that thing, literally.

553
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:29,517
This is a Remington 8-70,
one blast cuts you the fuck in...

554
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,661
...Fuck in half, yeah. That's telling,

555
01:00:31,687 --> 01:00:33,576
you're holding a gun,
I say I'm not afraid,

556
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:34,892
so you describe the gun to me.

557
01:00:35,282 --> 01:00:36,842
It's not the gun I'm not afraid of.

558
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:38,434
What are you gonna do?
Shoot in the air?

559
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:40,004
Try to scare me? Go ahead.

560
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:41,800
You wouldn't let me die,
you're not gonna kill me.

561
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:43,660
So now I saved your life,
that makes me weak?

562
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:46,065
Look, I'm not a threat to you,
or your boy.

563
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:48,740
I need to be on your property.
Alright, there's no contact at all,

564
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:50,264
I'm gonna stay in the fields.

565
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,124
There's just one thing I need you to do,

566
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:53,911
and you'll never have
to deal with me again.

567
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,174
Just verify for me this is
your house on the map,

568
01:00:56,182 --> 01:00:57,495
so I know I'm in the right place.

569
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:59,509
- What's this?
- It's a map.

570
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,862
Yeah, it's my house. Why is it marked?

571
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:03,422
Okay, it doesn't matter. Look,

572
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:05,397
I'm gonna be out of the barn in an hour.

573
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,860
If you can spare it,
I'm gonna take this canteen.

574
01:01:07,884 --> 01:01:09,654
Is there somewhere
I can fill it up with water?

575
01:01:09,675 --> 01:01:11,289
This number, how did you get this?

576
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:14,878
Does that mean something to you?

577
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:17,730
What?!
Hey... hey, hey!

578
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:33,870
Yeah, you're right, I'm not a killer.

579
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:37,534
But I'm fine with how a blast of rock salt
to your face won't kill you.

580
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:40,604
Now you gonna tell me who you are

581
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:43,248
and what the fuck you're doing on my farm.

582
01:01:47,575 --> 01:01:49,897
Time travel hasn't been invented yet.

583
01:01:49,927 --> 01:01:52,278
But in 30 years it will have been.

584
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,725
They've been used
by the big criminal syndicates.

585
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,381
You're a Looper?

586
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,724
I can't go back to the city
with Abe, my boss,

587
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:13,647
his men have been searching for me 24/7
so they find me,

588
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,321
or find him.

589
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:17,235
All I got is that map.

590
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:20,002
You have three houses marked on them.
Yours is one of them.

591
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:22,646
I know he's coming here.

592
01:02:24,189 --> 01:02:26,762
So what do you know about Loopers?
You know what we do?

593
01:02:26,783 --> 01:02:28,473
So he's coming here...

594
01:02:28,572 --> 01:02:29,891
to murder my son,

595
01:02:29,893 --> 01:02:32,954
cause he thinks he might be this...
Rainmaker?

596
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:36,431
And once he kills the Rainmaker,
what happens?

597
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:38,957
I think... he thinks that if
he'd killed the Rainmaker,

598
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:42,072
then he never would have been sent back,
so he'd just vanish.

599
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:43,993
He'd disappear just like he appeared.

600
01:02:45,373 --> 01:02:47,454
He'd be back with his wife.

601
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,629
Who is he, this guy you let run?

602
01:02:52,157 --> 01:02:54,519
Is it just some random
guy from the future?

603
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:57,744
He's... this is somebody.
You know what... the numbers mean?

604
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,762
This is Sid's birth day.

605
01:03:02,802 --> 01:03:05,853
And this is the main code of
the hospital he was born in.

606
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:15,364
How many other kids were born in
that hospital in that day with your son?

607
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:16,928
- Like two?
- Sound right.

608
01:03:17,284 --> 01:03:20,493
Three kids, three houses
marked on this map.

609
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:23,062
He knows one of them is the Rainmaker,
he doesn't know who he is.

610
01:03:23,095 --> 01:03:25,018
What's he gonna do?

611
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,330
God...

612
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:13,554
Will he really do this?

613
01:05:13,638 --> 01:05:15,879
Think about doing this would fix

614
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:17,833
what he thinks it will fix.

615
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:24,586
If he comes here, will you stop him?

616
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:28,982
I'm asking, can I trust you?

617
01:05:29,011 --> 01:05:31,812
I don't care if you trust me.
I don't care about your son!

618
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:34,999
I've lost my life, if I kill
this man, I get it back.

619
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,396
He'll kill the other two kids,
and come here last.

620
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,200
Pull out facing me.

621
01:05:45,262 --> 01:05:47,747
And those Goddamn cane, we're just blind!

622
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:50,890
He can get 50 yards from this place
without a hawk spotting him.

623
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:54,480
It would make sense if we burn
the fields. Level them.

624
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:56,654
How much gas you got in that barn?

625
01:05:57,511 --> 01:05:59,712
No, you can't burn down the cane fields.

626
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:01,610
This stuff's half dead anyway.

627
01:06:01,653 --> 01:06:03,785
Yeah, it's the seed for next year.

628
01:06:04,176 --> 01:06:06,660
It's not gonna happen. Fucking not.

629
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:14,784
See, you use what you need,
and you set up anywhere,

630
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:16,927
but one thing: I don't want
you talking to Sid.

631
01:06:17,203 --> 01:06:20,002
I watch my son, you watch
the cane, that's the deal.

632
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,117
Good by me.

633
01:06:21,149 --> 01:06:22,115
Fine.

634
01:06:22,347 --> 01:06:24,367
Alright, hold still.

635
01:06:26,077 --> 01:06:29,252
It's easy for things to get
infected in a farm...

636
01:06:29,668 --> 01:06:31,538
so I fill it off.

637
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:34,704
Pussy.

638
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,809
I'm gonna be out here and
you're in the house,

639
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:40,947
we need a way to communicate.

640
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:43,365
There's a diner bell in the barn.

641
01:06:43,607 --> 01:06:45,534
Ring the bell if someone's coming on here.

642
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:49,070
Diner bell. We need... buzzers,
walkies or something.

643
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:51,013
I don't know what
we've got, but I'll look.

644
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:52,691
Sid.

645
01:06:55,657 --> 01:06:56,741
How's the math coming?

646
01:06:56,947 --> 01:06:58,109
I want to help the man.

647
01:06:58,161 --> 01:06:59,388
Help him with what?

648
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:00,982
I could help with my toys.

649
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:02,741
No. Let me turn to you.

650
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:06,567
I need you to stay away
from that man. Ok?

651
01:07:06,612 --> 01:07:09,147
You just let him do his thing,
but you stick with me. Ok?

652
01:07:09,169 --> 01:07:10,387
Is he not good?

653
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:13,521
Well, we're gonna see what he is.

654
01:07:13,773 --> 01:07:17,534
Alright? But I need you to stick with me.

655
01:08:04,085 --> 01:08:05,832
Give me that pop-ups.

656
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:11,565
Tell me if you hear her coming.

657
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:15,162
- What you're doing here?
- Communication.

658
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,113
But I need to make it stronger.

659
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:23,288
- How do we do that?
- Bigger battery.

660
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:24,778
Smart.

661
01:08:27,223 --> 01:08:28,795
Do you kill people?

662
01:08:34,637 --> 01:08:38,555
- Let's say I kill people.
- With your gun?

663
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,268
- Why, you want a gun like mine?
- Yeah.

664
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,498
What you gonna do with it.
Pole vaulting?

665
01:08:46,548 --> 01:08:48,015
It's bigger than you.

666
01:08:49,783 --> 01:08:51,731
Stop bad things from happening.

667
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:13,495
So hum... how long you and your mum
been out here on the farm?

668
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:16,752
- She's not.
- She's not what?

669
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,215
Sara doesn't know...
but I remember my real mom.

670
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,581
When I was a baby, I couldn't stop it.

671
01:09:29,106 --> 01:09:30,852
Couldn't stop what?

672
01:09:31,862 --> 01:09:34,494
I couldn't stop her from getting killed.

673
01:09:35,131 --> 01:09:38,019
I saw it, but I couldn't stop it.

674
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,895
I was not strong enough.

675
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:47,570
You should... you should talk
to your mum about this.

676
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:50,816
She's not my mum.
She's a liar.

677
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:07,817
Spotted in coming out of
a sewer tunnel in the West End.

678
01:10:07,848 --> 01:10:09,184
He's on the run.

679
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:23,234
He is heading to the
western tower street,

680
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:26,757
possibly to whore selling.
We have a visual.

681
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:31,347
You can't take that thing out
with a plough or something?

682
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,583
Listen, I found a...

683
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:42,071
In the barn I found some parts,
and I made a... a thing.

684
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:45,185
Here.

685
01:10:46,749 --> 01:10:49,618
So if you see something, just press that.

686
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,496
When?

687
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:55,854
Last night, he woke me up.

688
01:10:55,878 --> 01:10:57,834
Don't tell him, I told him I wouldn't.

689
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:04,506
You said you were his mom.

690
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:06,947
Yeah.

691
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:09,774
He told me you're not.

692
01:11:10,913 --> 01:11:12,311
He said that?

693
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,224
Yeah...

694
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:19,588
- If he's not your son, who is he?
- He's my son.

695
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,923
I had Sid when I was 22...

696
01:11:24,296 --> 01:11:27,225
but I didn't want to give
up my life in the city.

697
01:11:27,271 --> 01:11:29,582
So I dropped him here, on the farm,

698
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:32,756
and my sister, when she saw
how I was living,

699
01:11:32,765 --> 01:11:34,931
so she took him.

700
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:37,673
And my sister, she raised him.

701
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:43,927
She loved him.
He called her Mom.

702
01:11:49,661 --> 01:11:53,077
- How did she get killed?
- Jesus Christ.

703
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:55,274
He remembers it.
You gonna have to talk to him about it.

704
01:11:55,298 --> 01:11:56,538
I told you one thing,

705
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,516
I told you to stay away from my son.

706
01:11:58,545 --> 01:12:00,962
- He asked about my gun.
- Stay out of it!

707
01:12:01,015 --> 01:12:03,826
Stay the fuck away from my son!

708
01:12:06,023 --> 01:12:09,851
Where does 56 go?

709
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:13,453
Good, you're smart.

710
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,324
21?

711
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:17,095
How long you cannot sleep?

712
01:12:17,455 --> 01:12:20,163
I don't know... a little while.

713
01:12:20,309 --> 01:12:22,461
It's a good question.
Where's the token going?

714
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,910
Good! 32.

715
01:12:28,335 --> 01:12:30,317
We should help Joe watch.

716
01:12:30,866 --> 01:12:31,582
Joe?

717
01:12:31,628 --> 01:12:33,639
Cause he can't stay awake all the time.

718
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:36,619
- Ain't our business. Ok?
- He's keeping us safe.

719
01:12:36,669 --> 01:12:38,213
Let's do this now. Okay?

720
01:12:38,298 --> 01:12:40,405
You have 32 there,
I know you know this one.

721
01:12:43,855 --> 01:12:45,685
No. Eight times three is what?

722
01:12:45,765 --> 01:12:46,968
32.

723
01:12:47,304 --> 01:12:50,962
- Eight times three is what?
- 32.

724
01:12:53,632 --> 01:12:55,462
I want you to count three eights.

725
01:12:55,493 --> 01:12:57,826
8, 16...

726
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,536
32.

727
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:03,393
Are you telling me you want a long time?

728
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:03,893
No.

729
01:13:03,931 --> 01:13:05,955
Then why don't you put that were it lies?

730
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:12,975
A long time.

731
01:13:13,029 --> 01:13:15,933
He's protecting us, cause you can't do it.

732
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,323
Ok, I told you to stay away from him.

733
01:13:18,355 --> 01:13:20,025
I never did anything.

734
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:22,327
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- So.

735
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:23,754
- I told you...
- So!

736
01:13:23,785 --> 01:13:25,599
You do what I tell you, Sid!

737
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:28,541
You can't tell me what to do,
cos you're not my mom.

738
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:30,619
You're not my mum, you're a liar.

739
01:13:30,659 --> 01:13:33,318
You're going to get killed,
cos you won't stop lying.

740
01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:35,067
- Sid, calm down...
- Liar, you're lying to me,

741
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:36,077
I hate you, you're a liar!

742
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:37,684
Come on, kill me, I hate you, liar!

743
01:13:37,687 --> 01:13:39,190
I hate you, liar, you're lying to me...

744
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,344
- Calm down. Calm down!
- ... I hate you!

745
01:13:56,946 --> 01:14:01,329
Liar!
Liar!

746
01:14:03,043 --> 01:14:05,625
You're not my mum, you're a liar!

747
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:09,859
<i>You're not my mum, you're a liar!</i>

748
01:14:11,145 --> 01:14:13,596
<i>You're not my mum, you're a liar!</i>

749
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:18,391
<i>Liar!
Liar, liar!</i>

750
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:51,506
I'm sorry.

751
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,206
It's OK, sweetie.

752
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,914
Holy shit.

753
01:16:33,932 --> 01:16:35,377
How are you ma'am.

754
01:16:36,271 --> 01:16:39,383
Hey, man.
What can I do for you?

755
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:42,387
Would you start by
accepting my apologies

756
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,496
this late visit, I hope I
not interrupt your dinner.

757
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:46,433
No, that's fine.

758
01:16:46,466 --> 01:16:49,242
I've been walking into all the empty
farms around there in the hot sun,

759
01:16:49,315 --> 01:16:50,430
I just...

760
01:16:50,491 --> 01:16:52,109
take this one off the list,

761
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,400
- or I'd have to come back tomorrow
- What this is about?

762
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:56,426
You're alone here, madame?

763
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,003
My husband should be back
from the city anytime now.

764
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:00,545
Happy to hear it.

765
01:17:03,908 --> 01:17:05,838
Can I trouble you for some water?

766
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:09,029
I'll get you some,
and you take the glass with you.

767
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:13,367
I'm sorry ma'am. My business today, is...

768
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:17,241
ticking off the list business,
it's gonna require me coming here.

769
01:17:17,774 --> 01:17:18,571
If that's all right.

770
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:20,210
Will you tell me what this is about?

771
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:21,146
I will, yeah.

772
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:25,857
Can I come in?

773
01:17:29,472 --> 01:17:30,680
Madame?

774
01:17:38,532 --> 01:17:40,390
I am a sworn police officer,

775
01:17:40,444 --> 01:17:42,496
and I'm looking for fugitives.

776
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,034
Have you seen anybody those past two days?
Vagrants?

777
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:48,076
Vagrants are always wandering around.

778
01:17:48,884 --> 01:17:52,557
- That man?
- He is young? No.

779
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:56,126
We're looking for his father too,
similar look and build,

780
01:17:56,174 --> 01:17:58,745
end fifties.
You may meet each of them together.

781
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:03,234
You recognize them?

782
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:06,340
- No.
- Keep it.

783
01:18:08,504 --> 01:18:10,580
Your kids are with your husband?

784
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:14,449
- Yeah, just one.
- How old?

785
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,492
Ten.

786
01:18:37,428 --> 01:18:39,702
I show you the barn, and then the house,

787
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:41,129
and then you can be on your way.

788
01:18:41,314 --> 01:18:44,367
I took the liberty with your barn.
Apologies.

789
01:18:46,236 --> 01:18:48,422
So... The house.

790
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:05,476
- 10, you said, your boy?
- Yeah.

791
01:19:05,901 --> 01:19:08,492
And your husband?

792
01:19:08,651 --> 01:19:10,872
I just got to check in, the Home Office.

793
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:16,180
You said the boy is the city
with his father. When is he getting back?

794
01:19:16,457 --> 01:19:17,575
Can't tell you.

795
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:28,382
This Goddamn thing.
You never get the signal this far out.

796
01:19:30,915 --> 01:19:32,911
Piece of shit.

797
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:40,516
Ok, here we go.

798
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:42,881
Is this man dangerous?

799
01:19:43,104 --> 01:19:46,693
He shoots men down for a living.
He is a cold-blooded killer.

800
01:19:47,094 --> 01:19:49,579
My boss says half of the city
is looking for him.

801
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,675
Half of the city then me, so...

802
01:19:52,826 --> 01:19:55,119
And if you find him,
there's a hell of a prize.

803
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,048
A chunk of money like that.

804
01:19:57,111 --> 01:19:58,798
You think of it.

805
01:19:58,946 --> 01:20:01,158
- I will.
- Alright.

806
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:03,001
You show me upstairs?

807
01:20:04,683 --> 01:20:06,297
There's drafts in the house.

808
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:29,326
My grand dad dug this tunnel when
the vagrants rixe got bad.

809
01:20:29,937 --> 01:20:31,723
Nanna said cuz he was nuts.

810
01:20:31,969 --> 01:20:33,162
Thank you Grand dad.

811
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:35,027
That wasn't the man?

812
01:20:35,115 --> 01:20:36,792
No. It's funny, I know though,

813
01:20:36,794 --> 01:20:38,391
his name's Jessie.

814
01:20:39,264 --> 01:20:41,182
I like him, he's good.

815
01:20:42,562 --> 01:20:44,761
He's gonna go away
once he didn't find me.

816
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:47,722
He won't harm your mum...
Sara.

817
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,468
Where is your mum?

818
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:52,954
Where's my mum?

819
01:20:55,827 --> 01:21:00,324
she... she gave me up.
I was younger than you.

820
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:04,348
They were vagrants, and she was alone.

821
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:07,455
For a long time, I thought

822
01:21:07,478 --> 01:21:09,400
she was stupid for getting
on that junction,

823
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:12,040
resigning, but now I see, she was...

824
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:12,973
so alone.

825
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:15,960
That's what she had.

826
01:21:16,761 --> 01:21:19,567
And she sold me to a begging little gang,

827
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:23,633
I got away and I ran,
I went on this train,

828
01:21:23,861 --> 01:21:26,787
I remember seeing there an empty car.

829
01:21:26,891 --> 01:21:28,773
I saw myself over and over again,

830
01:21:28,774 --> 01:21:30,947
killing those men who bought me.

831
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:34,525
and who got my mom on what she was on.

832
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:36,929
Finding them and tearing them apart. Saving my mom.

833
01:21:37,624 --> 01:21:38,862
What did you do then?

834
01:21:39,414 --> 01:21:41,513
A man in the city found me,

835
01:21:41,575 --> 01:21:44,405
put a gun in my hand,
and gave me some things that was mine

836
01:21:45,707 --> 01:21:48,093
It's just that men try to figure out
what they would do

837
01:21:48,128 --> 01:21:50,409
to keep what's theirs.
Their take out.

838
01:21:51,685 --> 01:21:53,814
This is the only kind of man there is.

839
01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:56,646
I'm not going to let Sara get killed.

840
01:22:07,826 --> 01:22:09,880
I think we're clear.

841
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:22,249
...

842
01:22:26,423 --> 01:22:27,571
...

843
01:22:44,164 --> 01:22:46,178
All working girls, yeah?

844
01:22:46,654 --> 01:22:48,337
This whole block,

845
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,099
back-up all blocks over.

846
01:22:51,707 --> 01:22:52,884
Hello Joe...

847
01:22:52,936 --> 01:22:56,057
You wanna check those too, I can arrange.

848
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:01,457
I'm an arranger, stranger.

849
01:23:02,052 --> 01:23:05,281
But if you don't see
what you want to see, no refunds.

850
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:07,728
What?

851
01:24:10,103 --> 01:24:11,406
What happened?

852
01:24:56,481 --> 01:24:58,250
That's pretty good.

853
01:25:01,235 --> 01:25:04,352
In the city, young guys
would head on me by...

854
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:07,907
flying fucking quarters.

855
01:25:08,364 --> 01:25:10,944
I wouldn't tell that I was TK, but...

856
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:13,363
I would keep their quarters down.

857
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:15,311
This one guy...

858
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,859
busted a vein, I saw, in his eye,

859
01:25:17,876 --> 01:25:19,186
trying to get it high.

860
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:33,502
He's you.

861
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:35,120
Your loop.

862
01:25:36,679 --> 01:25:38,322
You lied to me.

863
01:25:40,507 --> 01:25:43,560
But I know you're not lying when you
said you're gonna kill this guy...

864
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,921
your own self.

865
01:25:46,621 --> 01:25:49,348
You protected Sid from that Gat man.

866
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,027
- Come on...
- Yeah.

867
01:25:52,698 --> 01:25:54,604
- Yeah...
- He saved your ass, didn't he?

868
01:25:54,669 --> 01:25:56,303
He saved my ass, yeah.

869
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:58,643
He's a...

870
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:03,084
He's a good kid.

871
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,593
Yeah, he is.

872
01:26:07,634 --> 01:26:11,395
You know when I came back,
after my sister died,

873
01:26:12,506 --> 01:26:15,851
I remember seeing him,

874
01:26:16,042 --> 01:26:19,842
for the first time in two years
just sitting on the porch,

875
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:25,212
I drove up, crying,
I had been in this...

876
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:29,913
party all night in the city,
when I called...

877
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:35,887
and so I was wearing this
ridiculous party dress,

878
01:26:38,476 --> 01:26:41,089
my, ridiculous shit.

879
01:26:42,835 --> 01:26:45,537
And I don't know if he...

880
01:26:46,064 --> 01:26:49,192
if he even remembered me, but...

881
01:26:50,263 --> 01:26:53,350
but he looked at me.

882
01:26:58,661 --> 01:27:01,216
I abandoned him.

883
01:27:04,157 --> 01:27:06,644
I abandoned my baby.

884
01:27:11,115 --> 01:27:14,006
And I've seen so many men in the city,

885
01:27:15,526 --> 01:27:20,249
This empty look in their
eyes, and just lost...

886
01:27:21,026 --> 01:27:24,123
So whether he loves me back, or not,

887
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:29,041
as long as I'm there to raise him..

888
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:32,582
he's gonna be taken care of.

889
01:27:34,172 --> 01:27:36,364
He's gonna be safe.

890
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,019
He's never gonna get lost.

891
01:28:02,274 --> 01:28:05,705
- Hello Joe.
- Jessie.

892
01:28:07,654 --> 01:28:10,351
Put this down, let her go.

893
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:15,316
Sarah, Jessie here is the best
shoot with the Gat that I know.

894
01:28:16,268 --> 01:28:20,184
So when he lets you go, just sit down
on the couch, don't do anything stupid.

895
01:28:25,685 --> 01:28:27,775
He's coming here, Jessie,
my loop is coming here.

896
01:28:27,979 --> 01:28:29,313
I've got to take you in there.

897
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,795
I've got 948 bars of pure silver.

898
01:28:32,247 --> 01:28:34,503
I close my loop, I get back with Abe,

899
01:28:34,603 --> 01:28:36,713
whatever he gives me back,
I'll split with you.

900
01:28:36,738 --> 01:28:38,713
Was that your plan?

901
01:28:39,311 --> 01:28:40,585
Okay, take all of it.

902
01:28:40,627 --> 01:28:43,093
Are you delusional?
You didn't ride with anyone.

903
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,894
As long as Abe has got one Gat man's down,

904
01:28:44,896 --> 01:28:46,601
he gonna be hunting you
'till his dying day.

905
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:50,622
We're gonna go now.
I'm gonna get my truck,

906
01:28:50,647 --> 01:28:51,984
and we're just gone...

907
01:29:06,027 --> 01:29:07,408
I'm sorry.

908
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,134
The Rainmaker...

909
01:30:35,906 --> 01:30:37,572
My God...

910
01:30:39,028 --> 01:30:40,946
Sid. Sid!

911
01:30:43,842 --> 01:30:45,760
Sid!

912
01:30:46,085 --> 01:30:47,467
It's him!

913
01:30:47,513 --> 01:30:50,352
What is he, some TK freak?

914
01:30:50,513 --> 01:30:52,437
You knew.

915
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,720
- What are you doing with those guns?
- How did your sister die?

916
01:30:56,758 --> 01:30:58,844
- What are you doing with those guns!
- How did your sister die!

917
01:30:58,907 --> 01:31:00,459
How did she die,
is that what happened to her?

918
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:02,075
- No. No, no.
- Did he kill her like that?

919
01:31:02,098 --> 01:31:03,991
No, listen, he was climbing
a bookshelf, okay,

920
01:31:04,011 --> 01:31:05,841
and it... it fell back on him, and...

921
01:31:05,863 --> 01:31:08,136
- he can get scared and explode...
- Jesus, fuck!

922
01:31:08,142 --> 01:31:09,953
.. but one day he'll learn to control it.

923
01:31:09,968 --> 01:31:12,150
Yeah, I know he will,
and imagine what he's gonna do!

924
01:31:12,178 --> 01:31:13,848
But if he did good with it, though,

925
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:17,041
if he grew up, wouldn't it raise him?

926
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:20,381
If he grew up good?

927
01:31:20,581 --> 01:31:22,007
He doesn't.

928
01:31:22,182 --> 01:31:24,372
You stay away from him, Joe!

929
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:32,940
Sid! Sid, stay away from Joe, baby.

930
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:35,378
Won't you, baby?

931
01:32:32,752 --> 01:32:34,956
Come here, it's okay.

932
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:40,997
It's okay, baby.

933
01:32:43,436 --> 01:32:45,725
Now right now two things have happened.

934
01:32:45,763 --> 01:32:48,002
My loop knows Sid
is the kid he's looking for,

935
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,524
and my gang knows I'm here.

936
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:50,792
That means that in 15 minutes

937
01:32:50,794 --> 01:32:52,788
one or both of them
is coming down the highway.

938
01:32:53,727 --> 01:32:56,637
Back-up the Gat man's truck,
take everything that fits and go,

939
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:58,362
driving North, away from the city.

940
01:32:59,423 --> 01:33:00,981
Thank you.

941
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:15,158
I've got everyone here, all our men.

942
01:33:15,186 --> 01:33:17,037
Arm them up, let's go.

943
01:33:26,024 --> 01:33:28,306
I got him Abe. I got him!

944
01:33:28,867 --> 01:33:31,295
Well, cheers...

945
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:36,268
Right, motherfuckers!

946
01:33:36,308 --> 01:33:38,051
I got him!

947
01:33:38,082 --> 01:33:40,035
He had a sweet on
this one particular whore, so

948
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,160
I checked her building...

949
01:33:41,184 --> 01:33:43,415
They found Joe too,
they're on a farm on the east side.

950
01:33:43,468 --> 01:33:45,527
That's why all the Gats came here,

951
01:33:45,529 --> 01:33:48,434
the whole crew is armed
up to make up a sweep.

952
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:49,456
Joe.

953
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:53,252
Fuck Joe!
Save your bullets, I've got the loop!

954
01:33:54,557 --> 01:33:59,189
Not such a fucker mellow,
I'll bring him up to see Abe.

955
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,072
Gats, shoot!

956
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:05,204
Shoot!

957
01:35:21,943 --> 01:35:23,801
Holy shit.

958
01:35:30,288 --> 01:35:31,359
Joe!

959
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:36,818
I used to put a gun in that kid's hand,

960
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:42,082
I guess it comes back around.

961
01:35:43,567 --> 01:35:45,879
Like your Goddamn ties...

962
01:37:06,425 --> 01:37:09,998
Take this truck, you take
your gold and go live your life.

963
01:37:10,274 --> 01:37:13,450
Nobody's coming after you.
I've fixed it.

964
01:37:13,481 --> 01:37:15,938
Are you gonna kill the boy,
is that how you fix it?

965
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:18,435
You're Goddamn right
I'm gonna kill that boy.

966
01:37:19,372 --> 01:37:21,451
You've just got your life back.

967
01:37:21,464 --> 01:37:23,292
My life!?
Your life!

968
01:37:23,358 --> 01:37:25,102
Becoming you.

969
01:37:25,169 --> 01:37:27,681
Goddammit! You've lost your fucking mind,

970
01:37:28,302 --> 01:37:29,769
You let the boy live,

971
01:37:29,817 --> 01:37:31,905
he will take everything you've got!

972
01:37:32,118 --> 01:37:34,037
And everything I've got!

973
01:37:34,864 --> 01:37:36,639
You've seen what he becomes.

974
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:38,316
I haven't seen that yet.

975
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:31,824
Okay baby, we're gone.

976
01:38:33,488 --> 01:38:35,002
Put your seatbelt on.

977
01:39:00,442 --> 01:39:02,211
- Stop.
- Tap down, baby, it's okay.

978
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:04,790
- Stop, please, he's gonna shoot us.
- Tap down, baby!

979
01:39:04,793 --> 01:39:07,577
Stop. He's gonna
shoot us! Stop!

980
01:39:07,631 --> 01:39:10,299
- Please, get...
- Stop! Stop, stop!

981
01:39:29,801 --> 01:39:33,053
- Sid...
- I'm sorry.

982
01:39:33,087 --> 01:39:37,387
It' okay. It's okay,
I'm gonna get you down.

983
01:39:44,657 --> 01:39:46,465
Ok, we'll go and hide in the cane.

984
01:39:46,505 --> 01:39:48,080
Go. Go!

985
01:39:54,109 --> 01:39:55,131
Go.

986
01:40:12,699 --> 01:40:14,617
No!

987
01:40:21,603 --> 01:40:23,568
No, Sid, no...

988
01:41:09,809 --> 01:41:13,429
Noooooon...

989
01:41:22,464 --> 01:41:25,081
It's okay, baby...

990
01:41:28,205 --> 01:41:30,868
It's okay...

991
01:41:30,965 --> 01:41:32,504
I love you, calm down.

992
01:41:34,253 --> 01:41:35,521
Good boy...

993
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:39,733
Mummy loves you.

994
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:44,609
Mummy loves you.

995
01:41:45,995 --> 01:41:47,434
I's okay...

996
01:41:50,128 --> 01:41:51,665
Mom.

997
01:42:05,271 --> 01:42:08,010
You did good, you did so good,

998
01:42:08,046 --> 01:42:09,521
Good boy.

999
01:42:11,222 --> 01:42:12,324
Okay, listen to me.

1000
01:42:12,346 --> 01:42:14,405
I need you to run into the fields.

1001
01:42:14,436 --> 01:42:15,877
No mom, no, I don't wanna leave you.

1002
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:18,326
- It's okay.
- I don't want to leave you, Mom. No!

1003
01:42:18,364 --> 01:42:19,457
It's okay, baby. Go, Go!

1004
01:42:19,459 --> 01:42:21,979
Move! Move, Goddammit!

1005
01:42:39,482 --> 01:42:41,271
Move.

1006
01:42:45,464 --> 01:42:47,281
<i>Then I saw it.</i>

1007
01:42:50,985 --> 01:42:53,867
<i>I saw a mum who would die for her son.</i>

1008
01:42:56,497 --> 01:42:59,071
<i>A man who would kill for his wife.</i>

1009
01:43:01,838 --> 01:43:04,306
<i>A boy angry and alone.</i>

1010
01:43:05,321 --> 01:43:08,541
<i>Lay down and frightened.
The bad path, I saw it.</i>

1011
01:43:10,086 --> 01:43:13,803
<i>and the path was a circle.</i>

1012
01:43:15,219 --> 01:43:17,224
<i>Round and round.</i>

1013
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:29,682
<i>So I changed it.</i>

1014
01:43:44,193 --> 01:43:45,990
Sid!

1015
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:09,667
Where is Joe?

1016
01:44:11,216 --> 01:44:13,844
He had to go away, baby.
