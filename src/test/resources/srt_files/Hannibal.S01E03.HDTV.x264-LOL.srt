1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,905
<i>Previously in Hannibal...</i>

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:07,651
- He's some kind of special consultant for the FBI.
- I asked you to get close

3
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:10,927
To the Hobbs thing. I need to
know you didn't get too close.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:14,102
- What you need is a way out 
of dark places when jack sends you there.

5
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:16,843
- Last time he sent me
into a dark place,

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,083
I brought something back.
- A surrogate daughter?

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,157
- Abigail Hobbs is a suspect?
- She would make the ideal bait.

8
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:25,600
Wouldn't she?
- Just a second. Dad?

9
00:00:25,602 --> 00:00:28,809
It's for you.
- Hello?

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,016
- They know.

11
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,415
- Be patient.
Wait for your shot.

12
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,908
(gunshot)

13
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,958
(soft thud)

14
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,205
Ready? 
And three, two, one.

15
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:54,411
Go.

16
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,991
- She was so pretty.

17
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,163
- She is so pretty.

18
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,169
- Aren't deer are supposed to be

19
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:06,878
Complex emotional creatures?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,959
- I read they're like the equivalent
of a four-year-old human being.

21
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,032
- They're smarter
than a four-year-old.

22
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:19,046
- And they care
about each other.

23
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,619
They care
about their environment.

24
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,625
They tread lightly
through the underbrush

25
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:26,934
Because they don't want
to hurt the plants.

26
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:29,073
- They're a lot like us.

27
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:32,249
And we're gonna honor
every part of her.

28
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,323
Her hide is gonna
make a beautiful rug.

29
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:38,198
Her leg bones we can
carve into knives.

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,207
None of her is gonna
go to waste.

31
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,329
Just like we talked about.

32
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,502
Start at the sternum.

33
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,507
Keep the blade pointed up.

34
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:56,281
Damage the organs,
you ruin the meat.

35
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,443
- I don't know how I'm gonna
feel about eating her after all this.

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,365
- Eating her is honoring her.

37
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:18,709
Otherwise,
it's... It's just...

38
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:21,717
Murder.

39
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,035
Ok.

40
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:30,675
Nice and easy.
Big breath.

41
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:45,182
Good.

42
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,374
(monitors beeping)

43
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,326
(muffled whimpering
and coughing)

44
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,584
(dog barking)

45
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,327
- Morning.

46
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:55,308
- Didn't hear you drive up.
- Hybrid.

47
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,484
Great car for stalking.
- Um,

48
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:00,522
I'm compelled
to go cover myself.

49
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,528
- I have brothers.
- Well, I'll put a robe on

50
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,533
Just the same.
You want a cup of coffee?

51
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:06,539
And more immediately,
why are you here?

52
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,547
- Yes, and Abigail Hobbs
woke up.

53
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,996
- Well, you know how
to bury the lede.

54
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,336
- You want me to get you
a cup of coffee?

55
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:18,872
- No. I want to get my coat.

56
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:21,513
- Let's have a cup of coffee.

57
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:24,956
(ringing)

58
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,742
(cell phone vibrating)

59
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,089
- Is he gonna keep calling?

60
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:39,095
- Jack wants you
to go see her.

61
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:41,435
- And you don't.

62
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,039
- Eventually.

63
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,044
Jack thinks Abigail was

64
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:47,552
An accomplice
to her father's crimes.

65
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:50,527
I don't want to get
in the middle of you and jack,

66
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:53,601
But if I can be helpful
to you as a buffer--

67
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,808
- I--I like you as a buffer.

68
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,019
I also like the fact
that you rattle jack.

69
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,560
He respects you far too much
to yell at you,

70
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,699
No matter how much
he wants to.

71
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,069
- And I take advantage
of that.

72
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:14,659
- Abigail Hobbs
doesn't have anyone.

73
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:19,974
- You can't be
her everyone.

74
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,888
When I said what I was going
to say in my head,

75
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,927
It sounded really insulting,
so I'm going to find

76
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,703
Another way to say it.
- Say it the insulting way.

77
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:36,018
- Dogs keep a promise
a person can't.

78
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,130
- I'm not collecting
another stray.

79
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,606
- The first person Abigail
talks to about what happened

80
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:46,146
Can't be anyone who
was there when it happened.

81
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:48,118
So that means
no dr. Lecter either.

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,995
- Yeah, much less the guy
who killed dad.

83
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:54,201
Jack's wrong
about Abigail.

84
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:57,277
- Let me reach out to her
my own way.

85
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,131
Hi.

86
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,805
I'm alana bloom.

87
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,078
- Are you a doctor?

88
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,421
- Not medicine.
I'm a psychiatrist.

89
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,699
- What do you specialize in?

90
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,844
- Among other things,

91
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,916
Family trauma.

92
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:41,130
- I asked the nurses
if my parents were dead,

93
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:43,203
And they wouldn't tell me.

94
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:48,350
Said I had to wait for you.

95
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:50,857
- I'm sorry
you had to wait.

96
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,369
- I know they're dead.

97
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:03,191
Who buried them?

98
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,497
- They haven't been buried.

99
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:08,973
- Don't you think
they should be?

100
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:12,449
- Your mother was cremated
per the instructions in her living will.

101
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,162
(she clears her throat.)
- my dad?

102
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,878
- Your father is
more complicated.

103
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:27,257
- Because he was crazy?

104
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,499
- The nurses said
you didn't remember.

105
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,507
- I remember. I just didn't want
to talk to them about it.

106
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,023
I want to sell the house.

107
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:41,028
I guess it's mine now.

108
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,268
I can use the money for college,
get an apartment.

109
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,348
What are all those?

110
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,023
- I brought you some clothes.

111
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,161
Thought a change might
feel good.

112
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,301
I guessed your size,
so anything you don't want,

113
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:58,376
Leave the tags on,
I'll bring it back.

114
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:00,348
And I brought you
some music too.

115
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,423
- Your music?
- If there isn't
anything you like,

116
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,197
I've got a stack
of itunes gift cards.

117
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,203
I--I've got a stack
of gift cards.

118
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,975
I don't... Do well
redeeming gift cards.

119
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:15,055
- Probably says something
about you.

120
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:16,525
- Probably does.

121
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:27,122
- I got seven families waiting.

122
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:31,099
No, let me rephrase: Demanding that we find 
whatever's left of their daughters.

123
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,439
Abigail Hobbs may be the only
person who knows the truth.

124
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:36,347
- You can't ask her
right now, jack.

125
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,820
We have to create a safe place
for her first

126
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:42,096
Or you won't get any answers.
- I respect your sympathy

127
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:45,672
For her, dr. Bloom. I hope one day 
you'll appreciate my lack of it.

128
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:49,349
- You really think Abigail Hobbs
helped her father kill those girls?

129
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:51,656
- I think it's a possibility
that needs to be ruled out.

130
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,464
If Abigail didn't help her
father, maybe she knows who did.

131
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:58,441
- How was she
when you saw her?

132
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,513
- Surprisingly practical.

133
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:03,221
- Suspiciously practical?
- I would suggest

134
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,227
She can be practical
without being a murderer.

135
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,600
- I think she's
hiding something.

136
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:11,644
- It may simply be her trauma.
- Yeah, it could also be more.

137
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:13,682
She has a penchant
for manipulation;

138
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:16,190
Withheld information
to gain information;

139
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,563
She demonstrated only
enough emotions

140
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:21,471
To prove she had them. - You're beginning 
to appreciate my lack of sympathy?

141
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,647
- You said it may be more
than trauma, yet you question

142
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,953
Her involvement in the murders
her father committed?

143
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:30,529
- What I'm questioning
is her state of mind.

144
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:34,239
- I want will graham
to talk to her.

145
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,680
- Jack. Not yet.

146
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:41,860
- You are not will graham's
psychiatrist, dr. Bloom.

147
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,567
Dr. Lecter is.

148
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,907
<i>- Garrett Jacob Hobbs--</i>

149
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:51,754
The, uh, minnesota shrike,
abducted and murdered

150
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:56,567
Eight girls
over an eight-month period.

151
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,408
Each of them had the same
hair color, same eye color,

152
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,648
Same age, same height,
same weight

153
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,622
As his daughter Abigail.

154
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:07,397
There was a ninth victim

155
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,603
Who also fit
Abigail Hobbs's profile,

156
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,879
But Garrett Jacob Hobbs
didn't murder her.

157
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,826
The killer who did
wanted us to know

158
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:20,333
He wasn't the minnesota shrike.

159
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,978
He was better
than that.

160
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:32,566
He is an intelligent psychopath.
He is a sadist.

161
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,772
He will never kill
like this again.

162
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,546
So how do we catch him?

163
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:40,019
- Giving a lecture
on Hobbs's copycat?

164
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:43,028
- Well, we need every good mind
we can get on this.

165
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,838
- This copycat is
an avid reader

166
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,047
Of Freddie Lounds
and tattlecrime.com.

167
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,724
He had intimate knowledge

168
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:57,066
Of Garrett Jacob Hobbs's
murders, motives, patterns--

169
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,674
Enough to recreate them
and, arguably,

170
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,916
Elevate them to art.

171
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:05,757
How intimately did he know
Garrett Jacob Hobbs?

172
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,763
Did he appreciate him

173
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,737
From afar, or did he engage him?

174
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:14,515
Did he ingratiate himself
into Hobbs's life?

175
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,223
Did Hobbs know
his copycat

176
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,258
As he was known?

177
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,745
Before Garrett Jacob Hobbs
murdered his wife

178
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,286
And attempted to do
the same to his daughter,

179
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:30,927
He received an untraceable call.

180
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:33,132
I believe

181
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:36,241
The as-yet
unidentified caller

182
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:39,884
Was our copycat killer.

183
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,316
- So you're not a doctor,

184
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:54,223
A nurse, or a psychiatrist.

185
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:56,229
- I'm a journalist.

186
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:58,603
I want to tell the truth.
Your truth.

187
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,277
Sometimes that involves
some deception,

188
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,282
But know this:
I will never lie to you.

189
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,823
- Sounds like something
a liar would say.

190
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:08,028
- If you tell me what you know,

191
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,034
I can help you
fill in the blanks.

192
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:13,210
- How about you tell me
what you know.

193
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,889
- Your dad was
the minnesota shrike.

194
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:20,964
Your mother wasn't the first
person your father killed.

195
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,170
He killed
eight girls.

196
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:27,181
Eight girls that looked--
- Just like me.

197
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,186
- Yes.

198
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:31,192
- Why do they call him
the shrike?

199
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:34,200
- It's a bird that
impales its prey,

200
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:38,278
Harvests the organs
to eat later.

201
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,785
He was very sick.

202
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:45,097
- Does that mean I'm sick too?

203
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:48,004
- You'll be fighting
that perception.

204
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:51,380
Perception is
the most important thing

205
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:54,055
In your life right now.
- I don't care what anybody thinks.

206
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:56,228
- You'd better
start caring, Abigail.

207
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,467
What you remember,
what you tell everyone,

208
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,472
Is going to define
the rest of your life.

209
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,247
Let me help you.

210
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,801
- How did they catch him?

211
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:16,483
- A man named will graham.
Works for the fbi but isn't fbi.

212
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:20,394
He catches insane men
because he can think like them.

213
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:24,003
Because he is insane.

214
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,516
- Would you excuse us, please?

215
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:34,867
I'm special agent Will Graham.
- By special agent he means not really an agent.

216
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:36,873
He didn't get past
the screening process.

217
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,112
Too unstable.

218
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:44,593
- I really must insist you leave the room.
- If you want to talk--

219
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:56,359
- Abigail,

220
00:14:56,361 --> 00:15:00,304
This is dr. Lecter.

221
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:02,309
Do you remember us?

222
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:05,584
- I remember you.

223
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,665
You killed my dad.

224
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,548
- You've been in bed
for days, Abigail.

225
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,623
Why don't we
have a walk?

226
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:26,041
- I'm sorry we couldn't
save your mother.

227
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:30,319
We did everything we could
but she was already gone. - I know.

228
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:36,068
I saw him kill her.

229
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,818
He was loving right up
until the second he wasn't.

230
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,591
Kept telling me
he was sorry,

231
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:48,402
To just hold still.

232
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:52,447
He was gonna
make it all go away.

233
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,586
- There was plenty wrong
with your father, Abigail,

234
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,659
But there's nothing
wrong with you.

235
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,204
You say he was loving.
I believe it.

236
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:03,544
That's what you
brought out in him.

237
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,318
- It's not all
I brought out in him.

238
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:12,201
I'm gonna be messed up.

239
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:15,844
Aren't I?

240
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:18,217
I'm worried about nightmares.

241
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:22,496
- We'll help you
with the nightmares.

242
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:25,604
- There's no such thing

243
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:29,515
As getting used
to what you experienced.

244
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:32,958
It bothers me
a lot.

245
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,666
I worry about nightmares too.

246
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:41,248
- So killing somebody,

247
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,423
Even if you have to do it,

248
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:46,495
It feels that bad?

249
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:56,021
- It's the ugliest thing
in the world.

250
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,806
- I wanna go home.

251
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,826
- Special agent Graham.

252
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,366
I never formally
introduced myself.

253
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:15,776
I'm freddie lounds. - Are you trying to 
salvage this joke from the mouth of madness?

254
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:19,018
- Please. Let me apologize
for my behavior in there.

255
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,023
It was sloppy and misguided

256
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:23,363
And hurtful.
- Miss Lounds.

257
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,436
Now is not the time.

258
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,015
- Look, you and I may have
our own reasons for being here,

259
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:33,926
But I also think we both
genuinely care about what happens

260
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,767
To Abigail Hobbs.
- You told her I was insane.

261
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:39,875
- I can undo that.

262
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:45,089
- You help Abigail see me as
more than her father's killer,

263
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:47,864
And I help you

264
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,808
With online ad sales?
- I can undo what I said.

265
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,114
I can also make it a lot worse.

266
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,122
- Miss Lounds...

267
00:17:57,124 --> 00:18:01,200
It's not very smart
to piss off a guy

268
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:05,011
Who thinks about
killing people for a living.

269
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:08,019
<i>- "it isn't very smart
to piss off a guy</i>

270
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,893
Who thinks about killing
people for a living."

271
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,640
You know what else
isn't very smart?

272
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,645
You were there with him.

273
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,587
And you let those words
come out of his mouth.

274
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,662
- I trust will to speak
for himself.

275
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,667
- Evidently
you shouldn't.

276
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,275
- I'm just happy the story
wasn't about Abigail Hobbs.

277
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:30,180
- Well, then it's a victory.

278
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:33,689
(sighing)
So, Abigail Hobbs

279
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,297
wants to go home.
Let's take her home.

280
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,870
- What Abigail wants
and what she needs

281
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:42,614
Are different things. Taking her out 
of a controlled environment would be reckless.

282
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:45,187
- You said she was practical.
- That could just mean

283
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,562
She has a dissociative disorder.
- You take her home,

284
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,971
She may experience intense
emotions, respond aggressively,

285
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:54,346
Or re-enact some aspect of the 
traumatic event without even realizing it.

286
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:56,118
- Where do you weigh in
on this, doctor?

287
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,658
- Dr. Bloom is right.

288
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:04,207
But there is a scenario where revisiting 
the trauma event could help Abigail heal

289
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:08,352
And actually
prevent denial.

290
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:10,625
- Then we have a difference
of opinion. Therefore,

291
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:13,366
I am going to choose
the opinion

292
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,270
That best serves
my agenda.

293
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:17,243
I need to know

294
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:21,254
If you're right about the copycat, will.
- We have no way

295
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,961
Of knowing what's waiting
for her when she goes home.

296
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,446
- Thanks again
for meeting with me.

297
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,454
I know this hasn't
been easy for you.

298
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,727
- Oh yeah? How
would you know?

299
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:38,468
- I've been writing
about Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

300
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,111
I've spoken to the relatives
of some of his other victims.

301
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,250
- Hobbs is dead.

302
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:46,890
He deserved a lot worse.
Him and his whole family.

303
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:50,936
- There must be some
small comfort knowing

304
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:54,177
That justice was served.

305
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,250
- Comfort?

306
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,431
My sister was impaled on a severed 
stag head, cut down the middle.

307
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,004
He pulled out her lungs
while she was still breathing.

308
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:08,216
There's no comfort in that.
- I'm sorry. I am.

309
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:11,224
But you have to try not
to remember her that way.

310
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:15,937
- What do you
want from me?

311
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,349
- I just thought
you should know Abigail Hobbs

312
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,957
Came out of her coma.

313
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:09,718
- Is this where my mom died?

314
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,694
- Yes.

315
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:21,451
- I was sort of expecting 
a body outline in chalk or tape. 

316
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:23,757
- They only do that
if you're still alive

317
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,668
and taken to the hospital before
they finish the crime scene.

318
00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:33,584
- Goodbye, mom.

319
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,578
- If you ever wanna go,

320
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,452
You just have to say so and we'll go.
- Go where?

321
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,624
The hospital?

322
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:15,533
- For now.

323
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,922
- Who turned all
the pictures around?

324
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:28,368
- Crime scene cleaners
will do that.

325
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,212
- They did a really good job.

326
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:35,187
Is that where all my blood was?

327
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,632
- Yes.

328
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:42,942
- You do this a lot?

329
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,484
Go places and think
about killing?

330
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:51,699
- Too often.

331
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:54,005
- So you pretended to be my dad.

332
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:56,946
- And people

333
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:58,952
like your dad.

334
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:02,462
- What did it feel like?

335
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,533
To be him?

336
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,414
- It feels... Like...

337
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:12,723
I'm talking to his shadow
suspended on dust.

338
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,868
- No wonder you have nightmares.

339
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:24,054
- The attacks on you
and your mother

340
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:26,394
Were different.
They were desperate.

341
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:29,669
Your dad knew he was
out of time. Somebody

342
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:33,347
Told him we were coming.
- The man on the phone?

343
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:36,355
- It was a blocked call.
Did you recognize his voice?

344
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:38,661
- I had never heard it before.

345
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:41,937
- Was there anybody new
in your father's life?

346
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,942
Someone you met or
someone he talked about?

347
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:48,019
- Abigail, he may
have been contacted

348
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,460
By another killer.

349
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,468
A copycat.

350
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,507
- Someone who's still out there?

351
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,148
- Yeah.

352
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,874
- Can you catch
somebody who's crazy?

353
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:10,482
- Folie a deux.

354
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:12,187
- What?

355
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,994
- It's a french
psychiatric term.

356
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:18,871
Madness shared by two.

357
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:20,977
- See?

358
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:23,818
- One cannot be delusional

359
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,891
If the belief in question is
accepted as ordinary

360
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:28,832
By others in that person's
culture or subculture.

361
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,269
Or family.

362
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:34,581
- My dad didn't seem delusional.

363
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,653
He was a perfectionist.

364
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,534
- Your dad left
hardly any evidence.

365
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:44,141
- Is that why
you let me come home?

366
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:45,745
To find evidence?

367
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:49,187
- It was one of many
considerations.

368
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:51,895
- Are we gonna
re-enact the crime?

369
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:54,636
You be my dad, you be my mom,

370
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:58,747
And you be the man
on the phone.

371
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:00,753
- Abigail, we wanted you
to come home

372
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:02,892
To help you leave
home behind.

373
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:08,608
- You're not gonna find
any of those girls, you know.

374
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,619
- What makes you say that?
- He would honor every part of them.

375
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:14,891
He used to make

376
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:17,967
Plumbing putty out of elk's bones.

377
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,240
Whatever bones are left

378
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:24,418
Of those girls are probably
holding pipes together.

379
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,189
- Where did he make this putty?

380
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,329
- At the cabin.

381
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,334
I can show you tomorrow.

382
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:32,675
- Abigail, there's
someone here.

383
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,754
- Hey, Abigail.

384
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,741
So, uh, does that hurt?

385
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,879
- Sometimes.

386
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,158
- Everybody on the block
was on the news.

387
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,999
And everyone at school.

388
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:56,473
Such whores.

389
00:25:56,475 --> 00:26:00,417
- Did you talk to the news?
- No. No!

390
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,261
My mom doesn't want me talking
to you, much less the news.

391
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,102
- Since when do you
listen to her?

392
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:09,342
- Well, clearly I don't.

393
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:11,514
I'm talking to you right now.

394
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:16,461
Everybody thinks
you did it, you know?

395
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:21,174
- Do you think I did it?

396
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:24,550
- I don't think
you're the type.

397
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:26,990
Then again, I didn't
think your father

398
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:30,065
Was the murder-suicide type.

399
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:33,943
Although I guess the hunting
could have been a clue.

400
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:35,948
- Mine or his?

401
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,455
- Both, now that
you mention it.

402
00:26:38,457 --> 00:26:41,998
I don't think
you did it.

403
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,605
- I do.

404
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,981
- This is private property.

405
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,655
- You were the bait, right?

406
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:54,466
That's how it worked? You lure
them back to daddy for dinner?

407
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:56,537
How'd you trap
my sister?

408
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,512
Did you chat her up?
- Hey! Piss off!

409
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:04,058
- Did you help your old man
cut out my sister's lungs

410
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,967
While she was still using--

411
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,387
(spitting)

412
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,529
- He said he was
somebody's brother.

413
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:21,273
- Marissa! Come home.

414
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:23,078
- No...
- Come home!

415
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,724
- Can you stop being
such a bitch?

416
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,197
See you later.
- Bye.

417
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,701
- He's gone.

418
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:49,215
You've never
seen him before?

419
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:51,288
- No.

420
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,731
- Let's get back to the hotel.
We'll go to the cabin tomorrow.

421
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,405
- We should
report this, yes?

422
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,410
- Yes.

423
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:17,360
I'm sorry, okay?

424
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,398
This will all stop.

425
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,505
Please. I'm gonna
make it all go away.

426
00:28:26,352 --> 00:28:30,763
(alarm beeping)

427
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:22,739
- He cleaned everything.

428
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:25,447
He said he was
afraid of germs,

429
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:29,057
But I guess he was just afraid
of getting caught.

430
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,566
- No one else ever came
here with your dad...

431
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:35,642
Except you.

432
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:39,352
- He made everything
by himself.

433
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:43,029
Glue, butter...

434
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,572
He sold the pelts
on ebay or in town.

435
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:49,613
He made pillows.

436
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:51,986
No parts went to waste.

437
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:54,427
Otherwise it was murder.

438
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:04,889
He was feeding them to us.

439
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:07,028
Wasn't he?

440
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,638
- It's very likely.

441
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:16,788
- Before
he cut my throat,

442
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,699
He told me he killed those girls
so he wouldn't have to kill me.

443
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:24,677
- You're not responsible for
anything your father did, Abigail.

444
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:27,150
- If he would've just killed me,

445
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,991
None of those other girls
would be dead.

446
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:31,929
- We don't know that.

447
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,002
Your father--

448
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:57,901
- I need ert at the Hobbs cabin.

449
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:09,031
- Abigail--
(screaming)

450
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:32,429
- Do you think she knew the guy
down by the stream? - Somebody's brother.

451
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:34,435
- Not somebody.

452
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:36,975
Abigail said he asked
if she helped her dad

453
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:39,448
Take his sister's lungs
while she was alive.

454
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,855
- The young woman
on the stag head.

455
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,061
- Cassie boyle.

456
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:46,935
Had a brother,
nicholas.

457
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:50,044
But Garrett Jacob Hobbs
didn't kill

458
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:52,284
Cassie Boyle.
- I know.

459
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:56,896
Garrett Jacob Hobbs would've
honored every part of her.

460
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:59,503
- You brought Abigail Hobbs

461
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:02,077
Back to minnesota to find out
if she was involved

462
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,885
In her father's murders,
and another girl dies.

463
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:08,060
- Yep, scraped
his knuckle on her teeth.

464
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:10,501
There's foreign tissue
and what could be

465
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:14,210
Trace amounts of blood.
- You said that this copycat

466
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:17,854
Was an intelligent psychopath, Will. 
That there would be no traceable motive,

467
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:20,796
No pattern. He wouldn't
kill again this way.

468
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,002
You said it.

469
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,943
- I may have been
wrong about that.

470
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,449
- Yes, because Garrett Jacob
Hobbs never struck his victims.

471
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:31,959
Why would the copycat do it?
- I think he was provoked.

472
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:34,165
Nicholas Boyle

473
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,873
murdered this girl
and his own sister.

474
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:41,252
- With or without Abigail Hobbs?
- Without.

475
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:43,490
- Well, do you think
that Abigail Hobbs

476
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,931
Knew nicholas or cassie boyle?

477
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,070
- No...

478
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,115
- You don't think
she knew them...

479
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:54,655
Or don't want to think
that she knew them?

480
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:57,931
- She said she didn't know them.

481
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,437
(Jack sighs.)
- Dr. Bloom says that Abigail

482
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,443
Has a penchant for, uh,

483
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,615
Manipulation. Is she
manipulating you, will?

484
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:06,421
- Agent Crawford.

485
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:08,393
- Look, he said he was wrong
about the copycat killer.

486
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:10,632
I want to know what else
he's wrong about.

487
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,637
- Whoever killed the girl
on the field killed this girl,

488
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:15,178
I'm right about that.

489
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,685
He knew exactly how
to mount the body.

490
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:21,061
Wound patterns are almost
identical to cassie boyle.

491
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:24,370
Same design, the same...

492
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,676
Humiliation.

493
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:28,716
- Abigail Hobbs
is not a killer.

494
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:32,292
But she could be
the target of one.

495
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:38,308
- I think it's time that Abigail
Hobbs left home permanently.

496
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,447
Doctor, would you be good
enough to collect Abigail

497
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:42,453
And all of her belongings

498
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,693
And escort her out
of Minnesota, please?

499
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:54,218
Not you, will.
I want you here.

500
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:01,472
- (journalists):
Abigail! Abigail!

501
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:21,760
- You killed my daughter!
- Abigail--

502
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:23,666
- Why did you come back here?

503
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:27,644
Why come back?
- Stay here. Stay here.

504
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:31,454
(woman sobbing)

505
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:47,431
- Abigail.

506
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:50,507
- Miss lounds.

507
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:52,680
You're on the wrong side
of the police line.

508
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:55,721
- I've been covering the Minnesota 
shrike long before you got involved.

509
00:34:55,723 --> 00:34:58,896
I wanna help you tell your story. 
You need me now more than ever.

510
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:02,406
- I wanna talk to her.
- No you don't. Go inside.

511
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:05,314
- I'm not the only one lurking
about the Hobbs house peeking in windows.

512
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:08,489
You really should monitor those
police lines more carefully.

513
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:13,871
- Have you seen
a young man, mid-20s,

514
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:16,946
Ginger hair? Unwashed.

515
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,052
- I'll tell you if I saw him

516
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:21,759
If you tell me
why it's important.

517
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:34,461
(sobbing softly)

518
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,432
<i>- None of her
is gonna go to waste.</i>

519
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:04,711
(whimpering)

520
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:14,538
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

521
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,144
Okay? I just need you
to listen to me.

522
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:21,958
I didn't kill
that girl, okay?

523
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,596
I didn't kill her!

524
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,665
Wait!

525
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:28,710
Listen! I didn't--

526
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:50,603
- Abigail?

527
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:56,987
Abigail?

528
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,174
- She'll be all right.

529
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:11,260
Abigail.

530
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,366
Show me what happened.

531
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,908
- He was gonna kill me.
- Was he?

532
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:51,070
This isn't self-defense, Abigail. 
You butchered him.

533
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:53,409
- I didn't...

534
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:57,922
- They will see
what you did

535
00:37:57,924 --> 00:37:59,358
And they will see you

536
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,066
As an accessory
to the crimes of your father.

537
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,010
- I wasn't.

538
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:13,765
- I can help you,

539
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,439
If you ask me to.

540
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:20,350
At great risk to
my career and my life.

541
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,564
You have a choice.

542
00:38:25,566 --> 00:38:28,907
You can tell them
you were defending yourself

543
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:32,818
When you gutted this man...

544
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,224
Or we can hide the body.

545
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:53,942
- Then I don't
remember anything.

546
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:57,117
Maybe a blur out of the corner
of my eye and--

547
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,961
And then a big fat cut to black.

548
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,504
- Well, Nicholas Boyle
attacked Abigail, you,

549
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:08,649
Struck dr. Lecter
in the back of the head.

550
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:11,991
- Well, where's Abigail?
- Lecter took her back to the hotel.

551
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:14,432
- She scratched nicholas boyle
on his way out the back door.

552
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:17,674
The blood on her hands matches
the tissue that we pulled

553
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,646
From marissa schurr's mouth.

554
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,323
- And then what, he--
he got away?

555
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:25,395
- We'll catch him
one way or another.

556
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,208
Where you going?

557
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,749
- I wanna go home.

558
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,782
- Hello, Abigail.

559
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:51,133
- How did you know it was me?
- Hospital called.

560
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:55,344
You climbed over the wall.

561
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,694
Where else were you to go?

562
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:04,703
Home is no longer an option.

563
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:07,343
Come down from there.

564
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,730
- I don't want to go to sleep.

565
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,505
- You can't anticipate
your dreams.

566
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:34,251
Can't block them,
can't repress.

567
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:36,390
- I didn't honor
any part of him,

568
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,331
So it's just murder,
isn't it?

569
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,707
- Most would argue
self-defense.

570
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,582
- Then why not
tell the truth?

571
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,821
- Most would argue.
There would still be those

572
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,894
Who would say you were
taking after your father.

573
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:55,543
- You're glad I killed him.

574
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:59,721
- What would be the alternative?
That he killed you?

575
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,726
- I don't know
if he was going to.

576
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,497
- No, you don't.

577
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:08,645
- You're the one
who called the house.

578
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:11,587
You talked to my dad before--

579
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:15,397
What did you
say to him?

580
00:41:17,337 --> 00:41:20,278
- A simple conversation,

581
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,486
Ascertaining if he was
home for an interview.

582
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:28,600
Then why not tell the truth?

583
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,382
- I think you called the house
as a serial killer.

584
00:41:34,384 --> 00:41:36,622
Just like my dad.

585
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,474
- I am nothing like your dad.

586
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,647
I made a mistake.

587
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:48,689
Something easily misconstrued.
Not unlike yourself.

588
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:58,483
I'll keep your secret.

589
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:01,557
- And I'll keep yours.

590
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,973
- No more climbing walls,
Abigail.
