1
00:00:02,726 --> 00:00:05,526
Oh, great. We've got the Prius
that can make dinner reservations,

2
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:09,026
buy movie tickets, tell us the weather...
I just want one that opens.

3
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:11,508
Maybe we should
have gotten that one.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,590
Mitchell?

5
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:15,926
Oh. Oh my God, Teddy!
Cam, this is Teddy.

6
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:17,326
Teddy. Teddy-Teddy?

7
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:19,958
Doc--doctor Teddy!

8
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:23,836
Teddy was Mitch's one significant
boyfriend before me.

9
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:26,271
Uh, Mitch had recently
just come out.

10
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:27,503
And as he put it,

11
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,488
it was hard to love someone else

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,627
if he couldn't love himself.

13
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:33,511
I actually said those words?

14
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:35,997
Ugh. It's kind of hard
to love myself right now.

15
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,334
You were the one who said,
"I need some time.

16
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:39,642
I'll call you when I heal more."

17
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,428
Ten years later...

18
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,262
Ohh! I never said that.

19
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:45,622
Time to heal more!
That's so sweet and sensitive.

20
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,321
Why did you kill
that part of yourself?

21
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:48,950
You know, I'm hosting a fund-raiser

22
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:50,138
for the hospital this weekend

23
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:51,676
at that roller rink on South main.

24
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,803
Any chance you guys can come?

25
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,757
- Yeah. Absolutely, we'll be there.
- Possibly. Okay.

26
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:56,807
Great. So 4:00 Saturday.

27
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,886
I'm so glad I bumped into y'all.

28
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:00,890
Us, too. Say bye, Lily!

29
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:02,353
Bye, Lily.

30
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:04,403
I taught her that, so...

31
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:06,332
- Bye, Lily. Bye.
- Bye, Teddy.

32
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,138
Oh, my gosh, he's great!

33
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,454
You're okay making plans
with my ex-boyfriend?

34
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,572
Um, yes.
It's been a hundred years.

35
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,289
Plus, this is one of the many
benefits of being gay.

36
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,723
We can be friends with our exes

37
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:20,378
without all the petty jealousy
straight people go through.

38
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,372
Well, I guess I am friends
with Pepper, so...

39
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,693
I went on one date with Pepper.
One.

40
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:26,817
When are you gonna
stop bringing it up?

41
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,152
When you stop reacting like that.

42
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:31,017
Daddy loves Pepper.

43
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:32,304
I taught her that.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,074

00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:47,279
That's private.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,932
Oh, sorry. But why do you have
all of our names down on a list?

48
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:52,584
It's for my school essay--
Pick a hero in your family

49
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:54,759
and write about why
you've chosen him or her.

50
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:56,048
You're still in the running,

51
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,486
but I'm not loving
that you're drinking wine

52
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,514
while watching my brother.

53
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:02,040
Well, it was from an open bottle
of white in your fridge, so...

54
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,047
It's about judgment, Claire.

55
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:04,662
It's not the '70s.
We know better.

56
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,280
There was lipstick on the bottle.

57
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:08,396
There are my babies!

58
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:10,035
- How was dinner?
- Perfect.

59
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,735
I had a steak,
I had some ice cream,

60
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,208
Gloria found a hair in her fish,

61
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,612
and it didn't cost us a penny!

62
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,176
It might have been my own hair,

63
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,334
but Jay was so happy
that I didn't say anything.

64
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:21,023
What?

65
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:23,470
- Mm-hmm.
- Honey, you got a second before you go?

66
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,443
I wanna talk to you
about something.

67
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,693
All right.
Why is she smiling at me like that?

68
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,691
It's good news.

69
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:28,562
Okay.

70
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:30,668
You remember Bob from my office?

71
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,287
Yeah, Uncle Bob.
The one who did the trick

72
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:33,400
where he pulled
a quarter out of my ear.

73
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,417
He learned another trick.

74
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,438
He pulled 50 grand
out of our pension fund.

75
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,215
- Oh.
- I fired him.

76
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,322
But the worst part is,

77
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,559
I was grooming him
to take over the company.

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,475
But there's an upside.

79
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,341
He wants you to work for him.

80
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,775
I know it's just a job right now,

81
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,914
but you know that he has
this thing going on in his chest,

82
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,823
so you never know where
you're going to end up, Claire.

83
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,247
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Gloria. Gloria, it's a cold.

84
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:52,281
- Anyway, look.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:54,110
I know you've been wanting
to get back out there,

86
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,698
and I always kind of thought
that if you did go back to work,

87
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,006
you'd come back
to work with me.

88
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,549
I-I worked there for
half a summer 20 years ago.

89
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,818
And it-- it was terrific, honey.

90
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,179
Listen, obviously,
we'll start you out slow.

91
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,407
We'll give you time to
re-learn about the place,

92
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:09,068
and then maybe move you up.
You know, you do know a guy.

93
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,167
He means him!

94
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,002
It's a wonderful opportunity, dad.
Thanks.

95
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:13,829
- Could I--could I think about it,
talk to Phil? - Oh, sure.

96
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,780
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- All right. All right. All right.

97
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,052
- Where's my boy? Give me my boy.
- Here's your man.

98
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,704
Here's your little man.
Oh, love him.

99
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,687
What did I say about these
flowered blankets for him?

100
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,955
- Ay.
- Huh?

101
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:26,644
He's starting to take after
Hugh hef-nerd over there.

102
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:27,992
Very amusing, Jay.

103
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,298
Let me just get
your name down here.

104
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:34,788
Another brochure
from a community college.

105
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,853
You know, I bet mom
is having them send these.

106
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:38,600
Really? You don't think
they've targeted you

107
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,238
as a must-have recruit?

108
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,661
At least this one doesn't have
that fakey lunchtime shot

109
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:44,919
of the black guy,
Asian girl, and an Indian--

110
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,578
Oh, wait! There it is.

111
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,577
Wow, that wheelchair kid
is really cracking everybody up.

112
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,853
Girls, your mom's on
her way home with dinner!

113
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:52,616
I never got this.

114
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,416
If he sees it,
we'll have to talk about it.

115
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:58,558
What?

116
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,843
What what?

117
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:09,052
If grandpa calls, I'm not home.

118
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:09,965
What happened?

119
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,730
He wants me to work for him.

120
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,189
Like, groom me to
take over or something.

121
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,528
I don't know how I'm gonna say no.

122
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:16,378
Why would you say no?

123
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,082
I thought you were
looking for something.

124
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,253
We could use the money, too,

125
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:21,068
especially if Haley decides
to go back to school.

126
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,074
Oh, is she still throwing out
those college brochures?

127
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,334
Just tossed one now.

128
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,209
Who does she think
empties the trash?

129
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,993
You know what really sucks?
That job could be great.

130
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,787
But my dad is a terrible boss.
He is so mean.

131
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,924
"Princess, coffeepot's
not gonna wash itself."

132
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,360
That's where you got that?

133
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,224
I said it to you one time.

134
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,556
Well, you just gotta tell him
straight up, man to man.

135
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,121
Woman to man.
You're very shapely.

136
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:42,576
I know. I will.

137
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,462
It's just I hate it so much.

138
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,106
The-- the four big times
that I disappointed him,

139
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,061
it devastated me.

140
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:51,575
I mean, the first time,
I cut off all my hair.

141
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,346
I went to college out of state.

142
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:56,500
I crashed his vintage
jag into a wall.

143
00:04:58,619 --> 00:04:59,936
That's only three.

144
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,310
Kids, dinner!

145
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,172
Oh, loving this already.

146
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,419
If no one gets a concussion,
we're totally coming back.

147
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,485
So listen, if at any point
you're not okay

148
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:12,915
with seeing me
and Teddy together,

149
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,581
just please let me know,
and we can go.

150
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,794
Oh, well, thank you.
And if at any point

151
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,422
you're not okay with me
being so okay with it,

152
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,852
you let me know.

153
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,679
Teddy! Teddy! Hey!

154
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,907
- Ah, hey!
- Hey!

155
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,787
Aw, look at you!

156
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:28,513
This shirt is fantastic.
You're adorable.

157
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,495
You're adorable!

158
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,054
Oh, I think somebody has a crush!

159
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,234
Thank you so much for having us.

160
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,199
I don't know which one
of my girls is more excited.

161
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,825
Okay. Come on,
let's get you some skates.

162
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:39,064
I want Teddy to come.

163
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,296
Oh, honey, I-I'm sure
Teddy has other things--

164
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,319
No, no! You guys go! Catch up.

165
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,250
I'll lace up.
Okay.

166
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,731
Okay, ready?

167
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:48,646
- Have fun, okay!
- Hey, Uncle Cam!

168
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:51,071
Oh, my gosh! Hey!
What's--what's going on?

169
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:52,682
What--what are you
guys doing here?

170
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:54,911
- Teddy invited us.
- You guys know Teddy.

171
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,035
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah, Teddy's great.

172
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:58,097
Heads up, amateurs!

173
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:01,870
It's time to rock 'n' roll!
Do you get it?

174
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,507
Cam, what are you doing here?

175
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,580
- Um...
- Oh, hell, it's dad.

176
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:06,759
Whose dad? Not your dad.

177
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,531
I have been avoiding
his calls all day.

178
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,598
Quick, Phil, slingshot me.
All right.

179
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,124
Oh. Limbo skate, kids.

180
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,828
How low can you go?

181
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,294
I'm at a roller rink
with my family

182
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,601
on a Saturday night.
I win.

183
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,770
I have got to get a photo of Lily.

184
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,487
Teddy's making her giggle so hard.

185
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:26,308
Oh, well, everybody loves...
Teddy, so...

186
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,412
But you'll let me know
if you're not okay.

187
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:30,635
Mitchell, do you know
your entire family's here,

188
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,798
invited by your ex-boyfriend?

189
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,690
Phil and Claire,
Jay and Gloria,

190
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:35,921
your cousin Pete.

191
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,168
Hey!

192
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,770
C--it's a-- it's a fund-raiser, all right?

193
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,534
I'm sure he just invited
everyone on his contact list.

194
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:45,130
Oh, well, that makes sense.

195
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,168
Yes, of course it does.

196
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,557
And... I'm flattered.

197
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:50,852
Why are you flattered?

198
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,764
- You know.
- I don't.

199
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,244
You do!

200
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,551
I really don't!

201
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,001
Gloria, throw on those skates
and take a whirl with me.

202
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:07,858
Oh, I totally would,

203
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,229
but I'm taking care of Lily
and she doesn't want to.

204
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,116
- Oh.
- Yes, I do.

205
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:12,986
No, you don't.
You told me before.

206
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:15,433
You don't remember?
Why would I lie?

207
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,200
Gloria.

208
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,190
You don't know how to roller-skate.

209
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,428
Of course I do.
I know how to do everything.

210
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,831
I can't lie to that face.

211
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:28,573
It's a good thing
that we're not married.

212
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,557
Well, I don't...

213
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,584
I can't skate.
I am an elegant woman.

214
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,577
That means that I never do

215
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,967
the few things that
I don't really do that good.

216
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,639
But I'm a natural teacher.

217
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,551
But I'm going to look stupid.

218
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:41,615
Gloria...

219
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,536
Trust me.

220
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:45,416
As long as you're standing next to me,

221
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,999
you will not look stupid.

222
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,050
Oh, thank God!
There is no place to sit.

223
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,570
Always room at my table
for my darling nieces.

224
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,357
Uhh... you beat us to it.

225
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,009
We were gonna ask
this kid if we could share.

226
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,260
Well, he was just leaving.

227
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,806
Yeah, you can totally sit with us.

228
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,842
You know, I debated
even putting you two on here.

229
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:05,826
Whoa, fancy.

230
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,086
Yeah, I know.
Well, I did used to work here.

231
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,881
W-w-wait.
You're the Claire from the bathroom?

232
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,401
Oh, is it still here?

233
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:14,148
Y-yeah... oh...

234
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,735
Oh! Hey!
Look at you two catching up

235
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,875
- after all these years.
- Well, it hasn't been that long.

236
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,260
It's been like a month
since you came by

237
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:21,184
- when Alex had the flu, right?
- Oh, no kidding!

238
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:23,158
Well, I do get a
home-cooked meal out of it.

239
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,074
Plus I owe these guys.

240
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:25,740
- Phil helped me buy my last two houses.
- Oh...

241
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,864
Oh. So good.
Such great stories.

242
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:29,746
- Yeah.
- Hey, you!

243
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:31,208
You owe me a phone call!

244
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,196
I know! I'm gonna call you!

245
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,477
Hey! Teddy's here, huh?

246
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:38,093
Hey, you deadbeat, you owe me
50 bucks for the golf.

247
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,630
Well, maybe I'll slip it to you
during your next prostate exam.

248
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:43,070
I'll bet you're counting
the days, you perv.

249
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:44,922
Oh. So funny.

250
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,269
You and Jay really seem
to have a thing, don't ya?

251
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,747
And Gloria-- what's the nature
of your relationship with her?

252
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,344
Well, actually,
we just met tonight.

253
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,997
You know, I'm not
so sure she likes me.

254
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:53,969
Really?

255
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,527
Uh, well, I mean, she just
takes a little time to warm up.

256
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:00,303
Oh, thanks. And thank you,
again, for coming tonight.

257
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,046
With the money we raised,
we'll be able

258
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:04,367
to inoculate over 4,000 needy kids

259
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:07,117
against some truly awful diseases.

260
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:09,041
And how well do you know Luke?

261
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,186
I love that movie, too!

262
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:13,765
Yeah, that cool fight scene
on that skyscraper in Shanghai--

263
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,472
it really made me
want to go to Japan.

264
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,379
Why? Shanghai's in China.

265
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,068
I'm just saying, you don't
want to fly to Japan,

266
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:21,454
get in a cab and say,
"take me to downtown Shanghai."

267
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,224
It's a pretty expensive ride.

268
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,315
Uh, um, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom.

269
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,408
Come with me.

270
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:28,915
Be right back, guys.

271
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:33,045
Uh, what do you think
you're doing out there?

272
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:35,506
- I'm flirting.
- That's what I was afraid of.

273
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,053
Look, I'm not gonna
pretend I'm stupid

274
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,249
- just so a boy will like me.
- Of course not.

275
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,422
But you don't have to put
the poor guy to shame.

276
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:44,085
Flirting with boys is about
increasing your value,

277
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:45,426
not decreasing theirs.

278
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:48,921
That's a complicated thought.
What magazine taught you that?

279
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,583
You're doing it again!
The mean thing.

280
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,606
Can you even hear it or what?!

281
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,094
- I heard it.
- Good.

282
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,173
So now that he knows
that you're smart,

283
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,916
let's work on being nice.

284
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,613
- Wanna ditch the hoodie?
- No.

285
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,625
That's all good. It's a process.

286
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,900
Man, tough finding
a hero in this family, huh?

287
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,283
You know, I've got
problems of my own.

288
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:11,384
I can't always be the lovable
sidekick on "the Manny show."

289
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,868
Did you even notice
I'm binge-eating?

290
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:16,466
Whoa. You're really
going through something.

291
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,330
Wanna talk about it?

292
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:18,732
Not even a little bit.

293
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,318
And don't go hounding me
like you always do.

294
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,762
Well, thanks for restoring
my faith in this family.

295
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:25,259
Too bad I'm not related to Teddy.

296
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,362
- He seems terrific.
- Doesn't he, though?

297
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:29,316
Knees bent.

298
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,944
Arms loose. Chin up.

299
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,053
Butt out.

300
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,351
Ay, no, Phil. This is too much.

301
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:36,705
No, just remember,
"kbalcubo." Huh?

302
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,051
K-b-a-l-c-u-b-o.

303
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,305
- "Koala bears always lose cherries
under big overpasses." - Ay.

304
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,971
- Ay, no! How am I gonna
remember all that?! - Uh, uh... oh!

305
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:44,504
- Oh!-  Aah!
- I gotcha.

306
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:47,393
- Ay, Teddy...
- Teddy, you're amazing!

307
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,254
Thank you for saving me!

308
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,696
Let me get in there, boys.
Excuse me.

309
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,147
Boom!

310
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:55,907
Okay!

311
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:57,828
Okay, clearly it's time to talk.

312
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,550
All right, Cam, Cam,
you're obviously upset.

313
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:03,016
But trust me--
there are no lingering feelings

314
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:03,966
between me and Teddy.

315
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,357
I don't care about you and Teddy.

316
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:07,879
I don't like what's lingering
between him and your family.

317
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,777
- What?
- Mitchell, look around.

318
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,180
Your family is cheating on me
with your ex-boyfriend.

319
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,737
Cheating-- Okay, yes.
Th-there is a bit more contact

320
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,129
between them than I realized, but--

321
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,958
Oh, o-oh, yeah.
Now this is where we make Cam

322
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,360
the over-sensitive drama queen.

323
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:22,521
God forbid we take any action
to make things right for me.

324
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,409
Well, okay, okay.
Okay, what do you want me to do?

325
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,603
Would you like me to ask them
to break up with Teddy?

326
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,400
Is that what you're asking?

327
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,932
Of course not.
I would never ask that.

328
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,755
- That would be insane.
- Well, good.

329
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,534
It would be as insane
for me to ask that

330
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,828
as it would be sane
for you to offer it.

331
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,333
So that is what you're asking.

332
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,971
No, that's what I'm not asking.

333
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,156
But if you decide to do it,
I want it to come from you,

334
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:44,839
not me, because
I'm clearly not asking for it.

335
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,945
- Okay, this is nuts.
- Is it?

336
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,446
I worked my fingers to the bone

337
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,332
to get these jumpy
protestants to love me,

338
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,717
and now I find out
they're holding a torch

339
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,521
for the man who came before me?

340
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,687
It's not nuts.
It's actually quite painful.

341
00:11:57,688 --> 00:12:00,094
Excuse me, sir?
You just won a prize

342
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,009
for setting a rink record
on the boxing machine.

343
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,144
If you wouldn't mind taking
a picture for our wall of fame?

344
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:06,219
Oh, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Just one second.

345
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,856
- Okay.
- That's exciting.

346
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,898
Mitchell, I know
you'll do what's right.

347
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,959
Unless you like seeing me humiliated.

348
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:14,718
Thank you.

349
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,875
Everybody was staring, Phil.

350
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:30,927
Well, what if we practice outside
where no one can see us?

351
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,512
Ay, and now I have
the nervous burps!

352
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,876
- Oh...
- Claire.

353
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,828
Dad? Wh-what are
you doing out here?

354
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,070
Apparently this is the only way
we'll get to talk tonight.

355
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:41,236
- About this job--
- Mm-hmm?

356
00:12:41,237 --> 00:12:44,054
- Hey, guys. - This sounds
really important, dad. Hang on.

357
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,657
- Go ahead, Mitchell.
- Okay, so listen. This is coming from me.

358
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,982
- Mm-hmm. - No one else. Um...
but I need you to do something,

359
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,077
- and I don't want you
to give me any flack. - Oh, jeez.

360
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:53,017
That's flack.
I-I think it's a little weird

361
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:55,673
- how you all still hang out
with Teddy so much... - Told you.

362
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,463
And I think it'd be appropriate
if maybe you all,

363
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,684
you know, stopped seeing him.

364
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,484
This is coming from Cam, isn't it?

365
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,645
No, it's not.

366
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:04,561
Wait a second.

367
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,662
Cam doesn't think we can love him
and Teddy at the same time?

368
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,958
And you just sold Cam out like that?
Wow.

369
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,086
Wait. What is that?

370
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,051
I'll tell you what it is.
It's sad.

371
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,513
Hey, skaters!
Not an emergency,

372
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,941
but we do have a small
fire in the snack bar.

373
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:22,845
We'd like everyone to calmly
file outside. Thanks.

374
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,469
Okay, everyone,
the exit's over here.

375
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,923
Come this way, please.

376
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:27,121
Hey, this way, to the exit.

377
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:28,369
All right, everybody over here.

378
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,773
Come on.
You guys, just do this for me.

379
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:33,080
But... he's all the way over there.

380
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,789
There's no hurry. We're in
a wooden box built in 1970.

381
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,912
- Let's go! 
- Oh--all right, let's go.

382
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:38,706
Okay, thank you. That's very nice.

383
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:39,627
- Okay.
- Sweet of you.

384
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,766
Hey, skaters, good news!

385
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,182
Fire's out!

386
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,021
Sorry for the scare.

387
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,978
All right--all right,
before you get upset,

388
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:49,365
this was just about convenience.

389
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,644
- Was it? 
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,760
Or was it a perfect metaphor?

391
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:54,031
Congratulations, Mitchell.

392
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:57,332
This is the saddest
I've ever been in roller skates.

393
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,101
Okay, be careful.

394
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,048
I don't want to get hurt, okay?

395
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,124
No one's gonna get hurt.
Hold on!

396
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,286
Aah! That hurts!

397
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,145
- Okay, if we could just--
- Aah!

398
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:10,222
- Son of a Mitchell!
- Aah!

399
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,559
Do not worry one bit.

400
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,491
You are gettin' it!

401
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,130
Let's get away from the cars, huh?

402
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,383
Disgusting.

403
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,675
Claire Pritchett?

404
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:24,360
- Jeff?
- No way!

405
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:25,909
I haven't seen you
since you worked here.

406
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,720
- Oh, wow! You... you still do.
- Yeah, do what you love,

407
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,713
- you never work a day in your life, right?
- Right.

408
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:32,354
This is perfect.

409
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,994
Some civilian just
yakked in the rink.

410
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,104
Can you take over for a minute?

411
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,778
Um... no.

412
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,497
Ah, it's kind of where
I make most of my money.

413
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:40,456
- You know, I hate to shut it down.
- Mm.

414
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:43,550
Ah, I got a girl pregnant.
It's a whole thing.

415
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,058
It's-- all right.
I'll do it for a minute, sure.

416
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,214
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay.

417
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:47,916
- Oh, hey...
- Yeah?

418
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,249
I still think about that kiss.

419
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:55,175
Oh, God.

420
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,060
Bleh! Gross.

421
00:14:58,061 --> 00:14:59,533
Mom, I threw up.

422
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,573
Oh, honey, that was you?
You're gonna be okay.

423
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:04,258
Let me get you something
for your tummy.

424
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,156
I'm just so stressed out.

425
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:08,318
You know that hero essay
I have to write?

426
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,046
Mm-hmm?

427
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:11,695
Well, dad kind of assumed
I wrote it about him...

428
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:12,967
- Mm-hmm.
- But I didn't.

429
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,913
And now he wants to read it,
and I don't know what to do.

430
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,582
Don't worry about your father.
I am sure he'll understand.

431
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,744
Claire, I need some ice for Cameron.

432
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,177
And we have to talk about the job.

433
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:24,806
Unless you've taken back this one.

434
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,405
Dad, I'm with a customer right now.

435
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:28,072
I'll be with you in just a moment.

436
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,237
Honey, I'll talk to your dad.

437
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:35,175
You don't think he'll be upset
I wrote it about you?

438
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,638
You wrote it about me?

439
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,622
Mom, you know me and homework.

440
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:41,397
I didn't give it much thought.
What's a hero?

441
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,980
Someone who's not
afraid of anything,

442
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,879
and who's strong-- that's you.

443
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:47,694
But dad's so great, too.

444
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:49,204
- Here it comes.
- Okay. All right.

445
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,803
You just sit down.
Sit down, sweet pea.

446
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,671
Have your drink.
You're gonna be fine.

447
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:54,980
Okay.

448
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,605
Here goes. Um...

449
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:01,127
So, dad, the last time
we worked together,

450
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,789
- it was tense between us.
- What?

451
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,911
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

452
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:07,634
You were--
you're really hard on me,

453
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,871
and you talk down to me.

454
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,127
- You don't know what
you're talking about. - Right.

455
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:13,869
And when I confronted you
like I am doing now,

456
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,854
you were insensitive,
like you are being now.

457
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:19,087
And while I really
appreciate the opportunity

458
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:21,173
and I do love you very much,
I don't think

459
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:23,137
that working together
is a very good idea.

460
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,158
All right, fine.

461
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:29,949
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm very disappointed.

462
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,354
- We won!
- Man, that sucks!

463
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,523
Yeah, totally un-masculating.

464
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,381
Well, at least you guys
look cool when you play.

465
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,758
Let's play again.
This never happened.

466
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,383
Actually, we need to go hang out
with our family for a while.

467
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:48,665
Really? Now?

468
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,290
Yeah, but we'll be around.
We'll see you guys.

469
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:53,917
What happened? Did I mess up?

470
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,530
No, you did great.
So he didn't like me?

471
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,798
- No, he totally liked you.
- Then why'd we walk away?

472
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,222
'Cause it was never about him.

473
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:01,025
This was about getting you 
some confidence.

474
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,780
Guys will pick up on that.
Better guys.

475
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,850
Guys who can lose to a girl
without feeling e-masculated.

476
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,172
Okay, try not to throw this
in my face one day,

477
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,385
but sometimes
you're actually really smart.

478
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,286
Like, smart smart.
I hope you know that.

479
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:18,630
Wow.

480
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:20,953
Thanks.

481
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:25,561
But I'm totally throwing that
in your face one day.

482
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:26,753
Are you kidding?

483
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,670
Oh, thank you so much.
Everything go okay?

484
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:32,857
No. Actually,
I was trapped back here,

485
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:34,280
my dad and I got in a whole thing.

486
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,846
Now he's mad at me.

487
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,989
- Whoa, where'd you find that?
- I know where you keep the beer, Jeff.

488
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,565
I hate this feeling!

489
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,894
I swear, it started when
I was 12 years old

490
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,844
and I got a "C" in social studies.

491
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,408
The way my dad looked at me,
you would have thought

492
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,288
I'd worn a tube top in church.

493
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,119
He knew it crushed me.

494
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,348
He didn't care.

495
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,251
That's why I can't work for him.

496
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:55,668
He was hard on me then.
He's gonna be hard on me now.

497
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm telling you,
people don't change.

498
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,279
I've changed.

499
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:02,177
I don't wanna put up
with this stuff.

500
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:05,666
I am a completely different person
than I was 20 years ago.

501
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,869
All right, kids,
that's gonna be $18.50.

502
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,824
Out of $20?

503
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:13,308
There's your $1.50...

504
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,473
I thought so.

505
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:18,718
Well, I mean,

506
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,177
do you feel good that you were
at least honest with him?

507
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:23,938
No.
And... super no.

508
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:25,818
Because I'm the one who's left
with this awful feeling

509
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:26,985
every time I disappoint him.

510
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,026
It's not fair.

511
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,261
'Cause I'm not the bad guy here.

512
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,734
He needs to know that.

513
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,079
How's that?

514
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,955
- That better?
- Yeah, much better. Tha--

515
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,573
Thank you, Teddy.

516
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:44,373
You're fixed. Skate with me.

517
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,057
I think it's a little soon, sweetie.

518
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,923
- No. Teddy.
- But--oh, sure thing, kiddo.

519
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:51,506
Hey, lots of ice,
no cartwheels for three days.

520
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,722
- Yeah.
- Ready? Come on.

521
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,132
Good guy.

522
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:58,033
Who--Teddy? Yeah.
Yeah, he's the best.

523
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:00,166
Nuts he can't find anybody, huh?

524
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,634
Gotta be something
a little off there.

525
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,334
He definitely did not bring out
the best in Mitchell,

526
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,505
I can tell you that right now.

527
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:07,941
Oh, really?

528
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:10,161
Well, you know,
not that it matters...

529
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,338
But in what way exactly?

530
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,653
Honestly?
When they were together,

531
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,026
- Mitchell could be a bit of a pill.
- Oh.

532
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:17,656
Now, I like Teddy,

533
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:21,388
but when they broke up,
I was actually kinda glad.

534
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,422
Of course, Mitchell
thought that I was

535
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,481
uncomfortable because
of the gay thing,

536
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,036
and maybe I was, but...

537
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:28,974
I really just wanted him
to be happy.

538
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,821
Like he is now.

539
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:33,750
And when you two started up,
everyone thought,

540
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,398
"well, there it is."

541
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:40,323
Okay, kids. Couples skate.

542
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:43,351
Grab someone you love
and get out there.

543
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,580
Jay, you can be so...

544
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,749
- I'm not skating with you, Cam.
- Yeah.

545
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:51,158
What about me, dad?
You wanna skate with me?

546
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,233
What qualifies someone as a hero?

547
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:01,105
Obviously, a hero has
to be someone we respect.

548
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,178
A person we look up to.

549
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,185
A person who is generous of spirit.

550
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,474
Who's willing to grow and learn.

551
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,476
So... dad,

552
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:15,101
if that offer still stands...

553
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:18,095
Really?
What changed?

554
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,129
A couple of things.

555
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,472
Maybe it's the person
you love most in the world

556
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,585
or the guy who makes
the most out of life,

557
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,176
no matter what anyone thinks.

558
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,013
No! It's cool!
No, everybody's laughing at me!

559
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:31,134
- Keep rolling! This is your chance!
- Ay, no! No!

560
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:33,657
Yeah!

561
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,749
- Phil!
- I know!

562
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:38,582
- Funny, though...
- Go, dad!

563
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,210
The hero in my family is my family,

564
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,136
because of who we are together.

565
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,924
"C" minus.
"This was not the assignment."

566
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,320
I'll tell you who is not my hero.

567
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,811
Mrs. Rita McNabb.

568
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:05,960
Yeah!

569
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,328
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

570
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:09,542
What is everybody looking at?

571
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:11,157
Oh, I guess I can tell
the story one more time.

572
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:13,414
Sure, yeah. Well,
I was mad about something.

573
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:14,752
I don't even remember what.

574
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:16,301
I turned. Now at this point,

575
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:18,389
I'm more animal than I am man.

576
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,114
Strike the punching machine,

577
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:22,821
and apparently I broke
some sort of world record.

578
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:24,224
I guess the thing
that I'll never forget

579
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:25,702
is the sound that it made.

580
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:28,987
It was, like,
bells and whistles and sirens.

581
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,558
It's impossible to describe.

582
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh, no!

583
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,924
That was literally the first
punch I've ever thrown!

584
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:38,386
You are never to see him again.

585
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:39,479
Yes, I know.

586
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,879
