1
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,152
MAN: Just look sexy, please.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,862
WOMAN: Come on.
That wasn't sexy.

3
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,148
God, I'm so happy I married you.

4
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:09,215
(laughs)

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:14,942
What are they going
to do to me in there?

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,207
If you stop taking pictures

7
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:18,977
and come inside, we can find out.
(laughs)

8
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,076
This place is crazy.
You think we're still going to want

9
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:22,681
to bang each other when we're 80?

10
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:25,016
Uh, you better. Otherwise
I'm going to leave your ass.

11
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:26,888
Wait a minute.
I'm the best you've ever had.

12
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:28,616
Actually, there was this one guy...

13
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,091
Shut up. Shut up.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,828
You are so sexy.

15
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:33,465
Come on.

16
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:34,999
Let's go inside.

17
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,337
Last stop on
the haunted honeymoon tour.

18
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,173
Better make it good. Mm-hmm.

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,477
♪ Here comes the bride ♪

20
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,985
(gasps)

21
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,458
(both laugh)

22
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,162
Built in 1908,

23
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,664
Briarcliff Manor was
the largest tuberculosis ward

24
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,367
on the East Coast.

25
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:02,269
46,000 people died here.

26
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,536
You think it's haunted?

27
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:05,172
(laughs)
They shuttle the bodies

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,573
out through an underground tunnel

29
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,275
called "the death chute."

30
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:10,712
We should totally do it
in the death chute.

31
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,080
Oh, my God, you are so demented.

32
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,681
I love you.

33
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,417
What are we going to tell
our kids about the honeymoon?

34
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:16,952
Tell them the truth.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,021
(sighs) How we visited the 12
most haunted places in America

36
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:21,590
and screwed our brains out
in every single one.

37
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,358
Or that Mommy's a horror freak

38
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:25,393
and Daddy lives to make Mommy happy?

39
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,628
Mmm, he does. Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:29,898
(faint rattling)

41
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,803
Come on. Let's keep exploring.

42
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,039
All right.

43
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:39,940
We got an hour before sunset.
Let's make it quick.

44
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,210
WOMAN: The Catholic Church
bought this place in '62

45
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:48,116
and turned it into a sanitarium
for the criminally insane.

46
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:51,120
Legend has it that once you
are committed at Briarcliff,

47
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:53,322
you never got out.

48
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,358
Their most famous resident

49
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:56,859
was a serial killer.

50
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:58,194
MAN: Bloody Face.

51
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,330
Say "Bloody Face."

52
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:01,665
Bloody Face.

53
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:12,744
Teresa!

54
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:16,148
You got to see this penny chair.

55
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,217
Oh-ho.

56
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,352
(giggles)

57
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,053
Tie my down.

58
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:23,223
I'm sick, Doctor.

59
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,358
Can you help me?

60
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,059
I don't know.

61
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,628
You seem to have a very bad case

62
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:28,595
of morbid erotica.

63
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,699
(gasps)

64
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,368
Ready for your injection?

65
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:45,681
(loud bang) What is that?

66
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,851
(panting): What is that?

67
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,285
I don't... um... What is that?
Let's go see.

68
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:50,320
No, no, no, no...

69
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,321
Come on.

70
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,289
No, come on. Let's go.

71
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,590
You're killing me.

72
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,159
Promise I'll make it up to you.

73
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:56,160
No, you swear we're coming back.
Promise me we're coming back.

74
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:56,994
I promise, I promise. Okay.

75
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,395
Maybe it's Bloody Face.

76
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,297
Maybe it's just old pipes.

77
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,200
You can totally put it
in my ass right now.

78
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,801
(laughs) Wow.

79
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:06,971
Oh, come on.

80
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,542
I can't see.

81
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,078
Hey, take it easy.
Take it easy.

82
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,080
What, you scared? Pussy.

83
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:16,849
(scoffs)

84
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,017
So tight.

85
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:22,055
Oh, my God! What? What? What?

86
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,823
Oh, you are such a prick.

87
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,158
You are

88
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:26,192
such a prick.

89
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,627
Speaking of which...

90
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,996
No, I want to know what's in there.

91
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,298
Do it again and I'll blow you.

92
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,066
(scoffs)

93
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,419
Give me your phone.

94
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:44,946

95
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,561

96
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:19,726
(car engine starts)

97
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,061
ATTENDANT:
That'll be three dollars even.

98
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,629
30 cents a gallon.

99
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,931
You think because you're
out here in the toolies

100
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,465
you can gouge people?

101
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,934
I don't set the prices, sir.

102
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,435
Kids get a coloring book?

103
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,770
Yeah, that be Texaco.

104
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,238
WOMAN: Come on, Jack.
I just want to go home.

105
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:33,239
Whoa.

106
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:35,808
Nice.

107
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:36,809
Drive safely.

We just want to borrow it.

Nigger try to mess

Are you guys insane?
Come on, Kit.

139
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,221
We're just gonna scare him,
come with us.

140
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:58,355
I'm not going with you guys.

141
00:06:58,423 --> 00:06:59,523
And neither is the gun.

142
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,992
So, just leave.

143
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,300
How much is Al paying you these days?

144
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:13,170
I hear you got yourself a maid.

145
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,505
That's what I hear anyway.

146

I'm not to you putting
those two words together.

152
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:10,898
But I like it,

00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,174
(both sigh)

156
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,742
So, how are you?

157
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,110
Good.

158
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,244
How are you?

159
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:25,178
I'm good.

160
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,351
Let's do it, babe.

161
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:33,887
Let's tell everyone.

162
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:36,022
Come on. We didn't
commit a crime.

163
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,091
We drove to Provincetown
and got married.

164
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,560
Your family, my folks...
they should know.

165
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,295
The world will change one day.

166
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:45,231
The world is wrong.

167
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,033
We need to keep it a secret.

168
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:49,603
(sighs)

169
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,305
Baby...

170
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:55,008
it makes me feel like
I can't protect my own family.

171
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,415
The roast is just about ready.

172
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:04,751
That's not what I'm hungry for.

173
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:16,528
I can't take... damn it...

174
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:17,930
(laughs)

175
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,917
Oh, babe.

176
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:40,952
I hope you like
your beef tough and dry

177
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,321
because that's what I want
for dinner tonight.

178

Lana Winters from the <i>Gazette.</i>

210
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,528
I'm doing a story on your bakery,

211
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,663
and I have an appointment
with Sister Jude.

212
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,386
Play with me!

213
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,789
Play with me!

214
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,824
Ow!

215
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:15,659
Pepper, leave the lady alone.

216
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:16,893
Oh, it's fine.

217
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,662
She was only trying to make friends.

218
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,330
It was harmless.

219
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:21,831
She's not harmless.

220
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,367
She drowned her sister's baby
and sliced his ears off.

221
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:25,368
Follow me, miss.

222
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:34,010
WOMAN (shrieks): No! No!

223
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,180
I don't want to go to bed!

224
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:39,283
Sister Jude calls this
her "stairway to heaven."

225
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,556
MAN: Leave me alone!

226
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,457
(man shouting indistinctly)

227
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:59,303
A lady reporter...!

228
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:05,209
Told you I would come find
you, Sister Mary Eunice.

229
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:06,944
Brush yourself off, Shelly.

230
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,179
Do you think

231
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,914
I'm full of shame and regret

232
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:11,449
for what I've done now, Sister?

233
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,151
You could shave me bald as a cue ball,

234
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,153
and I'll still be the hottest
tamale in this joint.

235
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,025
Take her to the common room
so the others

236
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:22,928
can witness her newfound immaculacy.

237
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:24,030
And next time, knock.

238
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,533
Remind me of your name.

239
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,936
Lana. Lana Winters.

240
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:31,905
Can I ask what Shelly did?

241
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,873
I assume you were
punishing her for something.

242
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,477
I assumed you were here
to do a story on our bakery.

243
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,011
Oh, believe me, no one loves

244
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,579
that molasses bread more than I do.

245
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:43,651
I toast it for my breakfast
every single morning.

246
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:46,327
Shelley was brought to us
having been given

247
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:49,249
the preposterous diagnosis
by a psychiatrist

248
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,518
comparing her to a wood nymph.

249
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:53,854
You mean a nymphomaniac?

250
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,255
Just more nonsense
from the charlatans.

251
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:58,325
That young woman is a victim
of her own lust.

252
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:00,427
There's no other name for it.

253
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:06,100
Mental illness is the
fashionable explanation for sin.

254
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,601
(slams drawer shut)

255
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:09,603
You said your name's Lana?

256
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,305
After the movie star?

257
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:13,440
Now there's a train wreck of a soul.

258
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,343
Jennifer Jones, however,
there's a true lady.

259
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:18,746
You've seen <i>Song of Bernadette?</i>

260
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,548
Oh, it's a classic. Yeah.

261
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:22,817
But at Briarcliff,
I hear you're the true star.

262
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:26,387
Oh, no, not me.
The monsignor, Timothy Howard.

263
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:29,057
He's the real visionary.
Sit down. You make me nervous.

264
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,360
You know what this place was
just two years ago?

265
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:33,762
A hellhole!

266
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,430
And I'm told the bakery was your idea.

267
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:37,933
It was, but it was based
on his philosophy.

268
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:39,902
Well, write it down.

269
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,470
He believes the tonic

270
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:45,507
for a diseased mind
lies in the three "P" s:

271
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:48,143
Productivity, prayer,
and purification.

272
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:50,113
The bakery's just the tip
of the iceberg.

273
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,422
Oh, we have such dreams
for this place.

274
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,290
Are all your patients
remanded here by the state?

275
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:58,394
Not all.

276
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,195
The monsignor's a man of charity.

277
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,530
You know where most
of our wards come from?

278
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:03,698
The ghetto.

279
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,801
They said to tell you that the...

280
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,371
Oh, I didn't knock.
I'm sorry, Sister.

281
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:10,772
You were sent to tell me what?

282
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,774
Sent to tell you... What?

283
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:15,944
The bad person will arrive any minute.

284
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,312
Thank you, Sister.

285
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:21,015
Well, are we ready
for our bakery tour?

286
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,817
She's talking about the maniac,

287
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:25,120
the killer of those women,
isn't she? Bloody Face.

288
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,654
Bloody Face?

289
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:27,922
An eyewitness caught a glimpse of him

290
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,391
leaving one of the crime scenes
wearing a mask,

291
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,526
which appeared to be made of
human flesh. I heard he's going

292
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:33,495
to be admitted here today.
Is there any way I can meet him?

293
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:35,330
You're not in the least bit
interested in our good works.

294
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:36,865
Our town's in a collective panic.

295
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,534
This maniac is decapitating
women, three of them so far.

296
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,502
I see you for exactly who you are.

297
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,971
Three minutes.
Give me three minutes with him,

298
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,006
and I swear to God
I will write an amazing...

299
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,808
Swear to God?!
It's rich coming from you.

300
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,110
People want to understand what's
in the mind of someone like him.

301
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:52,480
There's not a pious bone in your body.
Where's the harm in that?

302
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:55,681
You're out of your depth,
Miss Lana Banana.

303
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:58,416
You want a story?
Write this down.

304
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:01,756
<i>Your killer is being turned</i>
<i>over to us by the authorities</i>

305

It's an ordeal, I know...
our check-in procedures.

310
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:01,940
Though, not a patch on what you
put your victims through.

311
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:06,377
Sister, I didn't kill anybody.

312
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:08,846
The guards have given you
over to my care.

313
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,881
Not for correction, but for storage

314
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,649
while they weigh your fate.

315
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:15,718
This is not a meat locker.

316
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,121
Here, you will repent for your crimes

317
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:21,023
to the only judge that matters:

318
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,557
The Almighty God.

319
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,125
There is no God.

320
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:29,262
Not a God who would create
the things I saw.

321
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,098
Your story about little green men?

322
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,466
No, never will do here.

323
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:37,001
They weren't human.

324
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,803
They were monsters.

325
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,806
All monsters are human.

326
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:43,074
You're a monster.

327
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,780
I wonder...

328
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:52,850
did her dark meat slide off the bone

329
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,652
any easier than your other victims?

330

00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:20,359
to get locked up in a place like this?

382

They say I chopped up my family.

383

No, I'm not crazy.

388
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:39,144
That's unfortunate.

way worse than this.

394
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:51,390
I'll try to come back later.

Hey!

00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:55,361
What's your name?

397
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,329
Grace.

398

(church bell tolling)

399
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:04,336
(sobbing)

400
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:05,771
He's gone. Willie's gone.

401
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,541
There was a medical
emergency last night.

402
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,576
I didn't even know he was sick.

403
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:12,345
Why wasn't I informed?

404
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:13,579
(sobs)

405
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:15,515
Dr. Arden asked

406
00:22:15,582 --> 00:22:18,017
to have him taken
directly t-to his wing.

407
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,835
I demand you give me access
to your laboratory.

408
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:24,991
When the monsignor
brought me out of retirement

409
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:27,547
to run Briarcliff's medical unit,

410
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,189
we made a gentlemen's agreement.

411
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,839
Curious, since only one
of you is a gentleman.

412
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,569
Please look at me when I speak to you.

413
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,736
I'm not one of your charges, Sister,

414
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:38,828
quaking in my boots.

415
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:41,546
Do you have any idea what this is?

416
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,043
It's a plant.

417
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,011
A little Elena.

418
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,214
This particular strain of <i>Alstroemeria</i>

419
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,083
has never existed before.

420
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:52,553
It was created by bombarding
the plant with gamma rays.

421
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:56,258
It is an affirmation of the
power of science over nature.

422
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,861
Your little mutation
doesn't change the fact

423
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,731
that in order for this
institution to thrive,

424
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,833
I need to manage your operation.

425
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,184
Sister...

426
00:23:05,304 --> 00:23:07,312
if you could manage
to stay out of my business,

427
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:09,233
I'll try and stay out of yours.

428
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,736
Let's discuss another matter:

429
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:13,748
The patients, four of them,

430
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,640
including Willie last night,

431
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,876
have disappeared
under your supervision.

432
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,177
They died.

433
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,579
That's it? Period?
No explanation.

434
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:24,822
Patients committed here
suffer not only

435
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:27,651
diseases of the mind,
but also of the body.

436
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:30,521
Where are the bodies?

437
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:31,868
Cremated.

438
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,858
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

439
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:37,370
Cause of death documented
in their death certificates.

440
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,971
I find it interesting

441
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,007
that of all the patients that died

442
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:42,341
since you've been here,

443
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,142
none have family.

444
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,855
No one to grieve

445
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,213
or to ask questions.

446
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,948
I think you're lying.

447
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:51,483
And in time, whatever
it is you're hiding

448
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,285
will come to see the light of day.

449
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:56,849
I've dealt with bigger monsters
than you, Doctor.

450
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,994
Let me give you fair warning:

451
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,529
I'll always win

452
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:06,499
against the patriarchal male.

453
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:08,734
Bully for you.

454
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,145
LANA: I am telling you, Wendy,
that battle-axe has secrets.

455
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:23,548
Under all that piousness
and fidelity...

456
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,884
there's a real darkness.

457
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,720
Getting high before dinner?

458
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:32,489
Makes your food taste better.

459
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:35,459
If your gut says there's
a story, then there is.

460
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:38,395
Blow the lid off the place like
Maisel did with "Bedlam 1946."

461
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:39,863
Get yourself a Pulitzer.

462
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,131
Problem is...

463
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:42,499
your editor won't let you do it.

464
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,866
Emmerman's an asshole.

465
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:44,901
He thinks that Canada geese

466
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,536
leaving Chicopee a month early

467
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:48,304
is a Column "A" story,

468
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:49,706
and he wants me to write
the cooking column.

469
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,074
Your cooking is horrible.

470
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:52,809
Why do you think I never eat it?

471
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,982
I'm not doing this for Emmerman.

472
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,718
I write it on my own,

473
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:03,354
and I get it out to <i>Life</i> or <i>Look.</i>

474
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:04,622
This is my shot.

475
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,592
I know, baby,
and I am behind you 100%.

476
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,695
If you need to take some time
off to get this story done,

477
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:13,165
I want you to do it.

478
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:18,537
The blinds are open.

479
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:21,340
No one can see.

480
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:24,444
The pot's making you paranoid.

481
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:26,713
You think the PTA is going to be cool

482
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,848
if they find out a dyke is teaching

483
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,684
little Bobby and Suzie science?

484
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:33,253
I mean, I have to fight to get
evolution on the curriculum.

485
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:34,621
You're right.

486
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:35,822
I'm sorry.

487
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,628
(giggles)

488
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,498
Anything I do in my life,

489
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,567
I can do because you love me.

490
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,135
I know, baby.

491
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:55,375
So how are you gonna get in?

492
00:25:58,513 --> 00:25:59,913
SISTER JUDE:
Hail, Mary, full of grace,

493
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:01,181

<i>Blessed art thou among women,</i>

495
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:05,853
<i>and blessed is the fruit</i>
<i>of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

496
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,821
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

497
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:09,757
pray for us sinners,

498
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:11,926
now and at the hour of our death.

499
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:13,060
Amen.

500
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,398
(solemn choral music plays)

501
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:27,208
(singing in Latin)

502
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:49,462
You are a <i>rara avis,</i> Sister Jude.

503
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,498
What does that mean?

504
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:53,133
It means "rare bird."

505
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,135
In Latin.

506
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:58,204
And it's a compliment or a criticism?

507
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:00,406
It's a compliment.

508
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,008
Most women of the cloth
feel they have to deny

509
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,777
all sensory life when
they take their vows.

510
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,714
No.

511
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:11,583
I've renounced spirits.

512
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:13,986
Are you sure?
Your cooking reveals

513
00:27:14,054 --> 00:27:15,721
an almost decadent palate.

514
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:17,256
"Decadent."

515
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:18,424
Is that a subtle reprimand, Father?

516
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:20,026
Oh, you know me better than that.

517
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:21,961
I always say what I mean.

518
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:23,296
I'd appreciate the same from you.

519
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:28,535
As usual, you've seen
right through me, Father.

520
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,905
When you put me in charge here,

521
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:32,440
I thought your faith in me

522
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:36,110
was based on our
mutually shared vision

523
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:38,112
of madness as a spiritual crisis,

524
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:40,180
an absence of God.

525
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:41,648
That remains true.

526
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:45,687
I want to know where
you found... Dr. Arden.

527
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:48,289
He is not a man of God.

528
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:49,557
The Church approved him.

529
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,292
He was sent here by people

530
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,528
better equipped to judge
his godliness than you.

531
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:59,100
Say what you will,

532
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:02,003
your rare bird has a nose for rodents.

533
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,273
You mustn't be so fearful.

534
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,742
It was God, after all,

535
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,078
who created both science and Heaven.

536
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,181
God put the idea in a doctor's head

537
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:14,750
to create the antibiotic
that cured tuberculosis.

538
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,486
These are amazing times, if you
just look at it in another light.

539
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:18,854
There is no other light.

540
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:21,090
We're literally almost on the moon.

541
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,793
Our dear departed
John F. Kennedy, a Catholic,

542
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,661
was elected President.

543
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,029
This is a time
when anything can happen,

544

if someone wants it enough.

545
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:32,001
But what on earth do we want,
if not to save souls?

546
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:38,508
Here's... what I want.

547
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:43,712
I want this institution
to become a place

548
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,315
of such promise and renown
that we are asked

549
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:49,652
to be Cardinal of New York.

550
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,786
"We?"

551
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,621
Wherever I go, you go.

552
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,022
You're my right hand.

553
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,659
You'll become Mother Superior,

554
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,294
overseeing thousands of nuns

555
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,496
who will address you
as "Reverend Mother."

556
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:03,665
And then, with God
and you on my side...

00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,054
He'll have to play
with himself for a while.

664
00:35:12,122 --> 00:35:13,222
Solitary? Where's that?

665
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:22,163
(footsteps, door slams)

666
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,935
Alfred, get your hands
out of your pants.

667
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:50,391
(door slams)

668
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,561
Why are you doing this to me? The devil
doesn't reside in hell, Mr. Walker.

669
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:55,463
He lives right here

670
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,097
in the frontal gyrus.

671
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,966
The occipital lobes.

672
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,934
Inside those beautiful brains

673
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:03,403
lies the secret

674
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:06,540
to understanding the darkness
of the human psyche.

675
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:07,874
And ten of them

676
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:09,576
put together

677
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:11,245
are not as dark as what resides

678
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:12,313
right here,

679
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,614
in this cute,

680
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,182
blonde melon.

681
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:24,892
(muffled talking)

682
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,160
(buzzing, electrical humming)

683
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:28,909
"Victim was found naked."

684
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:30,597
"Preliminary findings indicate"

685
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:32,166
"that the skinning occurred"

686
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,234
"while the victim
was still breathing."

687
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:37,338
Kit!

688
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,474
Alma!

689
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,476
Help me!

690
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:42,877
Alma!

691
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:47,581
You sliced her from the feet up.

692
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:49,650
(screaming)

693
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,352
What did you do with the skin?

694
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,156
(screaming)

695
00:36:56,224 --> 00:36:58,025
I'm not here to pass judgment,
Mr. Walker.

696
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:00,761
I'm merely interested in methodology.

697
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:02,830
Hello. What's this?

698
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:04,665
Way too hard to be a tumor.

699
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:15,677
(screams)

700
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:33,295
(screaming)

701
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:48,409
Mr. Walker?

702
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,310
Mr. Walker?

703
00:37:49,378 --> 00:37:51,379
(screams)

704
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:54,082
(church bell tolling)

705
00:37:57,353 --> 00:37:59,320
You've put everything at risk.

706
00:37:59,388 --> 00:38:00,688
Everything.

707
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:01,890
Our reputation,

708
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:02,957
the life's work

709
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,459
of our great monsignor,

710
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:06,294
all his future dreams.

711
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:08,663
(sobbing)
I used bad judgment, Sister.

712
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,097
Bad judgment?

713
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,398
Like eating too much cake?

714
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:12,800
Is that what you mean, Sister?

715
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:16,737
Miss Winters got me very confused.

716
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,440
Maybe the sin is mine;
Maybe my faith in you

717
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:20,875
was nothing but the sin of pride.

718
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:22,343
No, you're not a sinner, Sister.

719
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:24,878
I favored you. I coddled you.

720
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:27,381
I refused to see what others saw.

721
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,549
When they said

722
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,384
you were <i>stupid,</i>

723
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:32,186
I said no, simply,

724
00:38:32,254 --> 00:38:34,022
you were more pure than the others.

725
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:36,524
It's not big enough, Sister.

726
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:52,004
Punish me, Sister, please.

727
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,707
I'm so weak and stupid, Sister.

728
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,242
Stupid dummy.

729
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,177
(cracks)

730
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,481
(smack) Stand up and get out.

731
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,716
I don't have time for this.

732
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,051
(sniffles)

733
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,319
Too good to me, Sister.

734
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:10,515
If I ever hear you

735
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:11,822
call yourself stupid again,

736
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,157
I'll cane you bloody.

737
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:42,806
You're awake.

738
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:44,099
I'm so relieved.

739
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:45,983
What's going on?

740
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:47,811
You had an accident.

741
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,193
Something attacked me.

742
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:52,487
You writers,

743
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:55,094
with your very fertile imagination.

744
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:57,095
You took a tumble.

745
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:58,296
Get me out of this thing.

746
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:01,133
No, no. You mustn't move.

747
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,769
You've got a long recovery
ahead of you.

748
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:05,705
You can't keep me here. No?

749
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,974
There are people
who will come looking for me.

750
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,876
Do you think so?

751
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:10,977
You said she was hurt?

752
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:13,013
While trespassing.

753
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:17,585
You and Miss Winters have
a charming home here,

754
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:20,287
Miss Paisa, very cozy.

755
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:23,790
I need to see her.
But surely, you're not her family?

756
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,660
Lana's parents don't
speak to her anymore.

757
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:27,728
I-I'm practically family.

758
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:29,897
We're very close.

759
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,365
Are you now? Like sisters.

760
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:33,768
But point in fact, you're not sisters,

761
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:35,169
are you, Miss Paisa?

762
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:36,271
I mean,

763
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:37,739
you have no legal standing.

764
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:39,874
I have a moral standing.

765
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:42,410
Moral?
There's an interesting word.

766
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:49,684
You're a... spinster,

767
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:51,719
schoolteacher, I take it?
I teach the third grade.

768
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:53,421
Oh, I admire that.

769
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:56,191
The molding of young minds
is a sacred charge.

770
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:57,625
You would never

771
00:40:57,693 --> 00:40:59,194
intentionally do anything to put

772
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:00,562
these precious youngsters

773
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:01,863
at risk?

774
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:03,265
Of course not.

775
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:05,333
So when you agreed to room
with Miss Winters,

776
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:06,501
you couldn't possibly

777
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:09,003
have been aware of her...

778
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,337
inversion?

779
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:12,773
Inversion?
I mean, you would never

780
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:16,176
intentionally expose
these little angels

781
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:18,411
to a homosexual, would you?

782
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,980
We both know what

783
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:24,217
that so-called monster
in the closet really is,

784
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:26,386
don't we, Miss Winters?

785
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:28,188
That's why you've come.

786
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:30,190
Because something in you knew

787
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,025
that you needed help.

788
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,861
Are you threatening me, Sister?

789
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:37,097
It is I who have
been threatened, young woman.

790
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:39,300
Your friend gained access

791
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:42,670
to my facility under false pretenses.

792
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:43,771
She had no interest in our bakery.

793
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,407
She wanted an inside look

794
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:48,475
into a mental ward,

795
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:50,444
and I intend to see that she gets it.

796
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,446
You can't do this.
Oh, yes, I can.

797
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:54,281
I can do it either

798
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:56,017
by exposing the shenanigans

799
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:58,853
that took place in this love nest,

800
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:01,589
or I can do it discreetly.

801
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:02,724
She will, of course,

802
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,092
receive the finest

803
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,461
of care.

804
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:07,762
I have no legal standing.

805
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,597
You are a respected member

806
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:11,799
of this community, at least for now.

807
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:16,237
Your sworn statement along
with our professional diagnosis

808
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:18,572
is more than enough
for a friendly judge

809
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,908
to remand Miss Winters
into my custody.

810
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,582
It's a small town.

811
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,818
A scandal will work just as well.

812
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:36,554
You'll be ruined.

813
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,324
You'll never step
into a classroom again.

814
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,227
Wait! Wait!

815
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,707
(screaming in distance)

816
00:42:56,775 --> 00:43:00,544
We're gonna slay that monster
together... you and I.

817
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,080
Morning devotionals
are at 6:00 a.m. sharp.

818
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:04,114
No exceptions.

819
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:07,318
No! Let me out of here!

820
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:08,686
Come back here, you bitch!

821
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,054
Chin up.

822
00:43:10,122 --> 00:43:12,824
We're gonna get you cured.

823
00:43:12,892 --> 00:43:14,192
Help me!

824
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,827
Did you manage it?

825
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,763
Yes, Sister Jude.

826
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,765
Help me!
Though shalt not steal.

827
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,900
Well, hopefully, that's
the only commandment

828
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,803
you had to break
in order to get these.

829
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:27,872
LANA: Come back here!

830
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,381
(creaking)

831
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,134
Ah,

832
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:55,402
Sister Jude.

833
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:56,838
Come to lend a hand?

834
00:43:56,905 --> 00:43:58,206
What's going on in here?

835
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:01,476
Just a little spring cleaning.

836
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:03,778
That odor... what is it?

837
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:05,280
Disinfectant.

838
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:06,881
Standard sanitary procedure.

839
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,683
Cleanliness is, after all,

840
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:09,784
next to godliness.

841
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:13,655
Something's been living in here.

842
00:44:13,723 --> 00:44:15,991
That's absurd.

843
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:18,326
This room has been
closed up for years.

844
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,062
I'm in need
of some extra storage space.

845
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:22,631
I think this will do quite nicely.

846
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:24,600
Don't think you can pull one
over on me, Doctor.

847
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:26,802
I'll ferret it out.

848
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,238
Whatever it is you're up to.

849
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:31,240
A ferret.

850
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:33,476
Delightful creature.

851
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:35,578
I used to keep one as a pet.

852
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:37,647
Until it bit me,

853
00:44:37,714 --> 00:44:39,215
and I broke its neck.

854
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:42,952
You brought me my keys?

855
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,887
Thank you.

856
00:44:46,323 --> 00:44:49,793
You may think my mind
is closed, Doctor,

857
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,663
but my eyes are wide open,
I promise you.

858
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,998
You hear me?

859
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,355
(screaming)
