1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,149
Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.

2
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:20,349
Elena, you gotta talk to me.

3
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:23,048
Last call.

4
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,649
Why is she such a pain in the ass?

5
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,848
-Excuse me.
-Hey, pal.

6
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,948
It's all right. One more, please.

7
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:43,348
-Save some for the other customers, okay?
-Pour it!

8
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:50,748
-You ain't getting behind the wheel, right?
-There's a cab picking me up.

9
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:58,747
I'm looking you in the eye, Gus.
I'm telling you, I'm not driving a car tonight.

10
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:39,746
Bite me.

11
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:02,744
Yeah, coffee.

12
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:07,044
-What's with the hand?
-Just a scratch.

13
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:19,243
Get me some eggs, will you?

14
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:23,743
-Can I get a scrapple with that?
-You can get anything you want.

15
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:27,843
Oh, God!

16
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,239
Look at him, all high and mighty.

17
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,739
You ain't gonna let that shit ride, are you?
After what he did?

18
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,139
I'd truck his ass, if it was me.

19
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,239
He's built kind of solid, though.

20
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,538
Maui ain't all that.
It's the clothes that give him size, Zig.

21
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,038
-You think?
-His ass is candy, Zig.

22
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,838
You, you're the legend of the docks.

23
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:19,238
Truck him with your best punch
and then just walk the fuck away.

24
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,638
Officially, I've put us on the hook
for 14 open homicides.

25
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,938
So either we bring in a hell of a case...

26
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,538
or I'm as big a fool
as Col. Rawls thinks I am.

27
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,938
That sounded a little desperate.

28
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:34,137
Not entirely.

29
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,737
Lester, enlighten Miss Pearlman
as to the status of our investigation.

30
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:43,637
You said this case needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?

31
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,937
Come take a look at this.

32
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:53,837
That's the DNR log
on the phone listed to the warehouse...

33
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:56,037
where we tracked the suspect container.

34
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,637
It shows outgoing calls to numbers
that connect to Petey Dixon...

35
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:02,137
Proposition Joe Stewart,
and "White Mike" McArdle...

36
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,037
among other traffickers on the East Side.

37
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:08,336
Which supports surveillance of known
dealers coming and leaving the warehouse.

38
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:11,137
Also, some surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos...

39
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:15,237
from Southeast DEU,
which tie White Mike to street dealers...

40
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:17,437
that we've already
made controlled buys from.

41
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,537
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on the warehouse phone.

42
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:23,437
-What's your PC on the truck driver?
-Sergei Malatov:

43
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:27,636
resident alien, Ukrainian origin.
No criminal history here.

44
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,836
We ID'd him from the contract
on the DAC truck rental.

45
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:34,036
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people his cell number.

46
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,836
And phone records show
a call placed to the warehouse...

47
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:40,336
at the time Kima observed him on the docks
using the cell phone.

48
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,136
Checking the DNR log's history...

49
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:44,636
we matched seven other calls
from that cell phone...

50
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:47,936
to dates and times when
a container disappeared from a Talco ship.

51
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:51,035
Anything else? Tap 2 feels a bit thin.

52
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,836
How about Nicholas Sobotka
of the 1400th block on Reynolds Street?

53
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,735
On a Cl's information,
Herc and Carver followed him...

54
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,035
from a drug meet
along the Fayette Street strip...

55
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,335
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.

56
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,735
When we ran that phone number
from that address...

57
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:11,535
through the DNR at our warehouse,
we got nothing.

58
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:15,835
But when we checked it against
the cell phone of our friend, Sergei...

59
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:19,535
-we got a couple of hits.
-Sobotka's your stated target, right?

60
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,934
This is a nephew, and from the look of it...

61
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,034
he's involved in street dealing
as much as smuggling.

62
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:28,334
But right now, this case feels like
a lot more than Frank Sobotka.

63
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:31,234
-No offense to Stan Valchek.
-Okay.

64
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,834
I admit, you've got PC.

65
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:38,634
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's cell phone, too.

66
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,934
Now what have you got for exhaustion?

67
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,334
Any possible informants?

68
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,234
-Nothing on the docks.
-No one we can buy weight with.

69
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:48,133
-Surveillance?
-That got us to the front door...

70
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:51,333
but it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.

71
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,833
Start typing. I'll call the judge.

72
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,434
Ham and cheese sandwich,
and one of them Frappuccino drinks.

73
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,433
-I hear Charles lost his leg.
-What?

74
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,633
Frappuccino? What the fuck is that?

75
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,633
He's all pussy, Zig. Cold cock him.

76
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:24,132
Take him, Zig. Now's the time.

77
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,832
What do you know?
The pissant's got some grapes on him.

78
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,332
Banana, too.

79
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:54,332
Fucking shit!

80
00:09:57,132 --> 00:10:00,632
-Take us up.
-Son of a bitch! God damn it!

81
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,231
Fuck you!

82
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:07,232
You big, stupid, fucking oaf!
Fuck you, Maui.

83
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:10,232
You're the fucking wimp.

84
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:12,331
No, fuck you, Maui!

85
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,731
-Stay there.
-Fuck you!

86
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,531
God damn it!

87
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:31,330
Any of you fucks try to help him down,
you'll be up there with him.

88
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:36,130
Bad advice!
You motherfuckers gave me bad advice!

89
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,630
Shit.

90
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,730
-What the hell are you wearing?
-No one mentioned all the perks.

91
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,130
Lacrosse?

92
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,930
What, a brother can't run with a stick?

93
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,429
Jim Brown was an all-American midfielder
at Syracuse.

94
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,830
You putting yourself beside Jim Brown?

95
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,529
Lester, I'm just saying....

96
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,529
I thought you were born in pinstripes.

97
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,230
Lieutenant, I was under the impression
that when detailed against his will...

98
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,229
to some backwards-ass,
no-count, out-in-the-districts...

99
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,329
Iost-ball-in-tall-grass drug investigation...

100
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,129
a veteran police of means and talent...

101
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,229
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.

102
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,829
Up to a point.

103
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:26,629
-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

104
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:31,129
It's a hell of a thing to take a downtown
police and lose him in a cross-town world.

105
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,228
Take that one over there.

106
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,129
I'm homesick already.

107
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:40,029
I don't know what you're laughing at.
You can kiss my ass.

108
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:50,428
You should see
what your boy tried to pull today.

109
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:51,928
Fucking Ziggy.

110
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:57,228
-What are you looking for?
-Can't find the fucking bills.

111
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,728
-End of the month, everything's hanging.
-We got anything for the Greeks?

112
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:04,327
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

113
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,328
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

114
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:09,628
No wonder I couldn't find them.
You use them as bookmarks.

115
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:17,828
Let me ask you something important.

116
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,727
You like fake tits? I can't decide.

117
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,027
Thus far, I'm undecided on fake tits.

118
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,127
I thought I knew what paperwork was.

119
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:38,527
But what you all go through,
to listen to someone else's phone calls....

120
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,926
You all cannot spell for shit.

121
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,626
Would we be police if we could?

122
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:05,426
-Who's the duty judge this week?
-Vanderwal.

123
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,526
You think he'll sign?

124
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:10,826
No problem, if you clean his garage first.
Or wash his windows, maybe.

125
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,826
Fucking Vanderwal.

126
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,926
Wash windows?

127
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:30,125
-Are these the affiants, Miss Pearlman?
-Yes, Your Honor.

128
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:34,526
Are you willing to affirm that
the information offered in this affidavit...

129
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,625
is entirely true
to the best of your knowledge?

130
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:38,325
Yes, Your Honor.

131
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,725
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Absolutely.

132
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:45,025
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.

133
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,324
Sash installation.

134
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:51,125
And then if you can give
the windows a wash.... Thank you.

135
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,024
It's a good thing I took the Sergeant's test.

136
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,425
-Fuck, my knee.
-Sorry.

137
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:01,924
-First name?
-First name: Francis.

138
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,824
Spell the last name on the account.

139
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:06,824
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.

140
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:10,924
Yeah, that's it. It's a business address.

141
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,224
-You've been flagged.
-Flagged?

142
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:15,024
It says right here on the computer.

143
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:16,923
Yeah? You're kidding me.

144
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,124
I don't have any more information
on that now.

145
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,924
Whatever, okay.

146
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:26,323
The check's on its way tomorrow.
Cross my heart.

147
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:37,823
Horse, if you don't pay your phone bill
for three months, what happens?

148
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:39,223
No phone.

149
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:44,123
Okay, so I'm 90 days late on my cell phone,
but they let me go...

150
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,223
even before I mail the check in.

151
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:50,423
I ask the nice lady in the billing department
why that is. You know what she says?

152
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,622
-I've been flagged.
-Flagged?

153
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:55,423
She says it's on the computer
when my account comes on:

154
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,023
"Do not disconnect for non-payment."

155
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:02,522
"Flagged," what the fuck is that?
What am l, special?

156
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:05,822
Maybe you been touched by an angel.

157
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,422
Told you, B.

158
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:15,322
Tumbleweeds be blowing
through this motherfucker.

159
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:19,522
-Like the fiends all cleaned themselves up.
-No, that ain't it, man.

160
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:23,921
Word is out,
we just selling dog shit up in here, man.

161
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:27,121
Damn.

162
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:38,922
-Pud, how we doing?
-Slow as a white man in slippers.

163
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,921
All right, later.

164
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:47,621
We dying 'cause these dusty-ass fiends
done found the real someplace else.

165
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,621
It's that bullshit, man.

166
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,221
You two got a reason to be here?

167
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,520
-We're just going about our business.
-Keep moving.

168
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:02,521
Fake-ass police.
Where he get that uniform at? Kmart?

169
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:06,821
He wouldn't even be all chest-out
if we had some people up in this bitch.

170
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,320
Shit is fucked up, man.

171
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,921
Damn, junior, you had a night.

172
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,121
Even for a legendary motherfucker
like yourself--

173
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:19,420
Drop it.

174
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,720
What is wrong with you, man?

175
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,720
'Cause Elena didn't open up the door
for your ass...

176
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,520
you just gonna let all this shit fly out?

177
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,920
Come on, Jimmy. Lighten up.

178
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,619
Come and get me.

179
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,320
So, you guys going for a wiretap
on that port case?

180
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,419
They got every swinging dick with a shield
on that detail but me.

181
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,919
You jealous, bitch?

182
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,819
I'd rather be back in Homicide.

183
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:06,119
I'd take your place in a heartbeat.

184
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,019
Why?

185
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:18,919
-That floater showing up in your dreams?
-No, it's not just her.

186
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:25,718
I mean, who am l, Captain Chesapeake?
I need to get off that boat, Bunk.

187
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:27,518
I need to do a case.

188
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,518
I mean, if I'm not gonna....

189
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,518
If I'm no good for....

190
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,818
If that's all you want, just go and ask Rawls.

191
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:56,018
-He'll put you on this straightaway.
-Yeah, why wouldn't he?

192
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:10,817
...after which I tell Horse
to go down the southeast lot...

193
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:14,617
and steal the most expensive thing
he can drive, which he does.

194
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:18,017
And we box it up
and ship it to every port you can name.

195
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,517
Where is it now?

196
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:22,417
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.

197
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,616
How's that for your kid brother?

198
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,617
You said you were gonna
bring something over?

199
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:30,016
Just this.

200
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:34,016
Read it.

201
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,216
-What is it?
-A confirmation letter, like.

202
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:42,016
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board I told you about?

203
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:44,416
I put you up for it. You're on.

204
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:45,916
I'm on?

205
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:50,416
I ain't been union since they closed
the dry dock. How come I'm on?

206
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:54,016
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.

207
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,015
You mean, you greased it.

208
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:01,315
The chairman,
he thought you'd be right for it, is all.

209
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,916
There's a stipend comes with it.
$200 a month, Lou.

210
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,015
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

211
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,015
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

212
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,015
I'm not up to go to no meetings or anything.

213
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:16,315
Christ, Lou,
you don't gotta go to all the meetings.

214
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:20,015
Just show up once in a while,
let them know you're alive.

215
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:23,315
That's not for me.

216
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,515
What's for you?

217
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:30,214
That shitwagon parked out front
needs a battery.

218
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:34,115
Or this kitchen here
has been rigged the same way for 25 years.

219
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,414
Whatever I got comes straight.

220
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,315
That's real noble, big brother.

221
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,014
Not noble. Right.

222
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:52,114
The shipbuilders' local goes belly-up,
and that makes you some kind of martyr?

223
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:54,114
The only difference between me and you...

224
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:57,314
-is you picked the wrong union.
-That ain't the only difference.

225
00:19:57,414 --> 00:20:00,013
-If you were in my position--
-I'm not.

226
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:08,113
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
I don't have to make those kind of choices.

227
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:13,314
Come on, kid.

228
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,013
Sit down.

229
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,213
You really used to race pigeons
with my PePop?

230
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,113
We all did back then.

231
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:42,412
I gave one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time.

232
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,912
He set her loose in the middle of the ocean.

233
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:48,012
Damned if she didn't find her way
back to Hull Street.

234
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:51,212
Which, by the way, is more than I can say
about your grandfather...

235
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:53,212
when he was in the bag.

236
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,712
How come they don't fly away?

237
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:01,412
His wings are clipped.

238
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:11,212
How much for this one, Mr. Diz?

239
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,511
Why don't you start out with pigeons, Zig?
You can train pigeons.

240
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:16,411
Them things got lice.

241
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:19,511
They bring the plague, for Christ's sake.

242
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:28,711
Thanks, Mr. Diz.

243
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:34,011
I tried. Rawls hates his guts.

244
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:38,411
-With reasons.
-But the thing of it is, Jimmy's dying inside.

245
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,711
He's a train wreck
unless he catches a real case.

246
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,811
-But good police.
-Always.

247
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,110
The thing of it is, Lieutenant...

248
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,911
Jimmy McNulty, when he ain't policing...

249
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,811
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken, self-destructive fuck-up.

250
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,110
And when he is policing...

251
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,611
he's pretty much the same motherfucker.

252
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,310
But on a good case,
he's running in front of the pack.

253
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,810
That's as close as the man comes
to being right.

254
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,110
Go back to Rawls.

255
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,309
So I get paid?

256
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,509
Yeah, you get paid, but you don't get paid.
We get paid.

257
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:23,209
Why don't they give you the money
and leave me out of it?

258
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,309
'Cause we need someone to be
Confidential lnformant Number 238...

259
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,509
registered with the department.
We get you registered, we get paid.

260
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:34,509
-So you're gonna send my picture--
-And your social security number.

261
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,509
And they give me money which you keep,
and I don't get nothing.

262
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:40,609
Cuz, did you do anything
to deserve the money?

263
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,309
Did you?

264
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:45,008
Yeah, we cracked a fucking case wide open.

265
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:47,209
We brought back
very significant information...

266
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,509
about a major drug trafficker.
That's what we did.

267
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:54,908
But that's your fucking job, right?
You get paid a salary for that.

268
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,109
Bernard, you're upsetting my partner, man.
What are you doing?

269
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:02,208
10%.

270
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:05,608
10% goes to me and I don't tell.

271
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,808
You don't tell
because your ma and my ma are sisters.

272
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:12,208
-That's why you don't tell.
-We're not even gonna use your real name.

273
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,707
You'll be registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.

274
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:18,908
10%.

275
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:25,807
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.

276
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,207
It's payday, Zig. Once again.

277
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,307
All that?

278
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:42,107
We're rolling out there.
I can't hand this shit off fast enough.

279
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:44,907
Nice sled you got.

280
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,707
Zero percent interest. Money's cheap.

281
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:51,207
"Money's cheap"?
What the fuck does that mean?

282
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:54,007
It means I got a good deal, you peckerhead.

283
00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:57,607
You should think of getting
some new wheels yourself.

284
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,507
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

285
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,807
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.

286
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,006
Worry about yourself.

287
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,507
I heard you took on Maui.

288
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:16,006
-Boy needed to get schooled.
-What are you, some kind of badass now?

289
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:23,405
-Yeah, it's me.
-Niko, things okay?

290
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:27,006
-Things are going great.
-Ifyou need more, talk to Sergei.

291
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:30,606
I gotta see you soon.
I'll call you back in a few, all right?

292
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:33,005
Is that the man?

293
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,305
-You don't have to concern yourself--
-I wanna meet him.

294
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:40,006
Let me handle the business.
I mean, you're getting paid, right?

295
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:43,505
Fuck you! I'll play the game for myself.

296
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:47,105
-Take the money, Zig.
-You don't think I can do it?

297
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:49,605
Pick up the fucking money, Ziggy.

298
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:52,405
-I don't want it. You pick it up.
-You.

299
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:55,505
Fuck you.

300
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,805
I was wondering about the La-Z-Boy chairs
I ordered. They come in yet?

301
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:11,604
-How many you ordered?
-That'd be three.

302
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,105
Your order's in.

303
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,804
-Yes?
-It's Nick.

304
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:19,304
How's it going?

305
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:22,704
I'm ready to talk about more, okay?
Youjust say where and when.

306
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:24,504
I'll call you back.

307
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:31,903
-Not as careful as Barksdale's people were.
-This ain't West Baltimore.

308
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:36,503
They are on their phones
because they don't expect us to be on them.

309
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:41,403
Let me shorten this conversation for you:
It's never gonna happen.

310
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:44,403
McNulty goes after it.
I could use someone like him.

311
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:48,403
And I could use three more inches of meat.
It ain't gonna happen.

312
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:56,203
You ever see how a dog gets
when he smells a bone buried in the yard?

313
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:59,503
Yeah, and I seen one
take a shit on my carpet, too.

314
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:04,502
And don't give me that he's-got-that-fire-
in-the-belly garbage, either.

315
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:04,903
The answer is no.

316
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,202
The answer is no.

317
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:09,703
What I need from you, I get.

318
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,902
-No bullshit, no arguments.
-What?

319
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:18,203
When I agreed to take these murders
for you, I made my terms clear, remember?

320
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:21,702
I need McNulty on this detail.

321
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:27,802
Jesus, Lieutenant. When I said "anything,"
I meant I'd let you have a kiss...

322
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:31,902
feel my tits or something, you know?
But not this.

323
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,701
You want me to clear those bodies?

324
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,401
See that you do.

325
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,201
Who they?

326
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:03,201
They might be some CBS boys
drifting from down south...

327
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:06,301
or might be some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.

328
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:07,801
This far over?

329
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,500
I know one thing, though.

330
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,101
-What?
-They're serving our customers.

331
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:22,201
-Marine unit, Diggins.
-I'm looking for McNulty.

332
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,100
McNulty, for you.

333
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
It's Daniels...

334
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,600
Get back to your office.

335
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,199
Thanks, Lieutenant.

336
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,000
This new generation with the names....

337
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,099
$150? Jesus.

338
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,899
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.

339
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,998
This is the other half of the case, right here.

340
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,599
Three apartments on the sixth floor,
all leased out to Pyramid, lnc...

341
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:27,998
the same people
who own the drug warehouse.

342
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:30,599
Is this where the girls are staying?
Or something more?

343
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:32,998
No, the building's too nice
for room and board.

344
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:35,299
A building this nice is for the johns.

345
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,499
-Makes them feel safer.
-How do they bring them in? The lobby?

346
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,898
-Garage, probably.
-Either they have a garage card...

347
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:44,198
or they're being shuttled in
by someone who does.

348
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:47,498
You get that piece and you're in.
If the people running the girls...

349
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:49,598
are connected
to the ones running the drugs...

350
00:28:49,697 --> 00:28:53,698
you can knock off the brothel
and then listen in on your wiretaps.

351
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,297
Tickle the wire like that.

352
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:58,498
Exactly.

353
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,797
Pleasure boats, topless women.

354
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,797
I'm telling you, now the weather's turned,
I gotta roll, Diggsy.

355
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:10,897
Thanks.

356
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:24,697
-We ain't be been paid since yesterday.
-And the day before that.

357
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,597
What the fuck?
Come on, dawg, are we back up or what?

358
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:29,797
We up, but we ain't in it.

359
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:33,097
What we got can't stand up
to what they moving down the way, so....

360
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:36,197
Boy, we about to dry up and blow away,
and shit.

361
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:38,596
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing for you.

362
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:40,496
How you gonna act like that?

363
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:43,897
Look, I feel you,
but I still gotta let you go so....

364
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:50,096
At least we get
some of that separation pay though, right?

365
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:54,196
Man, you better go on
before I lose my composure out this bitch.

366
00:29:58,295 --> 00:30:02,096
These motherfuckers. Separation pay.

367
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:04,895
Separate your ass.

368
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:10,096
Assumption number one
is the people running the girls...

369
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:12,895
and the people running the drugs
are the same crew.

370
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,795
Assumption number two
is that the apartments in that condo...

371
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:18,196
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.

372
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:22,095
Which means you have to get someone
in there undercover to make a case.

373
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:26,195
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.

374
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:29,795
I'd march into hell for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.

375
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,594
He doesn't look like he'd have to pay.

376
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:39,394
-Sorry, no. Domestic issues at home.
-Same for me.

377
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:42,494
Nadine would have them in a jar
by the side of the bed...

378
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:44,795
if she even heard tell of it.

379
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:54,594
What?

380
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,194
Takes a whore to catch a whore.

381
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:01,194
What the fuck did I do?

382
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:04,494
Give me a couple beers, Dolores.
Look at this.

383
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,294
I say, look at this.

384
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,194
Dolores, is that you?

385
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:18,493
Dolores, I'd like you to meet my attorney.
This is Steven L. Miles.

386
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,493
I may not be able to see through
all the bullshit in here...

387
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,493
but he can. So, if you will...

388
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,193
I'd like a stiff one for myself
and one for my counselor.

389
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:33,193
-Tell me he's a fake.
-That'd be lying, hon.

390
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,193
Is they real diamonds around its neck?

391
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,593
You sick, boy. You just sick.

392
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:39,993
Like I'm the only guy in South Baltimore...

393
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:43,493
that ever tried to win the affections
of a farm animal?

394
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:48,393
Enough talk. Now chop-chop.

395
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:54,292
I'd like one for the house and don't forget
to water my fine, feathered friend here.

396
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:58,692
If it's for the duck, the next round is on me.

397
00:31:58,992 --> 00:31:59,992
Easy, there.

398
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:02,692
We're gonna need a saucer, hon.
Put some beer in it.

399
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:04,292
He needs a chaser.

400
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:06,392
Put it on my tab, Dolores.

401
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,992
Pace yourself. You're drinking
with the longshoremen tonight.

402
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:23,891
That look right to you?

403
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:27,191
Same truck as carried the girls,
same mope driving.

404
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,491
What about the passenger?

405
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:31,591
Looks the part to me.

406
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:42,491
Container ship on the Talco line,
name of Caspia, docks tomorrow a.m.

407
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,491
Our man Horseface on it?

408
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:49,990
I better call the Lieutenant,
let him know we gotta set up on this.

409
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,591
This time, though, we got the wire up.
Eyes and ears both.

410
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,190
There goes the shuttle.

411
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:33,589
What's he waiting on?

412
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:36,889
Getting himself all steeled up
to tell some tales.

413
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:39,689
Lying to the wife's easy.

414
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,189
It's looking your kid in the eye
that's the hard part.

415
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,388
Police!

416
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,689
Let's see your license.

417
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,988
"Robert Johnson." You believe that?

418
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:23,888
Bob, I'm very disappointed in you.
Wanna go home, Bob?

419
00:34:25,388 --> 00:34:29,088
Okay, suppose a lonely fellow wants to meet
a nice young lady in this town.

420
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:31,087
How does he go about it?

421
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:36,387
He'd dial that phone number.

422
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:42,187
Dial the number. What else?

423
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:44,587
Punch in those four numbers there.

424
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,087
-And?
-Ask for Eve.

425
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,087
-What?
-Ask for Eve.

426
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:02,687
Go on, go home.

427
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,287
Godspeed, Bob.

428
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:11,487
-Johnson.
-My ticket to the dance.

429
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:25,786
Here we go. We got one.

430
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,086
1 2-14, Kima.

431
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:31,686
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

432
00:35:31,785 --> 00:35:33,886
Affirmative. I'll eyeball it to the gate.

433
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,686
-Raise our boys.
-Right.

434
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:38,485
-What's Kima rolling as?
-Gas and electric.

435
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:01,785
-Yes?
-Everything's good.

436
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,285
-You coming in now?
-Yes.

437
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:57,683
White DAC truck coming at you
pulling a red can.

438
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:00,683
Serial Number: X-W-B, as in "boy"...

439
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,983
C-1-5-7-7-2-6-8.

440
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:08,083
-Driver: white male with brown hair. Copy?
-Copy.

441
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,983
I'm out of this as soon as he clears the gate.

442
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,683
The van has too much profile on it
right now.

443
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,783
Copy that, too. We're up.

444
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:24,382
-Broken seal?
-Hey, Frank.

445
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:26,883
What's missing?

446
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:29,682
Nothing so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.

447
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:31,882
-Diapers?
-Disposables, yeah.

448
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:36,383
I'm thinking not even your crew
would steal Pampers off the dock, right?

449
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:38,082
I'm not so sure.

450
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:41,482
Customs seal probably just broke
on the offload, is all.

451
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:51,082
When's Bea Russell coming back
from the Fairfield piers?

452
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,881
Who, Beadie? She's not down Fairfield.

453
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,682
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl will be back soon enough.

454
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:58,381
-Yeah?
-She's detailed.

455
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:00,882
Something to do with city police.

456
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:13,981
All right, we're up.

457
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,080
I'm out. You have the eyeball.

458
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,981
12-08, copy that.

459
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,281
First I got this thing on my phone bill.

460
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:30,381
Now I hear Bea Russell's doing some shit
with real police.

461
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:31,881
You're paranoid, Frank.

462
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,380
-Why would she lie?
-Shit if I know.

463
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,480
-The Greek has two today, right?
-Boris comes back in an hour.

464
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,480
The second can's in a lower bay
ready to offload when I get to it.

465
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:47,980
Check that can through straight up.
You got it?

466
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,980
Enter it on the computer, like any other.

467
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,680
The next can after it,
make that one disappear.

468
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,080
You want me to lose a clean can?

469
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,679
-And give it to the Russian, yeah.
-You gonna tell them?

470
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:01,780
If I'm going nuts, I'll calm down tomorrow.
We'll slip the hot can off the pier.

471
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,680
If I'm right about this, they'll thank me.

472
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:09,179
And, Horse, make sure nobody's living
in that can when you stack it.

473
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:10,679
I know.

474
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,679
We got something here.

475
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,078
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

476
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,479
They're running them out in tandem.

477
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:29,579
-That means "one after the other," Jimmy.
-I know what it means.

478
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,879
1 2-08.

479
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:32,879
Carver, what's the status of your truck?

480
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,478
Left the can at the warehouse
and rolled out.

481
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:38,879
-You want us on the truck or the can?
-The can.

482
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,178
Copy.

483
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,678
-I got no eyes at the port.
-Kima?

484
00:39:44,778 --> 00:39:46,778
-She pulled up.
-I got it.

485
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:50,678
But the truck already left. You won't make it.

486
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:53,278
I'll call the MPA, delay the truck.

487
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:56,478
Do it. You're still here?

488
00:39:58,778 --> 00:40:00,077
Good call.

489
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:31,677
License and registration, please.
You were doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone.

490
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,577
-You stop for 24 mph?
-License and registration.

491
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:56,174
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.

492
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:03,274
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

493
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:06,075
That last little item we sent out, it's wrong.

494
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:08,274
I knew it was wrong when I let it go.

495
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:10,774
Not on the phone, Frank.

496
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:15,773
Okay, but this time he needs to be there.

497
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:19,774
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.

498
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:55,773
Go ahead, open it.

499
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,071
Bobbie Dolls.

500
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,071
What the fuck is this bullshit?

501
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:51,071
I am waiting for Russian vodka
and you bring me trash from Taiwan.

502
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,870
Give me your phone. Fucking Polacks.

503
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:56,870
Are they thieves or are they stupid?

504
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:04,271
He's dialing the same number.

505
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,370
It came, but it's nothing.

506
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:10,471
It's bullshit.

507
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,871
I was expecting this. Just get rid of it.

508
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,970
Get rid of it where?

509
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,770
Drop it in the fucking street.

510
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,270
-This is sweet.
-The boss man.

511
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,070
And we're on him.

512
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:35,070
-7 a.m.?
-Man, what the fuck do you think?

513
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,669
We gotta be there, in place,
when they come on.

514
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:39,069
Shit is early.

515
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:41,069
Y'all down for this?

516
00:44:41,169 --> 00:44:44,770
'Cause I can find me some motherfuckers
to swing bats for me if I have to.

517
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,369
You didn't say nothing about no bats.
All right.

518
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:50,969
That's the fuck I'm talking about.
Bring your boys, too. 7:00.

519
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:52,870
-Hey, Poot.
-Yo, Poot.

520
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:56,469
Come on, man.

521
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:01,469
God damn,
you're a pussy-crazed motherfucker.

522
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:03,868
A nigger can't look at a female?

523
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,569
Yeah, but you be getting dizzy
behind that shit.

524
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,569
-At least I be getting some.
-Well, I be getting some, too.

525
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:12,068
But I don't make it my everything.

526
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:17,168
Lieutenant, you still up?

527
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:19,369
I'm here.

528
00:45:19,668 --> 00:45:22,369
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.

529
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,768
He went to ground
at an appliance store off Eastern.

530
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:27,768
Now he's dumping it.

531
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:30,668
10-4. Come home.

532
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:36,268
-You don't wanna sit on the can?
-Negative. The can is clean.

533
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:57,167
I don't know, Uncle Frank.

534
00:45:57,267 --> 00:46:00,167
Putting two and two together,
and coming up with six, maybe.

535
00:46:00,267 --> 00:46:01,467
Maybe.

536
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,467
You called Spiros still, right?

537
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,767
Spiros will know what to do.

538
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:14,567
Come past early tomorrow.
I wanna get down the diner first thing.

539
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:15,966
All right.

540
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:22,967
I can't keep up with him.

541
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:24,866
What's with the duck?

542
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:27,567
Ziggy.

543
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,066
Is Daniels around?

544
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,866
-No.
-What's the deal with can number two?

545
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:42,666
No contraband.

546
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,865
Heard them complaining about it
on the wire. Somebody fucked up.

547
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:51,865
The fact is, they even called the boss man
about it.

548
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:58,565
That's a good day.
You guys going for a taste?

549
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:01,065
No, I'm gonna chase the paperwork.

550
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:06,365
I gotta spring the sitter.
But for a ride home, I'll go for a quick beer.

551
00:47:06,465 --> 00:47:09,965
-But more than one, I get sleepy.
-Yeah, me, too.

552
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:14,465
-What, you short a car?
-Need new brake pads.

553
00:47:28,864 --> 00:47:30,764
Two. Boys.

554
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,265
How about you?

555
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:35,664
Boy and a girl.

556
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,664
And your husband, he....

557
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:41,064
None of my business, I know,
but did he die or something?

558
00:47:41,165 --> 00:47:45,364
You mean 'cause no one would leave
a beauty like me unless he kicked?

559
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:47,164
I was just asking.

560
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,163
He left me.

561
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:51,264
Left us.

562
00:47:52,764 --> 00:47:54,564
Picked up, moved south.

563
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,563
Said it was either my job or him.

564
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:03,163
That I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.

565
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:06,863
Said that he didn't get married
in order to cook his own dinner.

566
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:09,663
Anyway, he's cooking his own dinner now.

567
00:48:14,463 --> 00:48:17,763
What about with you and your wife?
What happened?

568
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:21,862
She died.

569
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:30,463
-Not now, Gus. I'm good.
-Whatever you say, Jimmy.

570
00:48:33,262 --> 00:48:35,062
So, you about ready to go?

571
00:48:35,463 --> 00:48:38,363
-Sure.
-Be right back. I just gotta make a call.

572
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:02,962
Please enter your code now.

573
00:49:05,961 --> 00:49:09,361
-Hi, may I help you?
-Yeah, let me talk to Eve.

574
00:49:11,961 --> 00:49:14,562
-This is Eve.
-I'm looking to connect.

575
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:16,162
Would you like a date tonight?

576
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:19,761
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in a couple of nights.

577
00:49:20,161 --> 00:49:24,061
-Have you been entertained by us before?
-No, first time for me.

578
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,861
We can arrange whatever you like,
whenever you like.

579
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:29,461
What kind of a girl are you looking for?

580
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:33,061
We have a variety for you to choose from
when you arrive.

581
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,260
When are you thinking of coming?

582
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,359
Just give me a minute.

583
00:50:49,459 --> 00:50:52,559
Stop! Move away from the cookiejar.

584
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:35,757
Long day.

585
00:51:36,957 --> 00:51:38,757
Yeah, me, too.

586
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:54,156
Thanks for the beer.

587
00:51:55,057 --> 00:51:56,257
Goodbye.

588
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:16,656
Hey, y'all, they coming.

589
00:52:17,255 --> 00:52:19,956
What these motherfuckers think
they looking at?

590
00:52:20,856 --> 00:52:23,056
Nigger, you've lost
your motherfucking mind.

591
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:25,956
-You're standing on my real estate.
-Mine now.

592
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:30,756
-Took it while you was resting.
-Y'all too late.

593
00:52:35,055 --> 00:52:39,555
Look, I'm gonna let you walk off right now,
or we could do it the other way.

594
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:42,555
Who you got to do it the other way? Them?

595
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,555
-You gonna see me in your sleep.
-Yeah, I know.

596
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:57,455
That's right. Keep walking, bitch.

597
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:00,155
They gonna come back.

598
00:53:00,954 --> 00:53:04,354
Yeah. The way we just punked them,
they got to.

599
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:15,554
-Where is he?
-You can talk to me, Frank.

600
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:18,554
-This is bigger than you.
-I'll tell him what you say.

601
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,554
Bullshit. Come on, Nick.

602
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:32,854
That's the Greek? That old guy?
I seen him in here before.

603
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:36,454
Have a seat.

604
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:55,853
A long time since we talk, Frank.

605
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,953
-Coffee, something?
-We're good.

606
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:03,552
What's on your mind?

607
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:06,652
Every goddamn thing.

608
00:54:07,153 --> 00:54:09,952
For one,
I think my cell phone's being tapped.

609
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:13,653
All of a sudden, the phone company
don't care if I pay my bills anymore.

610
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:17,352
Meantime, I hear that our regular port cop,
the one that found your girls...

611
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:20,652
got pulled off to work some special thing
with the city police.

612
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:23,152
-So you switched the can.
-I ran a test.

613
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:25,852
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.

614
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:28,652
Straight away,
the MPA cops stop that Russian's truck...

615
00:54:28,752 --> 00:54:30,852
right after he picked it up.

616
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:33,552
I think someone's got a line
into our computer.

617
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:34,651
Very smart.

618
00:54:34,852 --> 00:54:37,951
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.

619
00:54:38,452 --> 00:54:41,652
That's fine. But now we're going to
have to open the warehouse again.

620
00:54:41,752 --> 00:54:44,852
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.

621
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:48,951
If someone's watching,
show them we have nothing to hide.

622
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:51,651
Our cut stays the same though, right?

623
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:53,451
You kidding?

624
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:55,451
What's your name?

625
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:57,551
-Nick.
-Sobotka.

626
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,051
That's a fair question, Niko.

627
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:06,851
But it has to be the same for everyone:
no work, no pay.

628
00:55:06,951 --> 00:55:10,150
Doesn't matter what's in the cans.
We still gotta check them through.

629
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,750
-That's work, isn't it?
-We take gas, so do you.

630
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,051
-You don't understand--
-I understand completely.

631
00:55:16,151 --> 00:55:18,250
No one is in this for love.

632
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,450
It ain't just the money.

633
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:25,451
I got things happening right now.
Things with my union. Right now!

634
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:30,550
Not a fucking month from now,
when the legislative session is history. Now!

635
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,749
Okay. We pay you still.

636
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,950
I'm thinking of all the business we do
in the future...

637
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,750
and I want you should be happy.

638
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,649
Thanks.

639
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,949
It's a new world, Frank.

640
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,349
You should go out
and spend some of the money...

641
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:04,549
on something you can touch:
a new car, a new coat.

642
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:08,249
It's why we get up in the morning, right?
