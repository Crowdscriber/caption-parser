   FEMALE REPORTER:
    <i>For decades, millions</i>
    <i>of people have come here</i>

3
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,685
       <i>in search of</i>
       <i>the American Dream,</i>

4
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:57,656
    <i>but for many, that dream</i>
    <i>is quickly disappearing.</i>

5
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,060
 MALE NARRATOR:
  <i>Are you unemployed</i>
  <i>or stuck in a dead-end job?</i>

6
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:05,164
FEMALE REPORTER:  <i>Thousands</i>

  <i>Are you homeless, or living</i>
  <i>in a bad neighborhood?</i>

8
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:12,738
FEMALE REPORTER:  <i>Unemployment</i>
<i>shot up to its highest level</i>
<i>in nearly 26 years.</i>

9
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,175
  NARRATOR:
   <i>If the "American Dream"</i>
   <i>broke its promise to you,</i>

10
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,477
       <i>don't worry,</i>
       <i>we have an answer.</i>

11
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,150
  50 CENT:
   <i>Let me help you</i>
   <i>help yourself.</i>

12
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,321
I'm gonna give you
three and a half grams.
You know what to do with this?

13
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,157
'Cause if you know
what to do with it,
you gonna be all right.

14
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,164
   NARRATOR:
    <i>Welcome to the game.</i>
    <i>This is your guide book.</i>

15

     <i>Our experts are going</i>
     <i>to give you everything</i>
     <i>you need.</i>

16
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:47,172
It's very easy
to make a lot of money
with cocaine. (LAUGHS)

17
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,708
  NARRATOR:
   <i>You could have a six</i>
   <i>figure starting salary...</i>

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,312
 It's hard for me to believe
 that something that small
 could be worth so much money.

19
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,781
    NARRATOR:  <i>You can</i>
     <i>make a million dollars</i>
     <i>in a week</i>

20
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,118

    <i>For the next 90 minutes,</i>
    <i>we're going to focus on</i>
    <i>marijuana and cocaine,</i>

23
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,601
but the same lessons work
for any illegal substance
Americans are willing to buy,

24
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:20,539
    <i>or climb to the very top</i>
    <i>of the food chain</i>
    <i>and make billions.</i>

25
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,408
  <i>This training guide</i>
  <i>will show you how to do it.</i>

26
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,211
    You want to know
    how to make money
    selling drugs?

27
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,895
 BOBBY CARLTON:
  <i>Name's Bobby Carlton,</i>

28
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,498
I've lived pretty much
in every ghetto town,

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,235
and my mom
had it rough raising us.
She had me very young.

30
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,772
  <i>A year after</i>
  <i>I was, uh, born,</i>
  <i>my brother was born.</i>

31
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,375
  <i>Years later,</i>
  <i>I'd have two sisters.</i>

32
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,911
Stepfather, two sisters,
he'd eventually leave,

33
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,846
  <i>and then she'd be</i>
  <i>stuck with four kids.</i>

34
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,781
  She'd basically just
  try to raise a family

35
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,485
and try to earn enough
to put food on the table.

36
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,588
I look at people,
they got to get up,
they got to be in an office,

37
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,658
they got to go to a factory,
they got to bang their
heads against a wall,

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,593
  <i>they're trying</i>
  <i>to earn, earn, earn,</i>

39
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,529
but really, what they're
doing is just barely
making their payments.

40
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,700
 (STUTTERS)
  <i>They're working</i>
  <i>just to get by.</i>

41
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,570
   <i>I wanted to make</i>
   <i>money to go live.</i>

42
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,673
I was always looking up
to the bigger kids,

43
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,542
  who, people
  I perceived cool and
  trying to emulate them.

44
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,445
   The guys hanging
   on the street corner,
   not working,

45
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,615
    <i>they have girls,</i>
    <i>they have cars,</i>
    <i>they have money,</i>

46
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:41,253
they seemingly don't ever
have to be anywhere
at any certain time.

47
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,754
And I want in. I'm in.

48
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,459
    NARRATOR:
     <i>What Bobby Carlton</i>
     <i>was about to discover</i>

49
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,994
       <i>is that marijuana</i>
       <i>makes money.</i>

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,998
    <i>More money than tobacco,</i>
    <i>cotton, even corn.</i>

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,704
    <i>It's the most profitable</i>
    <i>farmed product</i>
    <i>in the country.</i>

52
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,573
 I smoked a joint,
 and then you just
 get into it.

53
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,975
    And then other
    people want to do it.

54
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:08,547
  <i>seven joints were in a bag,</i>
  <i>it's a dollar for a joint,</i>

55
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,515
    <i>you pay $5</i>
    <i>for that bag.</i>

56
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,851
Okay. I'll buy a bag,
break it down,

57
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,920
  sell five joints,
  smoke two myself.

58
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,356
       It's kind of
       innocent, right?

59
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,824
CARLTON:  <i>Ninth grade...</i>

60
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:25,364
    <i>but then they were like,</i>
    <i>"How many grams</i>
    <i>are in an ounce?"</i>

61
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:29,001
   <i>They were like, "How many</i>
   <i>pounds are in a kilo?"</i>
   <i>I was like, "2.2."</i>

62
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,536
    "And do you want me
    to tell you how much
    that costs?"

63
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,905
   Hence, everybody
   at school knew what
   I was up to that day.

64
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,748
    NARRATOR:
     <i>If Bobby Carlton</i>
     <i>can do it, so can you.</i>

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,954
    <i>How do you expand from</i>
    <i>a small circle of friends</i>
    <i>and attract more clients?</i>

66
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,292
Making money
selling drugs is easy.
(LAUGHS)

67
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,662
   NARRATOR:  <i>Meet Pepe,</i>
    <i>a retired Southern</i>
    <i>California drug dealer,</i>

68
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,365
    <i>who's going to tell you</i>
    <i>how simple it is</i>
    <i>to get customers.</i>

69
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:06,071
Like I say, is not hard.
Everybody can do it.

70
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,041
   Well, you just
   walk out to the street
   and the park

71
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:13,845
and everybody is gonna
say, "Hey! Spark it up,"
and you'll start rolling.

72
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,349
  If you smoke outside,
  you make a friend,
  because weed makes friends.

73
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,985
     Weed makes friends.

74
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,389
     NARRATOR:
      <i>Now that you've</i>
      <i>got some customers,</i>

75
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,791
       <i>you're gonna</i>
       <i>need some product.</i>

76
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,958
      <i>Where do you get it?</i>

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,396
              NEILL FRANKLIN:
               <i>Most people know</i>
               <i>where to get it,</i>

78
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:35,434
    and if you don't
    know where to get
    marijuana in bulk to sell,

79
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:38,370
     all you have to do is
     ask one or two people,
     and someone's gonna know.

80
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:42,374
  People will front you
  as many drugs
  as you can sell.

81
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,410
As long as you can continue
to pay people back,
they will front them to you.

82
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,113
  NARRATOR:  <i>And if you want</i>
   <i>to skip the middle men?</i>
   <i>Grow your own weed.</i>

83
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,554
Pepe spent quite a few winters
making a lot of money without
ever having to leave home.

84
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,691
    To grow some weed,
    uh, in your house,
    you only need electricity,

85
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,094
         big lamps, and water.

86
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,863
PEPE:  <i>You get in the internet,</i>
<i>you have the seeds, you know.</i>

87
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,667
  CARLTON:  <i>This is just</i>
   <i>kind of like a starter kit</i>
   <i>for people.</i>

88
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,505
   <i>You can get it</i>
   <i>at any hydroponics store</i>
   <i>and get your whole setup.</i>

89
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:17,075
  <i>They'll sell you the tubes,</i>
  <i>the nutrients,</i>
  <i>the little planters.</i>

90
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,412
      <i>In about 45 days,</i>
      <i>these will grow to</i>
      <i>about six feet tall,</i>

91
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,514
     be lush, green,
     and lovely.

92
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:29,388
    <i>let it dry for a couple</i>
    <i>of days, and then pick</i>
    <i>all the buds off.</i>

93
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,723
   NARRATOR:
    <i>So how much money</i>
    <i>can you expect to make?</i>

94
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,859
    Yeah, you can make
    a lot of money.

95
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,595
  I mean, like,
  is gonna grow a pound
  for each plant,

96
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,431
       and a pound
       in the streets

97
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,868
     goes $2,500, $3,000,
     if it is a good weed.

98
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,537
Per 10, how much
you gonna have?

99
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,072
  $30,000.

100
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,710
     In three months,
     people, they doing
     a whole house.

101
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,579
      If you put 50,
      150 thousand.

102
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,750
         (LAUGHS)

103
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,586
  NARRATOR:
   <i>For many dealers, the risk</i>
   <i>of jail time is worth it.</i>

104
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,889
      You make $100,000
      selling drugs.

105
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:07,459
  Hide the money,
  and go to jail, and when you
  come out, you have money.

106
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,762
   If somebody gave me
   $100,000 to go to jail
   for five years,

107
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,964
       I would take it,
       you know.

108
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,633
     What the fuck.
     I mean, you...

109
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,134
      Sometimes, you work
      10 years

110
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,504
    and you don't
    even see $20,000
    in your bank account.

111
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,775
NARRATOR:  <i>But the nearly</i>
<i>one million Americans arrested</i>
<i>each year for marijuana</i>

112
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,479

  <i>possession charges,</i>
  <i>and never even sold a joint.</i>

113
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,715
    <i>Given the risks,</i>
    <i>you'll want to save your</i>

114
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,717
     <i>and start trading</i>
     <i>more expensive drugs.</i>

115
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,086
      I got into cocaine,
      and I loved it.

116
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,725
   NARRATOR:  <i>When it comes</i>
    <i>to cocaine, America is</i>

117
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,162

     <i>Where there's demand,</i>
     <i>there's supply.</i>

123
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,242
        <i>And that's where</i>
        <i>you come in.</i>

124
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,244
   <i>The life of a coke dealer</i>
   <i>isn't easy.</i>

125
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,247
   <i>When you start out,</i>
   <i>you're alone, unprotected,</i>

126
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,984
   <i>at the bottom of</i>
   <i>a ruthless, international</i>
   <i>crime syndicate.</i>

127
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,222
  <i>Most of the world's cocaine</i>
  <i>is manufactured by drug lords</i>
  <i>in South America.</i>

128
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,825
     <i>They smuggle over</i>
     <i>500 tons into the U.S.</i>
     <i>every year.</i>

129
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,195
  <i>Along the way,</i>
  <i>it passes through</i>
  <i>a long line of distributers,</i>

130
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,164
      <i>until a couple</i>
      <i>of grams get to you,</i>

131
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,501
    <i>a pawn in a massive,</i>
    <i>70 billion dollar game.</i>

132
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:31,009
     Pawns, man, in the game,
     they get capped quick.

133
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,578
      They be out
      the game early.

134
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,780
        Unless they some
        smart ass pawns.

135
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,288
  NARRATOR:  <i>Curtis Jackson,</i>
   <i>otherwise known as 50 Cent,</i>
   <i>had to learn quick.</i>

136
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,892
   My mom hustled
   to provide for me,
   financially.

137
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:51,763
And her friends were all
the people that were out
selling drugs as a lifestyle.

138
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,032
      NARRATOR:
       <i>Curtis was raised</i>
       <i>without a father,</i>

139
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,902
    <i>and his mother</i>
    <i>was murdered when</i>
    <i>he was eight years old.</i>

140
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,904
  My mom was all I had,

141
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:04,643
so when I lost her,
I lost everything that was
pretty much good in my life.

142
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,078
   <i>Her old friends</i>
   <i>bought me things,</i>

143
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,214
   <i>then they got tired</i>
   <i>of just buying me things.</i>

144
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,817
   They gave me an eight
   ball of cocaine.

145
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,288
And they told me,
if anybody bothers you,

146
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,757
you know, you tell them
you got it from us,

147
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,327
and you'll be all right
in the neighborhood.

148
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,630
I was about 12 years old
when that happened to me.

149
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,169
    NARRATOR:
     <i>That's the incredible</i>
     <i>thing about cocaine.</i>

150
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,906
     <i>You can use it to make</i>
     <i>ends meet when there</i>
     <i>are no other options.</i>

151
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,943
      <i>You can be anybody,</i>
      <i>even a kid.</i>

152
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:42,047
  I would say about 14 or 15.
  That's when I pretty much
  started into the drug trade.

153
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,685
 NARRATOR:  <i>Let's say you're</i>
  <i>down and out, like John was,</i>
  <i>living in South Central L.A.,</i>

154
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,320
       <i>crashing at your</i>
       <i>family's place,</i>

155
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,722
        <i>with no money,</i>
        <i>not even for food.</i>

156
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,924
  HARRIEL:
   <i>We were living in the back</i>
   <i>of my uncle's house.</i>

157
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,126
    <i>He had this lemon tree,</i>
    <i>and one day he came out</i>
    <i>and he was like,</i>

158
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:59,698
We didn't have no food.
You know, me and my mom
was eating lemons for dinner.

159
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,733
      So, after that,
      I had to get paid.

160
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,237
    <i>The money that you could</i>
    <i>make on the corner</i>
    <i>was real good.</i>

161
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,342
     I started off with
     small amounts, then I got
     to the big amounts.

162
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:14,346
   NARRATOR:  <i>Crack, the most</i>
    <i>popular form of cocaine</i>
    <i>sold in the open market.</i>

163
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,682
   <i>It's cheaper than powder,</i>
   <i>so low income users</i>
   <i>can afford it.</i>

164
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,284
      <i>When you work</i>
      <i>for an organization,</i>

165
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,120

    <i>$10 crack cocaine rocks.</i>

166
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,222
     <i>Because most of your</i>
     <i>customers are addicts,</i>

167
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,325
    <i>they'll be impatient</i>
    <i>to make a buy</i>
    <i>right out on the street.</i>

168
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,795
   <i>And the good thing</i>
   <i>about crack fiends is</i>
   <i>they'll keep coming back.</i>

169
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,965
      Some guys will make
      anywhere from $1,000
      to $10,000 a day.

170
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,374
           MAN:
            <i>Are you the man</i>
            <i>with them jumbo 6s?</i>

171
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,843
         I'll take about three
         or four hundred.

172
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,112
Damn.
(GUN COCKING)

  50 CENT:  <i>It's harder than</i>
   <i>functioning in mainstream</i>
   <i>or corporate America</i>

175
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,759
      <i>because the dynamics</i>
      <i>of it is different.</i>

176
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,263
  In order to take a position
  in that world, you can just,
  "pow." Just shoot.

177
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,365
     CARLTON:  <i>The chances</i>
      <i>of getting robbed are</i>
      <i>pretty great, you know?</i>

178
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,135
     You do
     as much as you can
     to minimize that,

179
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,303
 but somebody at some point
 is gonna want what you have,

180
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,105
  and they're not gonna have
  the money to pay for it.

181
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,007
    They are gonna try
    and take it from you.

182
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,012
    <i>with 30 years' experience</i>
    <i>investigating</i>
    <i>the criminal drug world.</i>

183
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:26,918
      If I steal
      a television set out of,
      uh, you know, Best Buy,

184
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,256
         it lists for $1,000,
         I'll sell it for $200
         on the street.

185
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:36,027
       If I go rob
       the dope dealer,
       I get all his cash,

186
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,295
        and I get drugs.

187
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,364
        And the advantage
        of stolen drugs is

188
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,267
          when I steal
          a guy's coke
          that's worth $1,000,

189
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,436
           I get to sell it
           for $1,000!

190
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,471
         There's no discount
         for hot dope.

191
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,939
MAN:
Ever happened to you?

192
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,774
                Mmm.

193
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,776
       Not me. No, I never had
       no problems like that.

194
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,479
 'Cause at the end of the day,
 you fuck me, you gonna
 know what's happening.

195
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:59,050
   Are you gonna give them
   your drugs or are you gonna
   tell them to fuck off?

196
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,286
    And I'm the person
    that's gonna say fuck off.

197
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,456
   If you don't have a pistol,
   I don't know why you even
   selling dope.

198
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,325
            You won't last.
            'Cause somebody
            gonna try you.

      FRANKLIN:
       <i>Anyone who is dealing</i>
       <i>drugs in this community,</i>

200
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,199
     <i>if they do not have</i>
     <i>a gun on them,</i>
     <i>believe me, it's close by.</i>

201
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,303
   <i>It's under a stoop,</i>
   <i>right around a corner,</i>
   <i>tucked behind a phone booth,</i>

202
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,471
         but it's close by.

203
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,308
   They look up in your face,
   they look up in your eye,

204
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,343
      they see the gun
      and they know
      who's gonna use it,

205
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,444
    who ain't gonna use it.

206
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,316
     A, assess.
     "Don't shoot them,
     kill them."

207
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,019
  Because if you shoot them,
  you gonna make them
  angry enough to come back

208
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,187
   and really hurt you.

209
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,356
 So, if you're gonna shoot,
 shoot to kill.

210
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:43,128
It was like motherfuckers
were shooting each other
every day on the news.

211
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,498
It was like,
New York, very much like
a stabbing society, you know.

212
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,267
Something goes wrong,
somebody sticks a knife
in your chest.

213
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,970
 It was a drug deal gone bad,
 I got the worst of it.

214
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,839
        Stabbed here,
        stabbed here,
        stabbed here.

215
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:59,110
 Once in the back of the head,
 once in the chest,
 entered the left ventricle,

216
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,913

        Nobody's heard of?

223
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,869

224

   So, I did a lot of time.
   I did, like five years,
   spring something like that.

346
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:23,321
   And a white drug dealer
   will be in middle America,
   somewhere in the suburbs.

347
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:28,960
That isn't in a space where
he can just be searched for no
reason at all or go to jail.

NARRATOR:  <i>Curtis Jackson,</i>
<i>Russell Simmons,</i>
<i>and many others</i>

349
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,332
       <i>have successfully</i>
       <i>persuaded New York</i>

350
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,568
  <i>to reduce some of their</i>
  <i>harsh sentencing practices.</i>

351
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,271
   <i>But 90% of those</i>
   <i>convicted on drug charges</i>

352
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,574
   <i>are still African-American</i>
   <i>and Latino.</i>

353
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,476
       <i>Like they say</i>
       <i>for any business,</i>

354
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:49,347
       <i>the golden rule,</i>
       <i>location, location,</i>
       <i>location.</i>

355
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,317
    MIKE WALZMAN:
     <i>I didn't care if people</i>
     <i>knew where I lived.</i>

356
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,786
     People would
     just come to my house,
     and I would go outside

357
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,689
   and just give them
   the gram, and we would do
   the transaction that way.

358
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,461
   In 2003, I was the main
   coke dealer for all
   the private schools in L.A.

359
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:08,266
     <i>If you're gonna be</i>
     <i>a private coke dealer,</i>
     <i>this is the way to go.</i>

360
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,834
      <i>In a nice, suburban</i>
      <i>neighborhood,</i>

361
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,837
    <i>selling to the largest</i>
    <i>cocaine market directly.</i>

362
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,541
    <i>and already knew</i>
    <i>where to buy cocaine</i>
    <i>for him and his friends.</i>

363
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,845
    <i>So, he was in a perfect</i>
    <i>position to go into</i>
    <i>business for himself.</i>

364
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,047
     WALZMAN:  <i>What's going on</i>
      <i>through my head is,</i>

365
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,816
    <i>just start selling drugs</i>
    <i>to support my habit</i>

366
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,753
       <i>and to support</i>
       <i>the lifestyle that</i>
       <i>I wanted.</i>

367
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,889
     People want drugs,
     so I can sell drugs.

368
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,791
      'Cause I know where
      to get it already.

369
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,027
      My first rock
      was about this big,

370
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,629
   and I remember
   showing my friends this.

371
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:43,734
   They were like, "No fucking
   way you have this big of
   a rock with you right now,

372
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,369
       "like, this is insane."

373
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,571
    (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

374
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:51,842
       <i>It was like,</i>
       <i>"This is awesome,</i>
       <i>this is exciting."</i>

375
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,649
  The stories that grew out
  of me being a coke dealer
  just went from this

376
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,653
     to like, you know, this,
     and I was suddenly,
     you know, the guy...

377
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,622
        You know,
        that everyone's
        talking about,

378
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,792
     <i>I threw a party at</i>
     <i>the L'Ermitage hotel,</i>

379
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,994
       and I got, like,
       the Penthouse suite.

380
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,663
   <i>I've always wanted</i>
   <i>to be loved and accepted.</i>

381
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,000
    And that's what
    selling coke gave me.
    It gave me that power,

382
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,469
     it gave me the feeling
     of acceptance.

383
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,339
  It was definitely addictive
  to be a drug dealer.

384
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,575
    Not only the money
    that you got from it,

385
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,811
       <i>but the way people</i>
       <i>talked about you,</i>

386
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:30,948
the way people looked at you,
the power that I felt from it.

387
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,686
  I just liked having money.
  It gave me security,
  it made me feel good.

388
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,422
    People don't know
    what's a gram,
    and what's not a gram,

389
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,091
    they've never seen
    coke before in their life.

390
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,027
   <i>The market rate for a gram</i>
   <i>was about $50 for coke,</i>

391
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,096
    but if you're a rich girl
    who didn't know anything,

392
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:50,101
  I would probably sell you
  .5 for about $60 to $75.

393
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,437
  NARRATOR:  <i>A guy like Mike</i>
   <i>makes half as much as</i>
   <i>our Detroit dealer,</i>

394
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,741
     <i>working half as hard,</i>
     <i>but with virtually</i>
     <i>none of the risk.</i>

395
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,977
      The word got out
      that I have coke,
      and I'm selling coke.

396
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,080
    The dean in the school,
    they pulled me in,

397
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:06,717
    and they said, "Hey look,
    you know, we're hearing
    that you're selling drugs,

398
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,053
      "and we want to do
      a drug test on you."

399
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,422
      So, at that point,
      you know, I thought
      to myself,

400
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,626
     "Well, I better really
     slow down on this
     and not do it anymore."

401
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,027
  NARRATOR:
   <i>Mike failed his drug test,</i>

402
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,064
and was kicked out of school,
but never did any hard time.

403
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,601
  <i>When dealing small amounts,</i>
  <i>the nicer the neighborhood,</i>

404
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,669
       <i>the less chance</i>
       <i>of getting busted.</i>

405
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:30,941
     <i>it'll still take years</i>
     <i>to get that mansion</i>
     <i>in the hills you want.</i>

406
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,878
   <i>To be a big time player,</i>
   <i>you need to get committed.</i>

407
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,013
      <i>It's time to start</i>
      <i>building a business.</i>

408
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,558
    Instead of selling ounces,
    I started selling keys.

409
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,728
      NARRATOR:  <i>A key is</i>
       <i>a kilo of cocaine.</i>

410
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,798
         <i>A single kilo</i>
         <i>can run you</i>
         <i>about $20,000.</i>

411
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,033
        I had what I believe
        was skills.

412
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,870
   NARRATOR:  <i>This is Skipp.</i>
    <i>He did really well</i>
    <i>as a corner hustler.</i>

413
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:04,041
     I had the skills to sit
     on the wall and make
     about $8,000 a day.

414
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,211
NARRATOR:  <i>Once you've</i>
<i>stacked up enough money,</i>
<i>you can buy larger quantities</i>

415
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:11,048
  <i>and supply dealers yourself,</i>
  <i>which is what Skipp's</i>
  <i>gonna teach you to do.</i>

416
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,119
  SKIPP:  <i>I was 10 or 11</i>
   <i>years old, my family life</i>
   <i>was dysfunctional.</i>

417
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,922
My mother worked two jobs,
my father wasn't in the home,

418
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,790
      <i>so before drugs came</i>
      <i>into the community,</i>

419
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,195
lot of people who would hustle
would rob banks
or rob jewelry stores.

420
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,530
        <i>The aggression,</i>
        <i>the violence</i>
        <i>wasn't for me.</i>

421
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,499
     NARRATOR:
      <i>Skipp was struggling</i>
      <i>to make ends meet</i>

422
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:33,204
  <i>in order to protect himself</i>
  <i>from the Crips bullying</i>
  <i>his neighborhood.</i>

423
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,941
      <i>but it was</i>
      <i>the relationships</i>
      <i>I had with the Crips</i>

424
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,710
         <i>that actually</i>
         <i>introduced me</i>
         <i>to drugs.</i>

425
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,013
    <i>I saw them having money,</i>
    <i>and I was asking them</i>
    <i>what are they doing,</i>

426
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:46,083
    and the more I hung out
    with them, I got more into
    the culture of drugs.

427
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,152
     <i>We used to go to, uh,</i>
     <i>different areas</i>

428
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,721
     <i>that weren't populated</i>
     <i>by the L.A. culture</i>

429
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,090
      <i>so they wanted it,</i>
      <i>but they didn't have</i>
      <i>the connection,</i>

430
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,693
    <i>so we would come out</i>
    <i>and be that connection.</i>

431
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:59,129
       You'd have to have,
       uh, a family contact
       or a friend.

432
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,965
             <i>I myself went</i>
             <i>to Las Vegas.</i>

433
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,767
There are more than
a hundred street gangs
in Los Angeles.

434
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,070
Police now say
they have become
heavily involved

435
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,573
 in the drug trade,
 exporting their crimes
 throughout the west.

436
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,576
        Going out of town
        when people knew
        you were from L.A.,

437
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,879
    that number one,
    made you a star celebrity.

438
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:18,282
           And then,
           if you were the guy
           who had the drugs,

439
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,818
          it made you an even
          bigger celebrity.

440
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,922
      Made all the girls love
      and want to come to you.

441
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,258
       The difficult part
       became how to get it
       out of town.

442
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,863
          <i>I myself would always</i>
          <i>buy a bucket.</i>

443
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:37,568
       Put whatever I want
       inside of it and go get
       a girl who likes me.

444
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,004
         Don't tell her
         what's in the car,
         and let her drive it.

445
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,839
MAN: Did the girls
ever get pulled over?

446
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,075
      Nah, I've been
      fortunate that
      that has never occurred.

447
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:48,712
      Um, however,
      they did get pregnant,
      and I now have children.

448
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,848
        The relationships that
        I wanted for a weekend

449
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,317
            have lasted longer
            than I expected.

450
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,886
    NARRATOR:
     <i>A lot of smugglers get</i>
     <i>someone else to drive.</i>

451
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,022
      <i>But how do you keep</i>
      <i>track of you driver?</i>

452
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,025
The DEA make a living
chasing drugs across country.

453
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,298
    <i>So they can tell you how</i>
    <i>the smartest suppliers</i>
    <i>keep track of their cargo.</i>

454
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,171
           <i>the source of supply</i>
           <i>had rigged this car</i>
           <i>with a GPS locator</i>

455
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,641
           <i>and a phone,</i>
           <i>so he could actually</i>
           <i>dial into the phone</i>

456
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:22,179
       and he could monitor
       if the transaction was
       going correctly or not.

457
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,315
           He would know
           if the vehicle was
           out of position.

458
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,784
  NARRATOR:
   <i>Now, you don't want to put</i>
   <i>your drugs in the trunk.</i>

459
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,253
      <i>You're going to want</i>
      <i>some new options</i>
      <i>on your vehicle.</i>

460
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:33,023
    <i>Designing "traps"</i>
    <i>is standard practice</i>
    <i>for any local chop shop.</i>

461
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,328
           It's kind of like
           a combination safe.

462
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,830
         It has to be a series
         of things activated
         in the vehicle

463
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:44,735
    <i>Like, they may have to have</i>
    <i>the air conditioning on,</i>
    <i>the blinker on,</i>

464
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:48,038
     and a couple of other
     things within the vehicle
     for it to activate.

465
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,807
You got money
to spend, you'll get
a real good trap.

466
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,109
We've seen
some sloppy ones,
this is good work.

467
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,778
   When they're closed,
   you would never know by
   looking at it with your eye

468
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,816
          so whoever
          constructed this one
          was a professional.

469
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,352
      It goes the whole length
      of the back seat area.

470
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:04,288
            So you could fit
            probably in excess
            of 10 kilograms

471
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,725
of, uh, narcotics,
large amounts
of currency or weapons.

472
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,728
 NARRATOR:
  <i>Now you're ready.</i>
  <i>But before you hit the road,</i>

473
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,864
    <i>Pepe has some tips from</i>
    <i>back in the day when</i>
    <i>he was running cocaine.</i>

474
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,836
        Get up in the morning,
        you be ready.

475
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,805
Check your car,
no lights broke.

476
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,242
   Insure your car,
   everything.

477
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,811
Even the speed limit.

478
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,414
       25? 25. No more.

479
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,416
         75? 75.
         You know?

480
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,952
  15, school? 15, school.

481
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,720
         Take it easy.

482
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:37,755
           (LAUGHS)

483
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:41,025
      And you get there.
      You be there.

484
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,360
  NARRATOR:
   <i>So how much does</i>
   <i>a smuggler expect to make?</i>

485
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:48,265
If they take 10 kilos,
they give me $4,000
just to smuggle it,

486
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:52,936
or if it was more?
5,000. It all depends.

487
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,007
    NARRATOR:
     <i>So you've driven a few</i>
     <i>kilos across country,</i>

488
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,411
    <i>you might be making</i>
    <i>mid six figures a year.</i>

489
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:05,783
    <i>Once you're in the game,</i>
    <i>you realize just how</i>
    <i>many people want drugs.</i>

490
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:09,987
 There's everybody from
 the Wall Street types
 to the people on the streets,

491
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,424
    to kids going
    to concerts, the stoners.

492
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,259
   Everybody wanted cocaine.

493
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,761
   NARRATOR:

   <i>eventually make in a day.</i>

495
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,473
   <i>In the 70s,</i>
   <i>all the cocaine was coming</i>
   <i>in through South Florida,</i>

496
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:35,913
   <i>and uh, back then</i>
   <i>they used to call it</i>
   <i>the South Florida shuffle.</i>

497
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:39,883
  <i>Everybody and anybody</i>
  <i>was selling drugs,</i>
  <i>running drugs, moving drugs.</i>

498
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:44,021
      <i>They were coming in,</i>
      <i>and they were going</i>
      <i>everywhere.</i>

499

       <i>The posses buy cocaine</i>
       <i>for about $5,000 a kilo.</i>

500
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,394
       <i>The drugs are then</i>
       <i>brought here to Miami,</i>
       <i>where they're divided up</i>

501

 CARLTON:  <i>A girl that we had</i>
  <i>known, me and some friends,</i>
  <i>we had gone over</i>

504
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:06,977
  <i>to her house for a party,</i>
  <i>and I went with her into her</i>
  <i>garage, and I was shocked.</i>

505
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:11,148
     <i>There was boxes</i>
     <i>and boxes of cash just</i>
     <i>all over the garage,</i>

506
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,150
       <i>and it was just</i>
       <i>packed with money.</i>

507
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:16,420
I just looked at her
and I said, "Look I don't care
what you're into,

508
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,922
       <i>"or how you do it,</i>
       <i>I want in."</i>

509
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,024
     And she introduced
     me to somebody,

510
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,293
    and, uh, that somebody
    put me on a boat.

511
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,836
         The way it works
         is their drop-off
         point is Bimini.

512
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,806
         <i>Bimini's literally</i>
         <i>like 70 miles off</i>
         <i>the coast of Florida.</i>

513

          <i>You can go to Bimini,</i>
          <i>load up,</i>

         <i>These, like, Colombian</i>

516
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:49,153
          <i>What they do is they</i>

        <i>the money's very good.</i>

   <i>You get into Fort Lauderdale</i>
   <i>or you get into Miami,</i>

519
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:02,866

   <i>and you get a bunch</i>

         <i>that's a lot of money.</i>

522
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,818
  NARRATOR:
   <i>Fifty grand a day</i>
   <i>would satisfy most people.</i>

523
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,153
      <i>But not Brian O'Dea.</i>

524
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:28,425
    <i>Brian was one of</i>
    <i>the most notorious drug</i>
    <i>smugglers in the world.</i>

525
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:34,031
    <i>He and his 120 employees</i>

    <i>$100 million a year.</i>

526

   <i>Brian's going to show you</i>
   <i>how a college dropout</i>

527
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:40,904
    <i>can become</i>
    <i>the CEO of a major</i>
    <i>import-export business.</i>

528
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,407
     I sent two pounds of hash
     to myself from England.

529
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,844
     I got 19 months for that,
     and went to prison.

530
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,315
     When I got out of prison,
     I had no money
     and nothing going on.

531
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,350
         <i>So, I thought,</i>
         <i>maybe I can kick start</i>

            <i>my getting back</i>

            <i>with a little coke.</i>

533
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:00,557
      I had $500 in my pocket,
      and an address.

534
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,460
       Couldn't speak a word
       of Spanish, but figured
       I could figure it out,

535
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,995
              so I took off
              to Colombia,

536
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:10,067
     and I said,
     "Do you know, uh, Benny?"

537
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,469
      Showing him my card
      with Benny's name on it.

538
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,873
      I won't say
      his last name right now.
      I might get myself shot.

539
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,208
          So the guy, he said,
          "What do you want?"

540
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,476
          I went like that,

541
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,045
             and I said
             "Well, I got
             $500 with me."

542
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,948
       And, you know,
       everybody started
       crying laughing, right.

543
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,084
         I told him I just
         got out of prison,

544
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,487
          I got my hands on...
          That's all I could
          get my hands on,

545
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,556
       and I'm just trying
       to get a life started.

546
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,225
       So he said,
        <i>"Senor, muchos huevos."</i>

547
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,160
          He thought I had
          a lot of balls.

548
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,429
       He said, "I'm gonna get
       you 50 grams of coke.

549
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,399
     "You can
     cut it in half 'cause
     I'll give it to you pure.

550
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,269
       "You should be able
       to get about 10 grand
       out of that back there

551
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,370
    "if you sell it in grams."

552
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,238
        I don't know where
        I came up with this,

553
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,908
        but I got a pin,
        and I heated it
        with a lighter,

554
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,177
        and you can put
        a hot pin under
        this cellophane here,

555
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,346
       and that will pop open.

556
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:59,349
         So, then you can
         slide the cigarettes
         right out of the pack

557
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,184
    without breaking the seal.

558
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:05,422
         The 50 grams of coke
         fit into this pack

559
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,292
       like it was made
       to fit into that pack.

560
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,295
      I thought,
      "Ah, this is brilliant!"

561
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,630
          I put the cigarettes
          with the coke in it
          in my pocket

562
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,265
          with the pack
          I was smoking.

563
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,268
          Leaving Colombia,
          you have to go
          through immigration.

564
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,271
     There's no just going
     and getting on the plane.

565
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:26,109
So, I'm going through
immigration, there are
two guys there, and they go...

566
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,947
 "On behalf of
 the Unites States Government,
 we're checking all people

567
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:33,317
       "who fit a profile,
       who seem to be
       involved with drugs..."

568
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,654
  I said, "Are you kidding me?
  I'm a reporter!
  I'm a journalist!"

569
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:43,460
     But they said,
     "We still have to take

     I take my pants off,
     still have my jacket on.

574
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,473
       I pass them my pants,
       cursing and swearing,
       and my socks,

575
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,409
      and I reach my hand
      into my jacket pocket.

576
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,646
     I put the cigarettes
     I was holding the coke in
     on the bottom

577
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,349
      and the cigarettes I was
      smoking on the top,
      and I flipped it open,

578
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:08,318
        the one I was smoking,
        pulled out a cigarette
        and lit it.

579
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,454
     Offered them a cigarette,
     which they each took.

580
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:13,457
     I mean, these guys
     are making 30 bucks
     a month, we can't forget.

581
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,159
I'm lighting their cigarettes,
and I take my jacket off

582
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,995
      and hand it to them,
      and my shirt,

583
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:22,532
      holding the cigarettes
      and the coke in my hand
      the entire time.

584
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:28,338
The moment they handed me back
a piece of clothing that had
a pocket in it, shwamp!

585
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,608
  I immediately stuffed
  the coke back in the pocket.

586
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,179
         And that's how I got
         in the coke business.

    <i>was in business.</i>

588
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,491
He got a small amount of coke,
and he dissolved it in water,
and then poured in material.

589
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:51,661
    <i>What we used were ponchos,</i>

    <i>in Colombia.</i>

590
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,198
So, here we now had this piece
of material that had a couple
of grams of coke in it,

591
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,435
     and then I just folded up
     those ponchos buddy,
     put them in my suitcase,

592
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,671
          and headed on

          to L.A. from Bogota.

593
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:07,110
 You just soak it in
 the water, and then evaporate
 the water off. Simple.

594
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:10,247
   Of course, methanol is
   what you should be doing it
   with, and not water,

595
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,749
           'cause methanol
           evaporates off at
           room temperature.

596
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,352
        Water, you got
        to wait forever for
        the shit to evaporate,

597
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,187
      which is, you know...

"You can't make
any money in South Central
off of cocaine."

634
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,244
What I found out is that
the PCP dealers made
so much money for PCP,

635
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,647
they had the money,

they snort so much

So, they needed
another way to get it

    and they want to smoke it.

646
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:58,481
   They started saying

   was ready to go already."

647
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:01,785

       cooking it up for them,

648
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:05,956

     NARRATOR:
      <i>And that's how they</i>
      <i>busted Freeway Rick.</i>

686
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,916
      The cops on my case
      had planted drugs on me.

687
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,617
   I pled guilty to 10 years.

688
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,028
  NARRATOR:  <i>So, knowing</i>
   <i>the cops are going</i>
   <i>to arrest you at some point</i>

689
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,498
  <i>no matter how good you are,</i>
  <i>what can you do?</i>

690
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,102
    <i>The first thing you need</i>
    <i>to understand is how</i>
    <i>drug cases work.</i>

691
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:35,705
    <i>Drug cases are</i>
    <i>prosecuted unlike</i>
    <i>any other criminal case.</i>

692
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,807
    <i>Here's a cop and</i>
    <i>a lawyer to explain how.</i>

693
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:42,679
HOWARD WOOLDRIDGE:
It's impossible for the police
to have a normal procedure

694
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,115
     <i>in a crime where</i>
     <i>nobody wants to report it.</i>

695
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:50,487
   Nobody calls 911
   when they use a drug,
   buy a drug, or sell a drug.

696
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,990
       In traditional
       law enforcement,
       a crime gets committed,

697
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,427
      police try to find
      who committed the crime.

698
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,729
       This is the way
       drug enforcement works,

699
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:07,103
you look for a suspect,
and then you try to trick them
into committing the crime...

700
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,139
            For you!

701
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:10,740
         It's backwards.

702
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,475
   So the government
   goes around sort of saying,

703
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,411
     "Let's find suspect,
     who should be a...

704
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,646
    "Well, let's try
    to set some fucker up."

    NARRATOR:  <i>Here we are,</i>
     <i>observing the DEA,</i>

706
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,086

     <i>drugs from a suspect.</i>

707
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,488
       <i>He's the guy</i>
       <i>on the right with</i>
       <i>the baseball cap.</i>

708
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:31,428
   <i>He's completely surrounded</i>
   <i>by law enforcement,</i>
   <i>and has no idea.</i>

     OVER RADIO)

710

Just chill, just chill.
Got any weapons on you?
Anything on you?

711
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,542
          Nothing? No guns,
          no knives, no drugs?

712
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,644
       All right. But just
       to protect, do you have
       anything on you,

713
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:55,185
NARRATOR:  <i>The reality is that</i>
<i>the cops don't really care</i>
<i>too much about this one guy.</i>

714
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:58,788
     <i>Their objective is</i>
     <i>to just use him</i>
     <i>to cuff more dealers.</i>

715

MAN: We'll lock up
this middle man,

716
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,760
hopefully, this middle man
will cooperate and get us
the distributor,

717
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,662
and we'll just go
up the ladder

718
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,863
and keep going up
the food chain.

719
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,731
        It's very intimidating
        and overwhelming.

720
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,234
         I'm gonna say to you,
         you know, you got
         a lot to lose,

721
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,669

             at a lot of time.

722
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,937
           I mean, even if...
           Even if you're not,

723
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,738
            you're gonna try
            to sell him
            that he's going.

724
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,540
          You know,
          you're going to jail
          for a long time.

725
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,509
          If they don't know,
          they may give it up.

726
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,911

         <i>You either go to jail,</i>
         <i>you get a record.</i>

728
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:28,685
       Or in the other hand,
       you become
       an informant for us,

729
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,187

       Yes, this was

      <i>he is a gang leader.</i>

741
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,053
       They actually put it
       in the newspaper,

742
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,256

     <i>If he would plead guilty,</i>

747
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,765
and save the prosecutors
the trouble of going to trial.

748
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:20,870
   The offer came
   that it would be five years
   as opposed to 55 years.

749
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,906
       Um, I signed up for it.

750
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:24,741
      NARRATOR:
       <i>And what happened</i>
       <i>to the snitch?</i>

751
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,676

          any time at all.

752
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,879
     Matter of fact, he was

Federal drug money

  NARRATOR:
   <i>Alexandra Natapoff</i>

756
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,293

        <i>on snitching.</i>

757
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,828
Snitches are very good
at producing arrests.

758
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,765
They may not be
very good at solving
important crimes,

759
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:52,235
or getting drugs
off the street,
or making communities safer,

760

763
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,982
       And they,
       they are police.
       They can shoot you.

           incarcerated,

767
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:20,930
         bad things can happen
         in prison, right?

768
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,067
     No, he told me
     that he would

         <i>were arrested.</i>

776
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:48,691
Most snitches in the arena
of street and drug crime
will never have a lawyer.

777
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,960
They'll never talk to anyone
about their rights,

778
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,329
about the nature of the case
that the government
has against them.

779
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,798
They'll negotiate
with the police officer
right there on the street

780
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,634
   or maybe
   in the back
   of the police car.

781
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,102
      All right, let me
      tell you like this here.

782
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,705
    I never bought drugs

    Straight up.

787
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,684
     <i>Because snitching</i>

  work it off.

797
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,369
She could do
an undercover drug buy.

798

She was supposed to buy
15,000 ecstasy tablets,

50 grams of cocaine,
and two handguns.

     "Dad, I'm really thinking
     about you today."

805

808
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,801
   And at the end
   of the day,

809
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,736
    when the police
    were confronted

810
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,138
with whether they had made
the right decision

811
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,842
to send in a 22-year-old
college girl to make
this kind of drug deal,

812
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,177
     do you know
     what they said?

813
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,446
  They said,
  "Well, she didn't
  follow protocol."

814
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:19,148
Now, see that's where
everybody feels we're
looking to blame someone...

815
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,451
But I asked you what happened,
you said, "She deviated
from the plan."

816
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:23,453
Well,
and that's where, uh...

817
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:27,156
 Whenever the plan
 started going, um, south,
 if you want to say,

818
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,059
  uh, where we lost
  contact with Rachel

819
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,796
 because she did not show up
 at the location she was
 supposed to have gone to.

820
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:37,967
     You don't think
     she was pushed into it,
     coerced by your officers?

821
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,836

822
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:41,804
        For charges
        that were never filed?

823
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,442
Again, we don't threaten
people to become
confidential informants.

824

         So the boys decided
         to give him 50 grand,

882
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,380
        "He is not going to be

        he left that meeting,

884
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:18,154
and he went right to the
DEA's office with the money
and put it on the table.

885
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:22,425

The DEA, they were jealous,
because they were supposed to
be making all the big arrests.

926
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,161
             The first month,
             I performed
             seven drug raids.

927
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,764
        <i>The DEA were only doing</i>

        <i>The entire DEA.</i>

928
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,900

     of every county,

929
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,236
       I only had jurisdiction

930

931

three or four of these a day."

932

1038
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:13,222
      <i>But Harry Anslinger</i>
      <i>didn't stop pushing</i>
      <i>drug prohibition.</i>

1039
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:17,259
  <i>In the 1960s,</i>
  <i>he took his case all the way</i>
  <i>to the United Nations,</i>

1040
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:22,164
  <i>and lobbied the whole world</i>
  <i>to adopt the U.S. policy</i>
  <i>of outlawing drugs.</i>

1041
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,734
  <i>Richard Nixon would pick up</i>
  <i>where Anslinger left off.</i>

1042
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:32,040
 America's public enemy
 number one in the
 United States is drug abuse.

<i>and violence,</i>

1044
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,914
     <i>Nixon used drug policy</i>
     <i>as a weapon</i>

1045

   (RICHARD NIXON SPEAKING)

1047
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,672
        To fight and defeat
        this enemy,

1048
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:08,110
     it is necessary to wage
     a new, all-out offensive.

1049
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:11,914
 NARRATOR:  <i>President Nixon</i>
  <i>created the Drug Enforcement</i>
  <i>Administration,</i>

1050
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:17,619
with an annual budget
of $65 million,
and started the war on drugs.

1051
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:21,290
    <i>If you are a governor,</i>
    <i>mayor, police chief,</i>
    <i>or any public official,</i>

1052
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:25,127
  <i>an enormous amount of money</i>
  <i>was suddenly available</i>
  <i>from the federal government.</i>

1053
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:27,829
  <i>All you had to do</i>
  <i>was enlist in the drug war.</i>

1054
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,599
 FRANKLIN:
  <i>All of us in law enforcement,</i>
  <i>we're soldiers.</i>

1055
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:33,702
   We developed the cases,
   we got the informants,
   we did the search warrants,

1056
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:37,673
     we did the wire taps,
     but we didn't
     take the money out of it.

1057
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:42,778
    All the wonderful
    little entrepreneurs said,
    "Now it's my time."

1058
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,280
NARRATOR:  <i>Twelve years later,</i>
<i>the federal drug war budget</i>

1059
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:48,250
      <i>had grown to over</i>
      <i>$1.5 billion a year.</i>

1060
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,588
And the Reagan administration
stepped up the rhetoric.

1061
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,663
 For the sake of our children,
 I implore each of you,

1062
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:06,001
  to be unyielding
  and inflexible
  in your opposition to drugs.

1063
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,336
       Say yes to your life.

1064
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:10,072
   And when it comes to drugs,
   just say no.

1065
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,607
           "Just say no"
           is sort of a fraud,

1066
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,942
         it's one America
         talking to the other

1067
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,845
            not even knowing
            how the other half
            has to live.

<i>the creator of the critically</i>
<i>acclaimed series </i> The Wire.

1069
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:23,619
When you're at war,
you need a fucking enemy.

1070
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:28,090
And pretty soon damn near
everybody on every corner
is your fuckin' enemy.

1071
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,958
  NARRATOR:
   <i>David based the characters</i>

  <i>during his many years as</i>
  <i>a Baltimore police reporter.</i>

1074
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:36,798
         Yeah, we were saying
         "Just say no"

1075
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,967
         to involving yourself
         in the drug trade.

1076
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:42,738
 It was like telling people
 in a factory town,
 "Don't go to work for steel."

1077
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,340
  <i>Or telling people in Detroit,</i>
  <i>"Don't go to work for GM."</i>

1078

"Don't go work
for the only factory that is
hiring in your neighborhood."

1080
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:54,249
     <i>And the country</i>
     <i>is telling you implicitly,</i>
     <i>"We don't need you."</i>

1081
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,652
           <i>You're a human being</i>
           <i>without purpose.</i>

1082
01:00:56,654 --> 01:01:00,255
   <i>And that's 10, to 15, to 20%</i>
   <i>of our population</i>
   <i>at this point.</i>

1083
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,658
       You got to realize
       we ain't got no jobs
       around here or nothin'.

1084
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,294
      You know, so, every time
      we try to make
      a little somethin'

1085
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:09,297
           to get on our feet,
           to try and help
           to feed our family,

1086
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:13,001
they come kicking the doors in
and knocking, knocking us
back down again.

1087
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,438
       Even as you fall
       into the corner culture
       and ruin your life,

1088
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,341
   um, you're granted meaning.

1089
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,443
     You're granted a purpose.

1090
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:24,146
        You're gonna go out
        and you're going to
        sell this G-pack today

1091
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:27,115
        And you're going to
        bring that money home
        to your people.

1092
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,851
             So "just say no"
             was a problem.

1093
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:34,156
 Um, in that, we had not given
 the slightest bit of thought

1094
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:38,060
  as to what people
  in these worlds
  were supposed to say yes to,

   NARRATOR:  <i>By 1986,</i>

       Len Bias was
       a college star athlete.

  of, uh, heavy cocaine use.

1106

1123
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:11,987

you can murder somebody

01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:39,941
     that in part
     reflects my failures

1155
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:42,878
      to be a better lawyer
      in blocking that law.

1156
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,881
    It pains me very much,

1157
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:49,384
       you know, when I meet
       the family members
       of these people,

1158
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,386
     uh, it breaks my heart.

1159
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,562
    NARRATOR:
     <i>It was a total success</i>
     <i>for the Democrats.</i>

1160
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,198
Many of the congressmen
behind the mandatory minimums

1161
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,967
      <i>were re-elected</i>
      <i>the following term.</i>

1162
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,104
          If you really wanna
          do good in politics,
          be tough on drugs.

1163
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:14,643
   <i>the CIA discovered</i>
   <i>that drug money could help</i>
   <i>U.S. foreign interests.</i>

1164
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:19,514
 POLITICIAN:  <i>Now we all know</i>
  <i>that the U.S. government</i>
  <i>and the CIA supported</i>

1165
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:23,218
     the contras in Nicaragua,
     in the middle '80s.

1166
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:28,690
    Now it is alleged the CIA
    also helped the contras
    raise money for arms

1167
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:33,128
  by introducing crack cocaine
  into California.

1168
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,031
There's no question in my mind
there is complicity

1169
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,333
  in the flow of drugs
  into this country, period.

1170
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:42,070
NEWS REPORTER:
A senate investigation led by
John Kerry of Massachusetts

1171
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:46,041
     <i>found that individuals</i>
     <i>who provided support</i>
     <i>for the contras</i>

1172
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:51,413
   NARRATOR:  <i>Freeway Rick's</i>
    <i>former South American</i>
    <i>cocaine supplier</i>

1173
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:54,049
    <i>was a major contributor</i>
    <i>to the contras.</i>

1174
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:57,585
  <i>Eventually the DEA hired him</i>
  <i>to set up Freeway Rick,</i>

1175
01:05:57,587 --> 01:06:00,021
      <i>putting him in jail</i>
      <i>for 20 years.</i>

1176
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:03,224
  <i>The DEA paid Rick's supplier</i>
  <i>for services,</i>

1177
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:05,460
      <i>and American</i>
      <i>crack cocaine users</i>

1178
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,464
  <i>helped pay for</i>
  <i>a U.S. government-supported</i>
  <i>war in South America.</i>

1179
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:15,136
   And when that first cocaine
   was smuggled in on a ship,

1180
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,973
      it may as well have been
      a deadly bacteria,

1181
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:22,043
  so much as it hurt the body,
  the soul of our country.

1182
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:26,481
      But take my word for it,
      this scourge will stop.

1183
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,150
   NARRATOR:
    <i>President Bush Senior</i>
    <i>doubled the war budget.</i>

1184
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:34,122
   <i>And by the end</i>
   <i>of his administration,</i>
   <i>it had doubled yet again.</i>

1185
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:38,059
  <i>During the '90s,</i>
  <i>government asset forfeiture</i>
  <i>was also on the rise.</i>

1186
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,664
is they permit the government
to seize assets
and money of people

1187
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,701
   <i>where they believe that</i>
   <i>those assets are connected</i>
   <i>to drug enforcement.</i>

1188
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:50,105
  It's very easy
  for the government
  to get assets this way

1189
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:52,307
because the standard of proof
is so much lower.

1190
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,676
No one needs to be charged
or convicted of a crime.

1191
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,345
NARRATOR:
The message to law enforcement
officers was simple.

1192
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,015
     In the event that you are
     an undercover officer

1193
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,751
       and you see someone
       carrying two suitcases,

1194
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:05,453
   one is full of money,
   the other is full of drugs,

1195
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:06,755
           follow the money.

1196
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:10,492
   Drugs coming up from Mexico
   go north and east.

1197
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:12,594
     <i>To seize the large amounts</i>
     <i>of money,</i>

1198
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:17,632
  <i>I was instructed</i>
  <i>to begin working</i>
  <i>south and west bound traffic.</i>

1199
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:23,772
      <i>I got extremely talented</i>
      <i>at seizing money</i>
      <i>under the rules of law.</i>

1200
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,607
       That's highway robbery.

1201
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:29,144
         I have heard
         a police officer say

1202
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,745
          "Chief, we need
          a new vehicle."

1203
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:34,049
  He'd say "All right, go out,
  find a drug dealer
  and seize one."

1204
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:37,385
    And so they literally
    try to find this property.

1205
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,722
              If I found
              100,000 dollars
              drug money,

1206
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:45,060
    that paid my salary
    for a year, auto expenses,
    dog expenses,

1207
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:47,695
         whatever it took
         to keep me on board,

1208
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,597
         everything after that
         was profit.

1209
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,101
       The same problem
       comes up with regard
       to police corruption.

1210
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:57,572
       You go out in the field
       and you will see
       a stack of cash.

1211
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,276
  So you just lift
  maybe 10, 20, 30, 40 dollars
  off the top

1212
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:02,510
         and nobody notices,

1213
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,446
 and of course
 there's no accounting anyway,

1214
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,481
    so next time you will lift
    maybe a hundred.

1215
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,416
             If I found
             a stash of money,

1216
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,718
          I'd take a couple
          hundred bucks,

1217
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,288
        stick it in my pocket
        and then turn it in.

1218
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,590
        I'm not proud of that.

1219
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,759
    NARRATOR:
     <i>Between 2000 and 2003,</i>

1220
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:21,129
   <i>the Department of Justice</i>
   <i>earned over</i>
   <i>one billion dollars</i>

1221
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:22,430
    <i>in forfeiture proceeds.</i>

1222
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,200
    <i>By 2008,</i>
    <i>that number had tripled.</i>

1223
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,769
      <i>By the time</i>
      <i>Clinton left office,</i>

1224
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:32,607
    <i>High school students'</i>
    <i>use of methamphetamines</i>
    <i>had doubled.</i>

1225
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,810
     <i>And heroin and cocaine</i>
     <i>were cheaper and purer</i>
     <i>than they were</i>

1226
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:38,880
    <i>when the first drug laws</i>
    <i>were passed in 1914.</i>

1227
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:42,851
  The war on drugs
  is not winnable,
  but it's eminently fundable,

1228
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:45,587
  and the government
  is addicted to that funding.

1229
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,722
OFFICER: You know,
the worst thing
about this drug war,

1230
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:51,292
   it just ruined this job.

1231
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,861
         You know I began
         as a police reporter,

1232
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,630
     somebody very sympathetic
     to good police work,

1233
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,465
    and I still am sympathetic
    to good police work.

1234
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,602
     But I have no regard
     for the drug war anymore.

1235
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,704
     If you're a fan of
     the HBO series  <i>The Wire,</i>

1236
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,606
       you see this emphasized
       over and over again,

1237
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:07,208
       that it's all about
       statistics and numbers.

1238
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,677
 NARRATOR:
  <i>Radley Balko is a journalist</i>
  <i>who spent years</i>

1239
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,681
  <i>studying the effects</i>
  <i>that federal drug money</i>
  <i>has had on law enforcement.</i>

1240
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,750
        You need to make
        as many drug arrests
        as possible,

1241
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:19,354
    and that's how
    you get your grant
    in the federal government.

1242
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,156
     NARRATOR:
      <i>If you're running</i>
      <i>a police department,</i>

1243
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,790
      <i>you don't get</i>
      <i>massive grant money</i>

1244
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:26,394
   <i>for solving murder cases,</i>
   <i>or rapes, or theft.</i>

1245
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:30,165
   <i>Your only</i>
   <i>major financial incentive</i>
   <i>is to solve drug crimes,</i>

1246
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,901
     <i>and if you don't make</i>
     <i>the same drug arrests</i>
     <i>as last year,</i>

1247
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:35,370
  <i>you won't get</i>
  <i>the same budgets this year.</i>

1248
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,373
    And yet, all you're doing
    is making
    meaningless street arrests

1249
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,642
     that have no consequence.

1250
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:46,781
 NARRATOR:  <i>This incentivizes</i>
  <i>police departments to set up</i>
  <i>specialized SWAT teams</i>

1251
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,484
     <i>so police can conduct</i>
     <i>more drug raids.</i>

1252
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,754
  <i>And the U.S. government</i>
  <i>will provide money</i>
  <i>for SWAT equipment as well.</i>

1253
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:56,858
   No-knock raids
   are some of the most cruel,
   horrible tragedies

1254
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,395
    <i>a human can go through</i>
    <i>because it's so terrifying.</i>

1255
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:04,632
 I raided over 100 houses
 in my law enforcement career.

1256
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,969
      <i>There'd be 15 of us</i>
      <i>in all this riot gear,</i>

1257
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:11,206
     <i>and the biggest, fanciest</i>
     <i>guns we could get.</i>

1258
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,274
       I was always the guy
       who kicked the door in,

1259
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:14,943
      'cause I was
      the most aggressive one.

1260
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:20,949
   And we threw flash grenades
   in the window to confuse
   everybody.

1261
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:27,622
     <i>The one that really</i>

1262
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,594
         I remember
         a blonde-headed girl
         with blue eyes,

1263
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,762
          like my daughter's,

1264
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:40,335
        and it almost seems
        like it was one
        of my daughters now.

1265
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:44,405
     <i>And uh, she had a brother,</i>
     <i>and they were so scared.</i>

1266
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,342
       POLICE OFFICER:
       Don't move,
       you understand?

1267
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,677
  MAN: Did you shoot my dog?

1268

      MAN: Did you shoot
      my fucking dog?

1269
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,915
 (FAMILY YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

1270
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,424
  MAN: Why did you do that?

1271
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,661
     And we ripped that family
     apart for a bag of pot?

1272
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,266
      Sometimes people feed
      them wrong information,

1273
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:12,867
        sometimes it's just
        an accident,

1274
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:16,971
       where they read,
       instead of "863"
       they read "868"

1275
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:21,676
And when they got to the house
of the former marine,
Jose Guerena,

1276
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:24,812
he had already
been alerted by his wife
that someone was outside,

1277
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,447
so he grabbed his rifle.

1278
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,850
But before Guerena
could remove the safety
from his rifle,

1279
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:32,453
he was greeted by
more than 60 bullets
from law enforcement.

1280
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,623
The SWAT team refused
to let anyone attend
to Guerena,

1281
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,492
leaving no hope
for him to survive.

1282
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,961
     We've raised a generation
     of cops in Baltimore

1283
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,363
   who can make a drug arrest,
   but can't do police work.

1284
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,931
       You don't know
       how to use an informant

1285
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,700
            and not be used
            by an informant.

1286
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:48,503
You don't know how to write
an intelligent search warrant,

1287
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:51,673
     you don't know how to
     retroactively investigate
     a crime,

1288
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:54,008
you don't understand
how to maintain a crime scene.

1289
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,878
     All the things that count
     as quality police work,

1290
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,515
   that's a direct consequence
   of the drug war that
   nobody thought about.

1291
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:04,585
    NARRATOR:  <i>In the 1980s,</i>
     <i>there were about 3,000</i>
     <i>SWAT raids a year.</i>

1292
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:08,856
    <i>Today, that number is</i>
    <i>estimated at around 50,000</i>
    <i>SWAT raids a year.</i>

1293
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:13,561
   <i>Most serving warrants on</i>
   <i>non-violent drug offenders.</i>

1294
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:16,364
   These raids gone wrong
   are actually pretty common.

1295
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:18,933
   <i>They happen, by my estimate,</i>
   <i>a few times a week,</i>
   <i>across the country.</i>

1296
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:24,839
   <i>when narcotics officers</i>
   <i>knocked down the door</i>
   <i>at her home on Neal Street,</i>

1297
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,774
     <i>and then opened fire.</i>

1298
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:33,481
  <i>a 68-year-old grandfather</i>
  <i>of 12 was killed in his home</i>
  <i>in Framingham, Massachusetts.</i>

1299
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,416
      NARRATOR:
       <i>While drug war money</i>
       <i>has financed</i>

1300
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:39,554
    <i>an unprecedented expansion</i>
    <i>of U.S. law enforcement,</i>

1301
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:43,758
     <i>the bulk of drug money</i>
     <i>has continued to flow</i>
     <i>outside U.S. borders</i>

1302
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,461
   <i>and into the pockets</i>
   <i>of true masters of the game.</i>

1303
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:13,921
As a cartel drug lord,
your biggest problem is going
to be counting your money.

1304
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:16,991
   <i>But you'll have a few guys</i>
   <i>hired to do that.</i>

1305
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:21,028
   <i>And a few more guys to count</i>
   <i>your mansions, houses,</i>
   <i>planes, boats, luxury cars,</i>

1306
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:24,399
     <i>and all the material</i>
     <i>possessions you could</i>
     <i>possibly dream of.</i>

1307
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,502
    <i>Like all the kings</i>
    <i>and emperors before you,</i>

1308
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:30,438
      <i>you too will have</i>
      <i>your very own army.</i>

1309
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,509
  <i>Driving around in custom</i>
  <i>made tanks designed by top</i>
  <i>military equipment engineers.</i>

1310
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:40,982
   <i>and too many of your men</i>
   <i>find themselves in prison,</i>

1311
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:45,553
you just send a couple hundred
of your best guys down there
and get them out of jail.

1312
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:48,089
    <i>The guards won't stop you.</i>

1313
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:51,859
      <i>Anyone you perceive</i>
      <i>as being a threat,</i>
      <i>you send a message.</i>

1314
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:53,661
  <i>You chop off people's heads.</i>

1315
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,964
      <i>You roll those heads</i>
      <i>into nightclubs</i>

1316
01:13:56,966 --> 01:14:02,036
or pile them up and hang
their bodies from bridges to
keep your competition in line.

1317
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:06,674
       <i>As a cartel drug lord,</i>
       <i>you kill anybody</i>
       <i>who gets in your way,</i>

1318
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,743
       <i>literally gunning</i>
       <i>down civilians,</i>

1319
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:10,978
      <i>as long as</i>
      <i>you hit your target.</i>

1320
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,715
  <i>You'll be so used to killing,</i>
  <i>nothing will faze you</i>
  <i>anymore.</i>

1321
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:22,223
    <i>Since 2006, over 50,000</i>
    <i>people have been murdered</i>
    <i>in Mexico's war on drugs.</i>

1322
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:25,026
       <i>Most of those cases</i>
       <i>remain unsolved.</i>

1323
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:28,496
   <i>Not because you're</i>
   <i>careful about covering up</i>
   <i>your crimes,</i>

1324
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:30,565
    <i>but because you terrify</i>
    <i>the police.</i>

1325
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:35,203
     What happens when
     you as a public official,
     or a police chief,

1326
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:38,973
        receive an envelope
        with photographs
        of your family?

1327
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,843
      It won't take you long
      either to resign,

1328
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:44,212
         or to go along
         with their wishes.

1329
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:48,549
       The cartels have more
       money and more guns
       than the police do.

1330
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:50,518
         In a lot of ways,
         that doesn't make
         any difference

1331
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,019
       because the police
       are on their payrolls,

1332
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,856
        but where they're not,
        they can literally
        outgun the police.

1333
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,793
  NARRATOR:
   <i>To run a global company,</i>

1334
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:00,995
      <i>you need operatives</i>
      <i>all over the world.</i>

1335
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,832
    <i>An international work force</i>
    <i>rivaling any other</i>
    <i>Fortune 500.</i>

1336
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,268
      <i>So where do you find</i>
      <i>your employees?</i>

1337
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:10,071
   <i>Like business school does</i>
   <i>for our corporate leaders,</i>

1338
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:12,173
       <i>jails are like</i>
       <i>the ultimate job fair</i>

1339
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,776
for gangs, dealers, hitmen,
and other criminals for hire.

1340
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:18,646
     HARRIEL:  <i>We was in there</i>
      <i>beating people up,</i>
      <i>robbing people.</i>

1341
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:21,249
     I almost killed a guy.
     I beat him so bad
     that I almost killed him.

1342
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:23,518
    SKIPP:  <i>You know, tensions</i>
     <i>are high at all times.</i>

1343
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,986
        If it's not between
        the Bloods and Crips,

1344
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:27,121
      it might be between
      the blacks and Latinos,

1345
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,957
or might be between
the prison guards and inmates.

1346
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:33,094
    80% of the guys
    in there don't have
    a high school diploma,

1347
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:37,098
   <i>So if you have no one</i>
   <i>to show you what manhood is,</i>

1348
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,133
  you'll be just like
  the sharks just out there.

1349
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:45,907
  From 1920 to 1970
  the rate of incarceration in
  the United States was level.

1350
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:50,011
      <i>From the depression,</i>
      <i>World War II,</i>
      <i>the postwar boom,</i>

1352
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,282
    <i>the rate of incarceration</i>

1353
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:57,318
       <i>Public enemy number one</i>
       <i>is drug abuse.</i>

1354
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,222
  STERLING:  <i>In 1970,</i>
   <i>the rate of incarceration</i>
   <i>starts going up.</i>

1355
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:04,725
   <i>And it has not stopped</i>
   <i>going up for a half century.</i>

1356
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,063
    NARRATOR:
     <i>Only 5% of the world</i>
     <i>is American.</i>

1357
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:12,900
    <i>But today,</i>
    <i>America has 25%</i>
    <i>of the world's prisoners.</i>

1358
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:16,137
 GRAY:
  <i>The United States of America,</i>
  <i>the land of the free,</i>

1359
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:19,073
        leads the world in
        the incarceration
        of our people.

1360
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:24,645
     And incarcerate them
     at levels unheard of
     in the rest of the world.

1361
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:29,050
NARRATOR:
No other nation comes close.
Not China, not Russia, nobody.

1362
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,651
          There are only
          two explanations,

1363
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:33,788
         one is that
         we are uniquely evil,

1364
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:38,059
       and the other is that
       we have uniquely
       counterproductive laws.

1365
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:41,028
    NARRATOR:  <i>And while</i>
     <i>the prison population</i>
     <i>continues to grow,</i>

1366
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,731
  <i>the demand for illegal drugs</i>

1367
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,975
  <i>50% of America has consumed</i>
  <i>an illegal drug.</i>

1368
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,243
   <i>Do they think they can lock</i>

01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,713
   <i>There's just no stopping us.</i>

1370
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,881
           Everybody I know
           wants to do drugs
           is doing them.

1371
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:03,150
     They don't care
     if it's legal or illegal,
     they're doing them.

1372
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:08,089
    <i>Some of America's</i>
    <i>most famous business</i>
    <i>leaders, like Steve Jobs,</i>

1373
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:12,693
has said taking LSD
was one of the most important
experiences of his life.

1374
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:18,699
    I don't think it's as much
    a question about drugs
    as it's about freedom.

1375
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:20,768
           Whatever this
           freedom word means,

1376
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,004
            we really gotta
            grab hold of that.

1377
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,874
       <i>Either we have</i>

        <i>or we're not living</i>
        <i>in a free country.</i>

1380
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:36,117
 I'm just horrified by the way
 that we think of people

1381
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:38,719
    because of the choice
    of substance that they
    put in their bodies

1382
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,254
  to alter their perception.

1383
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,857
       And we judge them
       as good or bad,

1384
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:46,827
 while we sip our wine
 and have our cocktail parties

1385
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,396
         and you know...

1386
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:51,732
 Stick that hypocrisy right up
 society's ass for me.

1387
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:55,936
Some of them can kill you
the first time you try them
and other ones are really fun.

1388
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,938
And someone's lying to you
if they say they're not.

1389
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:02,109
  Our own power as individuals
  over our own bodies,
  our thoughts,

1390
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:05,379
       our minds, our ideas,
       and our feelings,

1391
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:08,149
        those are not things
        that can be taken away
        from us.

1392
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:12,019
   And anybody who would allow
   the state to take them away

1393
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,822
     doesn't deserve the title
     "American citizen."

1394
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,459
NARRATOR:  <i>The vast majority</i>
<i>of drug dealers never make it.</i>

1395
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:20,995
      <i>They're either killed,</i>
      <i>or wind up in prison.</i>

1396
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:23,230
      <i>But Americans just keep</i>
      <i>demanding more drugs.</i>

1397
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:28,169
MAN:  <i>Approximately half</i>
<i>a million Americans are</i>
<i>incarcerated on drug charges.</i>

1398
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:31,005
        In recent years
        we've spent more money
        building new prisons

1399
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:36,444
    <i>And they are beneficiaries,</i>
    <i>the people who manage</i>
    <i>these prisons,</i>

1400
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:39,013
     <i>the prison guards' unions,</i>

1401
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:42,249
      they all have a vested
      interest in perpetuating
      this broken system.

1402
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:45,486
NARRATOR:  <i>And famous</i>
<i>American freedom advocates</i>
<i>have been speaking for years</i>

1403
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,722
      <i>about the conflict of</i>
      <i>interest for politicians.</i>

1404
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,493
   Are you running for office,
   and you need more dough?

1405
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:55,062
            Adopt a tough
            on crime position,

1406
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,399
     you'll get a lot of money
     from the prison industry.
     Think about it.

1407
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,174
  NARRATOR:  <i>But even</i>
   <i>the largest prison system</i>
   <i>in the history of the world</i>

1408
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:09,944
      <i>is just another market</i>
      <i>for drug dealers.</i>

1409
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:12,146
There are drugs inside jail.

1410
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:19,487
Oh, you can find weed, coke,
crystal meth, ecstasy.
Even heroin, you can find.

1411
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:23,257
  People work there,
  bring it over,
  or visitors.

1412
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,260
There's drugs inside jail.

1413
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,364
  NARRATOR:  <i>Congratulations.</i>

1414
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:35,369
      <i>you're the number one</i>
      <i>organized crime threat</i>
      <i>in the United States,</i>

1415
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:39,206
  <i>having set up franchises in</i>
  <i>over 1,000 American cities.</i>

1416
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:42,176
  <i>You have an operating budget</i>
  <i>larger than most countries.</i>

1417
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:47,548
  <i>You and your partners</i>
  <i>in crime make over</i>
  <i>150 billion dollars a year.</i>

1418
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,818
   <i>And business shows</i>
   <i>no signs of slowing down.</i>

1419
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,556
  <i>Because like any good game,</i>
  <i>the machine creates an</i>
  <i>endless supply of players.</i>

1420
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:58,993
  The government always says
  drugs are illegal,
  because they're bad for you,

1421
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,795
    and we're trying
    to protect societies,

1422
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:03,397
but the government doesn't
give a fuck about your safety.

1423
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:06,534
   The government,
   they don't want you
   to use your drugs,

1424
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:09,103
     they want you
     to use their drugs.

1425
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:13,107
      So every night on TV,
      you see a weird ass
      drug commercial

1426
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:16,477
 trying to get you hooked
 on some legal shit.

1427
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:21,549
 And they just keep
 naming symptoms till they
 get one that you fucking got.

1428
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:23,417
       I think once
       I took my first Vicodin

1429
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:27,254
       it was just like
       this feeling of, "Aah,"
       you know,

1430
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:31,458
     like everything
     was not only mellow
     but didn't feel any pain,

1431
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,928
               it didn't...
               It just kind of
               numbed things.

1432
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:38,032
   I don't know
   at what point exactly
   it started to be a problem,

1433
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:41,302
     I just remember liking it
     more and more.

1434
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:43,604
People tried to tell me
that I had a problem,

1435
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:45,372
   I would say, "Get that
   fucking person out of here,

1436
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,141
    "I can't believe
    they said that shit to me.

1437
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:48,442
        "They know nothing
        about my fucking life.

1438
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:50,177
           "Are they out of
           their fucking mind?

1439
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:54,882
"I'm not out there
fucking, you know,
putting coke up my nose,

1440
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:56,183
"I'm not smoking crack."

1441
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,853
         You're struggling
         with the argument of,

1442
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,855
 do you have a problem
 or do you not have a problem,

1443
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,489
            can you control it
            or can you not,

1444
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:05,025
       and I literally thought
       I could control it.

1445
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,927
NARRATOR:
And for one out of ten people,

1446
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:10,064
this is how easy it is to fall
into the hands of addiction.

1447
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:14,869
    I snorted OxyContin
    and I remember just
    falling down on that couch

1448
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:18,339
and just feeling euphoric,
and feeling that,

1449
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:21,942
   "This is how I should feel,
   this is how it should
   always be."

1450
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:24,245
         I had fun for a lot
         of those years.

1451
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:29,483
  But for five or six of them,
  every time I did it,
  it was a freaking nightmare.

1452
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,151
     NARRATOR:
      <i>Once you're addicted,</i>

1453
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:32,887
        <i>the drugs become</i>
        <i>interchangeable.</i>

1454
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,623
    You're taking things
    that people are giving you

1455
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,591
      that you don't even know
      what the fuck they are.

1456
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:42,630
      They look like a pill
      and they're shaped like
      something that you take,

1457
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:44,331
             so you take it.

1458
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:48,202
      You know. Xanax, Valium,
      tomato, tomahto.

1459
01:21:48,204 --> 01:21:50,104
         You know what I mean,
         it's the same thing.

1460
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:52,273
       All in the same family,
       fuck it, take it.

1461
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:55,042
     You know, OxyContin
     is very expensive,
     and I couldn't afford it,

1462
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:58,412
  so eventually a friend said,
  "Well, you can do heroin.

1463
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:02,983
"Heroin's a lot cheaper
and you can...
It's easier to get, actually."

1464
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:05,419
        And the cost was huge.

1465
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,988
         Beyond the price,
         beyond the dollar.

1466
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:12,426
I was doing too much cocaine,
becoming too paranoid.

1467
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,129
People started smoking it,
I started smoking it.

1468
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:22,102
  I was sweating,
  I was shitting,
  I was vomiting everywhere,

1469
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:26,040
 and, you know, I said,
 "I need to go to a hospital."

1470
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:29,310
        Had I have gotten
        to the hospital
        about two hours later,

1471
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:30,544
            I would have died.

1472
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:33,213
    Having my mom
    look over me crying,

1473
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,016
    over her little baby boy,
    in a hospital,

1474
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:39,153
     at 2:00 in the morning,
     I just felt like shit.

1475
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:42,056
My organs were shutting down,
my liver, kidneys, everything.

1476
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:43,657
       They were going to have
       to put me on dialysis.

1477
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,326
          They didn't think
          I was gonna make it.

1478
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:47,161
     My bottom was going
     to be death.

1479
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:49,430
         <i>Within a month,</i>
         <i>I had relapsed,</i>

1480
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,400
        and shot right back up
        to the same amount
        of pills I was taking.

1481
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,003
       I remember just walking
       around my house

1482
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:59,540
        and thinking
        every single day like,
        I'm gonna fucking die.

1483
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:03,143
  I'm looking at my kids
  and I need to be here
  for this.

1484
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,179
         It was everything
         that I loved.

1485
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:06,580
 And everything that loved me

1486
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:10,317
    was a price that I was
    willing to pay to do coke.

1487
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,986
    That's a horrible price.

1488
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,489
     <i>if they can't afford</i>
     <i>to support their habit,</i>

1489
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,426
   I think when you come
   from a poor family,
   you wanna do drugs,

1490
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:23,030
and drugs cost money,
and then you see a way out.

1491
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:25,733
  OxyContin is very expensive.
  And people keep calling you,

1492
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:27,534
  you know, people want drugs.

1493
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,203
        And it was hard
        not to give them it,

1494
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:32,373
      because I knew
      I could make 50 dollars
      just like that.

1495
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,642
  The day I ate LSD,
  the next day I sold LSD.

1496
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,379
The day I did cocaine,
the next day I sold cocaine.

1497
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,314
The day I shot drugs,
I was selling dope.

1498
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,183
      I never meant to get
      in the dope business.

1499
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,519
        That wasn't my plan.

1500
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,688
 But it just started that way.

1501
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:51,392
Eventually I would make
my way to a Narcotics
Anonymous meeting

1502
01:23:51,394 --> 01:23:54,795
and a kid was reading
"What is an addict"
and it said very simply,

1503
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:58,665
"An addict is a man or a woman
whose life is controlled
by drugs,

1504
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:01,635
"in one form or another,
the getting and using,

1505
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,104
"and finding ways
and means to get more."

1506
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:06,607
And I heard that,
and a light went on
in my head.

1507
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:10,044
I knew I was an addict
for the first time in my life.

1508
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,346
When people asked me,
"What's wrong with you?"

1509
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:19,386
   Coming off of everything,
   I literally was up 24 hours
   a day for 3 weeks straight.

1510
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:25,392
     And I mean, not sleeping,
     not even nodding off
     for a fucking minute.

1511
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:29,530
Like I was literally just up,
looking at the TV.

1512
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,432
               I had to regain
               motor skills,

1513
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,534
               I had to regain
               talking skills.

1514
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:37,704
It's been a learning process,
like, it's been...
I'm growing.

1515
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:41,108
I just couldn't believe
that anybody could be
naturally happy

1516
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:45,312
  or naturally function or be
  enjoying life in general
  without being on something.

1517
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:51,652
     So I would say to anybody
     it does get better,
     you know.

1518
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:53,554
             It just, it does.

1525

drug cartels have an

   <i>The number one</i>

1528

   <i>the quickest way to relapse</i>

1530

1534
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:04,625
and they know the secret
approach that could threaten
the entire addiction market.

1535
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:09,296
I'm Patrick Reynolds.
My grandfather founded the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

1536
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,934
     <i>My only memories of my dad</i>
     <i>were of a man dying</i>
     <i>from smoking.</i>

1537
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:20,641
     <i>Tobacco is killing more</i>
     <i>than a combined total</i>
     <i>of all the murders,</i>

1538
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,543
       <i>all the drugs,</i>
       <i>all the suicides,</i>

1539
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,444
and all car accidents
combined.

1540
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:29,249
     Throw AIDS in,
     tobacco is killing
     more than the total.

1541
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:31,218
        If tobacco
        were banned tomorrow,

1542
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:35,522
         and the DEA was going
         to come after you
         for smoking,

1543
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,659
      the first thing it would
      do is it would make it
      really cool to kids.

1544
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:41,929
             We'd have a black
             market tobacco,

1545
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:45,766
        there would be tobacco
        probably manufactured
        in Mexico,

1546
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:49,736
        or some other country
        and imported...
        They'd find their way.

1547
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,206
         We know what works
         for fighting tobacco.

1548
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,675
Smoking bans in public places,

1549
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:58,679
       <i>high tobacco taxes,</i>

1554
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:16,563
That was tried in Portugal,
which had a huge drug problem,

1555
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:23,804
   <i>NBC sent reporters to</i>

         GIRLS: No, never.

1566
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:55,802
    If you read the research,
    you clearly and quickly
    come to realize

1567
01:27:55,804 --> 01:28:00,407
     I think for too long
     we probably thought

   or solve it through some
   criminal justice lens,

1570
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:09,950

     The DEA don't want
     the drug problem to stop.

 District attorneys don't want

    selling me cigarettes in
    there for 50 cents a pack.

1583

   Don't make sense, does it?
   Didn't to me. Didn't to me.

      <i>in Los Angeles,</i>

1586
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:16,516
 You know, it's just the money
 is so stupid that everybody's
 a part of the problem,

         unless I know better.

1591

      when individuals ask me
      for a job,

1592
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:39,506
            I understand that
            nine out of ten,

1593
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:45,645
It's just what they're sayin'.
But they're gonna revert back
to what comes easiest.

1594
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:48,148
    The current takes the path
    of least resistance.

1595
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:53,053
      So, what's the easiest,

1620
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,561
       It's perhaps heroic,
