00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:15,854
Gentlemen,
I want you to meet my daughters,

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,791
Marie Louise Pauline,

4
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:19,426
Marie Louise Jeanne,

5
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:20,994
and from my first marriage,

6
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:23,163
Marie Delphine Lopez.

7
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,931
But everyone calls her Borquita.

8
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,883
What they may lack
in outer beauty,

9
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:29,719
they more than make up for
with their many talents.

10
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:32,105
Borquita is a huge help to me
with the domestics.

11
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:35,275
While Jeanne excels
in petit point.

12
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:37,360
My youngest, Pauline,

13
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:40,897
well, her major talent
has yet to reveal itself.

14
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:44,151
Perhaps my talent
is in the boudoir,

15
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:45,368
Mother dear.

16
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,706
I guess we'll find out on your
wedding night, <i>mon petit.</i>

17
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,495
<i>Mon cherie.</i>

18
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:29,996
When the blood dries,

19
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:33,166
my skin is supposed to
be tight as a drum.

20
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:36,002
Just look at this wattle.

21
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:41,241
This blood's not fresh.

22
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,926
Borquita!

23
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,878
<i>S'ak pase'w la?</i>

24
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:49,099
<i>Mon cherie,</i> something happened
during the dinner party.

25
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,421
Stupid slut!

26
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,357
I invite all
the eligible bachelors

27
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:00,593
just to meet you and you...

28
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:03,697
spread your filthy legs for the houseman!

29
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,566
You might as well rut
with the family dog!

30
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:08,568
You can't control me, Mother.

31
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,653
The hell I can't!

32
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:10,987
The <i>hell</i> I can't.

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,623
You know what we're going
to say?

34
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,992
We're going to say
he took you by force.

35
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:18,078
Like the savage he is.

36
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,297
No, ma'am, I did no such thing.

37
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,249
Yes, that's what happened.
Miss Pauline came on to me.

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,551
And I told her
I belong to someone else.

39
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,920
Keep that mongrel quiet.

40
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,509
Haul him upstairs.

41
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,928
No. No. No.

42
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:41,634
Bonsoir, my pets.

43
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,970
Did y'all miss me?

44
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,274
Hush up.

45
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:50,694
Or I'll rip your lips open
and stuff more shit in there.

46
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,664
Why?

47
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:55,909
Why are you doing this to us?

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,834
Because I can?

49
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:00,453
Oh...

50
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:03,957
Now we gonna have
flies up here.

51
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:07,961
There.

52
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,096
That should do it.

53
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:11,298
Bastien.

54
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:14,851
You want to rut like a beast...

55
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,470
then we're going to treat you
like one.

56
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:21,224
Where's my pickaninny
with the head?

57
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:37,624
Put it on him.

58
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,309
Darling, you have
outdone yourself.

59
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,428
However did you think this up?

60
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,765
My great literacy began
with Greek mythology.

61
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,683
I used to sit on Daddy's lap

62
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:06,820
and he would read me
those stories

63
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:08,721
full of their vengeful Gods

64
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:12,575
and wondrous miraculous
creatures.

65
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,578
But the Minotaur was always
my favorite.

66
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:20,166
Half-man, half-bull.

67
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,402
And now...

68
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,588
I have one of my very own.

69

70
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,008
Are you sure about this?

71
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:56,933
Come on.

72
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,061
My mom gets home at 6:00.

73
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,230
It just sucks being
somebody's first.

74
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,149
I don't want to hurt you.

75
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,852
I'll be okay.

76
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,662
You okay?

77
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:59,171
Charlie?

78
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:04,043
Charlie?

79
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,077
Charlie, Charlie, what's wrong?

80
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:06,762
Charlie!

81
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:08,097
Charlie?!

82
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:17,803
<i>It's a cliche, but like</i>
<i>all cliches, it's the truth.</i>

83
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,436
<i>Your life can change overnight.</i>

84
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,221
<i>Or in a moment.</i>

85
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,076
<i>The official word on Charlie's</i>
<i>death was a brain aneurysm.</i>

86
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:29,079
<i>But the doctors had never seen</i>
<i>anything quite like it before.</i>

87
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:31,064
<i>The blood...</i>

88
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,866
<i>all that blood.</i>

89
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,085
It's not your fault, baby.

90
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,404
It's ours.

91
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:41,675
There's something I should have
told you a long time ago.

92
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:45,546
I prayed it would skip
your generation.

93
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:50,417
Your great-grandmother had
the same genetic affliction.

94
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,519
<i>So apparently I'm a witch.</i>

95
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,438
<i>It runs in my family,</i>
<i>but it doesn't show up</i>

96
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:56,807
<i>in every generation,</i>
<i>or in every girl.</i>

97
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:59,226
<i>Like my cousin Amanda,</i>
<i>she's just bulimic.</i>

98
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:03,096
<i>We read about the Salem Witch</i>
<i>Trials in, like, fifth grade.</i>

99
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,565
<i>Guess I should have paid</i>
<i>more attention.</i>

100
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,434
Hang her!
Drown her! Burn her!

101
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:09,269
Mercy Osbourne,

102
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,372
you have been sentenced
to death.

103
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,541
May God have mercy
on your wretched soul.

104
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,493
<i>Those girls weren't</i>
<i>even witches.</i>

105
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:18,898
<i>The real witches were cunning</i>
<i>and careful not to be caught.</i>

106
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,666
<i>In fact after that, they got</i>
<i>the hell out of Dodge.</i>

107
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:23,801
<i>They fled.</i>

108
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:26,086
<i>As far South as they could.</i>

109
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:31,141
<i>That's how eventually New</i>
<i>Orleans became the new Salem.</i>

110
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:33,344
<i>There's a school there.</i>

111
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:36,730
A boarding school
for girls like you.

112
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,066
You'll be safe.

113
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,151
You're sending me away?

114
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:43,136
<i>I'm sorry, baby.</i>

115
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,605
We can't keep you here anymore.

116
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:45,989
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

117
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,945
What's going on?

118
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,914
Mom, what's going on?
What is this?

119
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,982
Mom! Mom...
No, what is this?!

120
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,668
Mom...

121
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,653
Mom!

122
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:04,341
We'll handle it from here.

123
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:06,927
Can't I drive her
to the station?

124
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,929
She's our daughter now, Nora.

125
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,997
You've done all you can.

126
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,967
A long good-bye would
only make things worse.

127
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:17,170
By the way, these drapes.

128
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,773
I'm just <i>mad</i> for tartan.

129
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,513
Hello?

130
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:41,138
Hello?

131
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:44,775
Hello?

132
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,660
O dark father,
we offer this flesh up to you,

133
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,129
blood, life, and all.

134
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,831
Get the hell off me!

135
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,334
Jesus,

136
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,186
Sabrina, relax.

137
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:04,438
We're just messing with you.

138
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:06,640
Holy shit. Are you...

139
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,192
Madison Montgomery, movie star.

140
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,528
Shit. When's the last time
you made a movie, girl?

141
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:12,846
I'm Nan. Hi.

142
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:13,947
Zoe.

143
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:14,781
Queenie.

144
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,283
So bored now.

145
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,734
So, is this all of you?

146
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,686
At the moment.

147
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:25,158
Cordelia Foxx, headmistress.

148
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,160
All right, girls,
there's a van full

149
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,079
of groceries in the driveway
that needs unloading.

150
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:30,664
I'll show Zoe to her room.

151
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,382
Then we meet
for Midday Gathering.

152
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:33,584
Let's go.

153
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,260
<i>Miss Robichaux's Academy
for Exceptional Young Ladies</i>

154
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:45,596
<i>was established as a premiere</i>
<i>girls' finishing school</i>

155

<i>into a military hospital.</i>

158
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,986
<i>Afterwards, it came under</i>

159
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:56,239
<i>new management. Our management.</i>

160
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:59,392
<i>In 1868, Marianne Wharton,</i>

165
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,620
the reigning Supreme
of that time--

166
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,539
<i>purchased this facility,</i>
<i>retaining the name as a cover,</i>

167
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>establishing a safe haven</i>

168
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,345
<i>where young witches</i>
<i>could gather to learn.</i>

169
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:20,097
<i>In its heyday,</i>

170
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:23,934
<i>the academy was home</i>
<i>to as many as 60 girls.</i>

171
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:26,252
<i>Over the years,</i>
<i>those numbers dwindled.</i>

172
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,021
<i>Why?</i>

173
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,057
We're a dying breed, Zoe.

174
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,192
Many of the families who knew
they carried the bloodline

175
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,277
made a choice not to reproduce.

176
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:36,113
So, what's a Supreme?

177
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:39,265
An average witch is born
with a few natural gifts.

178
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,568
But in each generation
there is one woman

179
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,870
who embodies countless gifts.
Some say...

180
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,438
all of them.

181
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,040
She is the Supreme.

182
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:48,291
Are you the Supreme?

183
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,879
No.

184
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,381
I'm like you.

185
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,249
Just a witch.

186
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,803
And a teacher. I'm here to help
you identify your gifts

187
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,388
and teach you how
to control them.

188
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,973
She means to suppress them.

189
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:04,641
Not suppression.

190
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,126
Control.

191
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,678
She thinks it's still
the 1600s.

192
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,795
No. Back then,

193
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:12,099
our kind understood the dangers.

194
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,019
<i>Today, so many families know</i>
<i>nothing of their ancestry.</i>

195
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:19,072
<i>Too many girls aren't</i>
<i>lucky enough to have found us</i>

196
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,159
<i>or weren't identified in time</i>
<i>for us to have found them.</i>

197
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:23,944
<i>Like that poor Cajun girl</i>

198
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,496
<i>just outside Lafayette</i>
<i>a few months back.</i>

199
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,782
<i>Misty Day.</i>

200
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,001
<i>She wasn't much older</i>
<i>than any of you.</i>

201
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:32,786
<i>And she had a gift,</i>

202
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:35,539
<i>the power of resurgence.</i>

203
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,760
<i>Misty could reach</i>

204
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:41,795
<i>into that place</i>
<i>between life and death</i>

205
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:44,131
<i>and draw a soul back</i>
<i>from the precipice,</i>

206
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,499
<i>back to this side,</i>
<i>back to life.</i>

207
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,018
It's dark magic!

208
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:49,970
<i>To some, this appeared to be</i>

209
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,722
<i>the God-touched power</i>
<i>of resurrection.</i>

210
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:52,773
To cast you in

211
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,642
to darkness and sin!

212
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:58,511
<i>To others, necromancy.</i>

213
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:02,365
To cast you
into separation from God!

214
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:05,819
So what happened to her?

215
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,370
The same thing that's happened

216
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,906
to women like us
throughout the centuries.

217
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,541
Let me go!

218
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,860
Let me go!

219
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,727
It's you that will end
in flames.

220
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:32,397
I swear it!

221
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,023
We are under siege, ladies.

222
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:44,074
Our lives,

223
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:46,226
our very existence

224
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,994
is always at risk.

225
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:50,831
Know this or face extinction.

226
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,022
This is Allegra.

227
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,477
She is the equivalent of
a human female in her late 80s.

228
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:23,730
Allegra suffers
from acute bradycardia,

229
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:25,982
her kidneys are failing,

230
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,702
she's lost the ability
to swallow.

231
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,622
Allegra, in short, is dying.

232
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:36,877
Now, several hours
after this video was taken,

233
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:41,464
we injected Allegra
with our Serum RM47.

234
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,284
We expanded on the University
of Wisconsin studies

235
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,337
on induced pluripotent
stem cells.

236
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:51,141
Meet Allegra today.

237
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:01,067
I'll have what she's having.

238
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,403
And you will.

239
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,355
Sooner than you'd think.

240
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,942
We should be ready for
human trials in two years' time.

241
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:10,443
This afternoon.

242
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,295
Preferably

243
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:12,329
in the next half hour.

244
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:13,980
I have a dinner engagement.

245
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,148
I'm sorry, but, uh...

246
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,983
well, that's impossible.

247
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,485
I hear you like to get...

248
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,988
sauced
at biochemistry conventions

249
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,708
and brag about how you're gonna
win the Nobel Prize

250
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,343
for the work you're doing here,

251
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:29,596
research that has been
entirely funded

252
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:31,715
by my late husband's money.

253
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,433
I have made you rich,

254
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,936
soon to be famous.

255
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:39,522
I want that medicine.

256
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,442
I paid for it, and I want it.

257
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,977
Now.

258
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,012
You can't smoke in here.

259
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:51,117
Fiona...

260
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:54,321
you are a very beautiful woman.

261
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,189
But if you're just looking

262
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,958
for something cosmetic,

263
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,026
I can recommend
a plastic surgeon.

264
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,496
What I need...

265
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:06,883
is an infusion of vitality.

266
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:09,002
Of youth.

267
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,004
I want that drug, David,

268
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,590
and I want it now.

269
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:18,211
Even if I wanted to give it
to you, I couldn't.

270
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,230
What we do here is not magic.

271
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,384
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,464
Last night,
communities across the county

273
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:57,968
held candlelight vigils praying
for Misty's safe return.

274
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:00,270
However, sources close
to the family have declined

275
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,689
to comment on the fact
that authorities now believe

276
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:05,225
they have found the last known
location of the missing girl.

277
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:06,943
It is rumored that Misty Day

278
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:08,261
may have been burned
at the stake,

279
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,446
though no official statement

280
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,697
was released.

281
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,654
You made me leave my daughters'

282
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:19,956
violin recital early.
You've been

283
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,326
injecting me with your
shitor five days now

284
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:25,111
and nothing...

285
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:28,298
nothing has changed.

286
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,418
How do I know you're not
just shooting me up with some

287
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,920
sugar water?
I have risked my career

288
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,305
giving you these drugs.

289
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,124
They could kill you.
I could go to jail.

290
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,392
Double the dosage.

291
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,226
Pull our funding.

292
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,627
Give me more!

293
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,396
We are organic matter.

294
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,298
We are animals. We rot,

295
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:47,650
we die!

296
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,322
I will tender my resignation
in the morning.

297
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,410
No!

298
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,319
What is this?

299
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,038
How are you doing this?

300
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,013
Get away from...
get away from me!

301
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,561
No.

302
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:33,513
Please.

303
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,014
My children.

304
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,366
Don't be such a baby.

305
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:05,237
Hey, Jeeves. Can I get
some iceberg lettuce

306
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:06,604
with a side of blue cheese?

307
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:08,486
Girl, be nice to Spalding.

308
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:11,606
Poor bastard ain't got no tongue.
Is that true, Jeeves?

309
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,474
Did you use your tongue
for something wicked?

310
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,259
Or maybe you just suck
at going down.

311
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,930
Oh, come on, Jeeves.

312
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,232
Show us your stub!

313
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:22,817
Maybe we can put it to use!

314
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,003
So, new girl...

315
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:27,271
...what are you in for?

316
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:28,156
Her boyfriend.

317
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,407
Nan, shut up before you get

318
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,291
your ass in trouble.

319
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,444
Did you kill him?

320
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:36,247
No. It was an accident.

321
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:37,665
It was an accident, Zoe.

322
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,918
And you will find love again.

323
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:42,003
A strange and unexpected...

324
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:43,454
love.
Girl,

325
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:45,306
are you deaf or just stupid?

326
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:47,392
Tell us
about this accident.

327
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:51,429
And don't spare
all the gory details.

328
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,797
So, why are you here?

329
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,019
My agent staged an intervention.

330
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:00,021
Ever since my drunk and
disorderly, I get blamed

331
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:01,656
for all kinds of shit
that I didn't do.

332
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,491
But you did it.
You killed the man.

333
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:04,993
I get it, bitch,
you're clairvoyant.

334
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:09,197
Do you want to know
what happened?

335
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:12,834
Hi, boys. So glad
you all could come.

336
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,286
Gee, is it hot in here?
Cut, cut.

337
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:18,155
You're still not hitting your mark.
I'm using the space.

338
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,091
That's a light.
If you don't hit your mark,

339
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:21,342
that light can't hit you.

340
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:32,220
The light hit him just fine.

341
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,856
All he said was
"hit your mark."

342
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,275
Why don't you just
do the world a favor

343
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:39,727
and take an acting class,
you D-list,

344
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,446
Botox bimbo.

345
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:46,784
Ow!

346
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,786
Stop it, you bitch!

347
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,521
Stop what? I don't feel nothing.

348
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,073
I'm a human voodoo doll.

349
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:53,541
You like this?
Stop!

350
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,159
You're... you're gonna get
in trouble.

351
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,077
Queenie, stop!

352
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:00,298
I'll do it.

353
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:01,916
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

354
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,368
A walk?

355
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,504
Fine. I'm not hungry
anyway.

356
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,557
Like anyone believes that.

357
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,710
Well,

358
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,596
that was disturbing.

359
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,714
Given the choices around here,
it looks

360
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:18,232
like you're my new best friend.

361
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,387
Do you own any clothes that
don't come from the Gap?

362
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,389
Not really.

363
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,108
Why?

364
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,107
You can borrow something
of mine.

365
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:31,896
Frat party tonight.

366
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,247
Just got the tweet.

367
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,374
Ooh!

368
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:18,710
You dropped your cocktail.

369
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,964
I thought you were
in Switzerland.

370
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:24,465
L.A.

371
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,784
It's tragic. The
glamour's gone.

372
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:29,170
They put a shopping mall
on Sunset and Vine.

373
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:31,222
I don't have a broom.

374
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,008
That's ironic.

375
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:35,793
Los Angeles?

376
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:38,813
Why do you look so jet-lagged?

377
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,065
I happen to look wonderful.

378
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,316
Let me make you something.

379
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,484
It's a restorative

380
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,635
I've been experimenting with.

381
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:47,688
This will fix you right up.

382
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:50,992
Delia, with her
potions and powders.

383
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,326
You know, one of my greatest
disappointments in life

384
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:54,445
is that you never
fully realized

385
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:56,364
the extent of your power.

386
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:57,532
I've done pretty well.

387
00:25:57,616 --> 00:26:00,835
You are the only child
of the Supreme.

388
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,255
You have royal blood running in
your veins.

389
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:06,007
You could be ruling the world.

390
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:08,509
I like my little kingdom here,
thank you.

391
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,327
Yeah, well, your little kingdom
is a mess.

392
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,768
No! Oh...

393
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:18,803
You bitch.

394
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,471
It wouldn't have killed <i>you.</i>

395
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:22,640
Just put me in a coma
for a couple days?

396
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:25,359
Or weeks. Look, why don't
you just go away?

397
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:28,012
I don't want you here. How else
do you want me to say it?

398
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:29,864
You're still angry. I can tell.

399
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:31,616
My God, you are the Supreme.

400
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,622
I was just on this...
wonderful spiritual retreat

401
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:40,458
with Shirley
MacLaine in Sedona.

402
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:42,877
It was all about forgiveness.
You dumped me here.

403
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:44,695
You were sent
to an elite boarding school.

404
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:47,248
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

405
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,718
You know, I've often thought
that my big mistake with you

406
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:54,205
was waiting so long
before sending you away.

407
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:55,206
Enough.

408
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:56,674
Show yourself out.

409
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:58,392
No. I'm not going.

410
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:00,228
I'm staying.
I'm here to help you.

411
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:02,897
Do you know that not
50 miles from here

412
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:05,216
a young woman was
burned at the stake?

413
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:07,718
It's Salem all over again.

414
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,105
There is a storm coming.

415
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,941
And you are leaving
these poor girls

416
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:16,861
under your charge
completely unprepared for it.

417
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,996
I am aware of what's happening.

418
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:21,199
My entire teaching philosophy...

419
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,417
Has been an abject failure.

420
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:25,736
You teach them to cower.

421
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,955
And to hide in the shadows.

422
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,675
Well, there are no
shadows, not anymore.

423
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:33,511
Do you really think
with Twitter and Facebook

424
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:35,463
that a witch does
anything at all

425
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:38,516
she won't be videotaped
and turned into some...

426
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,185
viral freak show like a dog
who says "I love you"?

427
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,419
No, no, no.

428
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,088
This is my life.

429
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,090
You can't come in here
and piss all over it.

430
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,441
I will call the council.
Do.

431
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:48,976
Call the council.

432
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:50,978
And then you can explain to them

433
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:55,483
why you think it's a bad idea
for the Supreme to teach them.

434
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,368
When are you gonna die

435
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,603
and stop ruining my life?

436
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,580
I'm here.

437
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,216
I'm staying.

438
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:15,452
So why don't
we make the best of it?

439
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,748
<i>Okay, animals, all
right, let's listen up, okay?</i>

440
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:30,574
All right, we're gonna go over
a few ground rules, gents.

441
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:35,248
The no puke rule will be
strictly enforced.

442
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,239
I will not be drinking...
too much tonight,

443
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,804
so if I see any of you are
in danger of hurling in public,

444
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,645
I will send you back here
to the penalty box.

445
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:46,481
That also goes...

446
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:50,352
for public urination
and public exposure.

447
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:54,406
Believe me, Dalton, nobody's
interested in seeing your dick,

448
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:57,409
no matter how small it is!

449
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,911
Now, we're still on probation
for the slightly

450
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,813
misguided Blue Mooning episode,

451
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:04,366
and those pricks at the
administration are just looking

452
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,534
for a reason
to cut our balls off, guys.

453
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,171
So I will sacrifice one night
of a drunken stupor

454
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:13,324
so my brothers can live to party
another day!

455
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:16,828
The administration

456
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,763
can suck my cock!

457
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:20,632
Yeah!

458
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,717
One, two, one, two, three!

459
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,436
We are KLG!

460
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:25,937
One, two, one, two, three!

461
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:28,306
We are KLG!

462
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:45,874
Oh, my God,
that's Madison Montgomery.

463
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,877
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

464
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,745
That's prize tuna right there.

465
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,696
She's way out of your league.

466
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,714
What's a girl got to do

467
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:54,332
to get a drink around here?

468
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,334
Come with me.
Can't get a bite

469
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:58,753
if you don't dangle
your bait in the water.

470
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:20,468
Thought you looked thirsty.

471
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,088
Is that your superpower?

472
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:25,724
You can sense dehydration?

473
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:26,558
One of them.

474
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,009
Ah.

475
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,644
Frat boy, right?

476
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,896
I think frats are
full of fascists.

477
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,131
I don't mind being reduced

478
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,632
to a stereotype, but...

479
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:36,401
I'm on a scholarship.

480
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,153
My mom lives down in

481
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:40,405
the Ninth Ward. Besides,

482
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:42,407
didn't you come here with

483
00:31:42,474 --> 00:31:43,825
a movie star?

484
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:11,669
You want to be my slave tonight?

485
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,221
What's in it for me?

486
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,673
Are you stupid?

487
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:17,392
Slaves get nothing.

488
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:21,345
Now why don't you get me
another drink?

489
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,455
It's on.

490
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,513
Really? A finishing school?

491
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:57,315
Miss Robichaux's Academy
for Exceptional Young Ladies.

492
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:59,100
Wow.

493
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,236
I don't want to talk
about me anymore, okay?

494
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,605
You're the first hot girl
I ever met

495
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:05,323
who didn't want
to talk about herself.

496
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,070
There's got to be something
wrong with you.

497
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,363
I know. You have a boyfriend.

498
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:14,666
No, I don't.

499
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:19,671
Kyle, I like you.

500
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:21,172
But it's not gonna work out.

501
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,008
Have you seen Madison?

502
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:09,504
Hey, I can't find her anywhere.

503
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:11,556
What, you think she ditched you?

504
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,842
I'll look around upstairs.
Hang on.

505
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,231
Brush her hair back
so I can see her face.

506
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:23,902
What the hell are you doing?!

507
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,739
Get off her!
Wait your turn, man.

508
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:29,157
Are you out of your mind?!

509
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:40,151
Madison?

510
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:43,087
Shit!

511
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:44,155
Hey.

512
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,124
Madison, hey. Hey,

513
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:46,991
did they give you something?

514
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:55,666
Whoa, whoa.

515
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,218
It hurts.

516
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,970
Okay, look, stay here, okay?
I'm not gonna...

517
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:00,355
I'm not gonna
let 'em get away with this.

518
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:06,978
Give me the phone, Brener.
Eat shit, Kyle.

519
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:08,813
Give me the phone, Brener. That's evidence.
Eat shit, Kyle.

520
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:10,281
I'm calling the cops.

521
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,350
Hey, hey.

522
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,701
What's going on back there?
Get him off the bus.

523
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:15,069
Come on, man.
Stop. Stop.

524
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,454
All right, everybody shut up!

525
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:20,208
All right, everybody shut up!

526
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,210
First thing, delete the
videos from your phones.

527
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,214
We stick together.

528
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,224
Stop!

529
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:18,117
The Louisiana campus
is still in shock over

530
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:20,355
the tragic bus crash last night.

531
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:22,274
Nine members of the fraternity

532
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,576
Kappa Lambda Gamma
were on board.

533
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,662
Seven of the boys died
on the scene.

534
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:30,248
Two were rushed to Troost
Medical Center where they remain

535
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,950
in critical condition.
Officials

536
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:34,703
will not confirm the identities
of the deceased.

537
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:36,421
Hey, I was watching that!

538
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:38,573
Why? It's yesterday's news.

539
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:41,910
They got any Greek yogurt?

540
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:45,213
We have to tell
somebody what happened.

541
00:36:45,264 --> 00:36:47,683
The one I met-- Kyle--
Madison, he tried to stop it.

542
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,101
Shh.
Okay, and he was on that bus.

543
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:50,686
What are we talking

544
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:52,137
about? The college boys?

545
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:54,723
Taken in the prime
of their lives.

546
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:56,391
Such a tragedy.

547
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:58,694
Almost makes you want to cry,
doesn't it?

548
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:01,480
But, then, the world's not
gonna miss a bunch of assholes

549
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:04,149
in Ed Hardy T-shirts.
Who are you?

550
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,784
You know, I've got
to hand it to you.

551
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:08,704
A bus flip? That's not easy.

552
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:11,456
But you were a sloppy,
little witch bitch.

553
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,825
Go to hell, you stupid hag.

554
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:22,751
Say that.

555
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:25,804
Now, I've read all your files.

556
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,924
And you're never gonna become
great women of our clan

557
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:30,792
sitting around here at Hogwarts

558
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:34,062
under the confused instruction
of my daughter.

559
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,514
We're going on a field trip.

560
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:38,400
Jesus. Go change your clothes.

561
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,684
Wear something...

562
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:43,572
...black.

563
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:50,612
Where are we going?

564
00:37:50,663 --> 00:37:52,030
It's too hot.

565
00:37:52,115 --> 00:37:53,815
My freaking vagina is sweating.

566
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,483
To Popp Fountain.

567
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:58,253
A kind of holy place
for our order.

568
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,455
Back in the 1970s,

569
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:05,627
Mary Oneida Toups led
an alternative coven down here.

570
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:08,130
She and her sister witches
would gather there,

571
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:09,998
proudly and publicly,

572
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:12,434
very much in the spirit
of the times.

573
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,352
But it was damaged
during Katrina.

574
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:17,806
And the authorities used
this as an excuse to declare

575
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:20,976
this sacred space
a safety hazard.

576
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:23,145
- It's been closed off ever since.
- I don't

577
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,477
understand. What are we supposed
to do if we can't get in?

578
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:27,232
Tear the wall down.

579
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:29,818
When witches don't fight,
we burn.

580
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:31,486
This is seriously
the worst field trip ever.

581
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:34,039
Each one of you
has a unique gift, but

582
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:37,025
that's not nearly enough
to be a real witch.

583
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:38,860
And you're a real witch?

584
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:40,829
She's the Supreme.

585
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:43,882
You know that one--

586
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:48,086
she's smarter than all
of you put together.

587
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:50,889
<i>Help me.</i>

588
00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:55,844
<i>- Help me.</i>
<i>- The New Orleans Preservation</i>

589
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:58,597
<i>Foundation is proud to present</i>
<i>the haunted home tour</i>

590
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:00,381
of the notorious
Madame LaLaurie.

591
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:01,983
This very house,

592
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,052
the center of New
Orleans high society,

593
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:05,570
was also a place of

594
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,222
abject horror.
You want me to get her?

595
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:08,857
No.

596
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:10,725
Oh, excuse me. You can't just
barge in on the tour

597
00:39:10,776 --> 00:39:14,196
without purchasing a ticket.

598
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,914
You're giving us
a tour for free.

599
00:39:15,998 --> 00:39:17,532
For free. Of course.

600
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,085
The Code Noir,

601
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:22,838
a decree that dictated
the conditions of slavery,

602
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,756
did not exist on these grounds.

603
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:28,593
It was replaced by
the Madame's own code of terror.

604
00:39:28,678 --> 00:39:31,246
And the torture she inflicted
on her slaves would spawn

605
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:34,933
179 years of hauntings.

606
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:37,886
Wasn't this house owned
by the guy in <i>Face Off?</i>

607
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:40,922
Correct, the actor Nicolas
Cage was a previous owner.

608
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:43,308
Madame LaLaurie was
infamous for her vanity.

609
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:46,862
She fought the rigors
of age with a sacrament

610
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,697
<i>of expensive creams from Europe</i>

611
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,598
<i>and something else</i>
<i>far more exotic.</i>

612
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,070
Oh, I'm running out.
We gonna have to get some more.

613
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,571
No! Please

614
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:57,822
don't make me.
You think I want

615
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,541
to do this?!

616
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,648
You can blame your father
and his fresh-faced whore.

617
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:03,795
Unless you'd like to
split your inheritance

618
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,298
with an endless parade
of colored bastards.

619
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:28,270
<i>The secret ingredient
to the Madame's beauty ritual</i>

620
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:31,106
<i>was a poultice made</i>
<i>from human pancreas.</i>

621
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:34,776
This is the infamous chamber
of horrors.

622
00:40:34,827 --> 00:40:37,028
No flash photography, please.

623
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:41,416
The attic where Madame LaLaurie
inflicted heinous torture

624
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,335
upon her slaves.

625
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:45,620
And where she ultimately met

626
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,923
her own demise.

627
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:02,220
Get off my property!

628
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,856
I've heard that you are
in need of my services.

629
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:06,191
What could a Negress have
that I would ever want?

630
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,676
<i>Mo pélé Marie Laveau.</i>

631
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:11,229
I have the cure
for your husband's affliction.

632
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:14,316
His compulsion for young ladies.

633
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,684
I'll have you flogged
for your insolence!

634
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:18,286
A love potion

635
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:21,356
to ensure fidelity.

636
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:30,248
If the potion entrances as you
promise, your future's assured.

637
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,834
To our future together.

638
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:35,670
Salud.

639
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:38,039
Mmm.

640
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,392
It's like honeysuckle.

641
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:48,316
Oh.

642
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:51,019
Ooh.

643
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,439
Oh.

644
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:57,192
Ooh, yes.

645
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:00,228
Oh, no.

646
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:02,330
Oh, God!

647
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:03,415
What did...?

648
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:11,406
Get it...

649
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:14,075
Get it out of me.

650
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:17,846
<i>Unbeknownst to Madame
LaLaurie, a slave she had brutally</i>

00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,217
<i>and she came</i>
<i>to exact her revenge.</i>

653
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:39,100
Mo Cher,
what has she done to you?

654
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:53,114
The potion inflicted
its cruel justice, and she got

655
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:54,833
what she richly deserved.

656
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,785
But her body was never found.

657
00:42:57,194 --> 00:43:00,402
To this day, no one knows
the final resting place

658
00:43:00,522 --> 00:43:02,957
of Madame LaLaurie.

659
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:11,966
What do you hear?

660
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:15,186
The lady of the house.

661
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,163
Please. Please let it be him,
please.

662
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,869
It should have been you,
asshole!

663
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:53,912
It's the second door

664
00:44:53,963 --> 00:44:55,784
on your left down the hall.

665
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,510
Make sure you stack
'em vertically.

666
00:44:57,705 --> 00:44:59,256
I'm responsible for those girls.

667
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,924
What if something had happened?

668
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:03,043
Well, nothing did.
Where's Zoe Benson?

669
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:04,811
How would I know that?

670
00:45:06,264 --> 00:45:07,848
Oh, that's my taxi.

671
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:09,850
Here, darling.

672
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:12,686
Make sure you tip them
generously when they're done.

673
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:14,688
Where are you going?

674
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:16,573
Out. Don't wait up.

675
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:19,860
I have half a mind to enchant
the locks after you leave.

676
00:45:19,911 --> 00:45:22,329
Don't make me drop a house on you.

677
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:25,249
<i>When the levees broke,</i>

678
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,567
<i>the people</i>
<i>of New Orleans were tested.</i>

679
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:30,537
<i>Those who stayed,</i>
<i>stayed for a reason.</i>

680
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:33,674
<i>With that came a sense</i>
<i>of purpose and community.</i>

681
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:35,759
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>in a crisis.</i>

682
00:45:35,843 --> 00:45:38,795
<i>All the bullshit falls away,</i>
<i>and what's left is just</i>

683
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,012
<i>so raw and vulnerable.</i>

684
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:44,351
<i>It's agony to let</i>
<i>people see you so exposed.</i>

685
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:46,419
<i>It takes a huge amount</i>
<i>of trust,</i>

686
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:49,923
<i>and for most of us, that trust</i>
<i>was shattered long ago.</i>

687
00:45:49,974 --> 00:45:52,601
<i>But, like it or not,</i>
<i>we need each other.</i>

688
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:55,529
<i>And we need each other</i>
<i>desperately.</i>

689
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:57,397
<i>My mother was right.</i>

690
00:45:57,448 --> 00:45:59,566
<i>The world isn't safe</i>
<i>for a girl like me.</i>

691
00:45:59,617 --> 00:46:03,787
<i>But maybe I'm not safe</i>
<i>for the world, either.</i>

692
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:06,106
<i>And since I'll never be able</i>

693
00:46:06,157 --> 00:46:08,125
<i>to experience real love,</i>
<i>might as well</i>

694
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:10,051
<i>put this curse to some use.</i>

695
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:41,608
Excellent work, gentlemen.

696
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,860
Just set it down right here.

697
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:49,783
Well, I'd thank you,

698
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,821
but you're never gonna
remember any of this anyhow.

699
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,997
Come on, Mary Todd Lincoln.

700
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,249
I'll buy you a drink.

701
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:51,580
