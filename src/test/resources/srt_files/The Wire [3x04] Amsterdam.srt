1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:14,312
<i>And not only do we hear and appreciate</i>
<i>your input, but we are fully committed...</i>

2
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,449
<i>to giving 110% in our efforts</i>
<i>to fight this war against drugs...</i>

3
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,485
<i>and take back your streets.</i>

4
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,179
<i>But we can't do it alone.</i>

5
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,587
<i>So when you see illegal activity,</i>
<i>we need you to pick up the phone...</i>

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,853
<i>- and call it in so that we can get...</i>
- Man, that's bullshit!

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,758
<i>Please hold all your questions...</i>

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:34,027
I near wore out my phone
dialing 685-DRUG, and for what?

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,965
Those boys is back on the corner
the next damn day!

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,631
<i>The fact remains that</i>
<i>the Police Department can't do it alone.</i>

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,435
<i>We need your cooperation.</i>

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,569
My cousin Willy Gant cooperated.
He went downtown and testified.

13
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,677
- He deader than 2Pac today.
- Damn shame.

14
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,876
<i>Look, I know the problem</i>
<i>seems insurmountable...</i>

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,918
<i>but we are making progress.</i>

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,317
<i>Take a look at this chart.</i>

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,289
<i>This line here represents...</i>

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,688
<i>- I have the microphone, ma'am.</i>
- Let the woman speak.

19
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,424
My kids, they can't play outside no more.

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,997
Some nights, when we hear these pops...

21
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,468
- we got to sleep under our beds.
- Right on.

22
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,539
I come home from <i>work...</i>

23
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,264
I can't even get up my front steps...

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,536
'cause they're occupied
by the drug dealers.

25
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,803
That's right, you tell him!

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,677
Is that in that picture you got up there?

27
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,612
<i>I'm Major Colvin.</i>

28
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,358
<i>I apologize for giving you</i>
<i>the wrong impression tonight.</i>

29
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,223
<i>We mean no disrespect.</i>

30
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,363
<i>I know what's going on</i>
<i>in your neighborhoods.</i>

31
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,897
<i>I see it every day.</i>

32
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:43,401
<i>Ma'am, it pains me that you cannot enter</i>
<i>your own front door in safety...</i>

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,262
<i>and with dignity.</i>

34
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,262
<i>The truth is...</i>

35
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,135
<i>I can't promise you</i>
<i>it's gonna get any better.</i>

36
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,734
<i>We can't lock up the thousands</i>
<i>out there on the corners.</i>

37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,144
<i>There'd be no place to put them</i>
<i>even if we could.</i>

38
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:59,309
<i>We show you charts and statistics</i>
<i>like they mean something.</i>

39
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,522
<i>But you're going back</i>
<i>to your homes tonight...</i>

40
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,414
<i>we're gonna be in our patrol cars...</i>

41
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,585
<i>and them boys still gonna be</i>
<i>out there on them corners...</i>

42
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,323
<i>deep in the game.</i>

43
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,563
<i>This here is the world we got, people.</i>

44
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,572
<i>And it's about time</i>
<i>all of us had the good sense...</i>

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,365
<i>to at least admit that much.</i>

46
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,568
So, what's the answer?

47
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,914
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

48
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:34,180
<i>But whatever it is, it can't be a lie.</i>

49
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,586
First time I ever heard
a cop say something like that.

50
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,658
It's all yours, Sergeant.

51
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,386
As I was pointing <i>out...</i>

52
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,795
Who gave him a can of gasoline
and told him to put out the fire?

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,698
<i>- We are making progress...</i>
- Tommy Carcetti.

54
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,566
- Marla Daniels. I'm running for...
- Gonna take a run at Eunetta Perkins.

55
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,902
I know who you are.

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,775
I've seen you with Delegate Watkins
a couple of times already.

57
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,573
Well, Councilman,
this is not your home district.

58
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,081
What brings you to the West Side?

59
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,744
I got the Public Safety Subcommittee...

60
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,784
so here I am.

61
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,683
Anyway, good luck with Eunetta.

62
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,691
And welcome, Miss Daniels,
to the noble calling of public service.

63
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,091
<i>Further west in your neighborhoods...</i>

64
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,155
<i>the numbers of crimes against merchants</i>
<i>are way, way down.</i>

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,498
<i>We believe we're making significant...</i>

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,964
- What the hell was that?
- Tired of the bullshit.

67
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,200
Tired make you lose your mind?

68
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,288
So, what you need from Bubs?
I mean, exactly?

69
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,757
The lay of the land.

70
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,090
Who has what corners,
now that the Towers are down.

71
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,892
We wanna know what happened
to the Barksdale people, especially.

72
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,489
And this pay how much?

73
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,865
Let's treat it like a real job. Say $5 an hour.

74
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,437
$30 on a day, max.

75
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,234
That's less than minimum wage.

76
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,242
But there's no withholding, Bubs.
It's tax-free.

77
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,602
All right.
It feels good to be out here, you know?

78
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,203
I mean, gainfully employed.

79
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,010
- Thought your boy was coming, too.
- Johnny?

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,650
He don't think much of this here with y'all.

81
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,779
Besides, he happens to be...

82
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,381
one of the laziest white boys
to ever shit between two shoes.

83
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,983
Me, I've been working since I was a kid.

84
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,586
Yeah? What's your r�sum� read like, Bubs?

85
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,062
Just curious.

86
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,531
Well, I ain't claiming no payroll jobs, Kima.

87
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,932
It's been a while since I punched a clock.

88
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,470
When was that?

89
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,272
Long time ago.

90
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,770
Before I had a sheet.

91
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,436
Shit, I <i>was...</i> I was still clean.

92
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,075
I got one of those stock boy jobs...

93
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,945
one of those
"cheapest guys in town" stores.

94
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,015
Unloading appliances...

95
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,753
taking air conditioners and shit
out to the customers' cars.

96
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,355
Like that.

97
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,051
"How many you want?"

98
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,361
What happened?

99
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:41,991
I put a clock-radio in the trashcan one day,
trying to be cute, got caught.

100
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,233
I didn't even need a clock-radio.

101
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,033
See, that's me, though. Born fuck-up.

102
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,674
All right, you know what?

103
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,043
$5 an hour, $30 on the day.

104
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,645
That'll work.

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,253
And this here is
your "get out of jail free" card.

106
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,925
On this card
is my full name and phone number.

107
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,730
A police officer was shot in this
neighborhood a couple of weeks ago.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,094
You all know the incident
I'm speaking of, right?

109
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,571
I'm looking for the officer's gun.

110
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,941
A Glock 9...

111
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,646
which happened to misplace itself
during this incident.

112
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,342
Now, I don't care...

113
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,651
I don't care who has it now.

114
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,197
I just need it to find its way home.

115
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,004
Y'all don't happen to know a fellow
by the name of Peanut, right?

116
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:35,241
I didn't think so. Well, anyway, gentlemen,
you know, one hand washes the other.

117
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,842
You give me a good word on that gun and
I can make almost any charge disappear.

118
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,354
Any questions?

119
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,422
Huh?

120
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,189
Get them out.

121
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,156
Shit, I had to try something.

122
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,670
One each. One each.

123
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,240
Keep it moving. Little boys.
Yellow tops all day long. Right here.

124
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:17,152
All right, all right. Come and see him
and get that knockout shit, all right?

125
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,622
Much obliged. Good looking.

126
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,160
- Yo, he down across Fremont?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,455
Now we're on this side.

128
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,224
Oh, and Barksdale is down the way.

129
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,424
Got the red tops, y'all, red tops!

130
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,966
Spider bags here!

131
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,212
My nigga.

132
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,791
Yo, spider bags!

133
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,689
Come get the red tops, red tops!

134
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,229
- Major crimes unit.
- Look at that.

135
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,133
- It's <i>slowly...</i>
- He's not in right now.

136
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,807
- All right.
- To what do we owe the honor?

137
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,466
Just checking in.

138
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,872
Why? You got something going on?

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,380
Nothing too sexy.
Just pushing a case uphill...

140
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,848
inch by inch on Kintel Williamson...

141
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,712
our stated target.

142
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,477
We're working, too, Lester.

143
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,453
Yeah, on your own thing.

144
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,327
You even listening to me, McNulty?

145
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,416
I got a real case to bring in.

146
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,258
Fellow name of Stringer Bell.
You might have heard of him. I don't know.

147
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,424
You got a mouth on you, boy.

148
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,228
He's still out there, Lester.

149
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,962
He's got his corners, his money.

150
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,198
Fuck it. By now, for all you know,
he's got all that downtown real estate.

151
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,138
Motherfucker probably owns
half of Baltimore...

152
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,233
- without us even knowing it.
- That ain't the point.

153
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,074
Do you even know what happened
to all that real estate, Lester?

154
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,081
All that downtown property
Bell has title on?

155
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,644
Fuck, no.

156
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,050
He's probably laughing his balls off
right now. At you, me, Daniels, all of us.

157
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,886
You even pretending to speak
for anyone other than yourself, McNulty?

158
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,254
I'm speaking for the job.

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,260
You wanna talk about police work?

160
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,853
I was doing the job
when you was just dreaming on it.

161
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,091
Daniels was out there, too.

162
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,396
Now, you gonna fuck him
when he pulled you off a goddamn boat?

163
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,232
He's a boss. Fuck the bosses.

164
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,067
Maybe Daniels plays a few games
to get by...

165
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,506
but he's cost himself plenty
for the sake of the job!

166
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,176
He's earned some loyalty.

167
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,838
Fuck loyalty and fuck you, Lester.
I never thought I'd hear...

168
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,074
that chain-of-command horseshit
come out of your mouth.

169
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,550
Motherfucker, I've spent a lot of time
in a lot of weak units.

170
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,881
More than you.

171
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,788
Now, this here may not be perfect,
but it's a chance to be police.

172
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,450
Well, then be one.

173
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,558
You're not even worth
the skin off my knuckles, junior.

174
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,034
Jimmy, don't.

175
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,705
You put fire
to everything you touch, McNulty...

176
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,105
then you walk away while it burns.

177
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,040
I got nothing more to say to you.

178
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,373
Nothing.

179
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,111
And you...

180
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,443
I'm surprised at you, girl.

181
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,481
Daniels raised you from a pup.

182
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,923
Gotta get with Bubs.

183
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,603
Check on those fucking properties.

184
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,250
Well, Major Colvin, what do you think?

185
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,953
Well, it all sounds good.

186
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,320
But before I give you a final answer,
I need to speak with my wife.

187
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,893
I'm not talking about the position.

188
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,052
Your cheesecake.

189
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,331
The cheesecake's fine.

190
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,231
They bring it in from Michael's,
out on York Road.

191
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,828
It's got a little cinnamon in the crust.
None better.

192
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,274
Of course, I'd like to think
our offer's pretty damn good, too.

193
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,476
Excuse me while I go
to the little boys' room, gentlemen.

194
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,139
I need to tinkle.

195
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,748
Tinkle?

196
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,020
I never understood
why a grown-ass man gotta talk like that.

197
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,390
He need to take a piss,
whether he know it or not.

198
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,724
You'll get used
to these academic types, Bunny.

199
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,322
Especially when you get
that first paycheck.

200
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,369
I mean, 80 K is nothing to sneeze at
for a number-two security job.

201
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,632
Full bennies on top of your pension.

202
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,434
Yeah, it's generous.

203
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,874
And dull. In a good way.

204
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,239
I mean...

205
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,271
the worst you'll ever see is a rape.
A date rape, maybe.

206
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,648
You're ready to take it down a notch,
aren't you?

207
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,878
Hell, yes.

208
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,851
Yeah, that's how I felt.

209
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,348
My only regret was
that I didn't tell the Deputy Ops...

210
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,858
to stick it in his ass
on my way out the fucking door.

211
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,487
Hey, Johns Hopkins wants you, Bunny.

212
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,566
And they wanna pay Johns Hopkins money.

213
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,397
But what? You gotta ask your wife?

214
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,130
Oh, man, I ain't gotta ask her nothing.

215
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,605
I'm just letting Mr. Jenkins stew a little,
is all.

216
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,441
Wonder what's keeping him.

217
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,271
All he had to do was tinkle.

218
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,076
I guess he felt the need
to make a dookie, too.

219
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,283
They got corners up on Argyle...

220
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,660
and along Fremont up top.

221
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,230
Avenue corners belong to everybody.

222
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,893
Some who were with Barksdale,
and some independent-like.

223
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,200
McHenry Street got
some of Barksdale's people, too.

224
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,598
But Gangster Webster's crew
is right beside them.

225
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,177
What about the Lower Avenue corners
and the Poe Homes?

226
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,713
They belong to this young boy
named Marlo.

227
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,975
- Go by the name of Black.
- Marlo?

228
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,642
Young boy.

229
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,276
Got all that good real estate
near downtown.

230
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,753
Got himself the lunchtime trade.

231
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,791
If Bell and Barksdale
were gonna hold anything...

232
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,417
they'd hold on
to the Homes and Avenue corners.

233
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,927
Marlo one of Barksdale's people?

234
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,395
Marlo what?

235
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,335
Come on,
you got anything else on this guy?

236
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,462
You got another tip, maybe?

237
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,198
So much for the hourly wage.

238
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,768
107M703. Yeah.

239
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,878
That's the tag on the truck he ride.

240
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,783
107M703.

241
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,218
Did you prime it?

242
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,928
That little rubber ball right there,
next to the spark plug.

243
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,865
You gotta push it in three times
before you try to start it.

244
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,268
Gets the gas going to the carb.

245
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,030
You want the truth?
I ain't never used one of these.

246
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,370
Never had no call to.

247
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,935
Yeah, well, I didn't pick you up
for your landscaping skills.

248
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,016
All these Spanish? They own paper, too.

249
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,544
I only use people like y'all.

250
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,316
Sometimes it comes back on me,
sometimes it works out fine.

251
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,221
- For how long you been uptown?
- 10 years.

252
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,390
Hotter than a motherfucker out here.

253
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,091
Yeah, it's hot. Every day.

254
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,530
You gonna be riding in the back
of that hard truck, bouncing around...

255
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,866
every day.

256
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,639
And your back's gonna be yelling at you
every day.

257
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,769
I used to drive an SL.

258
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,314
Pretty gold convertible. Nice rims.

259
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,475
I don't even think on that car no more.

260
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,677
You put it behind you, huh?

261
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,187
Some can.

262
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,118
I'm just saying,
you wanna stay on the straight...

263
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,320
ain't gonna be no big reward to it.

264
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,259
This is it, right here.

265
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,495
Prime that bitch three times.
She'll start right up.

266
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,012
- Miss Pearlman?
- Cedric.

267
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,981
How goes Kintel Williamson?

268
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,985
- Anything there for me yet?
- No, not yet.

269
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,687
We'll get there.

270
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,496
Is that all you came by to tell me?

271
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,329
Just keeping the lines of dialogue open.

272
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,835
So, what's on your plate?

273
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,997
Oh, there's plenty of surprises around here.

274
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,818
Parole hearing. This soon?

275
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,951
He fingered a dirty guard
up at Jessup, apparently.

276
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,120
Got a big gold star next to his name.

277
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,720
That's some bullshit.

278
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,356
Yeah, well, not to worry.

279
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,698
They send me the hearing notifications
for a reason.

280
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,409
"Mr. Barksdale ran a continuous
violent criminal enterprise...

281
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,044
"and was a major drug trafficker.

282
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,307
"During the years 1999 to 2002...

283
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,415
"he was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused...

284
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,648
"the deaths of over a dozen individuals."

285
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,884
Parole Commission's not gonna walk him
on his first trip to the plate.

286
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,620
Not after a letter like that.

287
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,162
- Good work.
- I have my moments.

288
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,096
Nice suit, by the way.

289
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,629
Thanks.

290
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,334
I see you dress left.

291
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,841
Every day.

292
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,731
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is no longer in service.</i>

293
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,828
<i>If you feel you've reached this recording</i>
<i>in error...</i>

294
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,429
<i>please check the number and dial...</i>

295
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,471
Nothing?

296
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,242
That's an address up off of Reisterstown,
same one he was showing two years ago...

297
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,340
when I ran the car he was using.

298
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,477
- Stringer's a settled guy.
- Not there, he ain't.

299
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,551
Woman living there, last time I checked.
Just a front name.

300
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,057
His girl, maybe.

301
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,788
Not unless he likes them over 50
and asshole-ugly.

302
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,931
I'm sure she's real nice, though.

303
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,228
Good school spirit.
Always says hi to you in the halls.

304
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,599
You think he met her in college?

305
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,369
What? What did I say?

306
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,044
What you got?

307
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,117
Tag comes back
to an address over on Dukeland.

308
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,810
Female, 53 years.

309
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,284
See? That's how they do.

310
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,220
Yeah, but I got a hit on a Marlo,
street name of Black.

311
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,452
Marlo Stanfield. 22 years.

312
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,627
BPI number and a pretty good sheet.

313
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,330
What, you thought he'd be cherry?

314
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,868
Oh, I knew he'd have his cherry busted,
but not like this.

315
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,402
Check it out.

316
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,011
Think I'm gonna take a ride downtown
to Homicide. Wanna come?

317
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,103
Nope, got someplace to be.

318
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,082
This thing with Lester...

319
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,152
I feel like shit about it.

320
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,878
Well, you'll get used to it.

321
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,523
We roll up and we get out of the car.

322
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,293
Crowd parts like the Red Sea, victim's
on the ground, bleeding all over the place...

323
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,334
screaming, "I'm gonna kill
that fucking bitch."

324
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,199
But it's like
nothing's really wrong with <i>him...</i>

325
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,182
Oh, shit.

326
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,125
You tried to sneak by me, didn't you?

327
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,390
I was just coming in quiet and respectful.

328
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,932
Well, for a big man,
you do have a dancer's grace.

329
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,195
But I, sir, I have the eyes of an eagle.

330
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,636
And the fact that you tried to slither
into your work space undetected...

331
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,798
does not bode well
for the recovery prospect...

332
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,705
of our missing firearm, does it?

333
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,368
I'll get it.

334
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,877
What up, Mr. Bunk?

335
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,607
Hey, girlfriend.

336
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,046
Vernon Holley working tonight?

337
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,677
Yeah, he's 4:00 to 12:00.
You should try the coffee room.

338
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,785
All right.

339
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,750
Man, I would murder that...

340
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,620
- if she <i>wasn't...</i>
- Particular?

341
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,564
Hey, Crossfield, that line that's blinking's
for you.

342
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,760
- Find that gun.
- Yeah, okay.

343
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,137
Motherfuck you, too.

344
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,542
Marlo Stanfield, a.k.a. Black.

345
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,582
- Boy's the spawn of the devil, Kima.
- I see.

346
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,013
And y'all damn near had him
on this murder.

347
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,486
- What happened?
- We had a wit.

348
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,224
Boy they called Pooh Bear,
chubby fellow with braids.

349
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,260
We stashed Pooh over in East Baltimore...

350
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,092
even had him wear
one of those electronic bracelets...

351
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,756
so we could find him quick.

352
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,925
- You lost him?
- Not exactly.

353
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,629
Pooh went back to the West Side
to cop some hydro.

354
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,901
He could've bought the same weed
where he was, right?

355
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,976
We found him with two in his chest
and one in his mouth.

356
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,545
The bracelet led us
right to the spot where he fell.

357
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,170
Those things work.

358
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,647
Yeah. Marlo's serious.

359
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,853
That motherfucker's real.

360
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,747
I don't know, I think
a volcano's way better than a computer.

361
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,088
You see computers every day.
How often do you see a volcano?

362
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,854
Yeah, but that guy built the computer.

363
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,486
Hey, you built the volcano.

364
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,723
Big whoop.

365
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,732
Can I keep it?

366
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,461
Yeah, if you want to.

367
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,138
- Good night, Mikey.
- Good night.

368
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,802
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

369
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,182
It's good that you came.

370
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,808
- He was very proud.
- Glad to.

371
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,522
Jimmy, there's a problem with the alimony.

372
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,216
What's the problem?

373
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,761
You're behind by like four months.

374
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,965
What can I tell you?
I'm paying $2,000 a month in support.

375
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,091
- After that, there's nothing left.
- Right.

376
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:01,036
But you signed a separation agreement
that gives me another $1,000 in alimony.

377
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,233
Elena, I only signed that fucking thing
'cause I thought we'd be together.

378
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,139
Look at how much I make.
I'm not even close...

379
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,371
to being able to pay that much
every month.

380
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,142
My lawyer says that we have to serve you.

381
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,914
What, that suit of a boyfriend
won't cough up any cash?

382
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,049
Blood from a stone, darling.

383
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,057
Beginning today...

384
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,102
you can sell drugs in West Baltimore...

385
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,599
but only where we say you can.

386
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,900
Push them hard.

387
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,839
Get to it, people, and don't get captured.

388
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,509
Hey! Stay right there.

389
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,416
Get him up against the wall.

390
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,849
Hey, listen to what I'm telling you.

391
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,591
You know, kids...

392
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,035
this is a simple fucking thing
we're saying here.

393
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,266
If you stay on this corner,
you're going in a wagon.

394
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,673
If you move yourself down
to the free zone...

395
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,007
down to the vacants along Vincent Street...

396
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,206
then you can do
whatever the fuck you want!

397
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,839
How much fairer can we be?

398
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,783
Hey, I saw that, you little fuck.
What's your name?

399
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,816
You got a name?

400
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,855
Peanut Butter and Jelly.

401
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,151
Address?

402
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,982
What's your address?

403
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,561
I stay over on Dolphin Street.

404
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,357
Your address, numb nuts.

405
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,900
Are there any numbers
on the front of your fucking house?

406
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,899
Listen up.

407
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,032
This corner is indicted.

408
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,799
We're coming back tomorrow, and
when we do, everybody wears bracelets...

409
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,903
unless you move your shit
down to Vincent Street...

410
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,641
down where the houses are all vacant.

411
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,217
You do that, we don't give a shit!

412
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,754
Vincent Street is like
Switzerland or Amsterdam.

413
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,184
What the fuck is that?

414
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,588
It's one of those countries
where drugs are legal.

415
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,160
Vincent Street is your Amsterdam
in Baltimore.

416
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,129
You go down there, we don't give a fuck.
You stay here, you go to jail.

417
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,238
I ain't going to no Hamsterdam.

418
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,468
He killed a witness, huh?

419
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,543
The way that Vernon Holley told it, yeah.

420
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,270
So Marlo's a hitter.

421
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,936
Maybe he works for Stringer.

422
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,378
Makes sense.

423
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,540
If you need me, I'm gonna be West Side.
What about you?

424
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,915
I gotta get the scent of my boy, Stringer.

425
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,487
We've been off him too long.

426
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,817
What's your first move?

427
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,481
Something Prez said.

428
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,119
"P and P"?

429
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,694
B and B. Like the liquor.

430
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,956
You mean, liqueur, Plauzinski...

431
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,329
- Pryzbylewski.
- Benedictine and Brandy.

432
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,267
That was invented
by a bartender over at Club 21.

433
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,031
All that good shit comes out of New York.

434
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,505
I need every deed transfer
involving that company, Harry.

435
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,102
Today.

436
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,223
Yo, I'm asking them corner boys
if they know...

437
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,797
where the Barksdale package be at.

438
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,890
And they looking at me
like I ain't even talking.

439
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,835
On this strip, Marlo's the name ringing out.

440
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,297
There he is. You see him?

441
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,417
He didn't stay too long.

442
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,750
Yeah, Marlo's ghosting.

443
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,787
We're kind of sensitive about giving out
personal data on matriculating students.

444
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,522
Well, I could come back with a court order.

445
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,962
- Then I'd have to give it to you.
- Look.

446
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,535
My man has serious issues with women.

447
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,697
Domestic violence, really ugly stuff.

448
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,736
I can't show you any paper.

449
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,974
But let me get my screen up.

450
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,149
What did we tell you?
What'd we fucking tell you, man?

451
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,420
We told you to get yourselves
down to the free zone, didn't we?

452
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,052
We're trying to give you guys a break.

453
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,155
We're offering <i>you...</i> What's that?

454
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,324
Amnesty.

455
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,334
You take your crew down to Vincent Street.

456
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,200
You do your dirt,
nobody's gonna bother you.

457
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,829
What do you say?

458
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,774
You guys fucking brain-dead?
What do you say?

459
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,348
Yo, chief, how you gonna come up here
and try to game us?

460
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,439
Say what?

461
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,542
I'm saying you acting
like we retarded or something...

462
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,144
- Better we put a foot in your ass?
- At least we'd understand it.

463
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,554
- This ain't a trick, shitbird!
- Look, we grind, and y'all try to stop it.

464
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,024
That's how we do.

465
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,891
Why you gotta
go and fuck with the program?

466
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,188
All due respect.

467
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,537
Nothing but tumbleweeds.

468
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,801
Get me some buses.

469
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,808
Tomorrow we clean the corners.

470
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,208
Put them all in one place
and give them the news.

471
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,149
And I'm not asking anymore.

472
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,562
From here to Fremont...

473
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,292
you got Barksdale's people,
East Siders and freelancers, too.

474
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,334
- On the same corners?
- Yup.

475
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,404
That shit don't make sense.

476
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,701
Yo, can we call it a day, Kima?

477
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,280
- Bullshit, man.
- You, too?

478
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,171
What the fuck is up with these phones?

479
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,751
I've been seeing kids
throwing them away all day.

480
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,820
They got cash like that to waste?

481
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,048
Them shits be laying all over, man.
Sometimes you get lucky.

482
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,923
Find some minutes on them,
sell them for walking-around money.

483
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,291
- They burners, Kima.
- Burners?

484
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:06,162
<i>Marron,</i> another murder.
In Waverly, no less. You believe it?

485
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,597
I would be fucking shocked if it was
an African-American perpetrated the crime.

486
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,676
It ain't even funny, Ash.

487
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,775
This is why everyone's leaving this city,
black and white.

488
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,480
I was at a community meeting,
Sunday, in West Baltimore.

489
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,848
People were spitting mad,
and I can't say I blame them.

490
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,080
Well, they could move
to a better neighborhood. That is...

491
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,451
if they were willing to work for it.

492
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,048
Come on, I've been hearing that
"my poor immigrant father made it...

493
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,956
"so why can't the blacks?" bullshit
my whole life.

494
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,926
Think there's not good people
on the West Side...

495
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,692
- who want the same things that you...
- Okay, Mrs. Roosevelt.

496
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,597
All's I'm saying is, it's not about color.

497
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,366
So what's your next move, Tommy?

498
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,838
<i>The Sun</i> says an Anderson
State Senate seat is up for grabs.

499
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,207
Fuck that, you could go after
Ruppersberger in the second.

500
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,109
He's only got one term.

501
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,916
I'm gonna run for mayor.

502
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,126
That's good. Mayor Tommy.

503
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,795
Is she in the right joint?

504
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,616
She lets me sit next to her,
I buy her a <i>drink...</i>

505
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,486
- We each give you $10.
- $20 if you fuck her.

506
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,355
Oh, please, Ash.
Show just a little more class.

507
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,089
Besides, I already had my day in the sun.

508
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,455
Bullshit, Tommy. Once a gash-hound...

509
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,468
The bet is the bet. You said I lost a step.
I'm gonna prove I never did.

510
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,597
- You in, Pete?
- I'll pass.

511
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,946
Can I have two Glenlivets?

512
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,751
How you doing?

513
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,357
- The son of a bitch did it.
- He did you.

514
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,086
That's Theresa D'Agostino. Mario D's kid?

515
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,090
Yeah, she grew up all right.
She's down in DC now...

516
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,894
with the national party. A campaign fixer.

517
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:17,990
No shit.

518
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,400
Tommy's known her ever since law school.

519
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,599
Just hear me out, okay? One drink.

520
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,902
Go ahead. You're paying for it.

521
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,844
- Actually, they are.
- You made a bet.

522
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,412
Don't tell me we have to kiss or something.
Not gonna happen.

523
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,079
This isn't about ankle straps
in a two-and-a-half star hotel, is it?

524
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,647
Because the alumni dinner ended an hour
ago and I could be back in DC right now...

525
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,522
That's the old me, Terri.

526
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,358
Everything I got now, my wife, my kids...

527
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,492
I would not risk losing them. No way.

528
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,093
Seeing you with your old gang
made me think bad thoughts.

529
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,070
Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.

530
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,507
You're just pissed off that they
didn't recognize you when you walked in.

531
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,134
And why would they?

532
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,907
I mean, you're a Washingtonian now.

533
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,113
That's Pete Sinopoli over there, isn't it?

534
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,409
- I hear he's back to practicing law.
- Yeah.

535
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,681
He just didn't have it, did he?

536
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,381
I have it, Terri.

537
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,987
I'm gonna make a run for mayor.

538
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,993
And you're gonna run my campaign.

539
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,332
Give me one good reason why not to.

540
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,426
I could give you 10,
but here's the good one.

541
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,267
You're the wrong color.
You're not electable here.

542
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,275
- And I never play the long shot.
- You like to win.

543
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,005
I don't like to lose. It's not the same thing.

544
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,081
Where's the fun in it
if you know you're gonna win?

545
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,082
I mean, you handled that Democrat
in East LA, what was his name...

546
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,481
- Garcia...
- Valdez.

547
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,986
Valdez. How hard was that?

548
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,860
I need someone like you on my side.

549
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,462
I need you.

550
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,198
How big a win bonus?

551
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:02,864
Get a white mayor elected in Baltimore,
honey, you name your price.

552
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,473
One drink was the deal.

553
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,473
Go home, sleep it off.

554
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,639
You'll wake up and realize
you're making a mistake.

555
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,706
I can do this.

556
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,244
Question is, are you gonna come with me?

557
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,245
B and B.

558
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,681
<i>Hello?</i>

559
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,970
Yo, how we not gonna throw
a few hot ones at the motherfuckers?

560
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,271
One ass-whupping
and we back off like some bitches.

561
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,675
Then we on this off-brand-ass strip
right here.

562
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,806
Ain't even enough trade for Poot
and his crew. This some bullshit, man!

563
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,476
Look, man, Stringer gonna fix it, man,
you'll see.

564
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,816
Which one of y'all is Slim Charles?

565
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,684
- Who asking?
- That'd be Cutty.

566
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,350
Your boy gave me a number,
said to ring you up...

567
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,656
when I was ready to put in some work.
But no answer.

568
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,753
Took your time calling back, right?

569
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,299
The numbers don't play
after a few days, man.

570
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,527
- We change them up.
- Yeah, ain't you know nothing?

571
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,834
Respect, dawg, respect.
Y'all don't know who y'all talking to, man.

572
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,671
- You still ain't say your business, man.
- I'm trying to get put on.

573
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,769
- What you got in mind?
- Whatever you got that pays.

574
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,940
Yo, Poot. Come here, man.

575
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,413
Hey, look, man, call Shamrock, man...

576
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,491
and tell him
soldier's finally came into the camp.

577
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,819
You a soldier, huh?

578
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,417
Chill, Bodie, man, chill, man.

579
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,692
- Oh, Bodie Broadus?
- Yeah, that's right.

580
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,264
Shit, I remember your little ass
when you was still in diapers.

581
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,065
I used to spar
with your older brother, James.

582
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,163
That boy had a killer left.

583
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,938
Yeah, when he ain't drop it.

584
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,874
Yo, he still out here?

585
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,939
James been dead.

586
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,046
Fuck's up with that cheese box?

587
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,453
What, you ain't never
ridden no school bus before?

588
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,994
I'm saying, what they doing
with the niggas on that corner?

589
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:42,156
Look, dawg, first thing we gonna need
to do is get you some chrome.

590
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,756
Look, come on, man.

591
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,831
What's wrong
with my fucking phone? Shit.

592
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,581
Yo, TJ,
you got one with some minutes left?

593
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,013
Which is not to say
that you couldn't do some multi-use...

594
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,947
with the Howard Street properties, too.

595
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,953
- Residential-commercial could work.
- On Howard Street?

596
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,716
The whole point of the block grant is to...

597
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,814
bring the West Side back
to make it high-end.

598
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,485
The Hippodrome project
was just the start, see?

599
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,187
But residential?

600
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,457
With the stadium
and the theater back on line...

601
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,090
that whole area is like Inner Harbor East
10 years ago.

602
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,796
And the thing is, you're on the ground floor
with what you're holding.

603
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,534
- Yes, you are, String.
- So we're still talking more return...

604
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,372
than just flipping the properties
for the condemnation money.

605
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,672
Way more.

606
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:29,939
Excuse me.

607
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,319
Yo. No. Not right now.

608
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,315
A half-hour.

609
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,188
No, so go ahead and fill it up.
You got the order number, right?

610
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,462
- Man, move your ass.
- Man, this some bullshit.

611
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,319
My mom's gonna be worried and shit.
Y'all kidnapping niggas.

612
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,054
I'm Major Colvin.

613
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,792
My name is Major Colvin.

614
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,369
- Major what?
- Major these, motherfucker.

615
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,632
And we had to bring you down here
this afternoon...

616
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,871
because you've not been complying
with our directives.

617
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,137
Say what?

618
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,905
You haven't been doing
what we asked you to do.

619
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,072
Yo.

620
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,682
When I'm done.

621
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,116
I gotta pee now.

622
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,080
He ain't playing.
Smell like he already pissed in his drawers.

623
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,227
All right, go ahead.

624
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,995
Yo, I gotta go, too.

625
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,624
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.

626
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,567
You just let him go,
how you gonna discriminate?

627
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,969
Yo, faggy, why you touch my butt?

628
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,149
That's enough!

629
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,816
The fun is over.

630
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,728
Tyrell, why weren't you in school today?

631
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,094
My stomach hurt.
I couldn't make it out the bathroom.

632
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,534
Stand up when I talk to you, young man.

633
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,697
I know your mother, Tyrell.

634
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,204
She didn't raise any clowns, now, did she?

635
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,606
No, ma'am.

636
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,047
It's yours, Major.

637
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,791
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we brought you down here because...

638
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,437
you're here to learn about the new way...

639
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:12,272
The new way that we're going
to do things on the corners.

640
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,154
- That's downtown.
- Yeah.

641
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,524
- Well, that makes no sense.
- All four.

642
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,448
Go ahead, rip me a new asshole.
Ask me where I've been for two days.

643
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,146
Tell us, hotshot.

644
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,250
College registrar gives up
Stringer's course schedule.

645
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,522
I tail him to where he's laying his head.
Downtown high-rise.

646
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,325
Name's on the lease, too.
No attempt to hide it.

647
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,428
I get up early next morning, follow him
from his door to a lunch meeting...

648
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,367
with the state senator.

649
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,301
Same one with the bagman
we bounced the last time around.

650
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,535
Couple of white guys at the table, too,
nobody I read.

651
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,634
And all the while,
Stringer's using his cell phone...

652
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,906
making calls in front of these suits
like it ain't no thing.

653
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,481
Shit, I even rang it up myself.

654
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,744
Got his number from an admissions form.

655
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:31,413
The number wouldn't be 844-7393?

656
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,758
I had Prez pull
the B and B property assessments...

657
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,454
and land transfers from Circuit Court.

658
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,030
Some of the paperwork
asked for a contact number.

659
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,897
So I'm not surprised
our boy's using his cell phone so freely.

660
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,696
Those, right there, are the incoming
and outgoing numbers on his phone.

661
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,267
And damn near all of them
are downtown exchanges.

662
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,346
Architectural firms, city licensing...

663
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,041
attorneys, zoning offices.

664
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,777
Even campus exchanges over at BCCC.

665
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:07,183
- You saying he's right?
- I'm saying the phone is right.

666
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,056
Account information confirms
he's had that number listed...

667
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,987
for quite a while.

668
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,497
Nice work.

669
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,867
Maybe the cell phone is clean
because he's keeping it.

670
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,772
If it was dirty, it'd probably be a burner.

671
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,312
Disposables.

672
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,842
The latest in yo-tech.

673
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:38,113
They make a couple of calls with a burner,
throw it away.

674
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,917
Go on to the next phone, do the same.

675
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,050
There's more of those things laying around
the streets of West Baltimore...

676
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,149
than empty vials.

677
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,889
Well, how the fuck you supposed
to get a wire up on that?

678
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,761
Yeah, well,
first it was payphone and pagers.

679
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:53,564
Then it was cell phones
and face-to-face meets. Now this.

680
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,630
The motherfuckers do learn.

681
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,674
Every time we come at them,
they learn and adjust.

682
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,602
So...

683
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,678
Stringer's out of reach.

684
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,749
You know, a couple of years ago...

685
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,113
when they were buying up
all that downtown real estate...

686
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,618
I thought they were buying it to flip it...

687
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,053
and get the cash
when the federal payout money lands...

688
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,852
and the properties are condemned.

689
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,087
Bell and Barksdale haven't sold any of it.
They're buying more, in fact...

690
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,254
and applying for building permits.

691
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,197
Seems that
Stringer Bell is worse than a drug dealer.

692
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,735
He's a developer.

693
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,800
Jesus, fuck, he's really legit?

694
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,701
Well, you real police.

695
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,875
Now that he's out in the open,
why don't you pull him up and ask him?

696
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,572
You need a few days, I'll stall Daniels.
But after that...

697
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,341
you come home with a case we can use...

698
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,816
or you swallow your goddamn pride
and rejoin this unit.

699
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,159
How you doing, Donette?

700
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,599
"I'm fine, String. I missed you, baby."

701
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,345
Look, I'm sorry for not returning them calls.

702
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,914
"Sorry" don't keep my bed warm at night.

703
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,813
Shorty, I been running.

704
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:18,786
Ain't like I'm trying to shut you out.
I just got business to attend to, you know?

705
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,491
Do you know how it feels
to be alone out here?

706
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,721
Police coming to my door,
and I got no one to stand beside me.

707
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,763
You say the detective left you a card?

708
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,422
Man say D'Angelo wasn't no suicide.

709
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,952
Something about the way
the marks was on his neck.

710
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,860
He said D could have been murdered
and shit.

711
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,131
Sit down.

712
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,901
Now listen to me.

713
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,242
Everyone in them walls know who Avon is.

714
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,615
Ain't nobody gonna do his nephew.

715
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:23,915
All right?

716
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,882
Now, as far as you and me go...

717
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,928
I did you wrong
by keeping you at arm's length...

718
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,758
but it ain't gonna be like that no more.

719
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,702
Oh, yeah.

720
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,128
God made that.

721
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,268
Couldn't be no accident.

722
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,469
So why am I on your tab tonight?
Tell the truth.

723
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,342
I dare that to walk by me again.
She better not.

724
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,246
Why you buying, Bunk?

725
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,014
I got two dead...

726
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,793
in what feels like a drug rip up in Pimlico.

727
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:44,196
And the young 'uns out on the scene,
they seem to know this Omar fella by sight.

728
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,166
I need Omar, Jimmy.

729
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,541
Again? Jesus, Bunk.

730
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,872
Yeah.

731
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,681
Fuck it, then.

732
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:04,953
Number three?

733
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,315
No, that worked for you last time.
The blonde at the juke.

734
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:10,654
Oh, I really liked her.

735
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,093
Everybody likes everybody
when they're kissing.

736
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,688
But no, my friend down there...

737
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,760
she's a number two, I think.

738
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,533
And when it comes up, my mother passed.
A week ago.

739
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,701
And I'm having a little trouble
getting over it.

740
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,469
That's why I'm feeling so blue tonight.

741
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,481
- Okay, your mom's dead and you're sad.
- Yeah.

742
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,184
You my boy.

743
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,892
The same way.

744
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:52,357
My mom died about a week ago, <i>and...</i>

745
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,543
- Yo.
- What's up, boss?

746
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,944
You got the phone receipts
from the Virginia run?

747
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,252
All right.

748
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,419
From now on, I want you to deal with these.

749
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:19,688
All right.

750
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,723
If my man Bernard doing it like we said
and making them runs...

751
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,928
then I don't wanna have to deal with this
no more.

752
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:28,832
For sure.

753
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,873
- And if Donette call me...
- I know.

754
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,609
- Tell that bitch you busy.
- No.

755
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,446
I'm gonna take the call.

756
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:07,903
Ronnie?

757
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,405
Ronnie, Ronnie!

758
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,117
Rhonda!

759
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,044
He was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused the deaths...

760
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,715
- of over a dozen individuals.
- Suspected.

761
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,656
It's rumor and innuendo.

762
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,888
There isn't one new allegation
in this letter that wasn't already raised...

763
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,761
by the Assistant State's Attorney
at the time of the trial.

764
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:06,859
And given my client's superlative record
during his incarceration...

765
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:11,100
and given his notable role in identifying
the source of the overdose deaths...

766
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,369
at this facility last year...

767
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,312
I respectfully ask
that you honor our existing agreement...

768
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,780
- and approve Mr. Barksdale's early release.
- That's bullshit!

769
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,942
Hold your comments, Trooper.

770
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,914
We made a commitment, Counselor.

771
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,922
And given what this institution
was dealing with a year ago...

772
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,889
this is the lesser evil.

773
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,227
Rockefeller! Rockefellers on the spot!

774
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:36,197
Man, that's him right there.
In that G35, man.

775
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,927
- Boy in the retro?
- That shit is tight.

776
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,197
$430, it better be.

777
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,398
Hell, yeah. I'm gonna get me
one of those motherfuckers.

778
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,772
You must be going to get
that Muggsy Bogues, then.

779
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,243
Your Mini-Me ass gonna be swimming
in that Unseld.

780
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,110
As usual, man,
y'all fools are missing my point.

781
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,683
That boy came up short on that money
last week...

782
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,719
and y'all see how he out here grinding.

783
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,310
So where that money at?

784
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:02,256
You need to look beyond
what he driving or wearing on his back.

785
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,283
That boy got a girlfriend?

786
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,453
He run with this little freak
up at the high school.

787
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,757
She wearing ice?

788
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,389
She wearing a onion,
that's about all I can remember.

789
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,489
Hell, yeah.

790
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,262
Yo, check out the girl.

791
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,932
High school girl with platinum around
her neck, only one place it came from.

792
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,471
Give my man his thing.

793
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,380
SIG Sauer. That ain't no Lorcin, dawg.

794
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,848
I'm used to revolvers, man.
.38 don't jam.

795
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,085
Don't hold 15, neither.

796
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,419
Game done changed.

797
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,359
Game the same. Just got more fierce.

798
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:48,494
- I'm not big on vacations.
- Yeah, who has time?

799
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:55,307
What about taking the boys down
to Ocean City for a weekend or something?

800
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,308
You ever been down the ocean?

801
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,853
Listen.

802
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:18,200
It wasn't like
I was waiting for an opening with Rhonda.

803
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,226
It just happened.

804
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,901
I should have told you sooner.

805
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,214
I need to know this isn't going
to be a thing between you and me.

806
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,477
No, I wish you both all the best.

807
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,582
Was I very loud last night?

808
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,164
Thanks for making this easy on me.

809
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,108
You coming?

810
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,975
No, I think I'll stay here a while, nurse this.

811
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,180
Then I'll shove off.

812
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:27,226
One more, and put a beer next to it.

813
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,338
Nigga, what's up? You good?

814
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,179
Shit is on.

815
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,818
This what I'm talking about.

816
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,654
Drink that shit.

817
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,760
I'm surprised Avon
be letting y'all get your heads up.

818
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,525
Sometimes you got to.

819
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,975
Kiss the sky, nigga.

820
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,282
- Ready to go?
- Yeah. Are you all right to drive?

821
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,949
I thought you
were the designated driver tonight.

822
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,788
No, I'm good, really. I'm good to go.

823
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,375
Good night.

824
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,450
Bitch with one leg named Aaliyah.

825
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,111
What kind of shit is that?

826
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,155
Oh, shit.

827
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,873
- You do still like females, don't you?
- Shit.

828
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,219
He home now.
