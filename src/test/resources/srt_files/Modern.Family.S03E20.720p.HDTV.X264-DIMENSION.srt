1
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,251
We have to tell him.

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,124
I hope he's okay.

3
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:09,198
Walt, our elderly
next door neighbor, died.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,631
He and Luke were pretty close,
so we have to tell him.

5
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:13,056
I'm a little nervous about it.

6
00:00:13,057 --> 00:00:14,868
I think we should
break it to him slowly.

7
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:15,807
Like how?

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,129
Well, first we'd say,

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,294
"Luke, your friend Walt has a cold.

10
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,663
You shouldn't go over there."

11
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:22,801
Next day... "bad news.
Walt's in the hospital,"

12
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:24,965
but he's still cracking jokes
with the nurses."

13
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:27,332
Next day... "they're
trying an experimental drug."

14
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,246
Fingers crossed."

15
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:30,966
Next day... "his body rebelled.
He's in a coma."

16
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,478
Next day...
he rallies, next day... coma,

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,451
next day... coma, next day... coma,
next day... eye flutter...

18
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,703
Stop. Just stop. Stop. Oh.

19
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:42,321
Oh, Luke, we have
some bad news for you.

20
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:44,766
It's about Walt.

21
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,668
I'm afraid...

22
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:49,911
He passed away.

23
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,477
Um, it happened yesterday.

24
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:53,895
He finished writing
an angry letter

25
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:57,615
to the postmaster general,
and he just fell asleep.

26
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,038
Okay.

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,256
It was very peaceful.

28
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:04,267
Not the letter.
That was full of threats, but...

29
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,324
It's okay to be sad, honey.

30
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:08,591
You two were really good friends.

31
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,490
It must be quite a shock
to hear that...

32
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,664
Walt's dead.

33
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:18,880
Um, so do you
wanna talk about it or...

34
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:20,130
I'm okay.

35
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:22,388
Can I get back to my video game?
It's paused.

36
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,890
Oh, um, sure.

37
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,138
Yeah, buddy.

38
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,841
Come here.

39
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,817
How weird was that?

40
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,675
I know. Crazy weird.

41
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,445
It's like he had
no feelings at all.

42
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:38,180
I'm more worried about
the one you showed.

43
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,970
What's with all the smiling?

44
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,846
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,047
That grin.

46
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:44,010
"Walt's dead."
You looked like the joker.

47
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,926
I didn't smile.

48
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:47,231
You did. It's like
a weird coping mechanism.

49
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,377
You did the same thing when
you told him his hamster died.

50
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:52,621
I don't know what
you thought you saw, Phil,

51
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,956
but our child just got
some terrible news

52
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:58,251
and had absolutely no reaction.
Doesn't that concern you?

53
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,161
Yeah. He probably just
needs time to process it.

54
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,167
Hmm. Do you think?

55
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,309
Yeah, honey.

56
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,508
Death is a profound thing
to deal with at any age.

57
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,679
We all manage it differently.

58
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,225
Some people lock up their feelings.

59
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,942
Others...

60
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,201
reach out for comfort,

61
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,966
finding some way to reaffirm
their connection to life...

62
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,212
- You're joking.
- Oh.

63
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:32,414

-DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-

64
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,152
Hola, Haley.

65
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:36,414
Gloria, I was driving by

66
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:38,796
and saw this outside your door,
so here.

67
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:40,651
- Thank you.
- No problem.

68
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,383
Hey, so since I'm already here,

69
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:45,671
my friend was gonna have
a pool party tonight,

70
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:48,370
but he got sick.
Could we have it here?

71
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:50,978
Mm. Good thing
that you saw this paper

72
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,331
or if not, you would have
never been able to ask.

73
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,467
Yeah.

74
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:56,418
I'm sorry, but Jay and I are going

75
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,904
to Mitch and Cam's
for dinner tonight.

76
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:00,767
I'm just thinking out loud here.

77
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,546
What if I get a chaperone
that my parents approve of?

78
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,016
Would it be okay then?

79
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,048
Well, I guess so.

80
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,635
You know, it would be good for Manny
to have a little bit of fun.

81
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:13,147
Do you mind if he stays
here for the party?

82
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:15,866
Mind? The plan depended on him.

83
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,906
I don't suppose
you've thought of a chaperone?

84
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,387
Of course not, mom,
because it's going to be a wild party

85
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:22,496
and I'm trying to get away
with something, as usual.

86
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:23,565
Yes, I thought of a chaperone...

87
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,237
my Uncle who already
said he would do it.

88
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,604
But if that's gonna be a problem,

89
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,680
- I think I should just call everybody...
- Sorry.

90
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,217
Sorry. Sorry. It's fine.

91
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:31,534
And thank you, Uncle Manny.

92
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,038
Can you help a little bit?

93
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,547
This... if I... if I push down,
does that...

94
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,111
Yeah, that's helping.
That's helping.

95
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,844
No, it's not helping.
It's 'cause it's stuck.

96
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,526
I can't believe
I got 'em this stuck.

97
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:41,827
I've built beds my whole life...

98
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:43,569
bunk beds, dog beds, cow beds.

99
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,260
Okay, I'm calling you on cow beds.

100
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,342
Oh, that's my dad!

101
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:50,218
Okay. He can help.
He's built a boat, a dock, a lake...

102
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,006
Uh, he did not build a lake.

103
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,488
Okay, from now on, just stop
after you say the second thing.

104
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,347
So the cabin door swings open.

105
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:58,879
Damned if there wasn't
a lady pilot in there.

106
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,096
Yeah, well,

107
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,514
I hate to admit it,
but it throws me, too.

108
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,032
I do prefer a man.

109
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:06,211
Are we gonna have
this conversation again?

110
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,851
- Hey, Merle.
- Hey. How are you?

111
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,239
- Yeah, ooh.
- Okay. Nice to see you.

112
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,290
All right, let me grab that for you.

113
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,470
No. No. I got it.

114
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:14,056
I will take that beer you were
about to offer me, though.

115
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:14,900
Oh, yeah. Coming right up.

116
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:17,897
And you know where everything is.
Go have a seat.

117
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,477
Oh, I missed a call from my dad.

118
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,035
Oh, let me guess.
Is he calling to cancel?

119
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:23,754
What's his excuse this time?

120
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:26,354
You know, that's a really
mean thing to assume, Cam.

121
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:28,388
I really wish you'd give
my dad a break for once.

122
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,314
Oh, please.
You know Jay doesn't like my dad.

123
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:32,546
He thinks he's some
bumpkin from the sticks.

124
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, I will have you know
that Merle Stonewall Tucker

125
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,891
is one of the most respected farmers

126
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:38,894
in all of Hell's Hollow, Missouri.

127
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,176
Okay, you're not hearing yourself.

128
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,872
My dad likes him just fine.
Come on.

129
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,985
- Hello?
- Hey, dad. It's me.

130
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,316
Mitch.

131
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,257
I'm sick.

132
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,050
I gotta cancel tonight.

133
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:57,355
Yeah. Yeah, 6:00.
We're really looking forward to it.

134
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,046
What are you doing?
I just said I can't come.

135
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:00,845
I don't know.
Let me ask.

136
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:02,897
My dad wants to know
red or white?

137
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:04,358
Um, uh, red.

138
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,725
Red. And I'm sorry.

139
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:08,608
Okay.
Yeah, Cam says red.

140
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,203
Okay. Yeah, he's...
he's so happy...

141
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:12,225
Knock it off, old man.
You are not sick.

142
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,412
Why do you always do this?

143
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,702
Okay, look, between you and me,

144
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:15,980
Mervis kind of bugs me.

145
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,411
Okay, first of all, it's Merle.

146
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,128
Mervis isn't a name.
Mervis is a sound.

147
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,624
And second of all, he's...
he's my partner's father.

148
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,983
Okay? You're coming.

149
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:24,598
Okay, dad, why don't you settle in?

150
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,846
We don't have plans until dinner
tonight with Jay and Gloria.

151
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,384
I-I don't like that guy.

152
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,165
What? That's...

153
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,184
you like everybody.

154
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:34,467
Not Jay.
The guy rubs me the wrong way.

155
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,239
Every time I try
to do something nice,

156
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,860
he makes this cranky face, like...

157
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,523
Okay. Well, you know what?

158
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:42,333
I'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag

159
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,799
for you because
it's not like you at all.

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,191
Okay, you have to make an effort.

161
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,956
It's my partner's father.

162
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:50,340
Now give me the growl
that means "okay."

163
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,314
Good.

164
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,393
Did you know Walt had a daughter

165
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,899
he was completely estranged from?

166
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,138
His lawyer said she wouldn't
even honor his last request

167
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,888
to toss his dog tags in the ocean.

168
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:01,887
Can you imagine?

169
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,771
Phil, do we really have
to go through this again?

170
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,535
I told you, I would
do everything possible

171
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:06,728
to make sure that your skeleton

172
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,511
ends up in a science class
at a women's college.

173
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:10,613
No, it's just sad.

174
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,589
That's half of what would
keep me going in my old age...

175
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,744
remembering all
the good times with the kids.

176
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,466
Teaching Luke to ride his bike,

177
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,828
Haley at the father-daughter dance...

178
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:26,198
Taking Alex for her first pony ride.

179
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,857
You never took Alex
on a pony ride.

180
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,059
- Oh, right. That was just me.
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,548
But Alex and I went, um,

182
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:36,563
Oh, no. That was Haley.
Mm-hmm.

183
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,450
Phil, look. It's Luke.

184
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,660
He's going into Walt's house.

185
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,155
Oh, he's saying good-bye.

186
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:48,123
He just needed a little time.

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,547
It's so sweet and so sad.

188
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:55,013
He's so much more sensitive
than I ever thought.

189
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,738
They had a special bond.
I wouldn't be surprised

190
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:01,575
if one day he wrote a book
like "Tuesdays with Morrie."

191
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:02,670
I never read it.

192
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,772
Did that guy steal Morrie's TV?

193
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:15,380
Now setting a course for adventure!

194
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,703
Beep. Boop. Beep. Bop.
Boop. Boop. Boop.

195
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,947
I've had great experiences
with all my kids,

196
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:23,428
but I... I might have
fallen behind a bit with Alex.

197
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:25,054
My fault completely.

198
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,967
Adventure?
We are throwing dog tags

199
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,011
into an already polluted ocean

200
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,149
where they will probably
choke an otter.

201
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,531
80% my fault.

202
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:36,068
Honey, we're bringing
closure to a man's life.

203
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,907
We'll hike up
to the scenic overlook,

204
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,046
where apparently,
Walt proposed to his wife,

205
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,888
wait for the light to be just right,
say a few words.

206
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,209
Share some memories.

207
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,958
That's kind of poetic.

208
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,928
Kind of navajo.

209
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,624
Now you're getting it.

210
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,450
We'll be sending him off
with a level of dignity,

211
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,343
that if we're lucky,
someday we'll experience, too.

212
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:55,236
It's called...

213
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:13,019
Hey. What do you got there?
Walt's old TV?

214
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,499
He said I could take
one thing after he died.

215
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,354
I wish he would've said two things.

216
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,672
I would've taken that phone
with the big buttons.

217
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,569
I bet you guys had
some really good times

218
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,843
watching this thing, right?

219
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:26,352
No. I just wanted a TV in my room.

220
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,492
You know, Luke,

221
00:08:28,493 --> 00:08:31,712
there might be a nicer way
to honor Walt's memory.

222
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:32,862
What do you mean?

223
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:35,928
Well, I mean,
you guys liked to garden.

224
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,531
We could, uh, we could
take one of his flowers

225
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:42,116
and plant it in our yard,
and then every spring, when...

226
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,810
There we go.

227
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,006
Sweetie, how are you feeling?

228
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,601
You sad? Angry?

229
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,796
Confused? Frustrated?

230
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,086
You know you can talk to me.

231
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:58,386
I know, but I can't see through you.
Could you scootch?

232
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,476
No. No. You know, this is not okay.

233
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:01,514
It's going back.

234
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,326
What?
He said I could pick one thing.

235
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,279
This isn't picking.

236
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,587
It's looting, and it's going back.

237
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,042
You are so mean.

238
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:09,992
When Walt used to look
through those binoculars

239
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:13,637
and say, "your dad's one lucky man,"
he was wrong.

240
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,137
Hi, Haley.

241
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,428
Hi. Stef, Sam, this is Manny.

242
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,038
What's up, dude?

243
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,200
Kitchen's over there
and pool's in the back.

244
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,115
So where are your parents?

245
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,255
They're not coming.

246
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:24,641
I was told there'd be a chaperone.

247
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,256
There is. It's you.

248
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:28,293
My parents are totally fine with it.

249
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:30,273
Well, exits,

250
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,809
fire extinguisher, burn kit.

251
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,238
Okay, let's have some fun.

252
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:37,031
I believe I was clear
the bedrooms were off-limits.

253
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:39,103
Young lady, I don't think
you're ready up here

254
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,013
for what you're planning
to do up there.

255
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,114
Ugh. Not on my watch.

256
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:51,526
Oh, this was a delicious meal, Mitchell.

257
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,811
I wish my wife
could cook a roast like this.

258
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,202
You got a good one there, son.

259
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,401
Oh, well, I'm very lucky,

260
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:00,357
just like you and mama.
Never had a bad patch.

261
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,287
Except the winter of '85.
Remember that?

262
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:06,384
Oh, I spent several nights
in the cow bed then.

263
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:09,408
Oh, here. Let me help you.

264
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,411
No, no, no. You sit... sit down.

265
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,490
- Let... lets us guys catch up
here a little bit. - Yeah.

266
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,109
I'll tell you why
I don't like that guy...

267
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,582
and I could never
say this to Mitch...

268
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,001
he treats my son like
the wife in the relationship.

269
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,207
Always has.

270
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,601
Before we get to dessert,
I've got some presents here.

271
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,006
- Oh!
- Oh, you didn't need to, dad.

272
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,188
Love it!

273
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:32,482
- Oh, Merle, thank you so much.
- Oh!

274
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:35,998
Look at this. Oh.
So elegant, huh?

275
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,917
Oh, this is so sweet.

276
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,035
I think I might cry.

277
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:40,474
Don't.

278
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,146
Dad, I really gotta get home.

279
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:45,137
I know. I know.
You gotta do homework.

280
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,990
But you can't expect me
to see a sign that says,

281
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,308
"world's greatest milk shake... 50 miles,"

282
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,981
and not drive to it.

283
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,153
Sorry, sweetie.
Machine's broken.

284
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,327
I just wanted a special day
with my daughter,

285
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:59,223
you know, like
"the time we gave an old man

286
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,307
a dramatic sendoff at the beach,"

287
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:04,166
or... or "the time
we drove 100 miles"

288
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,409
for the world's greatest milk shake."

289
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,085
Call us when it happens, Francine.

290
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,750
Oh, it could be
before you get home.

291
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,315
I'm a week past
my due date as it is.

292
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:13,780
What can I do for you?

293
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:17,613
"The time we delivered a baby."

294
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,716
We were the only ones there,
and she was so close,

295
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:22,295
the sound of a pin dropping
could induce labor.

296
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:24,560
Okay!

297
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,293
What looks good?

298
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,025
What looks good?

299
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,395
What looks good?

300
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,248
Well, um...

301
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,743
Bam!

302
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,866
Wh-whoa!
Kids love to destroy things.

303
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,843
Not Manny. He's always been
a little bit too serious.

304
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:44,023
I would make the buildings,
and he would inspect them.

305
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:48,297
And if they weren't up to code,
ay, ay, ay, the paperwork.

306
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,010
I remember Cam, one time,

307
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:52,687
rolled a tractor tire right
through a chicken coop.

308
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,967
He was 3 at the time.

309
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,853
I remember Mitchell, one time,

310
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:58,657
karate-chopped
a plate glass window.

311
00:11:58,658 --> 00:11:59,879
Got 17 stitches.

312
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,482
Ah, yes. I love that story.

313
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,979
Which one of the Charlie's Angels
he was being again?

314
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,173
- That's not important.
- I think it was Farrah.

315
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:09,225
Yeah, the thing I remember is,
when Mitchell told that story,

316
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,774
how... how he giggled
all the way through.

317
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:11,885
I'm sure he wasn't giggling.

318
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:14,433
Oh, yeah, he...
he was giggling, all right.

319
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:17,227
No, see, Mitchell
has a booming laugh.

320
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,199
It's Cameron, actually...
has the high laugh.

321
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,962
You know...

322
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:23,782
No, I think Mitch has
a higher laugh than...

323
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:25,446
it's...

324
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,385
No, it's...

325
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:32,400
Listen to them.

326
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,384
Listen to them.

327
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,097
Best of friends.

328
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:36,911
Oh, man.
I'm sorry I doubted Jay.

329
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,152
He's been lovely.

330
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:39,812
Oh, well, confession time...

331
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,121
he kinda didn't want to come.

332
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:44,663
Well, you're gonna laugh

333
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,275
because my dad was kinda
hoping he wouldn't.

334
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,808
Wha?

335
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:51,696
Oh. They just needed to get
to know one another better.

336
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,034
I am so glad that we did this.

337
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:54,664
Yeah, me, too.

338
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,060
Oh, that's so funny.

339
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,893
Wh-what did your dad
not like about my dad?

340
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:01,023
Oh, well, you know Jay.
He's a Teddy bear,

341
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:03,875
but sometimes he can kinda
come off as a tough guy.

342
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:05,698
Yeah, that's true.

343
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:06,782
As an actual tough guy,

344
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:10,026
you can kinda see how that
would rub my dad the wrong way.

345
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,154
Oh, it's... I-I could see that,
but, you know,

346
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,324
my dad's actually
pretty tough himself, so...

347
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,243
Oh, yeah, city tough,

348
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,410
you know, not farm tough.

349
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:22,046
Uh-huh. You mean cities,
where there are gangs,

350
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,901
as to opposed to farms,
where there are ducks?

351
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:29,253
Oh, boy.
It's really jammed in there.

352
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:31,047
Yeah. Why don't you
hop on in there, dad?

353
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:31,737
My dad's got it.

354
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,960
All right, let's see here.
Hang on, Merle.

355
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,036
- Wait. Here. Huh? Hold.
- Yeah, that's good.

356
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:37,334
Oh. It's coming.

357
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:38,537
We got it. We got it.

358
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:40,208
- Oh, there you go.
- There you go.

359
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,827
Cam, why don't you go get us
a couple of cold ones?

360
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:44,569
We'll finish this job up in here.

361
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,248
Sure thing, dad. You earned it.

362
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,885
Yeah. Good helping there, Merle.
Okay.

363
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,980
Wow. It's hot in here.

364
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,819
It's, like, 80 degrees.

365
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,287
He did that so
the Meals on Wheels lady

366
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:57,740
had to take off her sweater.

367
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,952
How do we turn on
the lights in here?

368
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,774
Of course.

369
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:05,085
So, Luke, now that we're here,

370
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:08,325
you wanna take a minute and
say what Walt meant to you?

371
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,962
Nope.

372
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:12,399
Luke, you are going through
something huge in your life,

373
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,286
and I'm concerned that
you're not processing it

374
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,509
in a normal, healthy way.

375
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,918
I'm sad. I'm so very sad.

376
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,753
No, I don't just wanna hear
what you think I wanna hear.

377
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,232
- I want you to really tell me...
- Hi.

378
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:23,906
It's Kim with Meals on Wheels.

379
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,922
Oh. Hi, Luke. Where's Walt?

380
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:28,492
It is like a sauna in here.
How does he stand it?

381
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,505
Walt! I'm waiting for my hug!

382
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:37,148
I have some sad news about Walt.

383
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,076
He's dead.

384
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,095
What?

385
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:42,521
He died last night.

386
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,428
Are you joking?

387
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,771
No.
He had a heart attack.

388
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:47,578
A man died.
You're... you're smiling.

389
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:48,591
I'm not smiling.

390
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:50,195
You are, mom.
It's kinda creepy.

391
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:52,956
Well, hello? Walt?

392
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,691
What's going on?

393
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,311
Something happen to Walt?

394
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,401
Well, I'm sure you can imagine.

395
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:01,398
He sick?

396
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,723
He's in the hospital?

397
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:04,802
Oh, my God. Just tell me.

398
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,694
Mm! Okay.

399
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:09,693
He is... dead.

400
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,449
- He is?
- Yeah, he's dead.

401
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,818
What are you doing
with your mouth?

402
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,547
Nothing. She's smiling.
She thinks it's funny.

403
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,975
I don't. I don't think it's funny.

404
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,547
- I'm not smiling.
- I'm not leaving this with you.

405
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:22,434
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I just found out my face does this.

406
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,228
Wow, mom. That was so wrong.

407
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:27,567
Well, it's... it's called
a coping mechanism, Luke.

408
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,380
Some people repress their feelings

409
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,614
and some people just smile.
But d... it doesn't matter.

410
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,444
Just put the TV in the den.
Let's get out of here.

411
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,335
It doesn't go in the den.

412
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,565
It goes right here.

413
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,680
I can see it from my room.

414
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:46,123
Sometimes I'd wake up
in the middle of the night

415
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,767
and look down here.

416
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:50,556
If the TV was on,
I knew he was up,

417
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,208
and I don't know,

418
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,510
I guess I'm gonna miss that.

419
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:58,344
Yeah. That's...

420
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:00,115
Yeah.

421
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,754
Is that any better?

422
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,891
Yeah, it still feels just,
you know, a little wobbly.

423
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,498
Oh! Oh, my God.
Okay, no, no, no.

424
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:13,104
That's... that's fine.
Thank you. Thank you.

425
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:16,325
Okay, it's "go" time.

426
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,454
Oh, hey, doc.

427
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,333
It's okay. It's just a cramp.

428
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,011
Can I get you guys anything else?

429
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:24,926
Please, no.
He's already made me eat

430
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,794
the world's greatest
everything on the menu.

431
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,806
Dad, why are you acting like this?

432
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,199
Is this about Walt dying?

433
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,225
No. It's about what he didn't do
when he was alive...

434
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:37,862
have a special bond
with his daughter.

435
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:38,908
I don't want to be that kind of dad.

436
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:40,214
I want to be Eugene Cernan.

437
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,341
Who's Eugene cernan?

438
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:42,827
"Apollo 17" astronaut,

439
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,649
last man on the moon,
coolest dad of all time.

440
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,142
When he was leaving the moon,
he reached down

441
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:49,867
and wrote his daughter's initials
into the lunar surface.

442
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:51,041
Since there's no atmosphere...

443
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,570
There'll be there forever.

444
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:55,967
Wow. So every time she looks in the sky,

445
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,909
she knows there's a message
just for her.

446
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,484
Exactly. That's why dads
everywhere hate Eugene Cernan.

447
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:02,625
Oh, no.

448
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:04,803
Okay, "hate's" a strong word.
It's just...

449
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:06,159
I'm trying to make...

450
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,162
Oh. Oh, boy.

451
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:09,920
Honey. Okay.

452
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:12,490
I really wanna help, but
you know when someone yawns,

453
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,431
it makes you yawn?

454
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,003
You're not gonna yawn, are you?

455
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:19,595
I already yawned a little in my mouth.
Oh, God.

456
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:22,837
Jay, I want to thank you
for helping me do this.

457
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:26,992
I know Cam appreciates
not having to do it all on his own.

458
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,525
What? What's that face?

459
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:31,390
You really wanna know?

460
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,342
Sure.

461
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,670
Sometimes I think you treat my son

462
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,491
like the woman
in their relationship.

463
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,327
- What?
- Like those watches.

464
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:41,973
Cam's was all big and manly.

465
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:43,622
The other one
looked like something

466
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:44,957
Grace Kelly would wear.

467
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,263
Well, that's just because

468
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:48,255
Mitch has a more slender wrist

469
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:49,638
than Cam does. That's all.

470
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,393
It's skinny, not slender.

471
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,861
And you're honestly telling me

472
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:55,105
you don't cast Mitch
in the more ladylike role?

473
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:57,316
Are you saying Cam
is the wife in this deal?

474
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,659
I don't think about it that way.

475
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,067
It's not like it was in our day.

476
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:02,894
Husband went out to work.
Wife stayed home with the kids.

477
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,282
That sounds like
a clever way of saying "yes."

478
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:06,967
Fine.

479
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,144
They're both equal.

480
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:12,368
Neither one is the wife.

481
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,290
Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,413
I know that in my head.

483
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:20,561
It's just that it makes me
feel a tiny bit better

484
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:24,593
to think that the person
he's spending his life with

485
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:27,439
is a tiny bit of a woman.

486
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,694
I get it.

487
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:32,772
Every time I start to feel
comfortable with this thing,

488
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:36,032
some new part comes up
I gotta wrap my head around.

489
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,257
Yeah, I guess we got no choice.

490
00:18:38,258 --> 00:18:41,737
Yep. We got two sons,

491
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:44,000
and they're gay for each other.

492
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,339
I'll take it slow on the way home.

493
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,466
Don't worry.
Canceling course for adventure.

494
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,659
Beep. Boop. Beep. Bop. Mm.

495
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,188
You know what I'll never forget?

496
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:55,359
The time my dad
spent the entire day

497
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,053
trying to create
a special memory for me.

498
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:05,478
Or when a pregnant lady
slipped in my vomit.

499
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:08,882
Hang on.

500
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,302
I wanna do one thing before we go.

501
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,034
Hey, you on your way home?

502
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:18,538
Just about.
How's everything there?

503
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:25,538
Actually, it's pretty great.

504
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,530
I can't wait to see you.

505
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,014
Me, too.

506
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,835
Okay.

507
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,175
Let's hit it.

508
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,498
I don't know.

509
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:40,145
I feel like maybe we should get
some food on the way home.

510
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,578
Don't.

511
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,275
Maybe a nice tuna melt.

512
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:46,130
Stop it.

513
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,490
I did what I could, mom.
It was a nightmare.

514
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:01,059
I can't tell you how many times
I turned off the bathroom light.

515
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,624
Haley!

516
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:05,083
Oh, crap.
Listen, Gloria.

517
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:07,835
Okay, everything I told you
technically was not...

518
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,122
You lied to me

519
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,643
so that you could have a party
without supervision!

520
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,990
Oh, I had plenty of supervision.

521
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:16,715
He was running around all night
with his coasters and vacuum

522
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,599
and his "make good choices" speech.

523
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,779
Good. Somebody
needed to be responsible.

524
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,585
Thank you.

525
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,955
Not you.
You take rules too seriously.

526
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,932
I'm in trouble?

527
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,376
You are 13.

528
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,446
You're not supposed
to be vacuuming the party.

529
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,976
You're supposed to be
enjoying the party.

530
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:32,010
Exactly.

531
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,176
A party that you shouldn't
have been having!

532
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:36,078
It seems like you're sending
mixed signals here.

533
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,111
Yeah, maybe I should get
my friends and just leave.

534
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,923
No, you're in trouble,
little young lady.

535
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:41,475
You're having this party!

536
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:43,844
What? They've been using
glassware by the pool,

537
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:44,944
putting feet on the furniture,

538
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,492
and begging girls
to kiss each other.

539
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:49,720
Yes! All the things that you
should have been doing!

540
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,555
Yeah, all those things are fine.

541
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:54,506
Go. Have fun and go crazy.

542
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,506
But he's gonna ruin my party.

543
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,528
Two birds with one bullet.

544
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:07,063
