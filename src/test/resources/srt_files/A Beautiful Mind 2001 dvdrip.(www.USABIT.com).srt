1
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,467
Mathematicians won the war.

2
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,262
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes-

3
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,723
And built the A-Bomb.

4
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:42,143
Mathematicians... like you.

5
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,981
The stated goal of the
Soviets is global Communism.

6
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,275
In medicine or economics,

7
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,611
In technology or space,

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,488
Battle lines are being drawn.

9
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,283
To triumph, we need results-

10
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,161
Publishable, applicable results.

11
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,540
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

12
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,918
The next Einstein?

13
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,920
Who among you will be the vanguard...

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,799
Of democracy, freedom, and discovery?

15
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,426
Today, we bequeath America's future...

16
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,097
Into your able hands.

17
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,016
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

18
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,576
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,830
No, he has to have it all for himself.

20
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,456
It's the first time
the Carnegie Prize...

21
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,500
Has been split. Hansen's all bent.

22
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,627
Rumor is he's got his
sights set on Wheeler Lab,

23
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,171
The new military think tank at M.I.T.

24
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,966
They're only taking one this year.

25
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,176
Hansen's used to being picked first.

26
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,845
Oh, yeah, he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,722
He should be running for president.

28
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,733
There could be a
mathematical explanation...

29
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,360
For how bad your tie is.

30
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,701
Thank you.

31
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,370
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

32
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,663
Neils here broke a Jap code.

33
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,331
Helped rid the world of fascism.

34
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,668
At least that's what he
tells the girls, eh, Neils?

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,587
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

36
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,714
And you are? Am I late?

37
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:35,715
Yes. Yes, Mr. Sol.

38
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,842
Oh, good. Uh, hi.

39
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,721
Sol. Richard Sol. The burden of genius.

40
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,890
There he is. So many
supplicants, and so little time.

41
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,558
Mr. Sol. How are you, sir?

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,934
Ah, Bender. Nice to see you.

43
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,480
Congratulations, Mr.
Hansen. Ah, thank you.

44
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,982
I'll take another.

45
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,233
Excuse me?

46
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,694
A thousand pardons. I simply
assumed you were the waiter.

47
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,530
Play nice, Hansen. Nice is
not Hansen's strong suit.

48
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,449
Honest mistake.

49
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,993
Well, Martin Hansen.

50
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:07,955
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,334
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,672
I've read your
pre-Prints-

53
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,424
Both of them.

54
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,426
The one on Nazi ciphers,

55
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,304
And the other one on
non-Linear equations,

56
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,223
And I am supremely confident...

57
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,682
That there is not a single seminal...

58
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,434
Or innovative idea
in either one of them.

59
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,315
Enjoy your punch.

60
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,404
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,

61
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:43,199
The mysterious West Virginia genius.

62
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,911
The other winner of the
distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

63
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:47,828
Oh, okay. Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,331
Of course.

65
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,029
Oh, Christ.

66
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,951
The prodigal roommate arrives.

67
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,744
Roommate?

68
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,454
Oh, God, no.

69
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,623
Ugh.

70
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,210
Did you know that having a hangover is-

71
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,754
Is not having enough
water in your body...

72
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,840
To run your Krebs cycles?

73
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,843
Which is exactly what happens to you...

74
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,469
When you're dying of thirst.

75
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,514
So, dying of thirst...

76
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,809
Would probably feel...

77
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,478
Pretty much like the hangover...

78
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,814
That finally bloody kills you.

79
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,650
John Nash?

80
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,610
Hello.

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,195
Charles Herman.

82
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,239
Pleased to meet you.

83
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,584
All right, well done.

84
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,632
Well, it's official.

85
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,801
I'm almost human again.

86
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,636
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,388
His name was Johnny Walker.

88
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,602
Whew.

89
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:38,230
Well, I got in last night in time for...

90
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,483
English department cocktails.

91
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,151
Cock was mine,

92
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,236
The tail belonged to a
particularly lovely young thing...

93
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,906
With a passion for...

94
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,534
D.H. Lawrence. You're not
easily distracted, are you?

95
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,953
I'm here to work. Hmmm, are you? Right.

96
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,289
I see. Crikey!

97
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,967
Is my roommate a dick?

98
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,679
Hmm?

99
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,848
Listen.

100
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,266
If we can't break the ice,

101
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,603
How about we drown it?

102
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,323
So what's your story?

103
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,536
You the poor kid that never
got to go to Exeter or Andover?

104
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,163
Despite my privileged upbringing,

105
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,623
I'm actually quite well-Balanced.

106
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,083
I have a chip on both shoulders.

107
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,045
Maybe you're just better...

108
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,047
With the old integers
than you are with people.

109
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,007
My first grade teacher, she told me...

110
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,051
That I was born with
two helpings of brain,

111
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,761
But only half a helping of heart.

112
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,682
Wow! She sounds lovely!

113
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:57,268
The truth is that l-

114
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,728
I don't like people much.

115
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,939
And they don't much like me.

116
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,232
But why,

117
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,984
With all your obvious wit and charm?

118
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,572
Seriously, John.

119
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,700
Mathematics-

120
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:16,579
Mathematics is never going
to lead you to a higher truth.

121
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,622
And you know why?

122
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,124
'Cause it's boring.

123
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,792
It's really boring.

124
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,212
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

125
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,800
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

126
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,594
And these books.

127
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,640
Memorizing the weaker
assumptions of lesser mortals!

128
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,937
I need to look through...

129
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,064
To the governing dynamics.

130
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,404
Find a truly original idea.

131
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,448
That's the only way I'll
ever distinguish myself.

132
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,824
It's the only way that I'll ever-

133
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,576
Matter.

134
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:00,080
Yes.

135
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,042
All right, who's next?

136
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,835
No, I've played enough
"Go" for one day, thank you.

137
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,795
Come on. I I hate this game.

138
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,505
Cowards, all of you!

139
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,549
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

140
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,217
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,

141
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,303
Sol does his laundry all semester.

142
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:17,097
Does that seem unfair to
anyone else? Not at all.

143
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,560
Look at him. Nash!

144
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,228
Taking a reverse constitutional?

145
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,147
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm...

146
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,149
To define their movement.

147
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,654
Oh. Psycho.

148
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,574
Hey, Nash, I thought you dropped out.

149
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,242
You ever going to go to class or-

150
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,661
Classes will dull your mind.

151
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,207
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

152
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,209
Oh, oh, I didn't know that.

153
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,377
Nash is going to stun
us all with his genius.

154
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,046
Which is another way of saying...

155
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,090
He doesn't have the nerve to compete.

156
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,384
You scared?

157
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,886
Terrified.

158
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,346
Mortified. Petrified.

159
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,098
Stupefied... by you.

160
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,725
No starch.

161
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,769
Pressed and folded.

162
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,690
Let me ask you something, John.

163
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,609
Be my guest, Martin.

164
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,444
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed...

165
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,571
Allen's proof of Peyrot's Conjecture.

166
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,698
Adequate work...

167
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,450
Without innovation.

168
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,285
Oh. I'm flattered. You flattered?

169
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,537
Flattered.

170
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,789
And I've got two weapons briefs...

171
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,250
Under security review by the D.O.D.

172
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,502
Derivative drivel.

173
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,380
But Nash achievements:

174
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,756
Zero.

175
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,676
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is
there an actual question coming?

176
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:40,180
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

177
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,224
Huh?

178
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,726
How will it feel when
I'm chosen for Wheeler...

179
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,980
And you're not?

180
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,693
What if you lose?

181
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,574
Ah, there it is.

182
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,872
You should not have won.

183
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,373
Hmmm.

184
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,001
I had the first move,
my-My play was perfect.

185
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,586
The hubris of the defeated.

186
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,880
The game is flawed.

187
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,888
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

188
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,565
You've been in here for two days.

189
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,486
You know Hansen's just
published another paper?

190
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,739
I can't even find a
topic for my doctorate.

191
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,952
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

192
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,874
This is a group playing touch football.

193
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:52,294
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

194
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,924
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

195
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:01,136
John, you watched a mugging.

196
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:02,638
That's weird.

197
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,390
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

198
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,186
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

199
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,606
See, if I could derive an equilibrium...

200
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:15,233
Where prevalence is
a non-Singular event,

201
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,652
Where nobody loses,

202
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,738
Can you imagine the
effect that would have...

203
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,742
On conflict scenarios, and arms
negotiations... When did you last eat?

204
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,286
When did you last eat?
...currency exchange?

205
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,080
You know, food.

206
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,167
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know that?

207
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,253
Yes. But pizza-

208
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,257
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.

209
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,427
And of course beer.

210
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:50,519
I have respect for beer.

211
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,356
I have respect for beer!

212
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,157
Good evening, Neils.Hey, Nash.

213
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,159
Who's winning? You or you?

214
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,912
Evening, Nash.Hey, guys.

215
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,872
Hey, Nash.

216
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,667
He's looking at you for sure.

217
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,048
Hey, Nash.

218
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,716
Neils is trying to get your attention.

219
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,136
You're joking. Oh, no.

220
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,852
Go with God. Come back a man.

221
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,981
Fortune favors the brave. Bombs away.

222
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:42,112
Gentlemen, might I remind
you that my odds of success...

223
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:44,156
Dramatically improve with each attempt.

224
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,834
This is going to be classic.

225
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,408
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

226
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,624
I don't exactly know what
I'm required to say...

227
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,417
In order for you to
have intercourse with me,

228
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,171
But could we assume
that I said all that?

229
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:44,132
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

230
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,092
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

231
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,095
Oh, that was sweet.

232
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,141
Have a nice night, asshole!

233
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:55,393
Ladies, wait!

234
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,229
L-

235
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,440
I especially liked the
bit about fluid exchange.

236
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,652
It was really charming.

237
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:09,449
Walk with me, John.

238
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,743
I've been meaning to talk with you.

239
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:15,789
The faculty is completing
mid-Year reviews.

240
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,333
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

241
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,460
Wheeler, sir. That
would be my first choice.

242
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,003
And actually, I don't really
have a second choice, sir.

243
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,256
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

244
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,258
They've written papers.
They've published.

245
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,136
I'm still searching, sir, for my-

246
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,930
Your original idea, I know.
Governing dynamics, sir.

247
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,682
It's very clever,
John, but I'm afraid...

248
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:36,142
It's just not nearly good enough.

249
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,109
May l? Thank you.

250
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,861
I've been working on manifold embedding.

251
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:49,030
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

252
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,740
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

253
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,867
If you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein-

254
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,911
I've repeatedly asked
you for that. Now, John.

255
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,455
I'd be able to show him my
revisions on his John? John.

256
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,127
Do you see what they're doing in there?

257
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,837
Congratulations. Thank you so much.

258
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,799
Congratulations, Professor Max.

259
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,260
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

260
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,720
It's the pens.

261
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,056
Reserved for a member
of the department...

262
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,016
That makes the
achievement of a lifetime.

263
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,769
Now, what do you see, John?

264
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,564
Recognition.

265
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,400
Well done, Professor. Well done.

266
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,902
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

267
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,779
Is there a difference?

268
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,156
John,

269
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:34,492
You haven't focused.

270
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,662
I'm sorry, but up to this point,

271
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,415
Your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

272
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,461
Good day.

273
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,849
And my compliments to you, sir.

274
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,976
Thank you so much.

275
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,578
I can't see it.

276
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,588
Aah! -Jesus Christ, John.

277
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,049
I can't fail.

278
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,010
This is all I am. Come on, let's go out.

279
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:36,054
I got to get something done. John!

280
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,973
I can't keep staring
into space. -John, enough!

281
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,559
Got to face the wall, follow
their rules, read their books,

282
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,144
You want to do some damage? Fine-

283
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,313
But don't mess around. Do their classes.

284
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:47,482
Come on! Go on, bust your head!

285
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,233
Kill yourself.

286
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,653
Don't do it. Don't mess around.

287
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,488
Bust your head! Go on,

288
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,490
Bust that worthless head wide open.

289
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,659
Goddamn it, Charles! What
the hell is your problem?!

290
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,706
It's not my problem.

291
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,001
And it's not your problem.

292
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,340
It's their problem.

293
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:15,510
Your answer isn't face the wall.

294
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:17,929
It's out there...

295
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,597
Where you've been working.

296
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,329
That was heavy.

297
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:49,085
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

298
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,962
He was onto something. Clever boy.

299
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:56,300
Don't worry, that's mine. I'll
come and get it in a minute.

300
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:58,720
Oh, God.

301
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:03,391
Incoming,
gentlemen.Ay-Yi-Yi.

302
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:09,105
Deep breaths.

303
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:11,941
Nash, you might want to stop...

304
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:15,236
Shuffling your papers for five seconds.

305
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,533
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

306
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:23,161
Oh, we're not here for beer, my friend.

307
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:26,164
Oh.

308
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:31,002
Does anyone else feel she
should be moving in slow motion?

309
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,713
Will she want a large wedding, ya think?

310
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:35,256
Shall we say swords, gentlemen?

311
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:38,301
Pistols at dawn? Have
you remembered nothing?

312
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:40,678
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,

313
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:42,722
The father of modern economics.

314
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,599
"In competition...

315
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:47,351
Individual ambition
serves the common good."

316
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,729
Exactly. Every man
for himself, gentlemen.

317
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:52,815
And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

318
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,734
I'm not gonna strike out.

319
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:57,278
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

320
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,363
I don't think he said
that. Nobody move-

321
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,490
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

322
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:04,243
Oh, God. He may have the upper hand now,

323
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,495
But wait until he opens his mouth.

324
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,706
Remember the last time?

325
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, yes, that was one
for the history books.

326
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:20,843
Adam Smith needs revision.
What are you talking about?

327
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,554
If we all go for the blonde,

328
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,644
We block each other.

329
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:34,023
Not a single one of us is gonna get her.

330
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:36,734
So then we go for her friends,

331
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,612
But they will all give
us the cold shoulder...

332
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:42,240
Because nobody likes
to be second choice.

333
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,243
Well, what if no one
goes for the blonde?

334
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,080
We don't get in each other's way,

335
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:52,083
And we don't insult the other girls.

336
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,419
That's the only way we win.

337
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:59,006
That's the only way we all get laid.

338
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,847
Adam Smith said...

339
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,307
The best result comes...

340
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,601
From everyone in the group doing...

341
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,186
What's best for himself, right?

342
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:13,229
That's what he said, right?

343
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:14,146
Right. Incomplete.

344
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,273
Incomplete, okay?

345
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:18,943
Because the best result will come...

346
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,696
From everyone in the group...

347
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,448
Doing what's best for himself...

348
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,283
And the group.

349
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,577
Nash, if this is some way for
you to get the blonde on your own,

350
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,372
You can go to hell. Governing dynamics.

351
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:34,458
Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

352
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,210
Was wrong.

353
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:39,046
Oh, here we go. Careful, careful.

354
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:43,342
Thank you.

355
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:57,982
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

356
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:02,338
You do realize this flies in the face...

357
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:05,174
Of a 1 50 years of economic
theory? Yes, I do, sir.

358
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:07,134
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

359
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,053
It is, sir.

360
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:17,853
Well, Mr. Nash,

361
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:20,856
With a breakthrough of this magnitude,

362
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,985
I'm confident you will
get any placement you like.

363
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:33,077
Wheeler Labs,

364
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:36,747
They'll ask you to
recommend two team members.

365
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,415
Yes!

366
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,544
Stills and Frank are excellent choices.

367
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:44,505
Sol and Bender, sir.

368
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:48,259
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

369
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,344
Has it occurred to you
that Sol and Bender...

370
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:51,971
Might have plans of their own?

371
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,518
We made it!

372
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,520
Wheeler, we made it!

373
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:05,276
Cheers, cheers, cheers! To Oh! Oh!

374
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:07,903
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

375
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:30,009
Umm...

376
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,969
Hmm.

377
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:34,596
Governing dynamics.

378
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,767
Congratulations, John. Thanks.

379
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,769
Toast! To Wheeler Labs!

380
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:42,896
To Wheeler!

381
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:09,423
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

382
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,258
Dr. Nash, your coat?

383
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,343
Thank you, sir.

384
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:17,389
Doctor. General, this is Wheeler
team leader Dr. John Nash.

385
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:19,224
Glad you could come, Doctor.

386
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:20,726
Hello.

387
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:22,686
Right this way.

388
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:26,523
We've been intercepting radio
transmissions from Moscow.

389
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:29,067
The computer can't detect a pattern,

390
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,861
But I'm sure it's code.

391
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:33,238
Why is that, General?

392
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:35,824
Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?

393
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,037
Constantly.

394
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,458
We've developed several ciphers.

395
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:48,545
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

396
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:53,717
Doctor?
6-7-3-7,

397
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,719

0-3-6...

398
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:11,318

8-4-9-4.

399
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,933
9-1
-4-0-3-4.

400
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,411
I need a map.

401
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,665
46-1
3-08,

402
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:09,334

67-46-90.

403
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,505
Starkey Corners, Maine.

404
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:16,425
48-03-01
,

405
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:19,886
91
-26-35.

406
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,805
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

407
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:24,850
These are latitudes and longitudes.

408
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,643
There are a least 1 0 others.

409
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:29,187
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

410
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,650
Extraordinary.

411
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:38,196
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

412
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:43,201
Who's Big Brother? You've done
your country a great service, son.

413
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:46,538
Captain! Yes, sir.

414
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,999
Accompany Dr. Nash.

415
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:52,002
What are the Russians moving, General?

416
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,670
Captain Rogers will escort you...

417
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:55,547
To the unrestricted area, Doctor.

418
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,257
Thank you.

419
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,718
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

420
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:10,228
None of those who have said
they don't like the method...

421
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:14,274
Have told us any other method they
could use that would be effective.

422
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:16,443
And when you hear... It's Dr. Nash.

423
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:18,487
All right.

424
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,794
Thank you, sir. Home
run at the Pentagon?

425
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:35,462
Have they actually taken
the word "classified"

426
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:36,797
Out of the dictionary?

427
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:40,467
Oh, hi. The air
conditioning broke again.

428
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,594
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world...

429
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,514
If I'm melting? Our
hearts go out to you.

430
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:48,600
You know, two trips to
the Pentagon in four years.

431
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:49,893
That's two more than we've had.

432
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:51,686
It gets better, John.

433
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,314
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

434
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:56,316
You know, the Russians have the H-Bomb,

435
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,485
The Nazis are
repatriating South America,

436
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:01,863
The Chinese have a standing
army of 2.8 million,

437
00:29:01,947 --> 00:29:05,450
And I am doing stress tests on a dam.

438
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:08,286
You made the cover of Fortune... again.

439
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,956
Please note the use of
the word "you," not "we."

440
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,500
That was supposed to be just me.

441
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,961
Oh.

442
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:19,256
So not only do they rob
me of the Fields Medal,

443
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:21,299
Now they put me on the
cover of Fortune magazine...

444
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:23,844
With these hacks, these
scholars of trivia.

445
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:25,512
John, exactly what's the difference...

446
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:28,348
Between genius and most genius?

447
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,183
Quite a lot.

448
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,060
He's your son.

449
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,979
Anyway, you've got 1 0 minutes.

450
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:35,772
I've always got 1 0 minutes.

451
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:38,108
Before your new class?

452
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:45,657
Can I not get a note from
a doctor or something?

453
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,286
You are a doctor, John, and no.

454
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:52,664
Now, come on, you know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities,

455
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,833
M.I. T. Gets America's
great minds of today...

456
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:56,960
Teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

457
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:58,545
Poor bastards.

458
00:29:58,628 --> 00:30:00,672
Now, have a nice day at school.

459
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,173
The bell's ringing.

460
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,447
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

461
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,667
Can we leave one open, Professor?

462
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:39,169
It's really hot, sir.

463
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:42,881
Your comfort comes second...

464
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:45,050
To my ability to hear my own voice.

465
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:52,849
Personally,

466
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:56,936
I think this class will
be a waste... of your-

467
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,855
And what is infinitely worse-

468
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,359
My time.

469
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:06,321
However, here we are.

470
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:10,200
So you may attend or not.

471
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,452
You may complete your
assignments at your whim.

472
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,746
We have begun.

473
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,917
Miss.

474
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:23,630
Excuse me!

475
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:26,174
Excuse me! Hey, hey!

476
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:28,009
Hi!

477
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:31,012
Um, we have a little problem.

478
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,182
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed...

479
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:36,851
And extremely noisy with them open.

480
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:39,270
So, I was wondering if
there was any way you could,

481
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:41,147
I don't know, maybe
work someplace else...

482
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:42,941
For about 45minutes?

483
00:31:43,024 --> 00:31:45,860
Not a problem. Thank you so much!

484
00:31:45,944 --> 00:31:47,862
At a break! Got it!

485
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:51,699
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

486
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:54,786
As you will find in
multivariable calculus,

487
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,621
There is often...

488
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:59,415
A number of solutions
for any given problem.

489
00:32:03,711 --> 00:32:05,421
As I was saying, this problem here...

490
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:09,259
Will take some of you
many months to solve.

491
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:11,094
For others among you,

492
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:15,598
It will take you the term
of your natural lives.

493
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,197
Professor Nash.

494
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,462
William Parcher.

495
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:52,135
Big Brother... at your service.

496
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:54,804
What can I do for the
Department of Defense?

497
00:32:54,888 --> 00:32:58,641
Are you here to give me a
raise? Let's take a walk.

498
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:02,854
Impressive work at the
Pentagon. Yes, it was.

499
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,314
Oppenheimer used to say,

500
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:06,899
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

501
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:08,901
You knew Oppenheimer?

502
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:11,654
His project was under my supervision.

503
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:13,698
Which project?

504
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:17,410
That project.

505
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,162
It's not that simple, you know?

506
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,872
Well, you ended the war.

507
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:24,542
We incinerated 1 50,000
people in a heartbeat.

508
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:27,503
Great deeds come at
great cost, Mr. Parcher.

509
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:31,215
Well, conviction, it turns out,

510
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:34,552
Is a luxury of those on
the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

511
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,348
I'll try and keep that in mind.

512
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:44,395
So, John, no family,

513
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:46,314
No close friends-

514
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:47,899
Why is that?

515
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,942
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

516
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:54,238
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

517
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:57,200
Well, there are certain endeavors...

518
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,077
Where your lack of
personal connection...

519
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,204
Would be considered an advantage.

520
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,417
This is a secure area. They know me.

521
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,713
Have you ever been here?

522
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,590
We were told during
our initial briefing...

523
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:14,634
That these warehouses were abandoned.

524
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,886
That's not precisely accurate.

525
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:55,800
By telling you what
I'm about to tell you,

526
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:57,593
I am increasing your
security clearance...

527
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:59,303
To top secret.

528
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:03,015
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

529
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,433
Get it?

530
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,477
What operation?

531
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,110
Those are a good idea.

532
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:21,617
This factory is in Berlin. We
seized it at the end of the war.

533
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,411
Nazi engineers were attempting...

534
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:26,080
To build a portable atomic bomb.

535
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:28,791
The Soviets reached this
facility before we did,

536
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,501
And we lost the damn thing.

537
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:34,964
The routing orders at the Pentagon,

538
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:37,216
They were about this, weren't they?

539
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,095
The Soviets aren't as
unified as people believe.

540
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:44,765
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

541
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,184
"The New Freedom," has
control of the bomb...

542
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:49,854
And intends to detonate it on U.S. Soil.

543
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:54,817
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

544
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:02,700
Man is capable of as much
atrocity as he has imagination.

545
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:07,622
New Freedom has sleeper
agents here in the U.S.

546
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:10,625
McCarthy is an idiot,

547
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,752
But unfortunately that
doesn't make him wrong.

548
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:16,714
New Freedom communicates
to its agents...

549
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:19,634
Through codes imbedded in
newspapers and magazines,

550
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:21,302
And that's where you come in.

551
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:25,640
You see, John, what distinguishes you...

552
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:27,475
Is that you are,

553
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:29,143
Quite simply,

554
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:32,980
The best natural
code-Breaker I have ever seen.

555
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:41,530
What exactly is it that
you would like me to do?

556
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:49,580
Commit this list of
periodicals to memory.

557
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:54,752
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

558
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,504
Decipher them.

559
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:00,716
Place your chin on the chin rest.

560
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:04,553
Stare into the light. Pulse 88, regular.

561
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:09,517
Okay, this may be a
little uncomfortable.

562
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,271
That's got a little
zap to it, doesn't it?

563
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:17,566
He just implanted a radium diode.

564
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,694
Don't worry, it's safe.

565
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:22,571
The isotope decays predictably.

566
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,825
As a result, these
numbers change overtime.

567
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:29,286
They're the access
codes to your drop spot.

568
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:34,208
So what am I now, a spy?

569
00:37:44,885 --> 00:37:48,431
Come.

570
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,937
Boy, you must be really important.

571
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:05,114
It's all right, Mike.

572
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:15,791
What are you working on?

573
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,795
Classified.

574
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:23,465
Everyone waited half an hour.

575
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:26,635
For? Class.

576
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:28,804
You missed class today.

577
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:32,641
Oh. I suspect that...

578
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:34,977
Nobody missed me.

579
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:39,231
The problem that you left on the board-

580
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,400
I solved it.

581
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:45,779
Oh, no you didn't. You didn't even look.

582
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:49,867
I never said that the vector
fields were rational functions.

583
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:56,290
Your solution is elegant.

584
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:01,128
Though on this particular occasion,

585
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:04,173
Ultimately incorrect.

586
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:29,198
You're still here. I'm still here.

587
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,742
Why?

588
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:35,329
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,

589
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:38,874
If I can ask you to dinner.

590
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:45,089
You do eat, don't you?

591
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,591
Oh, on occasion, yeah.

592
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:50,302
Table for one. Prometheus
alone chained to the rock...

593
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:52,680
With the bird circling
overhead, you know how it is.

594
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:57,935
No, I expect that you wouldn't-

595
00:39:58,018 --> 00:39:59,728
You wouldn't know, uh-

596
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:04,733
If you leave your
address with my office,

597
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:07,903
I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00...

598
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:10,531
And we'll eat.

599
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:20,207
One more thing. Do you have a name,

600
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,751
Or should I just keep
calling you "Miss"?

601
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:25,921
Governor,

602
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:28,507
May I present Miss Alicia Larde.

603
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,426
Miss Alicia Larde. How do you do?

604
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:32,469
Professor, please. You and the governor.

605
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:37,307
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.

606
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,394
I want a copy of this.

607
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:42,688
First big date and all, you know.

608
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:45,816
So, you boys need to look good.

609
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:49,111
Which is not a state
you find yourselves in...

610
00:40:49,153 --> 00:40:52,322
Altogether naturally.

611
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:57,953
There. Better.

612
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:02,082
I'm surprising him. You
just keep on surprising him.

613
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,959
Professor.

614
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,728
God must be a painter.

615
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:26,148
Why else would we have so many colors?

616
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:31,320
So you're a painter?

617
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:34,114
That's not actually what I said,

618
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,950
But, yes-

619
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:39,161
I am.

620
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:49,796
Here.

621
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,757
Me.

622
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,342
Your date?

623
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:58,096
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

624
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,265
That's a plan.

625
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:06,521
Champagne would be lovely.

626
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:09,858
I'll be outside.

627
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,027
I will get the champagne.

628
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:22,287
Oh, thank you.

629
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,040
Thank you for that.

630
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:27,459
No, keep it.

631
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:30,754
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.

632
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:32,673
Do you?

633
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:34,675
No.

634
00:42:34,758 --> 00:42:36,718
I don't believe in luck.

635
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:43,642
But I do believe in
assigning value to things.

636
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:46,478
Oh.

637
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:56,405
I once tried to count them all.

638
00:42:57,572 --> 00:43:02,244
I actually made it to 4,348.

639
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:06,707
You are exceptionally odd.

640
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,626
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

641
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:17,426
A pair of odd ducks, then.

642
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:20,095
Mmm.

643
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:24,683
Pick a shape.

644
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:27,728
What?

645
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:32,023
Pick a shape. An animal Anything.

646
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,069
Okay.

647
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,655
An umbrella.

648
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:18,570
Do it again.

649
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:20,238
Do it again. All right.

650
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:21,990
What would you like? Do, uh...

651
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:24,576
An octopus.

652
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,664
You don't talk much, do you?

653
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:19,501
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

654
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:21,377
I don't mean work.

655
00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:28,968
I find that polishing my interactions...

656
00:47:29,052 --> 00:47:32,013
In order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

657
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:36,267
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow...

658
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:40,939
By being direct.

659
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:44,442
I often don't get a pleasant result.

660
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:45,777
Try me.

661
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:49,531
All right.

662
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,161
I find you attractive.

663
00:47:56,412 --> 00:47:58,373
Your aggressive moves towards me...

664
00:47:58,414 --> 00:48:00,208
Indicate that you feel the same way.

665
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:03,086
But still, ritual requires that we...

666
00:48:03,169 --> 00:48:05,880
Continue with a number
of platonic activities...

667
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:08,216
Before we have sex.

668
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:11,553
I am proceeding with those activities,

669
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:13,596
But in point of actual fact,

670
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,767
All I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

671
00:48:19,936 --> 00:48:22,063
Are you gonna slap me now?

672
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:48,756
How was that result?

673
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,734
What are you doing?

674
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:14,824
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences...

675
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:17,577
Within periodicals over time. And you?

676
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,829
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

677
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,002
Do I know you?

678
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:28,421
My uncle says you're very smart...

679
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:30,173
But not very nice,

680
00:49:30,256 --> 00:49:32,341
So I shouldn't pay no
mind if you're mean to me.

681
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:34,427
And who might your uncle be?

682
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,971
The prodigal roommate...

683
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:38,931
Returns.

684
00:49:42,351 --> 00:49:45,104
Come here. Charles, Charles, Charles.

685
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:52,487
My sister...

686
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:54,864
Got herself killed in a car crash.

687
00:49:55,907 --> 00:49:57,533
Not too far now, Marcee!

688
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,661
Her cowboy husband was too drunk...

689
00:50:00,703 --> 00:50:03,206
To know that he was too drunk to drive.

690
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:05,708
So, I took her in.

691
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:10,379
She's so small. She's young,
John. That's how they come.

692
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:14,550
I'm at Harvard...

693
00:50:14,634 --> 00:50:17,345
Doing the great author's workshop.

694
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:19,472
D.H. Bloody Lawrence.

695
00:50:19,555 --> 00:50:21,682
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

696
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:26,938
Well, I've been reading a lot about you.

697
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:30,191
How are you, John?

698
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:33,319
At first all my work here was trivial,

699
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:36,030
But a new assignment came up and-

700
00:50:36,113 --> 00:50:39,158
I can't really tell you any details.

701
00:50:39,242 --> 00:50:41,536
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

702
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:43,746
Something like that.

703
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:47,542
And, uh... Yes?

704
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,544
Well, l I met a girl.

705
00:50:49,585 --> 00:50:52,547
No! A human girl? Homo sapiens.

706
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:54,757
A biped? Yup. And contrary
to all probabilities,

707
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:56,801
She finds me attractive on
a number of different levels.

708
00:50:56,843 --> 00:50:58,219
Really?

709
00:50:58,261 --> 00:51:01,514
God, that's wonderful.

710
00:51:01,597 --> 00:51:04,392
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

711
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:08,563
Should I marry her?

712
00:51:08,604 --> 00:51:10,606
Oh, God. Right.

713
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:12,900
I mean, everything's going well.

714
00:51:12,984 --> 00:51:15,570
The job is fine. I have enough money.

715
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:17,363
It all seems to add up.

716
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:20,324
But how do you know for sure?

717
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:25,705
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

718
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:27,832
That's the only sure thing I do know.

719
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,841
Good evening.

720
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,600
Alicia, please don't be angry.

721
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:47,184
I just lost track of time at work...

722
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:50,396
Again. Mm-Hmm.

723
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:52,898
I'm sorry.

724
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,943
I didn't have time to wrap it.

725
00:51:55,985 --> 00:51:58,487
Happy birthday.

726
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:04,827
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

727
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,746
They create a full wavelength dispersal,

728
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:08,789
So if you look inside it, you can see-

729
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:11,500
Every possible color.
Every possible color.

730
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:13,002
Yeah.

731
00:52:13,085 --> 00:52:15,463
Remember you said that
time God must be a painter,

732
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:18,299
Because of all the colors,
at the governor's house?

733
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:20,176
You said that.

734
00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:22,428
I didn't think you were listening.

735
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:26,974
I'm always listening.

736
00:52:33,272 --> 00:52:35,941
It's beautiful.

737
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:54,877
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-Term commitment?

738
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,712
'Cause I need some kind of proof,

739
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:59,006
Some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

740
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,807
I'm sorry, just give me a moment...

741
00:53:09,308 --> 00:53:12,311
To redefine my girlish
notions of romance.

742
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:17,817
A proof?

743
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,485
Verifiable data.

744
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:22,196
Um... okay.

745
00:53:24,156 --> 00:53:27,868
Well, how big is the universe?

746
00:53:27,952 --> 00:53:29,537
Infinite.

747
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,871
How do you know?

748
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:32,706
I know because all the data indicate it.

749
00:53:32,748 --> 00:53:34,500
But it hasn't been proven yet? No.

750
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,377
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

751
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,421
I don't, I just believe it.

752
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,048
Mmm.

753
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,885
It's the same with love, I guess.

754
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,103
Now,

755
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:56,313
The part that you don't know...

756
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:01,318
Is if I want to marry you.

757
00:54:22,214 --> 00:54:24,466
Smile for the camera!

758
00:54:27,636 --> 00:54:29,138
Well done!

759
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:31,140
Oh, sweet pea.

760
00:54:31,223 --> 00:54:32,933
I love you. Congratulations.

761
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:34,768
Hey, Sol.

762
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,062
You look beautiful.

763
00:54:38,147 --> 00:54:39,356
Hi, how are you?

764
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:46,280
Hey, Sol.

765
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:48,324
Bye bye. Bye, now.

766
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:50,409
Bye! Bye!

767
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:52,119
Be safe!

768
00:55:21,273 --> 00:55:23,108
Get in. Hurry.

769
00:55:26,528 --> 00:55:29,448
They're following us.

770
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:34,620
Who's Who's following us?

771
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:36,330
The drop's been compromised.

772
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:38,290
Get down!

773
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,418
Stay down.

774
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,365
Here, take this. I
ain't shooting anybody.

775
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:14,159
Take the goddamn gun! No!

776
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,828
Son of a-

777
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:34,555
You stay back. Don't move.

778
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:23,770
John?

779
00:57:29,985 --> 00:57:31,445
Hi.

780
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,574
Where were you?

781
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:41,496
S-SolYeah, I talked to Sol.

782
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,207
He said you left the office hours ago.

783
00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:49,254
Why didn't you call me?

784
00:57:53,675 --> 00:57:55,302
Are you all right?

785
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:06,313
Honey?

786
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,483
John...

787
00:58:09,524 --> 00:58:12,611
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

788
00:58:13,695 --> 00:58:15,989
John, open the door.

789
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:20,661
Come on, open the door! Let me in!

790
00:58:20,702 --> 00:58:22,704
Talk to me!

791
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:25,290
John!

792
00:58:25,374 --> 00:58:28,418
Open the door!

793
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,812
Watch for cars, kids.

794
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,356
John.

795
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,859
William.

796
00:59:33,942 --> 00:59:36,236
This is not what I signed on for.

797
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:38,280
Every time a car
backfires or a door slams-

798
00:59:38,363 --> 00:59:42,159
I understand Better than
you could possibly imagine.

799
00:59:51,877 --> 00:59:54,379
You need to calm down, John.

800
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:57,090
Now listen to me. We're
closing in on the bomb,

801
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:59,551
In large part due to your work.

802
00:59:59,634 --> 01:00:02,262
Now don't you think your
fear is a small price to pay?

803
01:00:02,304 --> 01:00:05,140
William, my circumstance has changed.

804
01:00:05,223 --> 01:00:07,559
Alicia's pregnant.

805
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:18,945
I told you attachments were dangerous.

806
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:21,990
You chose to marry the girl.

807
01:00:22,073 --> 01:00:24,618
I did nothing to prevent it.

808
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:29,831
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

809
01:00:29,915 --> 01:00:32,083
Is for you to continue your work.

810
01:00:33,168 --> 01:00:34,753
Well, I'll just quit.

811
01:00:34,836 --> 01:00:36,630
You won't.

812
01:00:36,671 --> 01:00:38,298
Why would I not?

813
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,468
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

814
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,304
You quit working for me,

815
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:47,057
I quit working for you.

816
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:01,321
Parcher!

817
01:01:01,363 --> 01:01:02,864
Parcher!

818
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:09,454
John, you all right?

819
01:01:30,225 --> 01:01:31,643
John?

820
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:33,311
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

821
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:38,733
Why would you do that?

822
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:40,485
Why would you turn the light on?

823
01:01:40,568 --> 01:01:42,028
What is wrong with you?

824
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,988
You have to go to your sister's.

825
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:47,742
I left the car out the
back. You take Commonwealth.

826
01:01:47,826 --> 01:01:50,870
No side streets, you stay where it's
crowded. John, I'm not going anywhere!

827
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:53,373
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

828
01:01:53,415 --> 01:01:55,542
No, I'm not going. Just get your things.

829
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,169
I'm not leaving Stop! Stop it!

830
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:00,839
Please, Alicia.

831
01:02:00,922 --> 01:02:04,175
I'll explain when I can.

832
01:02:50,638 --> 01:02:52,557
Uncle John!

833
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,726
Uncle John!

834
01:02:56,978 --> 01:03:00,398
Hey, baby girl!

835
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:03,276
Wow, someone needed a hug!

836
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:05,945
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

837
01:03:05,987 --> 01:03:08,239
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture...

838
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:10,450
By the inimitable John Nash?"

839
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:15,455
What's wrong?

840
01:03:15,497 --> 01:03:20,627
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

841
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:22,504
Well, now you tell me, what is it?

842
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:24,797
Professor Nash!

843
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,091
Welcome!

844
01:03:28,843 --> 01:03:30,595
After?

845
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:40,355
So, we see that the The zeroes,

846
01:03:40,438 --> 01:03:43,024
Of the Reimann Zeta function,

847
01:03:43,107 --> 01:03:45,818
Correspond to singularities...

848
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:49,155
In space-Time,

849
01:03:49,197 --> 01:03:52,116
Singularities
in space-Time-

850
01:03:55,036 --> 01:03:57,872
And conventional number theory...

851
01:03:59,874 --> 01:04:04,337
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

852
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:21,813
Sometimes our expectations...

853
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:24,315
Are betrayed by the numbers.

854
01:04:24,399 --> 01:04:27,402
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

855
01:04:27,485 --> 01:04:30,029
Rational value.

856
01:04:49,924 --> 01:04:52,010
Professor Nash!

857
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,397
Hold it! Professor Nash?

858
01:05:06,357 --> 01:05:08,609
Professor Nash,

859
01:05:08,693 --> 01:05:12,113
Let's avoid a scene, shall we?

860
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:14,198
What do you want?

861
01:05:14,282 --> 01:05:16,909
My name is Rosen,

862
01:05:16,951 --> 01:05:18,953
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

863
01:05:19,036 --> 01:05:22,123
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

864
01:05:22,206 --> 01:05:24,876
I'd like you to come with me, John.

865
01:05:25,877 --> 01:05:27,795
Just for a chat.

866
01:05:28,963 --> 01:05:30,882
It appears I have no choice.

867
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:35,511
Oh-Hh!

868
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:44,187
Help me! Somebody!

869
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:49,734
Somebody!

870
01:05:49,817 --> 01:05:53,279
Help me! Get off me!

871
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:55,656
I know who you are! I know who you are!

872
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,408
No, no, no, no, don't.

873
01:05:57,492 --> 01:05:59,327
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

874
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:01,245
Call somebody! Call somebody, Charles!

875
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:02,788
They're Russians! Steady the leg.

876
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,624
Get away from me.

877
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:06,918
Stay away from me!

878
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,342
There, now.

879
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:16,260
All better.

880
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:22,141
Everything's all right here.

881
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:26,062
Watch your head.

882
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:58,469
John?

883
01:06:59,553 --> 01:07:01,555
Can you hear me?

884
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:17,363
Go easy now.

885
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:20,324
Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.

886
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:25,705
Sorry about the restraints.

887
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:28,332
You've got one hell of a right hook.

888
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:31,544
Where am l?

889
01:07:31,585 --> 01:07:33,254
Ahem.

890
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:35,673
MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.

891
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:41,512
I find that highly unlikely.

892
01:07:41,595 --> 01:07:43,055
You made a mistake.

893
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:47,059
My work is non-Military in application.

894
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:49,603
Which work is that, John?

895
01:07:51,772 --> 01:07:53,566
I don't know anything.

896
01:07:53,607 --> 01:07:56,193
There's no good in
keeping secrets, you know.

897
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,670
Charles?

898
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,631
Charles?

899
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:21,302
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

900
01:08:23,637 --> 01:08:25,514
I'm I'm sorry.

901
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:32,229
Charles?

902
01:08:39,403 --> 01:08:40,821
The prodigal roommate revealed.

903
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:46,911
"Saw my name on the lecture slate."

904
01:08:46,994 --> 01:08:49,121
You lying son of a bitch!

905
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:51,916
Who are you talking
to? Tell me who you see.

906
01:08:51,999 --> 01:08:54,585
How do you say, "Charles
Herman" in Russian?

907
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:57,129
How do you say it in Russian?

908
01:08:57,213 --> 01:09:00,508
There's no one there,
John. There's no one there.

909
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:03,135
He's right there. He's right there.

910
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:06,305
Stop! I don't know anything!

911
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:09,058
Stop! L I don't know anything!

912
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:13,312
My name is John Nash.

913
01:09:13,354 --> 01:09:14,980
I'm being held against my will.

914
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:17,608
Somebody call the Department of Defense.

915
01:09:17,691 --> 01:09:19,485
My name is John Nash.

916
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:22,029
I'm being held against my will!

917
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:29,578
What's wrong with him?

918
01:09:32,248 --> 01:09:34,500
John has schizophrenia.

919
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:38,337
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

920
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:43,801
But But his work.

921
01:09:43,884 --> 01:09:46,136
He deals with conspiracies...

922
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:49,390
Yes, yes, I know.

923
01:09:49,473 --> 01:09:53,644
In John's world, these
behaviors are... accepted,

924
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:55,354
Encouraged.

925
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:58,857
As such, his illness may
have gone untreated...

926
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:00,693
Far longer than is typical.

927
01:10:01,819 --> 01:10:03,320
What do you mean? How long?

928
01:10:03,404 --> 01:10:05,531
Possibly since graduate school?

929
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:08,867
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

930
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:11,245
What are you talking
about? What hallucinations?

931
01:10:11,328 --> 01:10:13,539
One, so far, that I am aware of.

932
01:10:13,622 --> 01:10:17,042
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

933
01:10:18,586 --> 01:10:20,546
Charles isn't imaginary.

934
01:10:20,588 --> 01:10:23,215
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

935
01:10:23,257 --> 01:10:26,260
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

936
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:29,221
He's always in town for
so little time, lecturing.

937
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:32,057
Was he at your wedding? He had to teach.

938
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:33,767
Have you ever seen a picture of him,

939
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:36,395
Talked to him on the
telephone? This is ridiculous.

940
01:10:36,478 --> 01:10:38,689
I phoned Princeton.

941
01:10:38,772 --> 01:10:40,566
According to their housing records,

942
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:42,526
John lived alone.

943
01:10:45,446 --> 01:10:48,907
Now, which is more
likely That your husband,

944
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:51,243
A mathematician with
no military training,

945
01:10:51,285 --> 01:10:53,746
Is a government spy
fleeing the Russians-

946
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:55,456
You're making him sound crazy.

947
01:10:55,539 --> 01:10:58,751
...or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

948
01:11:01,211 --> 01:11:02,921
Now the only way I can help him...

949
01:11:02,963 --> 01:11:04,298
Is to show him the difference...

950
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:07,134
Between what's real...

951
01:11:07,217 --> 01:11:09,386
And what is in his mind.

952
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:13,932
Come on.

953
01:11:15,642 --> 01:11:17,936
What's he been working on?

954
01:11:17,978 --> 01:11:20,939
His work is classified.

955
01:11:20,981 --> 01:11:23,275
He mentioned a supervisor...

956
01:11:23,317 --> 01:11:25,819
By the name of William Parcher.

957
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:28,906
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

958
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:31,450
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

959
01:11:32,326 --> 01:11:33,994
You want me to help you get...

960
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:36,080
The details of my husband's work?

961
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:39,625
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

962
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:41,668
Is that what you think?

963
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,801
What did the doctor say? Is he sick?

964
01:11:48,842 --> 01:11:50,469
I don't know.

965
01:11:50,552 --> 01:11:52,429
I want to see what
John's been working on.

966
01:11:52,513 --> 01:11:55,474
You know you can't go in his
office. It's classified, Alicia.

967
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:57,518
Stop. Oh!

968
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:12,741
Oh, my God.

969
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,789
Oh, my God.

970
01:12:25,712 --> 01:12:28,715
Why didn't you say something?

971
01:12:28,757 --> 01:12:31,802
Alicia, John's always been...

972
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:34,221
A little weird.

973
01:12:34,304 --> 01:12:36,515
He said he was doing code-Breaking,

974
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:38,725
That it was eyes-Only.

975
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,812
Top secret, part of the
military effort. Was he?

976
01:12:41,895 --> 01:12:44,356
Well, it was possible, you know?

977
01:12:44,398 --> 01:12:45,858
Directives come down all the time...

978
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:47,317
That some of us aren't cleared for.

979
01:12:47,401 --> 01:12:49,862
It was possible. Possible, but...

980
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:51,697
Not likely.

981
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:56,201
Lately, he'd become so
much more agitated...

982
01:12:56,243 --> 01:12:58,412
And then when you called-

983
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:01,081
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

984
01:13:01,164 --> 01:13:03,500
Cutting out magazines?

985
01:13:05,085 --> 01:13:07,754
Well, not all.

986
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:32,422
I'm so sorry. It's okay.

987
01:14:35,717 --> 01:14:37,719
I missed you. I missed you.

988
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,099
I have to talk to you.

989
01:14:42,182 --> 01:14:44,226
Okay.

990
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:51,483
Alicia, I've been thinking about it,

991
01:14:51,566 --> 01:14:55,153
And I do realize that my behavior...

992
01:14:55,237 --> 01:14:58,323
And my inability to discuss
the situation with you...

993
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:00,826
Must have appeared insane.

994
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:03,120
I left you with no other choice.

995
01:15:03,203 --> 01:15:05,330
I do understand...

996
01:15:05,413 --> 01:15:08,291
And I'm truly sorry. That's okay.

997
01:15:09,668 --> 01:15:11,920
Everything's gonna be all right.

998
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:15,590
Everything's gonna be all right.

999
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:18,593
We just have to talk quietly.

1000
01:15:20,137 --> 01:15:24,349
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1001
01:15:24,391 --> 01:15:26,977
I'm gonna tell you everything now.

1002
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,521
It's breaking with protocol...

1003
01:15:29,563 --> 01:15:31,523
But you need to know,

1004
01:15:31,565 --> 01:15:35,443
Because you have to
help me get out of here.

1005
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:40,156
I've been doing top secret
work for the government.

1006
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,992
There's a threat that exists...

1007
01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:44,703
Of catastrophic proportions.

1008
01:15:44,786 --> 01:15:47,664
I think the Russians feel
my profile is too high.

1009
01:15:47,706 --> 01:15:50,083
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1010
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:52,502
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me...

1011
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:54,880
From doing my work. You
have to get to Wheeler.

1012
01:15:54,921 --> 01:15:57,007
You have to find William Parcher. Stop.

1013
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,010
He can help us. Stop. Stop. Stop!

1014
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:06,558
I went to Wheeler.

1015
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,268
Good, good.

1016
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:10,395
There is no William Parcher.

1017
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,731
Of course there is.

1018
01:16:12,772 --> 01:16:14,858
I've been working for him. Doing what?

1019
01:16:14,941 --> 01:16:17,027
Breaking codes?

1020
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:19,195
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox...

1021
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:21,197
For the government to pick up?

1022
01:16:22,824 --> 01:16:24,576
How could you know that?

1023
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,786
Sol followed you.

1024
01:16:27,704 --> 01:16:30,332
He thought it was
harmless. Sol followed me?

1025
01:16:39,466 --> 01:16:42,052
They've never been opened.

1026
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:47,432
It isn't real.

1027
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,727
There is no conspiracy, John.

1028
01:16:53,063 --> 01:16:55,899
There is no William Parcher.

1029
01:16:56,983 --> 01:16:59,402
It's in your mind.

1030
01:17:00,987 --> 01:17:04,616
Do you understand, baby?

1031
01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:07,327
You're sick.

1032
01:17:10,246 --> 01:17:12,582
You're sick, John.

1033
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,292
John!

1034
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:16,252
John!

1035
01:17:24,594 --> 01:17:26,262
Code red.

1036
01:17:26,346 --> 01:17:28,807
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1037
01:17:28,848 --> 01:17:32,435
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1038
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:45,740
John?

1039
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:49,285
John?

1040
01:17:51,204 --> 01:17:53,540
The implant's gone.

1041
01:17:53,623 --> 01:17:56,584
I can't find it.

1042
01:18:00,213 --> 01:18:02,424
It's gone.

1043
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:36,666
You see, the nightmare
of schizophrenia...

1044
01:18:36,749 --> 01:18:39,085
Is not knowing what's true.

1045
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:41,671
Imagine...

1046
01:18:41,754 --> 01:18:44,883
If you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places...

1047
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:47,927
And the moments most important to you...

1048
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:50,513
Were not gone, not dead,

1049
01:18:50,597 --> 01:18:53,057
But worse-

1050
01:18:53,141 --> 01:18:55,059
Had never been.

1051
01:18:57,645 --> 01:19:00,565
What kind of hell would that be?

1052
01:19:05,695 --> 01:19:07,697
Administering insulin.

1053
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:11,034
8.42AM.

1054
01:20:08,758 --> 01:20:10,927
How often?

1055
01:20:12,512 --> 01:20:15,431
Five times a week for 1 0 weeks.

1056
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:42,166
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

1057
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,002
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1058
01:20:45,044 --> 01:20:46,713
So he keeps reminding
us, and reminding us.

1059
01:20:48,756 --> 01:20:50,174
Yeah.

1060
01:20:50,216 --> 01:20:52,468
John won't come near the campus, though.

1061
01:20:52,552 --> 01:20:55,471
I think he's ashamed.

1062
01:20:55,555 --> 01:20:58,516
Hey. Hey.

1063
01:20:58,558 --> 01:21:00,685
Want this?

1064
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:04,397
So, Alicia, how How are you holding up?

1065
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,233
Well, the delusions have passed.

1066
01:21:07,316 --> 01:21:09,569
They're saying with the medication...

1067
01:21:09,652 --> 01:21:11,237
And low stress environment-

1068
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,115
No, l I mean, how are you?

1069
01:21:21,414 --> 01:21:23,666
I think often what I feel...

1070
01:21:23,749 --> 01:21:26,961
Is obligation.

1071
01:21:29,046 --> 01:21:32,341
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

1072
01:21:33,634 --> 01:21:37,847
Rage against John, against God and-

1073
01:21:39,932 --> 01:21:41,225
But...

1074
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:46,480
Then I look at him...

1075
01:21:48,065 --> 01:21:52,361
And I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1076
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:55,239
And he becomes that man.

1077
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:59,702
He's transformed into
someone that I love.

1078
01:22:01,662 --> 01:22:05,208
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.

1079
01:22:08,085 --> 01:22:10,087
It's not all the time,

1080
01:22:10,129 --> 01:22:12,965
But...

1081
01:22:13,049 --> 01:22:14,759
It's enough.

1082
01:22:14,842 --> 01:22:17,803
I think John is a very lucky man...

1083
01:22:17,887 --> 01:22:19,555
Alicia.

1084
01:22:24,143 --> 01:22:26,896
So unlucky.

1085
01:22:29,899 --> 01:22:31,984
This is us. This is it?

1086
01:22:32,068 --> 01:22:34,779
It's nice. It's near where I work.

1087
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,323
John? You've a visitor.

1088
01:22:39,992 --> 01:22:41,953
Hi.

1089
01:22:41,994 --> 01:22:43,579
Hi.

1090
01:22:43,663 --> 01:22:45,539
I hope it's okay.

1091
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:54,590
Hey ya, chief.

1092
01:22:54,632 --> 01:22:58,594
Cigarette? Ah, no, thanks.

1093
01:22:58,678 --> 01:23:00,763
I quit, actually.

1094
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:06,769
Hello. Hey, John.

1095
01:23:09,105 --> 01:23:10,648
Have you met Harvey?

1096
01:23:10,731 --> 01:23:12,149
Umm, l...

1097
01:23:13,526 --> 01:23:15,444
-John, there's no
- Relax, it's okay.

1098
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:18,155
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

1099
01:23:18,197 --> 01:23:20,199
Jesus Christ, John.

1100
01:23:20,282 --> 01:23:21,909
I should have known.

1101
01:23:23,369 --> 01:23:25,246
Here you go.

1102
01:23:26,789 --> 01:23:28,708
I can take those later.

1103
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:30,334
You're supposed to take them now.

1104
01:23:31,711 --> 01:23:35,047
Can I bring you something? I'm okay.

1105
01:23:35,131 --> 01:23:36,632
Okay.

1106
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,179
So, um... yeah. I I was in town...

1107
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,390
Giving a workshop.

1108
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:46,475
I go back tonight.

1109
01:23:46,517 --> 01:23:48,811
You know, Bender, he really wanted...

1110
01:23:48,894 --> 01:23:53,399
To stop by and you know,
see you. You know, say hi.

1111
01:23:53,482 --> 01:23:55,151
Squeamish?

1112
01:23:55,192 --> 01:23:57,653
Yeah.

1113
01:23:57,695 --> 01:24:00,197
I suppose I would be, too.

1114
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,241
But alas, I'm stuck with me.

1115
01:24:05,703 --> 01:24:08,914
I'm trying to solve the
Reimann hypothesis. Uh-Huh.

1116
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:12,376
Oh, yeah?

1117
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,588
I figured if If I dazzle them,

1118
01:24:15,671 --> 01:24:17,840
They will have to reinstate me.

1119
01:24:19,383 --> 01:24:22,928
But it's difficult with the medication,

1120
01:24:23,012 --> 01:24:26,432
Because it's hard to...

1121
01:24:28,517 --> 01:24:30,060
See the solution.

1122
01:24:38,569 --> 01:24:41,405
You know, John, you should go easy.

1123
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:44,450
There are other things besides-

1124
01:24:44,533 --> 01:24:45,826
Besides work.

1125
01:24:48,245 --> 01:24:50,372
What are they?

1126
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:10,309
Shh-Hh.

1127
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,270
Shh.

1128
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:28,369
What are you thinking about?

1129
01:25:31,538 --> 01:25:33,457
What do people do?

1130
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,960
It's life, John.

1131
01:25:36,043 --> 01:25:38,003
Activities available,

1132
01:25:38,087 --> 01:25:40,673
Just add meaning.

1133
01:25:48,097 --> 01:25:50,266
You could try leaving the house.

1134
01:25:50,307 --> 01:25:53,769
You know, maybe...

1135
01:25:53,811 --> 01:25:55,938
Talk to people.

1136
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:02,903
You could try taking out the garbage.

1137
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,678
And there's some more
There's some more in...

1138
01:26:40,065 --> 01:26:42,526
Who Who were you talking to?

1139
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:44,653
Garbage man.

1140
01:26:53,954 --> 01:26:56,498
Garbage men don't come at night.

1141
01:26:59,251 --> 01:27:01,295
I guess around here they do.

1142
01:27:27,571 --> 01:27:29,698
Sorry.

1143
01:28:35,681 --> 01:28:38,392
Is it the medication?

1144
01:29:18,849 --> 01:29:21,310
I don't know what to do.

1145
01:29:39,077 --> 01:29:41,997
My mother's going to keep the
baby a little longer tonight.

1146
01:29:43,248 --> 01:29:45,375
I can get three hours of overtime.

1147
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:13,403
I'm going to bed.

1148
01:30:20,077 --> 01:30:23,038
Good night. Good night.

1149
01:31:41,116 --> 01:31:43,660
It's good to see you, John.

1150
01:31:44,828 --> 01:31:46,830
It's been a while.

1151
01:31:46,913 --> 01:31:48,873
Parcher?

1152
01:31:48,957 --> 01:31:51,042
Yes, sir.

1153
01:31:54,546 --> 01:31:56,047
You're not real!

1154
01:31:56,131 --> 01:31:58,883
Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.

1155
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,932
I don't think that I
would go that way, John.

1156
01:32:07,434 --> 01:32:09,811
It's time for you to get back to work.

1157
01:32:09,853 --> 01:32:12,856
The bomb is in its final position...

1158
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:14,441
Here in the U.S.

1159
01:32:15,775 --> 01:32:17,652
Knowing your situation...

1160
01:32:17,694 --> 01:32:20,363
Requires you keep a
low profile, "Mohammed,"

1161
01:32:20,447 --> 01:32:23,575
We've brought the mountain to you.

1162
01:32:42,594 --> 01:32:45,388
We've narrowed the bomb's
location to somewhere...

1163
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:47,223
On the eastern seaboard.

1164
01:32:47,307 --> 01:32:51,936
But we haven't been able to
pinpoint its exact position.

1165
01:32:54,272 --> 01:32:56,900
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1166
01:32:59,611 --> 01:33:01,821
Here, look at this, John.

1167
01:33:04,282 --> 01:33:06,076
What?

1168
01:33:06,117 --> 01:33:07,494
What?

1169
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:13,708
Dr. Rosen said
- Rosen! That quack!

1170
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:15,752
"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?

1171
01:33:15,794 --> 01:33:17,754
Psychological bullshit!

1172
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:19,798
Look at me, John.

1173
01:33:19,881 --> 01:33:22,258
John, look at me.

1174
01:33:24,052 --> 01:33:26,054
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1175
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:30,475
Wheeler has no record of you.

1176
01:33:30,558 --> 01:33:33,019
Do you think we list our personnel?

1177
01:33:35,146 --> 01:33:38,316
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1178
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:41,820
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1179
01:33:41,903 --> 01:33:44,614
I can restore your status at Wheeler.

1180
01:33:44,697 --> 01:33:47,408
I can let the world know what you did.

1181
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:50,036
But I need you now, soldier.

1182
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,419
I was so scared you weren't real.

1183
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:08,680
There's a storm coming.

1184
01:34:08,763 --> 01:34:11,015
I'm just going to
grab the laundry, okay?

1185
01:34:11,099 --> 01:34:13,101
I'll draw his bath.

1186
01:34:16,354 --> 01:34:18,147
It's okay.

1187
01:34:19,524 --> 01:34:21,359
Okay.

1188
01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:01,793
John?

1189
01:36:07,673 --> 01:36:10,426
I've almost got it! Charles,
you just watch the baby.

1190
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:11,677
I've got one more to close!

1191
01:36:11,761 --> 01:36:13,679
No! I'll be right there.

1192
01:36:13,763 --> 01:36:16,391
Oh, God.

1193
01:36:18,434 --> 01:36:21,187
I need a towel.

1194
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:24,399
Shhh.

1195
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,109
Charles was watching him. He was okay.

1196
01:36:26,192 --> 01:36:27,985
There is no one here.

1197
01:36:29,403 --> 01:36:31,322
Charles was watching
him. There is no one here!

1198
01:36:31,364 --> 01:36:33,282
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1199
01:36:33,449 --> 01:36:35,118
I can see him because of a chemical...

1200
01:36:35,201 --> 01:36:37,328
That was released into my bloodstream...

1201
01:36:37,411 --> 01:36:39,872
When my implant dissolved.

1202
01:36:41,499 --> 01:36:43,459
I couldn't tell you, it
was for your own protection!

1203
01:36:45,044 --> 01:36:45,795
Alicia!

1204
01:36:51,467 --> 01:36:54,971
No! Hello, I need Dr.
Rosen's office, please.

1205
01:36:55,054 --> 01:36:56,764
You've got to stop her, John.

1206
01:36:58,099 --> 01:37:00,351
You leave her out of this.

1207
01:37:02,103 --> 01:37:04,814
Who are you talking
to? It's not her fault.

1208
01:37:04,856 --> 01:37:07,150
-John. She'll compromise us again.

1209
01:37:07,233 --> 01:37:09,610
No, she won't. You'll
go back to the hospital.

1210
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:11,779
-John, answer me!
Countless people will die.

1211
01:37:11,821 --> 01:37:13,489
Alicia, please, put the phone down.

1212
01:37:13,573 --> 01:37:16,159
I can't let that happen. Yes, hello?

1213
01:37:16,242 --> 01:37:18,494
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?

1214
01:37:18,578 --> 01:37:21,038
I'm sorry, John.

1215
01:37:22,081 --> 01:37:23,708
No-Oo!

1216
01:37:26,252 --> 01:37:28,004
Alicia?

1217
01:37:28,087 --> 01:37:30,006
You know what you have to do, Nash.

1218
01:37:30,089 --> 01:37:31,507
Get away from me.
She's too great a risk.

1219
01:37:31,591 --> 01:37:33,843
Get away!

1220
01:37:33,885 --> 01:37:35,928
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1221
01:37:37,597 --> 01:37:41,100
Finish her. She knows too much now.

1222
01:37:43,603 --> 01:37:45,521
Uncle John?

1223
01:37:45,605 --> 01:37:47,607
Take care of her, you
pathetic piece of shit,

1224
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,025
Or I'll take care of you.

1225
01:37:49,066 --> 01:37:50,526
John,

1226
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:53,237
Christ, John, please do what he says.

1227
01:37:53,321 --> 01:37:56,073
Move, soldier.

1228
01:37:56,157 --> 01:37:57,617
Now.

1229
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,910
Uncle John?

1230
01:37:58,993 --> 01:38:01,621
John, please!

1231
01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:04,749
Now!

1232
01:38:04,832 --> 01:38:06,709
Alicia and Charles never
coexist in the same...

1233
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:08,628
Interactive field. Alicia and Parcher...

1234
01:38:15,885 --> 01:38:18,095
Let's play!

1235
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:20,890
...Charles, and Marcee
cannot coexist with Alicia.

1236
01:38:20,931 --> 01:38:22,642
I understand.

1237
01:38:38,949 --> 01:38:40,951
She never gets old.

1238
01:38:43,663 --> 01:38:47,166
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1239
01:39:19,907 --> 01:39:21,492
You see them now?

1240
01:39:30,751 --> 01:39:32,461
Yes.

1241
01:39:34,755 --> 01:39:37,049
Why did you stop your meds?

1242
01:39:39,301 --> 01:39:41,637
Because I couldn't do my work.

1243
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,639
I couldn't help with the baby.

1244
01:39:43,722 --> 01:39:45,474
I couldn't-

1245
01:39:46,976 --> 01:39:49,186
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1246
01:39:51,522 --> 01:39:53,858
You think that's
better than being crazy?

1247
01:39:53,941 --> 01:39:57,027
We'll need to start
you on a higher run...

1248
01:39:57,111 --> 01:39:59,071
Of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1249
01:39:59,155 --> 01:40:00,781
No.

1250
01:40:00,865 --> 01:40:02,700
There has to be another way.

1251
01:40:02,783 --> 01:40:07,163
Schizophrenia is degenerative.
Some days maybe symptom-Free,

1252
01:40:07,204 --> 01:40:08,873
But over time, you are getting worse.

1253
01:40:08,956 --> 01:40:12,001
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1254
01:40:12,084 --> 01:40:14,879
It's a problem with no solution.

1255
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:16,714
And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1256
01:40:16,797 --> 01:40:18,424
That's what I do best. This isn't math.

1257
01:40:18,507 --> 01:40:20,259
You can't come up with a formula...

1258
01:40:20,342 --> 01:40:22,303
To change the way you
experience the world.

1259
01:40:22,386 --> 01:40:25,181
All I have to do is apply my
mind. There's no theorem, no proof.

1260
01:40:25,222 --> 01:40:27,933
You can't reason your way out
of this. Why not? Why can't l?

1261
01:40:28,017 --> 01:40:30,811
Because your mind is where the
problem is in the first place.

1262
01:40:32,813 --> 01:40:35,024
I can do this.

1263
01:40:35,107 --> 01:40:38,736
I can work it out. All I need is time.

1264
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,241
Is that the baby?

1265
01:40:45,993 --> 01:40:48,495
The baby's at my mother's, John.

1266
01:41:02,176 --> 01:41:05,095
Without treatment, John,

1267
01:41:05,179 --> 01:41:07,097
The fantasies may take over...

1268
01:41:08,098 --> 01:41:09,642
Entirely.

1269
01:41:27,451 --> 01:41:29,745
You almost ready?

1270
01:41:31,705 --> 01:41:34,083
Rosen's waiting outside.

1271
01:41:34,124 --> 01:41:36,835
I can't go back to that hospital.

1272
01:41:40,839 --> 01:41:42,883
I won't come home.

1273
01:41:46,428 --> 01:41:48,639
He said that if you said that,

1274
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:53,143
He has commitment papers for me to sign.

1275
01:41:55,521 --> 01:41:57,272
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1276
01:41:59,108 --> 01:42:01,151
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1277
01:42:04,071 --> 01:42:06,073
I will try to figure this out.

1278
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:10,285
Whatever you do,

1279
01:42:10,369 --> 01:42:13,664
Rosen is right about one thing.

1280
01:42:13,747 --> 01:42:16,250
You shouldn't be here.

1281
01:42:18,669 --> 01:42:20,587
I'm not safe anymore.

1282
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:28,262
Would you have hurt me, John?

1283
01:42:37,646 --> 01:42:39,314
I don't know.

1284
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,069
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.

1285
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:53,513
Rosen said to call if you
try and kill me or anything.

1286
01:44:09,863 --> 01:44:12,157
You want to know what's real?

1287
01:44:17,621 --> 01:44:19,581
This.

1288
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,840
This.

1289
01:44:34,137 --> 01:44:36,056
This.

1290
01:44:37,474 --> 01:44:39,643
This is real.

1291
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:45,357
Maybe the part...

1292
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,818
That knows the waking from the dream,

1293
01:44:49,236 --> 01:44:51,154
Maybe it isn't here.

1294
01:44:55,033 --> 01:44:57,494
Maybe it's here.

1295
01:45:02,165 --> 01:45:04,501
I need to believe...

1296
01:45:04,584 --> 01:45:08,005
That something
extraordinary is possible.

1297
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:12,527
Come.

1298
01:46:20,994 --> 01:46:22,871
Hello, Martin.

1299
01:46:27,459 --> 01:46:29,711
Jesus Christ.

1300
01:46:31,379 --> 01:46:33,006
No. I-

1301
01:46:33,089 --> 01:46:36,134
I don't have that one.
My savior complex...

1302
01:46:36,218 --> 01:46:37,636
Takes on a completely different form.

1303
01:46:39,513 --> 01:46:42,599
I heard what happened and well,

1304
01:46:42,682 --> 01:46:45,101
I I wanted to write and I
tried you at MacArthur's...

1305
01:46:45,185 --> 01:46:47,270
But you'd left, and I just...

1306
01:46:59,366 --> 01:47:01,409
This is Helinger's old office.

1307
01:47:01,493 --> 01:47:03,078
Yeah.

1308
01:47:03,161 --> 01:47:05,664
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1309
01:47:08,041 --> 01:47:10,502
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1310
01:47:11,878 --> 01:47:14,839
They were wrong, John. No one wins.

1311
01:47:14,923 --> 01:47:17,634
Please, please have a seat.

1312
01:47:17,717 --> 01:47:20,637
God, it's so good to see you.

1313
01:47:22,764 --> 01:47:25,141
What brings you back to Princeton?

1314
01:47:25,225 --> 01:47:26,601
John?

1315
01:47:26,643 --> 01:47:29,854
John, I'm sorry, but
you have to tell him.

1316
01:47:29,938 --> 01:47:32,023
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1317
01:47:32,107 --> 01:47:33,692
Tell him your work is critical.

1318
01:47:33,775 --> 01:47:36,027
John, please!

1319
01:47:49,624 --> 01:47:53,169
Is there any chance that you
could ignore what I just did?

1320
01:47:54,838 --> 01:47:57,716
Of course, what are old friends for?

1321
01:47:57,799 --> 01:48:01,428
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?

1322
01:48:01,511 --> 01:48:03,596
John, of course.

1323
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,433
Of course. We always have been.

1324
01:48:11,646 --> 01:48:13,565
Alicia and I think that-

1325
01:48:13,648 --> 01:48:15,483
That fitting in,

1326
01:48:15,525 --> 01:48:17,527
Being part of a community,

1327
01:48:19,821 --> 01:48:21,573
Might do me some good.

1328
01:48:21,656 --> 01:48:23,533
That a certain level of attachment,

1329
01:48:23,616 --> 01:48:25,618
Familiar places, familiar people,

1330
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:28,872
Might help me...

1331
01:48:28,955 --> 01:48:31,458
Elbow out these-

1332
01:48:34,794 --> 01:48:37,756
These certain delusions that I have.

1333
01:48:42,469 --> 01:48:45,096
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1334
01:48:47,515 --> 01:48:49,642
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

1335
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:55,774
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1336
01:49:04,491 --> 01:49:05,950
Huh.

1337
01:49:09,996 --> 01:49:12,165
Will you be needing an office?

1338
01:49:16,503 --> 01:49:18,338
No.

1339
01:49:21,174 --> 01:49:24,052
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1340
01:49:24,135 --> 01:49:26,679
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

1341
01:49:26,763 --> 01:49:29,933
But he doesn't have I.D. Why
can't people read their memos, huh?

1342
01:49:30,016 --> 01:49:31,726
Then he goes totally nuts.

1343
01:49:31,809 --> 01:49:34,062
Not real! You're not real.

1344
01:49:34,103 --> 01:49:35,980
There's no mission.

1345
01:49:36,064 --> 01:49:38,358
Oh, shit. Shit.

1346
01:49:39,484 --> 01:49:42,153
Not real! You are not real!

1347
01:49:42,237 --> 01:49:44,113
Is this what you are, soldier?

1348
01:49:44,197 --> 01:49:45,448
Some useless ghoul?

1349
01:49:45,532 --> 01:49:47,534
The local madman?

1350
01:49:47,617 --> 01:49:50,245
I'm not a soldier. You're
gonna end up in a cell!

1351
01:49:50,328 --> 01:49:52,580
Old, worthless, discarded.

1352
01:49:52,664 --> 01:49:53,873
There's no mission.

1353
01:49:53,957 --> 01:49:55,583
And while you rock and drool,

1354
01:49:55,667 --> 01:49:57,210
The world will burn to ashes!

1355
01:49:57,293 --> 01:49:59,754
You are not real! You are not real!

1356
01:49:59,796 --> 01:50:01,464
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1357
01:50:01,548 --> 01:50:04,842
There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!

1358
01:50:04,926 --> 01:50:06,553
John? John?

1359
01:50:06,636 --> 01:50:08,471
John, John, John, John.

1360
01:50:08,555 --> 01:50:09,931
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1361
01:50:09,973 --> 01:50:11,516
John, John! It's okay.

1362
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,726
I just heard what
happened, I'm sorry. John-

1363
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:15,979
I'm not a soldier. John. Hey, Nash.

1364
01:50:16,062 --> 01:50:19,482
Nash, hey. Hey, you're all right.

1365
01:50:21,025 --> 01:50:23,152
Nash, Nash, hey, hey, hey.

1366
01:50:26,906 --> 01:50:29,784
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1367
01:50:29,867 --> 01:50:31,035
John?

1368
01:50:33,162 --> 01:50:35,790
You should've seen their faces.

1369
01:50:35,873 --> 01:50:38,626
Everybody was just staring at me.

1370
01:50:38,668 --> 01:50:40,295
John...

1371
01:50:40,378 --> 01:50:43,548
You know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1372
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:45,842
I know.

1373
01:50:48,094 --> 01:50:50,179
But then, on the way home,

1374
01:50:50,263 --> 01:50:53,099
Charles was there.

1375
01:50:56,936 --> 01:51:00,273
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1376
01:51:03,192 --> 01:51:05,570
Maybe Rosen's right.

1377
01:51:05,653 --> 01:51:09,157
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1378
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,200
No.

1379
01:51:11,284 --> 01:51:13,536
Come here.

1380
01:51:16,873 --> 01:51:19,709
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1381
01:51:43,775 --> 01:51:47,195
John, now, you can't ignore me forever.

1382
01:51:52,492 --> 01:51:54,702
Charles, you've been a
very good friend to me.

1383
01:51:54,786 --> 01:51:56,454
The best.

1384
01:51:58,164 --> 01:52:00,917
But I won't talk to you again.

1385
01:52:04,295 --> 01:52:06,464
I just can't.

1386
01:52:11,719 --> 01:52:14,222
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1387
01:52:22,063 --> 01:52:23,689
Good-Bye.

1388
01:52:30,863 --> 01:52:32,698
Good-Bye.

1389
01:52:46,629 --> 01:52:49,131
I was wondering if I
might audit your course.

1390
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:53,553
It's It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1391
01:52:56,764 --> 01:52:58,849
Is something wrong?

1392
01:53:00,142 --> 01:53:02,436
This will be my first class.

1393
01:53:05,856 --> 01:53:08,442
Good morning,

1394
01:53:08,526 --> 01:53:10,736
Eager young minds.

1395
01:53:30,548 --> 01:53:32,842
It's never gonna work, John.

1396
01:53:32,925 --> 01:53:35,428
You're just humiliating yourself.

1397
01:53:38,014 --> 01:53:40,141
It's pathetic!

1398
01:53:40,224 --> 01:53:42,268
You are being pathetic.

1399
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:44,353
I'm ashamed of you.

1400
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:13,632
Oh, man!

1401
01:54:17,386 --> 01:54:20,389
Are you coming? You're gonna be late.

1402
01:54:23,184 --> 01:54:25,019
Dad, you've got my books. What?

1403
01:54:25,102 --> 01:54:26,729
You've got my books.

1404
01:54:26,812 --> 01:54:29,231
Oh, right.

1405
01:54:29,315 --> 01:54:30,733
Thanks.

1406
01:54:31,776 --> 01:54:33,486
Good-Bye. Bye.

1407
01:54:33,569 --> 01:54:35,363
See you tonight.

1408
01:54:35,446 --> 01:54:37,406
Bye, honey.

1409
01:56:09,915 --> 01:56:11,500
Did you just solve Reimann?

1410
01:56:11,584 --> 01:56:13,752
Well, what do you think?

1411
01:56:13,836 --> 01:56:16,881
Huh. That's an analog to Frobenius...

1412
01:56:16,964 --> 01:56:18,924
For noncommutative extensions.

1413
01:56:20,134 --> 01:56:22,386
Yes, it is.

1414
01:56:22,469 --> 01:56:25,431
But it only appears to
work sporadically, so, no.

1415
01:56:25,514 --> 01:56:27,641
But...

1416
01:56:27,725 --> 01:56:30,019
I believe I'm making progress.

1417
01:56:31,061 --> 01:56:33,022
You're-

1418
01:56:33,105 --> 01:56:35,941
You're John Nash, right?

1419
01:56:38,402 --> 01:56:40,487
Toby Kelly. Hello.

1420
01:56:40,571 --> 01:56:42,364
I've been studying your equilibrium.

1421
01:56:42,448 --> 01:56:44,450
The one you wrote here, at Princeton.

1422
01:56:44,533 --> 01:56:47,036
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

1423
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:48,537
You know, I was young.

1424
01:56:48,621 --> 01:56:50,164
Umm...

1425
01:56:50,247 --> 01:56:52,625
I've been developing a theory.

1426
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:09,099
I believe I can prove...

1427
01:57:09,183 --> 01:57:11,935
That Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1428
01:57:12,019 --> 01:57:14,396
That everything,
everything is connected.

1429
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:17,149
That it's all part of the same subject.

1430
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:20,235
When was the last time you ate?

1431
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:22,863
Excuse me? You know, food.

1432
01:57:22,946 --> 01:57:24,907
Oh, uh-

1433
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:26,950
My wife,

1434
01:57:27,034 --> 01:57:28,869
She loves mayonnaise.

1435
01:57:28,952 --> 01:57:32,206
Oh, thank you.

1436
01:57:32,247 --> 01:57:33,457
Thank you.

1437
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,377
Go on.

1438
01:57:36,418 --> 01:57:38,504
The function...

1439
01:57:38,587 --> 01:57:40,547
Is in the two categories. Um-Hmm.

1440
01:57:44,718 --> 01:57:46,345
Alicia!

1441
01:57:46,428 --> 01:57:49,098
Alicia!

1442
01:57:49,181 --> 01:57:52,393
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1443
01:57:52,434 --> 01:57:54,520
Let us say 10milesperhour.

1444
01:57:54,603 --> 01:57:57,898
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle B,

1445
01:57:57,981 --> 01:58:00,943
And the fly, who can
travel at20milesan hour,

1446
01:58:01,026 --> 01:58:02,653
Leaves the tire of
bicycle B and it flies...

1447
01:58:02,736 --> 01:58:04,863
To the tire of bicycle A
and backwards and forwards...

1448
01:58:04,947 --> 01:58:07,282
And so on and so forth until
the two bikes collide...

1449
01:58:07,366 --> 01:58:09,118
And the poor little fly is squashed.

1450
01:58:09,201 --> 01:58:11,328
This is the important thing...

1451
01:58:11,411 --> 01:58:13,455
About actually focusing
in and comprehending...

1452
01:58:13,539 --> 01:58:15,541
The area that you're dealing with.

1453
01:58:15,624 --> 01:58:18,460
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1454
01:58:18,544 --> 01:58:20,838
No matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1455
01:58:20,921 --> 01:58:22,339
Especially the people from biology.

1456
01:58:22,422 --> 01:58:23,966
Don't listen to any of those people.

1457
01:58:24,049 --> 01:58:26,343
Let me go back to what
you were doing before.

1458
01:58:26,426 --> 01:58:29,721
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1459
01:58:30,973 --> 01:58:33,142
I was thinking that I might teach.

1460
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,645
A classroom with 50 students...

1461
01:58:36,728 --> 01:58:39,690
Can be daunting for anyone.

1462
01:58:39,773 --> 01:58:42,609
John, besides, you're
a terrible teacher.

1463
01:58:43,777 --> 01:58:46,613
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1464
01:58:46,655 --> 01:58:49,616
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1465
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:51,660
What about the-

1466
01:58:51,743 --> 01:58:53,829
Well, you know.

1467
01:58:53,912 --> 01:58:56,248
Are they gone?

1468
01:59:02,254 --> 01:59:05,173
No, they're not gone.

1469
01:59:05,257 --> 01:59:06,842
And maybe they never will be.

1470
01:59:06,925 --> 01:59:08,677
But I've gotten used to ignoring them...

1471
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:12,139
And I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1472
01:59:12,222 --> 01:59:14,141
You think that's what it's like...

1473
01:59:14,224 --> 01:59:17,895
With all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

1474
01:59:17,978 --> 01:59:21,023
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1475
01:59:21,106 --> 01:59:24,568
John, they Haunt you, though.

1476
01:59:24,651 --> 01:59:29,364
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1477
01:59:32,367 --> 01:59:34,328
Well, good-Bye.

1478
01:59:34,369 --> 01:59:36,830
John, I'll talk to the department.

1479
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:40,626
Maybe in the spring.

1480
01:59:46,214 --> 01:59:48,050
Hey, Nash?

1481
01:59:49,718 --> 01:59:53,764
You You scared?

1482
01:59:56,224 --> 01:59:58,185
Terrified.

1483
01:59:58,226 --> 02:00:00,604
Mortified. Petrified.

1484
02:00:00,687 --> 02:00:03,398
Stupefied by you.

1485
02:00:03,482 --> 02:00:04,858
Now you ought best ring Alicia,

1486
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:06,985
Or you're gonna get me... I'll ring her.

1487
02:00:07,069 --> 02:00:08,403
In an awful lot of trouble.

1488
02:00:12,324 --> 02:00:14,076
Thanks, Professor. Good-Bye.

1489
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:16,078
Have a nice day. Good-Bye.

1490
02:00:16,161 --> 02:00:19,039
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.

1491
02:00:19,081 --> 02:00:21,083
Professor Nash?

1492
02:00:24,336 --> 02:00:26,922
Can you see him? Yeah.

1493
02:00:27,005 --> 02:00:28,590
You sure? Uh-Huh.

1494
02:00:28,674 --> 02:00:30,842
Positive? He's within your vision?

1495
02:00:30,926 --> 02:00:32,511
Okay. Good.

1496
02:00:32,594 --> 02:00:35,597
Forgive me, I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

1497
02:00:35,681 --> 02:00:38,016
See you next week,
Professor. See you next week.

1498
02:00:39,309 --> 02:00:40,936
So now that I know that you're real,

1499
02:00:41,019 --> 02:00:43,480
Who are you, and what can I do for you?

1500
02:00:43,563 --> 02:00:46,942
Professor, my name is Thomas King...

1501
02:00:47,025 --> 02:00:48,151
Thomas King? Mm-Hm.

1502
02:00:48,235 --> 02:00:49,694
And I'm here to tell you...

1503
02:00:49,778 --> 02:00:52,823
That you're being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

1504
02:01:00,372 --> 02:01:03,083
Forgive me, but I'm
just a little stunned.

1505
02:01:03,166 --> 02:01:05,627
Over the past few years
your equilibrium...

1506
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:08,296
Has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1507
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:10,632
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1508
02:01:10,715 --> 02:01:15,011
What about my work on other some
such projects Manifold embedding?

1509
02:01:15,095 --> 02:01:18,306
The application of your
bargaining problem...

1510
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:22,686
To FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases-

1511
02:01:22,769 --> 02:01:24,479
Antitrust cases? Yes.

1512
02:01:24,563 --> 02:01:26,857
I never would have considered that.

1513
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,525
Well... Have I just reached...

1514
02:01:28,608 --> 02:01:31,319
Some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1515
02:01:31,403 --> 02:01:33,280
No, no, you haven't.

1516
02:01:33,363 --> 02:01:35,365
'Cause, I wouldn't have thought of that.

1517
02:01:40,495 --> 02:01:42,581
Shall we have tea?

1518
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:46,877
Oh, I don't go in
there. I usually just...

1519
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,837
Take my sandwich in the library.

1520
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:52,883
Come on, John. Let's have
some tea. It's a big day.

1521
02:01:52,966 --> 02:01:55,010

M-Most-

1522
02:01:55,093 --> 02:01:56,970
Most commercially
available brands of tea...

1523
02:01:57,053 --> 02:01:58,680
Are not suitable to my palate.

1524
02:01:58,763 --> 02:02:00,473
I'm not-

1525
02:02:00,557 --> 02:02:03,685
There are some Northern Indian
teas which are dense enough-

1526
02:02:03,768 --> 02:02:06,354
I enjoy the flavor that they have-

1527
02:02:06,438 --> 02:02:08,148
I have not been in this room...

1528
02:02:08,231 --> 02:02:11,234
For some many years. I
wonder what tea they serve.

1529
02:02:12,903 --> 02:02:14,529
Why, thank you, young lady.

1530
02:02:16,907 --> 02:02:19,242
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1531
02:02:19,326 --> 02:02:21,578
I have a son that age.

1532
02:02:21,661 --> 02:02:24,623
Harvard.

1533
02:02:27,834 --> 02:02:29,920
Hmm.

1534
02:02:30,003 --> 02:02:32,547
I would have thought the nominations...

1535
02:02:32,631 --> 02:02:35,091
For the Nobel Prize
would have been secret.

1536
02:02:35,175 --> 02:02:36,927
I would have thought
you'd only find out...

1537
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:38,595
If you won or lost.

1538
02:02:38,678 --> 02:02:40,847
That is generally the case, yes.

1539
02:02:40,931 --> 02:02:43,058
But these are special circumstances.

1540
02:02:44,351 --> 02:02:46,686
The awards are substantial.

1541
02:02:46,728 --> 02:02:51,274
They require private funding. As such,

1542
02:02:51,358 --> 02:02:54,319
The image of the Nobel is...

1543
02:02:55,946 --> 02:02:58,657
I see. You came here to
find out if I was crazy?

1544
02:02:59,950 --> 02:03:02,202
Find out if I would...

1545
02:03:02,243 --> 02:03:04,245
Screw everything up if I actually won?

1546
02:03:06,164 --> 02:03:08,917
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1547
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,377
Things of this nature?

1548
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:12,921
Something like that, yes.

1549
02:03:13,922 --> 02:03:15,924
Would I embarrass you?

1550
02:03:19,469 --> 02:03:21,596
Yes, it is possible.

1551
02:03:24,349 --> 02:03:26,434
You see, l-

1552
02:03:27,185 --> 02:03:29,479
I am crazy.

1553
02:03:31,523 --> 02:03:33,650
I take the newer medications,

1554
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:40,031
But I still see things
that are not here.

1555
02:03:42,283 --> 02:03:44,494
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1556
02:03:46,621 --> 02:03:48,456
Like a diet of the mind,

1557
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:50,959
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1558
02:03:53,378 --> 02:03:56,256
Like my appetite for patterns.

1559
02:03:57,882 --> 02:04:01,845
Perhaps my appetite to
imagine and to dream.

1560
02:04:02,887 --> 02:04:04,806
Professor Nash.

1561
02:04:08,935 --> 02:04:12,355
It's good to have you here, John.

1562
02:04:12,439 --> 02:04:14,357
Thank you.

1563
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:22,991
It's an honor, sir. Thank you very much.

1564
02:04:23,074 --> 02:04:24,742
A privilege, Professor.

1565
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:30,540
Professor.

1566
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:38,923
Nicely done, John. Thank you, Tom.

1567
02:04:40,091 --> 02:04:41,843
Thank you.

1568
02:04:41,926 --> 02:04:44,596
Thank you.

1569
02:04:52,729 --> 02:04:55,023
Thank you, Ed.

1570
02:05:02,614 --> 02:05:05,533
That was certainly most unexpected.

1571
02:05:26,554 --> 02:05:28,806
Thank you.

1572
02:05:32,894 --> 02:05:35,230
I've always believed in numbers.

1573
02:05:35,313 --> 02:05:37,857
In the equations and logics...

1574
02:05:37,941 --> 02:05:39,859
That lead to reason.

1575
02:05:39,943 --> 02:05:42,862
But after a lifetime of such pursuits,

1576
02:05:42,904 --> 02:05:45,406
I ask,

1577
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:48,034
What truly is logic?

1578
02:05:48,117 --> 02:05:51,246
Who decides reason?

1579
02:05:52,705 --> 02:05:56,125
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1580
02:05:56,209 --> 02:05:58,086
The metaphysical,

1581
02:05:59,545 --> 02:06:01,506
The delusional...

1582
02:06:02,632 --> 02:06:04,634
And back.

1583
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:09,555
And I have made the most
important discovery of my career.

1584
02:06:11,516 --> 02:06:14,811
The most important discovery of my life.

1585
02:06:17,271 --> 02:06:20,858
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love...

1586
02:06:20,942 --> 02:06:23,945
That any logical reasons can be found.

1587
02:06:27,365 --> 02:06:30,618
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1588
02:06:31,869 --> 02:06:34,872
You are the reason I am.

1589
02:06:38,543 --> 02:06:41,379
You are all my reasons.

1590
02:06:45,216 --> 02:06:47,301
Thank you.

1591
02:07:40,938 --> 02:07:43,399
So nice to have met you.

1592
02:07:46,110 --> 02:07:47,904
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1593
02:07:47,987 --> 02:07:49,447
Bye bye.

1594
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:51,199
Bye bye.

1595
02:07:51,282 --> 02:07:54,202
Are you ready to go now? Oh, yes, I am.

1596
02:07:54,285 --> 02:07:56,829
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1597
02:07:56,913 --> 02:07:59,707
Thank you so much.

1598
02:07:59,790 --> 02:08:01,125
Thank you.

1599
02:08:03,669 --> 02:08:05,880
What is it? What's wrong?

1600
02:08:09,675 --> 02:08:11,511
Nothing.

1601
02:08:13,179 --> 02:08:14,514
Nothing at all.

1602
02:08:16,474 --> 02:08:19,101
Come with me, young lady. Oh-Hh...

1603
02:08:19,185 --> 02:08:21,646
I have a car outside.

1604
02:08:21,729 --> 02:08:24,232
Are you interested in a ride?

1605
02:08:25,274 --> 02:08:26,984
Where's it going to?

1606
02:08:47,255 --> 02:08:50,925
L will

1607
02:08:51,008 --> 02:08:54,512
Watch you

1608
02:08:54,595 --> 02:09:01,394
In the darkness

1609
02:09:01,477 --> 02:09:05,314
Show you

1610
02:09:05,398 --> 02:09:08,859
Love will

1611
02:09:08,943 --> 02:09:15,032
See you through

1612
02:09:16,826 --> 02:09:24,166
When the bad dreams

1613
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:31,298
Wake you crying

1614
02:09:31,382 --> 02:09:37,430
I'll show you

1615
02:09:37,513 --> 02:09:45,646
All love can do

1616
02:09:46,939 --> 02:09:53,988
What love can do

1617
02:09:54,071 --> 02:09:57,992
L will watch through the night

1618
02:09:58,075 --> 02:10:02,163
Hold you in my arms

1619
02:10:02,246 --> 02:10:03,914
Give you dreams

1620
02:10:03,998 --> 02:10:09,170
Where none will be

1621
02:10:09,253 --> 02:10:13,382
L will watch through the dark

1622
02:10:13,466 --> 02:10:17,178
Till the morning comes

1623
02:10:17,261 --> 02:10:20,181
All the light

1624
02:10:20,264 --> 02:10:22,558
I'll take you through the night

1625
02:10:22,641 --> 02:10:25,478
To see

1626
02:10:26,479 --> 02:10:29,523
The light

1627
02:10:29,607 --> 02:10:32,860
Showing us all love

1628
02:10:32,943 --> 02:10:37,698
Can be

1629
02:10:39,033 --> 02:10:42,119
L will

1630
02:10:42,203 --> 02:10:45,539
Guard you

1631
02:10:45,623 --> 02:10:53,506
With my bright wings

1632
02:10:53,589 --> 02:11:00,888
Stay till your heart

1633
02:11:00,971 --> 02:11:09,688
Learns to see

1634
02:11:09,772 --> 02:11:15,194
All love

1635
02:11:15,277 --> 02:11:19,740
Can...

1636
02:11:19,823 --> 02:11:27,831
Be
