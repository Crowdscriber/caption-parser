Previously on "Vikings":

00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:03,929
We shall ask the gods
why do they make me earl,

3
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,800
yet kill my son?

4
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:08,391
- We can have more sons.
- Have we not tried?

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,296
Fill me with seed
before it's too late.

6
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,152
If you really want
to be a great man,

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,271
should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,424
That's where your brother is.

9
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:19,071
He's already boasting
how he sailed west alone.

10
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,069
But you weren't invited.
You didn't even know about it.

11
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:24,974
King Horik: There is a Jarl
in Gotaland, Jarl Borg.

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,558
He continues to claim he has legal
rights over some of my land.

13
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,209
And now, once again,
he's making threatening noises.

14
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:32,704
How can I be of help?

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,186
Travel to Gotaland
as my emissary?

16
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:37,451
I shall be forever
in your debt.

17
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,046
Please stay.

But not before.

56

How can you make peace,
Jarl Borg,

57
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:20,734
if you insist on
humiliating him?

58

Jarl Borg:
If I invade and defeat him,

59
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,911
will he not be
even more humiliated?

60
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,140
Ragnar:
Not if he fights well.

61
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:30,553
In any case,

62
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,701
I am sure that
he would relish a fight.

You are Ragnar Lothbrok,

00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:59,256
the one who sailed west?

68
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,582
I am surprised that
you've heard about that.

Siggy:
Go to the Seer,

86
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:27,579
ask if your fears
will come true.

87

It's sometimes better
not to know one's fate.

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,806
Jarl Borg: I take it, from
what you said yesterday,

89
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,536
that King Horik is
prepared to compromise

90
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,861
and offer some deal
regarding those lands of mine,

91
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:41,552
which he still occupies?

92
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:43,141
He is prepared to pay you

93
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,433
to renounce your illegal claims

94
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,139
of his lands.

95
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,183
Jarl Borg: You disappoint
me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.

96
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,210
I thought you'd come here
with a serious purpose.

97
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:54,599
- If you would just name your price.
- Jarl Borg: The land is priceless,

98
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,887
which is why King Horik
wants to keep it for himself.

99
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:59,989
Rollo: Every piece
of land has a price,

100
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,640
just like every human.

101
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,352
Jarl Borg:
Well, you don't understand.

102
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:07,461
This is not a small plot of land on
which to grow turnips and onions.

103
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,566
We're talking about
a vast swathe of land,

104
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,677
and on this land,
in the earth, are minerals,

105
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:13,514
things of great value.

106
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:16,591
Why else would I assert
my claim?

107
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:18,811
Ragnar:
King Horik resists your claim,

108
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:21,736
but still, in good faith,

109
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,834
he is willing
to settle with you.

110
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:26,478
Rollo: If you will name
a reasonable price.

111
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:31,731
At the moment,
my price is King Horik's head.

112
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,191
(Borg's men laugh)

113
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,552
Ragnar: Well then,

114
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,722
it seems I am done.

115
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,584
Jarl Borg: Hold on, please,
sit down, sit down.

116
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,587
Let's see if we can find
another way.

117
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,487
What do you have in mind?

118
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:49,432
What if my claim
was acknowledged

119
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:52,975
but I was willing to lease the land
back to the king during his lifetime?

120
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:55,958
Or what if we deferred judgment
on ownership,

121
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,530
but shared the mineral rights?

122
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:01,425
What do you say,

123
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,638
can we start negotiating
in this manner?

124
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,156
(Cutlery clatters,
Rollo claps Ragnar on the back)

125
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:09,339
Why not?

126
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,525
Ragnar: I have not been
given the authority to...

127
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,905
negotiate in this manner.

128
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,490
You mean King Horik sent you
here with nothing but a demand?

129
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,807
And yet he speaks of peace!

130
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,273
I don't know
what is in his mind.

131
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,318
Jarl Borg: Well then,
maybe you should ask him.

132
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,533
(Borg's men laugh)

133
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,728
Jarl Borg:
Let me make a suggestion:

134
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,272
Why don't you send
one of your men back

135
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,204
so he can put to King Horik
my ideas for a remedy.

136
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,043
If you think that will work.

137
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:45,845
Jarl Borg: Good. Your messenger
will take several days.

138
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:50,343
So, in the meantime, why don't you and
your men go and visit our famous ash tree?

139
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:53,843
It is famous not only for its size but
because it never loses its leaves,

140
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,757
summer or winter.

141
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,611
Some people even say
it's Yggdrasil,

142
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,760
the tree that holds up the sky.

143
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:03,122
And I will provide you
an escort.

144
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,217
I only have one,
very small request.

145
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:09,419
I would like one of your men to stay
behind here as a kind of security.

146
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,376
You understand, I hope?

147

Bjorn:
So how long must we travel?

155
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,993
Guide: It can take us three
days to reach the tree.

156
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,806
It looks like rain.

157
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,423
Come.

159

160
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,630

Seer: Do you think your husband
is in some kind of danger?

162
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,175
I've had strange
and disturbing dreams.

163
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,690
What happens in your dreams?

164
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,948
Lagertha: Dark shapes
come to me at night.

165
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:28,750
Monstrous forms.

166
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,812
When I wake,

167
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,971
they skulk in the shadows,
shapeless,

168
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:37,224
but no sooner am I asleep
than they creep forward again.

169
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,205
Seer:
Ah, yes.

170
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,847
The shadows come from
hell's hall.

171
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:46,615
No one can ensnare them,
not even the gods.

172
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,545
Lagertha:
What is it that they want?

173
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,574
To take something from you.

174
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:53,930
My life?

175
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:58,299
Seer: No, something far more
important to you than that.

176
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,628
My husband's life?

177
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,525
(Sighs)

178
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,442
Tell me.

179
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,101
Seer: Why must you
all force me up

180
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:10,791
and unearth me to sorrows?

181
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,890
Your husband is in danger,

182
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,740
but not for his life.

183
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:21,072
He is in danger
from the magical world.

184
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,679
How?

185
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,335
(Sighs)

186
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:28,703
Answer me.

187
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:32,680
Seer: I was unwilling to speak
and I will say no more now!

188
00:10:50,597 --> 00:10:53,332
(Twig snaps)

189
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:56,640
So, Rollo,

190
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,756
how do you get on
with your brother?

191
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,619
We get along fine.

192
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,101
Why shouldn't we?

193
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,142
No reason.

194
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:09,330
But not all brothers
get on so well.

195
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,411
I know that
from personal experience.

196
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,846
What do you mean?

197
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,622
I too had a brother.

198
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,859
I loved him.

199
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,636
We were very close,
as befits blood brothers.

200
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,549
We fought together
in the shield-wall.

201
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,705
We shared the same women.

202
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:33,488
When my father was killed, there was
fierce competition to replace him as jarl.

203
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,336
And although
I was his eldest son

204
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:38,453
I was not sure
I was going to succeed.

205
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,512
However, I was elected
at the thing.

206
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,721
We had a feast to celebrate.

207
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,777
My wife was there...

208
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,683
my young, beautiful wife -

209
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:50,281
we'd just gotten married -

210
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,132
and all the others who had stood
for election against me.

211
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:59,308
My brother poisoned them...

212
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,629
all.

213
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:05,345
I only survived because...

214
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,425
my wife took the cup
I was about to drink from

215
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,537
and drained it herself
in celebration.

216
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:15,973
I will never forget
her screams.

217
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:21,642
It's my wife's screams that will
haunt me for the rest of my life.

218
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:26,283
My brother denied
responsibility,

219
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:28,355
but his guilt was too obvious.

220
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,233
So I blinded him
with my own hands,

221
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,705
and then I burned him alive.

222
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:41,496
That's what I know about
the love between brothers.

223
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:44,824
(Fire crackles)

224
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:46,970
Ragnar...

225
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,100
would never do such a thing.

226
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,156
Of course not.

227
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,401
No, your brother is different.

228
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,387
Your brother's a great man,

229
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:00,455
a great warrior.

230
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:03,122
As am I.

231
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,840
I'm sure you are.

232
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:11,219
And yet I've never heard
of you.

233
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,807
(Retreating footsteps)

234
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,531
(Rushing water)

235
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,112
Nils:
Whoa...

236
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:25,606
Our camp is set up over here.

237
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,352
There's some excellent fishing,
upstream, under the waterfall.

238
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,065
I will go.

239
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:32,158
And I also,

240
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,239
for everybody knows...

241
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,174
- Three eyes are be.
- Ugh!

242
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,574
(Horses splash through water)

243
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:48,638
(Rushing water)

244
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:01,309
(Rushing water)

245
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,672
(Water splashes lightly
and drips)

246
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,723
Servant 1:
You! Look away!

247
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:23,116
- Servant 2: Who are you?
- Servant 1: Look away at once!

248
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,334
What are we suppose
to be looking at?

249
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,919
Arne: I'm blind! See?!
I can't see anything!

250
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,105
(Laughing)

251
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:31,179
Agh!
(Blade slices)

252
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,786
Agh!

253
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:35,549
Arne: (Struggling grunts)
Torstein: Arne!

254
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,578
Servant 1: What? You're
going to try to kill us

255
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,766
for protecting the reputation
of our mistress?

256
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,436
Ha! Shame on you!

257
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:44,652
Arne: We came upon your
mistress by chance.

258
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,822
We are strangers here,

259
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,761
traveling to the great ash
tree, guests of Jarl Borg.

260
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:52,707
Servant 1: Jarl Borg? Then why
didn't you say so at once?

261
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,785
Torstein: We will just
return to our horses then.

262
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,025
You spied on me.

263
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,014
We meant no harm.

264
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:12,548
Servant 1: They say they
are guests of Jarl Borg.

265
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,236
Are you alone?

266
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,611
We are traveling with
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.

267
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:24,433
Then I think that Earl Ragnar owes
me an apology on your behalf.

268
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,684
Don't you?

269
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:32,935
Ragnar: I never knew that

270
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:36,337
fresh fish was also
packed in salt.

271
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:40,362
Listen, it's not our fault.

272
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:43,826
We just saw her bathing.
What were we supposed to do?

273
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,508
Fish.

274
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,924
You did not see her, Ragnar.

275
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:50,099
So you get your cheek slashed

276
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,903
and now I'm supposed
to apologize

277
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,531
for you two staring
at a naked body.

278
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,862
That's what she said.

279
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:02,446
Who is she, anyway, to put such
a high price on her nakedness?

280
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,158
We didn't ask.

281
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,829
I'm intrigued.

282
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:12,930
What's so intriguing?

283
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:15,662
Sometimes the gods put things
like this in front of us

284
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,707
as some kind of test.

285
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,938
She has set me a challenge

286
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,719
and I am up to task.

287
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:24,818
See, I'm less interested in
what you say is her beauty,

288
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:27,128
than what I suspect is her wit.

289
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,571
So tell her

290
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:31,010
I invite her here to join us...

291
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,206
Neither dressed

292
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,399
nor undressed.

293
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,822
What else?

294
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:41,946
Neither hungry

295
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,773
nor full,

296
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,579
neither in company

297
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,810
nor alone.

298
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,587
Can you remember all of that,

299
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,159
one eye?

300
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,641
(Goats bleat, geese honk)

301
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,938
Siggy:
What did the Seer tell you?

302
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:03,514
He said that it's true;
That Ragnar is in danger.

303
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,272
From whom?

304
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,263
I don't know.

305
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,155
Who do you think?

306
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,417
(Seagulls cry outside)

307
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,806
I think he is in danger
from himself.

308
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,527
(Water rushes nearby,
men chatter quietly)

309
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,819
Man: Have you ever been
to Yggdrasil before?

310
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,078
Man 2:
No.

311
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:41,138
(Birds chirp,
chatter dies down)

312
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:50,657
Young woman: So, Earl Ragnar,

313
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,809
I come to you as you desired:

314
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,390
Neither dressed nor undressed,

315
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,743
neither hungry nor full,

316
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,122
neither alone...

317
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:01,147
nor yet in company.

318
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:03,464
Do I pass your test?

319
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,433
I owe you an apology.

320
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:07,416
I accept.

321
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:17,600
Could I offer you some,
uh, horrible salted fish?

322
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,119
I'm very tempted.

323
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:24,510
You can get tired
of fresh fish.

324
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,148
Come.

325
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,672
Sit, please.

326
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:47,147
May I ask your name?

327
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,766
My name is Aslaug.

328
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,310
We're on our way to see
the great ash tree.

329
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:55,474
Of course.

330
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,199
You are welcome to join us.

331
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:06,379
Will you come along, Aslaug?

332
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,529
(Low hum of chatter,
fire crackles)

333
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,299
Siggy:
(Gasps)

334
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:23,340
- Siggy, what is it?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

335
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:29,422
Oh, I visited my cousin
a few days ago.

336
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,131
She had just buried
her young son.

337
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,720
Why did he die?

338
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:39,459
One day he was fine,
and the next he

339
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:41,075
caught a fever that

340
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:44,931
made him sweat and cry out in
the night, and the next day...

341
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,692
she put him in the ground.

342
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,465
(Exhales shakily)

343
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:04,544
(Goat bleats nearby,
baby cries)

344
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,585
Siggy:
(Exhales slowly and shakily)

345
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,599
(Baby cries)

346
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:14,557
(Slicing and chopping sounds)

347
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:19,094
(Distorted thump)

348
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:24,541
(Distorted wheezed breath)

349
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:31,473
(Long, slow exhale)

350
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,611
(Labored breath)

351
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:39,516
(Breath hisses)

352
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:42,485
(Distorted landing thud)

353
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:49,536
Bjorn:
But if it is Yggdrasil,

354
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:51,257
then it must be the same tree

355
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:54,341
that Lord Odin
once hanged himself from.

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,581
Aslaug:
Why not?

357
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:59,038
All things are possible.

358
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:03,924
(Birds chirp)

359
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,062
Ragnar: "I hung from a windy
tree for nine long nights,

360
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,757
wounded by a spear,

361
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,804
dedicated to Odin,

362
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:25,160
from that tree of which
no man knows

363
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,933
from where its roots run."

364
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,780
(Doors burst open)

365
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:35,138
(People coughing)

366
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:43,890
(Labored whisper)
No, please...

367
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:46,294
Look after my daughter...

368
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,123
First.

369
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,149
Athelstan:
It's all right.

370
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,380
(Wheezing)

371
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:02,886
(Coughing)

372
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:11,519
(Men chatter and laugh)

373
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,389
Arne: (Sighs drunkenly)

374
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,695
What's wrong, boy?

375
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,990
What do you think?

376
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,750
My father is making
a fool of himself.

377
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:23,207
Arne: He's enjoying himself in the
company of a beautiful woman.

378
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,987
What's foolish about that?

379
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:26,909
Some day you'll do
the same thing.

380
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:29,795
If Lagertha were here,
she'd cut his balls off.

381
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:30,780
Arne: (Laughs)

382
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,920
Then it's a good
thing she's not.

383
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,196
Listen to me, my friend.

384
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,657
Your father and mother
are a famous couple.

385
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,814
They love each other.
Everybody knows that.

386
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:44,057
So don't begrudge your old man
a little harmless fun, huh?

387
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:48,389
(Claps Bjorn on the back,
laughs heartily)

388
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:56,046
(Ragnar and Aslaug
murmur quietly)

389
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,180
(Flames crackle)

390
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,450
(Approaching footsteps)

391
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,361
(Ale pours from pitcher)

392
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:14,473
Jarl Borg: I trust all
is to your satisfaction.

393
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,650
You feed me very well.

394
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:18,003
Jarl Borg:
You're an important guest.

395
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,277
We would like to keep you entertained
until your brother returns.

396
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:26,796
You always talk
about my brother.

397
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:28,813
What choice do I have?

398
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,156
He is your earl.

399
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,090
(Sighs, annoyed)

400
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,838
Which one would you like
tonight?

401
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:42,593
Why don't you take
both of them?

402
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:45,871
I don't need to be bribed
with women.

403
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:53,131
What is it you want, Rollo?

404
00:23:54,644 --> 00:23:57,550
What is it you really want?

405
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,223
(Thunder of galloping hooves)

406
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,588
Floki:
Fenrir, the giant wolf,

407
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:11,295
could not be constrained
by any means known to man,

408
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:15,316
so the dwarves forged a chain,

409
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:17,662
but not from metal.

410
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,448
Nothing made by man
could constrain Fenrir,

411
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,745
so they forged it
from the things we cannot see

412
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,572
and the things we cannot hear.

413
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,136
Like the breath of a fish...

414
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:33,121
the sound a moving cat makes.

415
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,839
The roots...

416
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:37,007
of a mountain.

417
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:38,127
You know?

418
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:39,752
(Laughs)

419
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,708
Of course I know!

420
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,128
These things interest me!

421
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,968
(Horse whinnies nearby)

422
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:49,370
I came to ask about Jarl Borg.

423
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,219
He won't sell.

424
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:54,348
He wants to make a deal.

425
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:58,113
King Horik:
I'm not interested in deals.

426
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:01,188
That would make it hard
for Ragnar.

427
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:04,381
King Horik: Ragnar will come
to the right conclusion,

428
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,510
and make the right decision.

429
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,790
Don't you care
if the negotiations fail?

430
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,650
(Non-committal)
Mm...

431
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:12,914
(Gasps)

432
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:14,665
Look!

433
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,956
(Rain patters)

434
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:29,452
(Water pours)

435
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,213
(Coughs and gasps)

436
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:43,013
(People cough and wheeze)

437
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:50,837
(Water drips
as Lagertha wrings out a cloth)

438
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,295
(Weakly)
I am going to die.

439
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:55,870
No,

440
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:57,914
you are not going to die.

441
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:01,586
The Seer might think that he
is the only one in Kattegat

442
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:03,767
with the gift of prophecy,

443
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,622
but he's wrong,

444
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:09,571
and I know you are not
going to die.

445
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,632
(Coughing and wheezing)

446
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,612
Aslaug: I should tell you the
truth about who I really am.

447
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:23,010
I am Princess Aslaug.

448
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:25,814
My mother was
the shield-maiden Brunhilde.

449
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:33,418
Everyone knows the
renown of your mother.

450
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,683
But I am not her.

451
00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:39,206
I am myself.

452
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:42,410
Both my parents are dead now,

453
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:44,863
and I did not know them anyway.

454
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:47,618
Why did you come along with me?

455
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,093
Because I had no choice.

456
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,874
Hmm...

457
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:56,518
(Kissing)

458
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,659
Why did you do that?

459
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:08,910
Because I had no choice.

460
00:27:14,162 --> 00:27:16,864
(Men snore softly)

461
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,041
(Soft sighs of pleasure)

462
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:46,059
(Kissing,
sighing with pleasure)

463
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:58,816
(Birds chirping)

464
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:01,385
(Horse nickers)

465
00:28:01,461 --> 00:28:03,206
Bjorn:
I hate you.

466
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:06,035
It's disgusting.

467
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:09,300
I could not help myself.

468
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:11,347
Shall I tell that to Lagertha,

469
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:12,474
your wife?

470
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:14,206
If you want to.

471
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,634
You cannot love her that much
after all,

472
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:22,115
no matter what you say,
no matter what people think.

473
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:24,732
I don't care what people think.

474
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:27,940
Of course I love your mother.

475
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,849
(Men chatter quietly)

476
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,404
Bjorn: Swear to me that
it will not happen again.

477
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:48,364
I swear to you
it won't happen again.

478
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,939
I love you.
(Swift kiss)

479
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,972
Now, go play.

480
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,086
(Chuckles)

481
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:11,392
(Bird chirps)

482
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:16,725
Man:
(Coughing violently)

483
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:22,566
(Coughing)

484
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:26,843
(Harness jingles, goats bleat)

485
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:30,847
(Chickens cluck)

486
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,464
Unnngh!

487
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:39,154
(Wagon rattles
as it trundles away)

488
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:45,562
(People coughing and wheezing)

489
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,210
Siggy: (Screaming hysterically)
No!

490
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:56,699
(Wailing)
