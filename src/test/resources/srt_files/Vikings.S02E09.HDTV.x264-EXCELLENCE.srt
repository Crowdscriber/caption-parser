<i>Ragnar: Previously on "Vikings":</i>

00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:07,840
<i>King Egbert: Your friends have returned.</i>

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,576
<i>A large fleet of Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.</i>

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,744
What will you do?

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,645
King Egbert: I hope I
can negotiate with Ragnar.

6
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,013
<i>King Horik: Where is Torstein going?</i>

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,349
I sent him to inform
the King of our return.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,184
King Horik: But you will
never ever do anything again

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,386
without consulting with me first,

10
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,055
<i>for you and I are not equals.</i>

12
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,759
<i>King Egbert: Princess Kwenthrith of Mercia!</i>

13
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,162
<i>I would like to hire some
Northmen as mercenaries</i>

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,799
to help you succeed in
gaining the Throne of Mercia.

<i>Aethelwulf: Athelstan is waiting
to see you at my father's villa.</i>

16
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,203
<i>He hopes that you will be
prepared to talk to him.</i>

17
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,372
King Egbert: Ragnar
Lothbrok is no longer alone

18
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,907
<i>in attacking our shores.</i>

19
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:45,744
If you and I join together,
we should surely overcome him!

20

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,568
<i>Athelstan: Caesar had sent
his cavalry a little in advance</i>

32
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,305
<i>and was following with
the rest of his forces.</i>

33
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,275
<i>The battlefront was not formed
according to rules of military theory,</i>

34
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,711
<i>but as necessitated by the emergency</i>

35
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,048
and the sloping ground of the Hillside.

36
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,283
The legions were facing different ways

37
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,953
<i>and fighting different actions.</i>

38
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,189
<i>The 9th and 10th legions were on the left,</i>

39
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,558
<i>and discharged a Volley of
Spears at the Atrebates."</i>

40
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,330
King Egbert: Yes. He's always
thinking, always using the terrain.

41
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,266
Go on.

42
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,634
<i>Athelstan: At the same time,</i>

43
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,003
<i>the Roman cavalry and light-armed troops,</i>

44
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,071
<i>seeming to appear from nowhere</i>

45
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:25,410
King Egbert: Ahah! But he
knew where. They were in here.

46
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,647
And what of his person! What of he himself?

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,752
Athelstan: As the situation was critical,

48
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,055
Caesar moved to the front of the line,

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,225
addressed each centurion by name,

50
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,662
and shouted encouragement to..."

51
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,997
The fragment ends here.

52
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:49,868
King Egbert: Hmm. But we can
imagine how it really ends.

53
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:56,441
We must do battle with Ragnar
Lothbrok and his allies.

54
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,046
I cannot believe that Ragnar
does not want to negotiate.

55
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,148
I know him too well. He's looking for land,

56
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,018
farming land, for his people.

57
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:10,889
King Egbert: His men killed all
of my envoys, sparing only my son.

58
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,192
By which they sent me a
simple but clear message.

59
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,428
Athelstan: Why not send me to speak to him?

60
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:27,139
You are already too dear
to me, and too important.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,242
Which is why, I think, they would kill you.

62
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,083
Athelstan: When? When will you attack?

63
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:43,055
King Egbert: As soon as King
Aelle returns with his warriors.

64
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:47,826
I'm sure you would prefer that
Earl Ragnar and I made peace.

65
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,929
Perhaps then you could
be at peace with yourself.

66
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,936
Ragnar: King Horik, your behaviour
has made it very difficult

67
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,373
to talk peace or to
negotiate with King Egbert.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,943
King Horik: I never had any intention
of negotiating with King Egbert.

69
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,612
I thought you were aware of that.

70
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,547
I only want revenge.

71
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,882
<i>I want to kill King Egbert.</i>

72
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,186
And then, perhaps, I shall talk to him.

73
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,521
<i>Lagertha: If we defeat Egbert in battle,</i>

74
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,657
he may be prepared to offer us more

75
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,594
in terms not only of gold, but of land.

76
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,930
Ragnar: This was a gift in good faith.

77
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,798
King Horik: What is good faith?

78
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,969
Why should there be good faith
between us and Christians?

79
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,174
What do you say, Floki?

80
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,113
Floki: They worship a false God.

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,116
They're fleas and vermin.

82
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,118
<i>Ragnar: I will go myself and talk to him.</i>

83
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,421
King Horik: You will not
divide our forces, Earl Ragnar.

84
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,823
You seem to forget I am King.

85
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,894
We will strike camp tomorrow,

86
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,530
and, armed and ready, we
will go to seek battle,

87
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,266
as our father Odin has taught us.

88
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,870
<i>Erlendur.</i>

<i>Bjorn: I can't sleep.</i>

95
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,967
I am thinking about what it is like to die.

96
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,938
Only those who have died would know.

97
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,807
The Seer would know.

98
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:45,143
Ragnar: He is not truly
dead. That is his curse.

99
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,718
He told me something about you.

100
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,754
That you would marry
the daughter of a King,

101
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,691
or else sail round a sea that has no tides.

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,729
Then I shall not die tomorrow?

103
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,331
Not according to the Seer.

104
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,336
(Fire crackles)

105
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:18,042
Bjorn reminds me of Odin's
favourite son, Balder.

106
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,145
<i>You know the story.</i>

107
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:27,720
Floki: The Gods made everyone
swear an oath that he would be safe.

108
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,924
Nothing could injure Odin's favourite son.

109
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,560
King Horik: The Gods even tested the oaths.

110
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:39,297
They threw stones at him,
darts, struck him with axes,

111
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,967
and slashed at him with swords,

112
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:47,106
but it seems nothing could harm Balder.

113
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,074
Floki: Everyone rejoiced

114
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,077
that it was impossible to hurt Balder.

115
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,114
All except Loki.

116
00:06:55,215 --> 00:07:00,187
The sly one watched with
distaste and impatience.

117
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,723
<i>And it sickened him to
see how Balder was immune</i>

118
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,692
from all sorts of attacks.

119
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:12,232
Yes. The sly one knew he had
to find a way to kill him.

120
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:19,773
Athelstan: Help me, Lord.

121
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,642
Who are these Gods who haunt my nights

122
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,011
and wreck my peace?

123
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:26,847
Odin, Thor, Freyr...

124
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,685
You have taught us not
to worship false Gods,

125
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:34,588
but I have seen them.

126
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,656
I have seen Thor in the sky!

127
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,792
I have seen the Sparks from his anvil.

128
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,663
I felt the sea heave with his anger.

129
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:47,534
- (Sighs)
- Why is this false?

130
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,137
Things that I've seen with my own eyes.

131
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:53,640
Things that Ragnar believes.

132
00:07:57,078 --> 00:08:00,948
Whatever happens, do not let Ragnar die...

133
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:06,253
Nor yet Lord Egbert.

even the complete
destruction one Northern army

340
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,663
will not lead to the
end of their incursions.

341
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,531
Probably quite the opposite.

342

return with renewed strength.

344

And not just once or
twice, but again and again,

times without number.

346
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,316
<i>The only way to bring an
end to these incursions</i>

347
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,853
is to negotiate an agreement
that is good for both sides.

348
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:40,724
But, in the meantime, King Aelle,

349
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,960
buying the services of these Northmen,

350
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,361
as mercenaries,

351
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,298

Aelle: Mm. Very well. As you say.

353

But someone has to take
this offer to the Pagans.
