Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,956 --> 00:00:05,065
So what, you just came over here
to get my hopes up?

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,566
I came here to make sure that
you don't go to church tonight.

4
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:12,996
There's nothing to gain
by locking horns with Tusk.

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,542
- He's not a man who likes conflict.
- Neither am I.

6
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,911
Are you intentionally trying
to destroy the president?

7
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,419
You may have all the money, Raymond,
but I have all the men with guns.

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,853
Raymond, was this intentional?

9
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:30,418
I may need to take two of
my plants offline tomorrow,

10
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:31,730
<i>for unscheduled maintenance.</i>

11
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,077
- <i>No. That's unacceptable.</i>
- Safety comes first.

12
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:35,641
We don't want an accident.

13
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,251
Did you kill Zoe Barnes?

14
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:39,357
I'm gonna treat this the way
I would any other story.

15
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:40,680
You might not like what I write.

16
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:41,778
It makes me seem crazy.

17
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:45,374
- You committed a crime.
- Not murder.

18
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:48,129
He's gonna get away with it,
isn't he?

19
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:49,723
Yes.

20
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,160

00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:02,239
<i>Bob Birch.</i>

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,360
<i>President Walker has surrounded himself</i>
<i>with a broken Congress.</i>

24
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:10,040
<i>He even brought one of them</i>
<i>into the White House.</i>

25
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:14,440
<i>Now, they've broken the economy and
put us on a collision course with China.</i>

26
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,761
<i>Put a stop to them</i>
<i>before it's too late.</i>

27

<i>Paid for by Friends</i>
<i>of a Better America.</i>

30
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,320
Twenty-five million?
Out of thin air?

31
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:32,200
- That's our estimate.
- Where is the money coming from?

32
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:34,160
- Super PACs.
- These are issue-based attack ads.

33
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,120
- So who's giving to them?
- We can't trace the money

34
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:37,800
until this quarter's
filings come in.

35
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,240
We get killed in the midterms,
we can kiss 2016 goodbye.

36
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,960
You can deal with the Republican
majority and a Republican president.

37
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,560
We're trying to counter
with D-trip.

38
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,960
Make 25 million appear
out of nowhere?

39
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,880
- We can make a dent.
- Dents don't cut it.

40
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:50,161
No matter how fast we ramp up
fund-raising, we can't close the gap.

41
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,480
- We have to stop their money flow.
- I want to know how.

42
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,600
Locate the source
and then cut off the tap.

43
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,320
With this influx, you can be sure
that somebody's not playing by the rules,

44
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:58,960
but we can't whistle-blow
until we find the source.

45
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,520
Then find it. And you sure
as hell better find it soon.

46
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,520
In the meantime, I've been working
on a proposal to counter the attacks.

47
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,280
I've coordinated
national messaging effort.

48
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,760
I'll be sending copies
later today.

49
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,680
We should be open to every idea.

50
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:10,961
Now, go. Get to work.

Frank.

53
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,320
You were supposed
to steer Congress on my behalf.

54
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:27,560
- No one is as concerned as me.
- I should've kept you in the House,

55
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,599
like Raymond suggested
from day one.

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,040
But you've been distracted,

57
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,599
by the Senate,
the State of the Union,

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
meddling with foreign diplomacy.

59
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,360
- You asked me to negotiate...
- I know what I've done.

60
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:40,560
- And I know where it's gotten us.
- Sir, the attack ads are not

61
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,079
- a result of anything...
- You're scrambling from fire to fire

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,120
- instead of preventing them.
- I'm not the FEC, I can't wave a wand...

63
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,040
Give me more than excuses,
Frank! You're better than that!

64
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,320
- Or maybe you're not.
- If you need a punching bag,

65
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:58,120
I will stand here and take the punches,
as I have done time and time again,

66
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:00,600
since I swore my oath.

67
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:03,640
But I would much rather
get back to work, as you've asked me to do.

68
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,481
You are out of line, Frank.

69
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:10,321
Dismiss me or keep swinging,
Mr. President.

70
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,481
You're dismissed.

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,921
Thank you, sir.

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,880
Dan Lanagin switched teams.

74
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:58,600
That doesn't make any sense.

75
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:02,360
I couldn't find any anomalies
among big Republican donors,

76
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,880
so I checked our own.

77
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,040
Lanagin hasn't given
a dime this quarter.

78
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,760
Yeah, but not giving isn't the
same as giving to the Republicans.

79
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,440
His casino's accounts.
Ernst and Young.

80
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:17,680
Eighteen million for donations,
and they're not going to us.

81
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,880
How did you get
your hands on those?

82
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:23,280
I've got friends.
That's why you solicit my services.

83
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,200
The estimate for
the ad buys was 25 million.

84
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,160
Those accounts are
up-to-date as of June 30th.

85
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,280
They could've made
more donations since then.

86
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:34,601
Tusk.

87
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:39,280
Lanagin's casino is in Missouri.

88
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:42,000
- Raymond Tusk?
- He's got an axe to grind with me

89
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,639
- and with the president. - I've never seen
his name on any FEC filings.

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,880
He doesn't make political contributions.
That's how he remains flexible.

91
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,401
You think he's funneling
the money somehow?

92
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,520
I don't know.

93
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,879
Get yourself to Kansas City.
I want you in that casino.

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,241
- Yes, sir.
- I'll keep digging.

95
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,320
Get me my wife.

96
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:07,200
- Where'd you get the recipe?
- My father taught me.

97
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,759
- You and your dad were close?
- Nah.

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,120
Cooking ribs was the only thing
that motherfucker did right.

99
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:16,159
- I guess you can't print that.
- I have ways.

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,960
This really gonna
be in the paper?

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,800
Well, at least in Boston, yeah.

102
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,959
Don't see why
anybody would care.

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,440
Well, it's a personal
interest story.

104
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:28,599
Vice President of the United States
comes here, of all places.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,080
- You mean this shithole?
- That's not what I said.

106
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,760
It's OK.

107
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,560
It's not the Taj Mahal.

108
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:41,360
- How long has he been coming?
- About 20 years now.

109
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:44,440
- He's a good man, Frank.
- You still call him Frank?

110
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:48,039
Hey, in this joint, I'm the president,
the vice president and the Congress.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,159
He just another customer.
A loyal one.

112
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
You think that's
why he likes it here?

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,839
'Cause you treat him
like a regular person?

114
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,639
Maybe. Mostly it's
the fuckin' ribs, though.

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,241
Now, if unemployment goes up more than
two-tenths, I want the Fed to consider...

116
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:36,480
- Get you something, hon?
- Club soda with lime, please.

117
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,759
- That's it?
- Yeah.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,440
- Nothing to eat?
- No. That's it.

119
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:44,959
Tough spot to hang out
if you're in the program.

120
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,439
- How'd you know?
- Takes one to know one, right?

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,920
- How long?
- Little over a year. You?

122
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,640
Going on 15.

123
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:59,440
- Any luck with the ponies?
- None. Not yet.

124
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:03,840
- Pick a number, one through 12.
- Nine.

125
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:10,360
- Hot Fuzz.
- Sounds about right.

126
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:14,560
Club soda comin' up, darlin'.
With lime.

127
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,760
<i>Hasn't moved, last two hours.</i>

128
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,199
And he hasn't spoken to anybody?

129
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,560
Just been betting on the races.

130
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:26,160
- You want us to bring him in?
- No.

131
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:29,080
That's the vice president's
chief of staff.

132
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:32,760
- Really?
- We don't want to make a scene.

133
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,039
Just keep an eye on him.

134
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,679
Let me know what he does,
where he goes and who he talks to.

135
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,199
You got it, Mr. Lanagin.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,999
<i>You should've seen their faces.</i>

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,880
<i>They didn't know what to think.</i>

138
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,359
Especially when
I made them hold the bag.

139
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,601
- You tried it out?
- I sure as hell did.

140
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:55,920
- I'm sorry I lashed out at you, Frank.
- No. I was disrespectful,

141
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,120
- and that was uncalled for. - My temper's
gotten away from me these days.

142
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,960
I need to be jolted back
into reality sometimes.

143
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:07,840
- It was a... a kind gesture.
- Just some good ol' fun.

144
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,399
Tricia tells me we're having
dinner, later this week.

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,120
Yes, Claire tells me the same.

146
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,880
Well, it'll be good to get out
of this place for a few hours.

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,479
It's been here since Kennedy.
It was painted the same year he was born.

148
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,999
It depicts, I think,
a World War I parade.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,560
Well, I should know
every painting.

150
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,239
Well, you seem to
know quite a lot, at least about this one.

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,840
I try to soak it all in
while I can. All the history.

152
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,559
Presidents who obsess over
history obsess about their place in it,

153
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
- instead of forging it.
- Who said that?

154
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,681
I did... just now.

155
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,760
The White House.
All day long it's buzzing,

156
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:03,079
and at this hour
it's so... desolate.

157
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,599
The presidency is a great
and precious thing.

158
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Loneliness is the price.

159
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Let's assume...

160
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,199
...in one of these chairs,
staring at this wall,

161
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
is where Truman decided
to drop the bomb,

162
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:23,161
and see if we feel anything.

163
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,240
Nothing. You?

164
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,841
No, nothing.

165
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,719
Sorry, it's a mess.

166
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,961
- You don't have to clean up for me.
- Yes, I do.

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,640
Wouldn't want you seeing these.

168
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,320
I wore 'em last night.

169
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:11,840
You like these, or you want the ones
I'm wearing now?

170
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,359
- How long you been working in the casino?
- Too long.

171
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,401
- Bet you've seen a lot.
- Oh, yeah. I've seen everything.

172
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:51,481
- I should get going, got an early meeting.
- OK.

173
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
You want me to stay?

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
I wasn't planning
on sleeping here.

175
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,880
So... another one-night stand,
then.

176
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:14,079
- Is that OK?
- Not really my thing.

177
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,639
- Come on, you must play the field.
- No, I don't.

178
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,840
- But you are such a flirt.
- I flirt, yes.

179
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:25,080
But I only sleep with
someone if I'm into them.

180
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:26,520
And I prefer to stick around.

181
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:29,640
Remy Danton, serial monogamist.

182
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,360
Is this a joke?

183
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,479
I'm sorry. I didn't...

184
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,801
Sorry.

185
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,600
This doesn't happen again
unless it's leading somewhere.

186
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:51,321
I'm upfront about what I want.
In all things, not just politics.

187
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,359
Three or four times a year, they fly in
about a dozen Chinese guys, money to burn.

188
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,839
They got a whole floor of the
casino reserved just for them.

189
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,680
<i>Word is they</i>
<i>throw away millions.</i>

190
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,519
That doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

191
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,479
The Chinese love to gamble,
especially the rich ones.

192
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,559
<i>Yeah, in Vegas.</i>
<i>This is Missouri.</i>

193
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,199
<i>- It's a much longer flight.</i>
- I wanna find out...

194
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,559
I want to find out where these
planes are coming from.

195
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,398
- Who do we know in the FAA?
- <i> I don't know anyone,</i> but<i> Doyle does.</i>

196
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,600
<i>I already got him on it.</i>
<i>I'll text you when I hear back from Doyle.</i>

197
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:25,721
I gotta go.

198
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
You leaving?

199
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,680
Yeah. Thanks for last night.

200
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,719
- I had fun.
- No, you didn't.

201
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,960
You were thinking
of somebody else.

202
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
I got that one after ten years.

203
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,840
Hope it brings you some luck.

204
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,679
Elaine Brooks will be sponsoring and the
First Lady has approved the early draft.

205
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,479
Jackie, take a look at the board.
Get a sense of who might cosponsor,

206
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,559
- besides yourself. - Absolutely. I'm sure
we can lock down a lot of heavyweights.

207
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,039
Lorrie and I will
get right on it.

208
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,999
We should talk
about a media plan.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,999
- It's premature for that.
- Don't we want to get this out,

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,919
start building support
as soon as possible?

211
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,359
- Events, interviews?
- I want what's most effective.

212
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,199
A media blitz is the wrong way to go.
You want a single long lead

213
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,639
that coincides with the introduction
of the bill. Something classy.

214
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,159
- But you want broad support, to hit...
- A blanket strategy will

215
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,759
galvanize as many detractors
as supporters.

216
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,399
Not if the message is framed...

217
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,279
We want a key demographic
to get on board, and then...

218
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,840
- Let me finish, please.
- Then we let it percolate.

219
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,279
I suggest Matt Bai,
<i>The New York Times Magazine.</i>

220
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,320
I like that idea.
I like that very much.

221
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:51,119
So do I. Can you speak to Matt?
No promises. Just test the waters.

222
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,480
- Happy to do that. - I've got a
good relationship. I'll call him.

223
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:56,920
Great. Seth, you keep me posted
and let's all get together later this week.

224
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,001
Thanks, Jackie.

225
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,399
I want you to read the bill
and write me a summary.

226
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,759
Do not, under any circumstances,
share it with anyone until we've spoken.

227
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,840
- Don't want to go over the board first...
- No. Not yet.

228
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:27,399
Anything on the abortion?

229
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,560
Nothing.
It all checks out.

230
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,479
- One hundred percent?
- I turned over every stone.

231
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,599
- Mrs. Underwood was telling the truth.
- We need something.

232
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,360
- This is taking too long.
- The Underwoods are careful.

233
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,440
If they have skeletons,
they're buried deep.

234
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,122
Not a question of "if." Somebody like
Frank is gonna have skeletons.

235
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,880
Then I'll find them.

236
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:49,599
If you don't deliver, that means
I don't deliver. And I always deliver.

237
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,880
You gave me an assignment
with high expectations. I will meet them.

238
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,799
But it's not gonna happen overnight.
So don't fuck with me.

239
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm a hired gun.
Not one that you own.

240
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:03,600
As long as you hit the target.

241
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,598
Then I need a favor.

242
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,039
- Connor Ellis.
- What about him?

243
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,879
I'll have more access
if he isn't around.

244
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,519
Arrange a cushy job offer
for him somewhere.

245
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,279
- Private or public sector?
- Private. Lots of money.

246
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,919
Something he can't turn down.

247
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,879
I'll see what I can do.

248
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,759
Here, this is half.

249
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,319
You can pay me when I've gotten
you what you want.

250
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
I don't take half pay
for a job half done.

251
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,119
- It's an interesting proposal.
- What we're missing is a unified theme.

252
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,240
If we coordinate on national ad-buys,
organize crossover events,

253
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,799
develop fund-raising apps,
I think it would go a long way...

254
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,679
Maybe, but I doubt the
leadership will go for it.

255
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,999
Which is why I'd like your
support. I set up a meeting.

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,040
If you came, and you
supported my position...

257
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,760
I just think they're gonna end up saying
we can't be thinning out our funds

258
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:08,158
on a national strategy. This is about
fieldwork, getting out the vote.

259
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,119
Right, but isn't it worth
at least some consideration?

260
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,839
Well, you know me, Linda,
I mean, I'm all for bold ideas.

261
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,679
But Birch and Womack, why,
they're... set in their ways.

262
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,000
I doubt very seriously that...

263
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,559
Listen, Frank, all I'm asking is that you
play devil's advocate with them.

264
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,039
Sorry, excuse me for a moment.
This is important.

265
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,519
I don't want
to short-shrift this.

266
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,439
No, I know, but I just
have to send this text.

267
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,080
I am busy too.

268
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,279
- Make sure that's an aisle seat.
- Of course.

269
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,079
I don't feel as if you're
taking this very seriously.

270
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,679
Linda, I apologize. I am sorry.

271
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,439
You are absolutely right,
I did not mean to sound curt.

272
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,479
And you are right,
this is important.

273
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,078
You and I should
go through your proposal

274
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,399
and discuss it right
down to the last detail.

275
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,919
I am not asking you to go
through it page by page,

276
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,319
just to help me initiate
some meaningful dialogue.

277
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,559
- You can count on my help, Linda.
- Thank you.

278
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,239
- I will have my scheduler
reach out to yours. - Thank you, Linda.

279
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Get me a secure line, please.

280
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,880
The vice president
is on the line.

281
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,839
Mr. Vice President.

282
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,639
Normally, I would ignore your call,
but I am in a good mood today.

283
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,199
<i>- Not even you could ruin it.</i>
- Are you funneling
money to the Republicans?

284
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,358
What on earth
are you talking about?

285
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,799
<i>About 20 million</i>
<i>in GOP Super PACs.</i>

286
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,439
You know I never make
political contributions.

287
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,439
That's the fastest way
to upset my investors.

288
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,359
I know the money is coming
from a casino in Missouri,

289
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,159
and I know
it's coming from Feng.

290
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,879
<i>Mr. Feng and I have</i>
<i>one co-venture together,</i>

291
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,159
<i>and it has nothing</i>
<i>to do with gambling.</i>

292
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,399
A plane that he owns

293
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,079
<i>flies to Lanagin's casino</i>

294
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,479
<i>- on a regular basis.</i>
- What he does on his own time

295
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,679
- is no business of mine. - Are you trying
to create chaos in the ranks?

296
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,559
The Republicans appear to be doing
a fine job of that without my help.

297
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,639
Well, it's not gonna work, Raymond.
It'll bind the Democrats together,

298
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,800
- not pull us apart. - What has bound them
together the past decade has been

299
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,639
the means to achieve a majority.

300
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,039
<i>- If I had to guess...</i>
- He stacked Congress.

301
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,200
The majority I whipped.

302
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,199
So it's been you,
Raymond, all along,

303
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,519
<i>even when Lanagin's money</i>
<i>was coming to us.</i>

304
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,359
You keep making assumptions
that I have denied.

305
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,679
Once the quarterly filings come
out, anybody with a laptop

306
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,559
- is gonna see what's going on.
- The end of September.

307
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,359
<i>That's a long way off.</i>
<i>But I look forward to seeing the reports.</i>

308
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,679
Should make for some very interesting
reading two weeks before the midterms.

309
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,318
You cannot bully your way back
to the table, Raymond,

310
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,599
just as you cannot
buy the keys to Congress.

311
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,479
Best of luck keeping your
majority in the House.

312
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,200
I know how much it means to you.

313
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,600
When the money's
coming your way,

314
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,999
you don't ask any questions.

315
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,639
But now it's clear. Lanagin's
never been anything but a front.

316
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,279
Do I tell the president? No.

317
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,519
He'll wonder why I didn't know,
which makes me look uninformed.

318
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,719
Or he'll blame the messenger for involving
him, which makes me look careless.

319
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,439
I know it's a trap.
I must keep this to myself.

320
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,479
He wants to know who
you are buying on behalf of.

321
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,680
It's a hedge fund named
Mercury Capital. It's unlisted.

322
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,079
They need the names
of the principal investors.

323
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,239
Tell him I have
to protect identities.

324
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,879
The broker needs more.
He wants a full investor list.

325
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,279
Say, um...

326
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,240
Say that the principal investor
has strong ties to the White House.

327
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,438
And they want to know
if you represent Clayton West.

328
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,440
Clayton West?

329
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,680
- He's waiting.
- One second.

330
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,159
- What does it say?
- It's about a refinery in China

331
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,359
for rare earth elements.

332
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,679
Tell him yes. Tell him the principal
investor is Raymond Tusk.

333
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,600
...Raymond Tusk.

334
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:38,960
<i>This is Doug Stamper...</i>

335
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,839
- What should we serve the Walkers?
- Cyanide.

336
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,678
Saving that for dessert.
What about a main course?

337
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,679
Meat of some sort? Vegetables?

338
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,358
I mean, this isn't really
my area of expertise.

339
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,279
I was thinking,
what about Freddy?

340
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,160
- Ribs?
- Or is that gauche?

341
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,200
No. I like the idea.

342
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,638
Well, we can do the
nice china, gourmet sides.

343
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,198
But I think the ribs
make it more personal.

344
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,880
I'll make the call.

345
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:21,479
- Any word on the call you're expecting?
- Not yet.

346
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,479
I don't think he's landed.

347
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,718
This is really coming
along, isn't it?

348
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,999
You think it's childish.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,679
I think it's better
than video games.

350
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,558
- Do you have my check for $5,000?
- Next time I get a raise.

351
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,638
- Bad luck at the casino?
- So Tusk knows I'm here.

352
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:01,598
- Daniel Lanagin knows you're here.
- Is Tusk involved?

353
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,799
- Why would I admit that?
- Tusk is in business with you.

354
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,879
You're sending money to Lanagin.
Lanagin's casino is in Tusk's backyard.

355
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,119
You didn't fly halfway around
the world just to confirm suspicions.

356
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,678
- Tell me what you want. - We want the
money to stop flowing to the Republicans.

357
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,479
- And what do I receive?
- I've told you what we want.

358
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,799
- Now it's your turn.
- So you can mislead me again?

359
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,719
Things have changed.
We have nothing to gain by misleading you.

360
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,358
Hm...

361
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,880
What do you think of my garden?

362
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,359
It's very beautiful.

363
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,078
When you only talk business,
you stop appreciating beauty.

364
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,959
- I don't have much time for beauty.
- That's a shame.

365
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,438
For people like you to smell the
flowers, some of us have to pull the weeds.

366
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,959
- When do you plan on leaving?
- I haven't bought my return ticket yet.

367
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,759
Good. I'd like to think on this for a
night. And I'm sure you must be exhausted.

368
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,519
Would you do me
the honor of being my guest?

369
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,039
- I'd be very grateful.
- Excellent. You can get some rest.

370
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,840
And if you like, there are many beautiful
things to enjoy here.

371
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,640
Please.

372
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,759
- Sir? Mr. Grayson is here.
- Seth.

373
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,639
You and I haven't really
properly had the chance to sit

374
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,319
and have a chat
since you came on board.

375
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,439
Is there anything
I can be doing better, sir?

376
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,878
No, no. I'm impressed.

377
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,279
You're very smart.
Excellent work ethic.

378
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,198
- But more importantly, you're
very observant. - Information is power.

379
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:06,438
It was right here in this room
that my...

380
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:10,719
...wife revealed a great deal of
information to a great number of people.

381
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,438
- Millions of them.
- Sir, if your concern is my knowledge

382
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:15,198
of any discrepancies,
let me assure you...

383
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,719
Claire and I are private people.

384
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,199
I can understand
why you might mistrust me.

385
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,318
I'm also observant,
like you, Seth.

386
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,039
But I still have my blind spots.

387
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,998
It would have never occurred to
me to reach out to Mrs. Marbury.

388
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:36,639
Her husband was dead.
He kept no records.

389
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,159
And yet, there it
was in black in white.

390
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,239
I respect the fact that you brought it
to us, that's what got you in the door.

391
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,359
But if you wanna stay,
I need more.

392
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,360
What exactly are you up to?

393
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,559
I was hired by Remy Danton.

394
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,040
He wants anything damaging
that I can find.

395
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,398
- Does he have a copy of the journal?
- No copies.

396
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,358
I gave the original to Mrs. Underwood,
and I told him that her story checks out.

397
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,238
- Did you give him anything else?
- I don't have anything else.

398
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,758
I wouldn't give it
to him if I did.

399
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,479
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

400
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,598
Well, you're the vice president
of the United States.

401
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,358
Remy works for Raymond Tusk.

402
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,159
That puts me between two
extremely powerful people.

403
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,998
- I had to be careful.
- I'm sure that Remy's offering

404
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,998
- you a great deal of money.
- But that's all he offers.

405
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:35,518
When I saw you push entitlement
reform through the Senate,

406
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,278
it was clear to me where
the real power in the White House is.

407
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,279
I want to work for a man like you, not
sail a yacht. Money doesn't interest me.

408
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,958
Do you want me to cease contact
with Remy?

409
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:56,600
No. I want you to find
the blind spots.

410
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:00,079
- Is he free?
- For a few minutes.

411
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,159
- Thank you.
- Mexico City,

412
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,558
where you'll meet
President Soto.

413
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,077
We can practice your Spanish on
the plane.

414
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:07,879
Hi.

415
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,799
- What is that?
- Frank gave it to me.

416
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,158
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, is it important?

417
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:15,078
I have a meeting with...
When is it?

418
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,118
- He's already in the waiting room.
- The archbishop of New York.

419
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,879
I'm just wondering if we should
bring a gift to dinner tonight.

420
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,279
Yeah, well, it's casual.
Maybe a bottle of wine?

421
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,079
You know them well. Any idea
what sort of wine they like?

422
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,999
Well, not extremely well,
but I'm friendly with their staff...

423
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,479
- I'll figure it out.
- I can make a call.

424
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,799
I'm having a conversation

425
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,239
with my husband, but thank you.

426
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,838
- OK. I apologize.
- I'll see you at the residence.

427
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,959
Seven-thirty.

428
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,558
No. Not now.

429
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,359
No. Just... Please go.

430
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,400
Get out. Please.

431
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:29,880
Rachel, it's me. I...

432
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,359
You should answer when I call.
I don't like leaving messages.

433
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,599
- Seth.
- Ayla.

434
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,359
I get 15 minutes to eat,
on a good day.

435
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,598
- Xander Feng.
- Means nothing to me.

436
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,478
Connor told me about a
back-channel with China.

437
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,678
There was speculation it
was a guy named Xander Feng.

438
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,398
- Fourteen minutes, 52 seconds.
- He's in business with Raymond Tusk.

439
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,598
They're working on a refinery in China.
Tusk has ties to the White House.

440
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,958
- Fourteen minutes, 30 sec...
- One of the wealthiest men in America

441
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,238
in business with an off-the-books
Chinese diplomat?

442
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:00,958
Influence in Washington
never been reported?

443
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:03,118
The White House pushes rare earth
subsidies when the energy crisis spiked?

444
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,359
Do you have a specific
question for me?

445
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,038
I'd like to ask
the vice president.

446
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,838
A specific question for me,
not an interview request.

447
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,879
Does the vice president
know Raymond Tusk?

448
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,678
- Not to my knowledge.
- You're hiding something, Seth.

449
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,480
I'm not hiding anything.
I'm just a guy with low blood sugar.

450
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,159
- Garrett?
- Hm?

451
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:30,638
- What is it?
- Christina.

452
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:33,039
She won't leave me alone.

453
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,598
It's like she's trying
too hard to be helpful.

454
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,198
- I'll have Linda talk to her.
- It's not just that.

455
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:43,038
I feel like it's a mask. I feel like
there's something else going on there.

456
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,278
- Like what?
- Sometimes, when I walk into your office

457
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,558
and see her talking to you...

458
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,838
...and you've been traveling
together so much.

459
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,919
- Jesus, Tricia.
- Oh, not you, her.

460
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,238
I think she's attracted to you.
And she does have a history...

461
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:04,478
I can't even believe we're
having this conversation.

462
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,278
I want you to relocate her.
Find her another position...

463
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,478
- Absolutely not.
- I know it seems overboard...

464
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,798
She's a good aide.
She's valuable to Linda,

465
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,838
- valuable to the administration.
- I'm your wife.

466
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,279
- I should be more valuable than them.
- Tricia.

467
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,518
I don't understand why you're
fighting me when she bothers me...

468
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,839
We're pulling up to Frank's
in two minutes.

469
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,118
Really, superb, Freddy.

470
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,398
I can honestly say I have
never had better ribs in life.

471
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,439
Well, I'm glad you
liked you them.

472
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,078
You know, I read the article in the<i> Sun</i>
about how you go to Freddy's.

473
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,878
I hope you don't mind me speaking
to that reporter, Frank.

474
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,838
- Not at all.
- Shit, I forgot I'm not supposed

475
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,758
- to call you that.
- I wouldn't let you call me

476
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,317
"vice president" even if you
tried. And I didn't mind at all.

477
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:49,838
I thought the article was great.

478
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,959
It's been a big bump in business
since it came out.

479
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,118
I'm talking lines
around the block.

480
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,238
You're not the only white person
to show up there now.

481
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:00,998
Well, I'm gonna call it a night.
I got a early start in the morning.

482
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:05,079
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. President, Mrs. Walker.

483
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,558
- A pleasure. Truly.
- Thanks, Freddy.

484
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,159
Always.

485
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,878
Oh, no. None,
none for me, thanks.

486
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,999
Mr. President, a slice
of pie is good for the soul.

487
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,958
- I'm stuffed.
- You can have a slice of pie.

488
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,799
I'm fine, really,
but thank you, Frank.

489
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,118
I'll have some.

490
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,678
For the two of us, as well.

491
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,838
Oh, now she is gonna make me run
another five miles to work off this puppy.

492
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,078
Are you crazy?
I can barely keep up with you.

493
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,039
- You're so much faster than me.
- You two run together?

494
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,438
Yes. It's hard to find the time,
but somehow we find it.

495
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:39,078
We do. And it's something
that's just ours, you know?

496
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,037
Yes. Just ours.
And about eight Secret Service Agents'.

497
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,318
That's so nice
that you have that together.

498
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,078
I wish Garrett and I had more
time for things like that.

499
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,998
We did take a spinning class
together once.

500
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,360
- Should've seen Garrett hunched over...
- Please.

501
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,318
- Would you like some more wine?
- I would, thank you.

502
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,518
- I saw the punching bag you gave him.
- You know what?

503
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,040
- I will have a slice of pie.
- Pie, please, for the president.

504
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,479
Thank you.

505
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,798
I read it front to back. It's good.
It'll cause a shit-storm,

506
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,557
- but maybe that's what we need.
- Not during the midterms.

507
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,278
I don't see how we take flack.
We're trying to curtail rape, for godsakes.

508
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,919
Sure, some right-wingers
will do their usual song and dance...

509
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,518
Hold off. I want
to read it myself first.

510
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,759
We promised the vice president
we'd have cosponsors...

511
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,998
I know what we promised,
and we're gonna stall.

512
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:33,478
- Don't disseminate the draft.
- But you know the gist of the bill.

513
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,718
- I don't see why we can't...
- Lorrie.

514
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:39,118
All right,
I'll leave it with you.

515
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,998
- Anything else?
- No. I think we're good.

516
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,958
All right. Then I'm off.

517
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:48,199
Date night with the husband.
Slit my wrists, please.

518
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,478
Hey, go home at some point, OK?

519
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:54,759
The Capitol will still
be here in the morning.

520
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:44,439
This is really something.

521
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,558
Ways to go yet.

522
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,878
Now, who won this battle?
The North or the South?

523
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,519
Massive casualties on both
sides. No clear winner.

524
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,677
How do you find the time?

525
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:59,160
I carve out a half hour here
and there. Helps me relax.

526
00:35:00,318 --> 00:35:02,039
I've forgotten the meaning
of that word.

527
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,317
Well, that's what the
punching bag is for.

528
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:06,479
It's very true.

529
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:13,199
Just a little. Trish and
I should get going soon.

530
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,318
You're never gonna make it
through this first term, Mr. President.

531
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:21,998
- How do you mean? - Well, not like this.
Letting the stress creep in.

532
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,678
You need to run the marathon,
not the sprint.

533
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,679
You need to enjoy
these little moments of escape.

534
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,718
You can pour more than that.

535
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,959
Thank you.

536
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,199
- This Union or rebel?
- Union, sir.

537
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,597
Enough "sirs" and "Mr. Presidents."
Call me by my name.

538
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:48,477
I respect the office
too much for that.

539
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:49,838
When we're in private, it's OK.

540
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,959
Tonight, I don't have
to be president.

541
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,197
I don't mean to get
involved in your personal life.

542
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:58,520
Oh, no. I brought it up.

543
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,078
Is this really about Christina?

544
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,238
Or maybe it's just
a symptom of something else?

545
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,719
- Like what?
- I don't know.

546
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,959
I barely see him at all.

547
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,997
He's so wound up in everything
that's going on overseas,

548
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:22,838
the elections, the economy.

549
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:25,638
When he was governor,
it wasn't a cakewalk,

550
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:29,278
but it was nothing like this.

551
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:33,518
How do you and Frank do it?
You both seem so close.

552
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,838
We're honest with each other.
We don't sweep anything under the rug.

553
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,238
Trish, if it's eating at you,
make him talk about it.

554
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,279
The White House is finite.
Your marriage... is for life.

555
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:01,199
- Good morning.
- Morning.

556
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,959
- You don't like your soup?
- I'm not good with chopsticks.

557
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,398
I think you'll like this soup
more than you liked

558
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,518
the two companions
I sent you last night.

559
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,478
I was tired.

560
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:20,598
Have you had a chance to think
about what we discussed yesterday?

561
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,039
In China, it's polite to refuse a gift the
first time. Maybe I should refuse yours.

562
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,920
We can't offer you a gift
if I don't know what you want.

563
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,759
The Port Jefferson Bridge.

564
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,197
You pulled it,
during the back-channel.

565
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:38,559
- I changed my mind.
- Why?

566
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,637
I have allies who want the bridge.
Without it, they become my enemies.

567
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:48,838
- I've been put on trial twice.
- Corruption charges.

568
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,678
Everyone in China who works
on this level pays who they need to pay.

569
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,678
And they kill who
they need to kill.

570
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,279
People disappear all the time, Mr. Stamper.
I could disappear. You could disappear.

571
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,518
Stop the junkets
and we'll get you the bridge.

572
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,358
The bridge comes first.

573
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,757
The vice president
has lied to me before.

574
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:14,278
I need proof of his commitment.
Then the money will stop.

575
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,358
Please, Mr. Stamper... eat.

576
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,599
You have a long
flight ahead of you.

577
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,717
If it's what you
feel you need to do.

578
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:33,158
I've had a great experience
here, Mrs. Underwood,

579
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,677
but this is an opportunity
I can't pass up.

580
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,718
- I imagine the pay is substantial.
- It is.

581
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,157
But it's not just that.
There's room to grow at SpaceX.

582
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,799
Well, if your mind's made up,
I won't try and convince you to stay.

583
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,598
The truth is...
when I first came on board,

584
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,278
I thought it was to work
for both you and your husband.

585
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:53,558
Don't get me wrong, it's been
an honor working for you,

586
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,238
but I didn't foresee
having to work with Seth.

587
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,998
- You're not very fond of each other.
- No.

588
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:01,118
Which is fine.
We're professionals.

589
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,678
But I think this is
for the best.

590
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,838
Well, the problem with hiring great people
is everyone wants to steal them away.

591
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,718
I appreciate you
being so understanding.

592
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,798
- You'll be missed, Connor.
- Thank you.

593
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:22,358
Seth, it's me. He just left.
Talk to him and put out a press release.

594
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:25,878
Let's make this
as smooth as possible.

595
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:28,398
<i>It's two opportunities</i>
<i>I'm interested in.</i>

596
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:33,878
A family-oriented restaurant chain,
and a retail barbecue sauce.

597
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,077
What would that look like?

598
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:36,317
We give you an upfront payment

599
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:37,998
for the right to use your brand.

600
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,318
Either venture fails,
or if they both do,

601
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:44,998
- you still get to keep that money.
- How much money we talking?

602
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:48,158
Ninety-five thousand
as soon as you sign.

603
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,317
And then you'd have a share of
the profits if we're successful.

604
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,358
- What would the shares be?
- I tell you what.

605
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,918
Let me draw up papers, you look
them over, you show them to your lawyer.

606
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:03,518
- I don't have a lawyer.
- You should get one.

607
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:06,119
I don't want you to feel
like you're being cheated.

608
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,079
You're skeptical.

609
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,359
Look...

610
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:17,117
Money usually don't
come through that door,

611
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:19,558
unless it's looking
for a plate of ribs.

612
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,957
And we want to sell
thousands of those plates.

613
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,997
Millions, if the
franchise builds.

614
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:27,717
The<i> Sun</i> article
put you on the map.

615
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:31,279
Let's fill up that map
with Freddy's BBQ Joints.

616
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,678
- What are you looking at?
- Excuse me?

617
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,319
The knives are in the kitchen,
you have a pistol. You can stop staring.

618
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:52,198
Is he in here? Dan!

619
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,238
- How are you?
- Good.

620
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,997
- Care for a drink?
- I'm good.

621
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,238
Well, let's go into the
living room. It's more cozy.

622
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,878
- I'm just fine where I am.
- All right. Thank you.

623
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,599
Yes, sir.

624
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:08,477
I'm sure you've told Raymond
that I asked you here.

625
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:11,237
- Raymond who?
- Oh, you don't have to pretend, Dan.

626
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:14,198
- Feng confirmed what you're up to.
- Name doesn't ring a bell.

627
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:17,878
I have flight records. One of his planes
to Kansas City on multiple occasions.

628
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:19,877
Do we really have
to play this game?

629
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:23,278
I came here because I thought
you might have something to offer.

630
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,278
Why don't we just skip
to that part?

631
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,958
You've been
a loyal contributor, Dan.

632
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:34,638
You've thrown us fund-raisers, there are
pictures of you and I shaking hands.

633
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,318
So whatever you've done this
quarter can be forgotten.

634
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,838
But I need the money to stop
flowing in the wrong direction.

635
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,678
- I'm still waiting for the offer.
- You're a businessman, Dan,

636
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,317
- I know your primary concern is profits.
- That's right.

637
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:52,517
But I'm offering you something that's
far more valuable than money:

638
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:56,637
- a direct line to the White House.
- That sounds vague to me.

639
00:41:56,638 --> 00:42:00,278
I have influence over the BIA,
over federal gambling legislation.

640
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:03,837
The sort of influence that my
contributions have already bought.

641
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,198
Not with my direct involvement
and the president's ear.

642
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,238
You know what
I like about money?

643
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,237
I can stack it on a table,
like this one.

644
00:42:14,238 --> 00:42:16,678
I can measure it
with a yardstick.

645
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,317
I can see it, smell it,
buy things with it.

646
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:26,478
Houses, cars, clothes.
Things that are real.

647
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:29,398
You're gonna have to show up
with more than beads.

648
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:33,117
Dan, I invited you to my home
because I thought...

649
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:36,397
- Through the back door.
- Excuse me?

650
00:42:36,398 --> 00:42:38,638
Through the back door,
like a servant.

651
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,238
The Secret Service makes
everyone come in that way.
It's a precautionary measure...

652
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:44,238
Unless you can offer more money
than Tusk, and I don't think

653
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,998
that you can, there's little
left for us to talk about.

654
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:51,357
I am offering you an alliance
with a man who goes to work

655
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,477
everyday at
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue!

656
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:58,638
I don't place my faith
in any white man.

657
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,237
Especially one that works
for the federal government.

658
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:04,558
I am just like you, Dan.

659
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,318
I know what it means
to start from nothing, to have to fight...

660
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,758
You know nothing about
what it means to be me.

661
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:15,197
Your version of nothing
was light-years ahead of where I started.

662
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:17,038
I respect you, Dan.
I take you seriously...

663
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,398
I'll let you know when I give
a fuck about your respect.

664
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:25,159
Holliday! Show Lanagin out.

665
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,279
I know where the back door is.

666
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,119
Francis?

667
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,119
It's not broken.
I can fix it.

668
00:43:51,718 --> 00:43:54,238
Leave it.
I'll clean up later.

669
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:06,517
Let's go for a run.
Burn off some of this steam.

670
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,958
Sir?

671
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:17,998
- I'll be out in a moment.
- I'll go ahead. You catch up.

672
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:20,317
Why didn't you reach out,
before you got on a plane?

673
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:22,518
I was afraid our communication
might be monitored.

674
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:25,757
- Where are we with Lanagin?
- Nowhere. Where are we with Feng?

675
00:44:25,758 --> 00:44:29,278
We might have an option,
but it's gonna be tricky.

676
00:44:46,062 --> 00:47:00,945
