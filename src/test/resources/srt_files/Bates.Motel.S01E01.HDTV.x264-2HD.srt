00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:41,028
Mom?

3
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,652
Dad?

4
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,758
Mom!

5
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,764
Mom?

6
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:20,144
Mom!
Mom, open the door!

7
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,566
Mom!

8
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,535
What is it, Norman?

9
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:29,505
It's dad.
He's--hurry!

10
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,085
Dad? Dad? Dad?

11
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:45,154
Dad...

12
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,229
Norman...

13
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,538
Norman?

14
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:08,144
Norman.

15
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,323
Oh, honey.
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,659
Dad.

18
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,957
This is the part where you say,

19
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:59,462
"Mother, this is beautiful.

20
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,798
"I am so happy
we're moving here.

21
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,603
You are so smart
to have thought of this."

22
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,339
Mother, this is so beautiful.

23
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,808
I'm so happy
you're making me move here.

24
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,477
You're so smart

25
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:19,282
to force me to do things
I have no say in.

26
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,351
You're an ass.

27
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,660
Okay, no peeking!

28
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:33,329
Keep 'em closed.

29
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,999
Okay.
Okay, not yet.

30
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:53,049
Open your eyes.

31
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,151
What do you think?

32
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,393
This is crazy, mom.

33
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:08,030
It's not crazy.
It's not.

34
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:10,232
We're gonna run this place.
Mm-hmm.

35
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,035
Yeah.

36
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:16,172
We own a motel, Norman Bates.

37
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:22,078
Come on.
I wanna show you the house.

38
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,680
I bought the whole thing,

39
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,783
the house and the motel,
on a foreclosure.

40
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,360
And everything came with it.

41
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,794
Awesome.

42
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,129
You can't buy furniture
like this anymore.

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,464
You have to imagine this room

44
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,733
without all this crap in it.

45
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,135
Just simple,
elegant furnishings,

46
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,204
open space, light.

47
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:51,941
Linen drapes, fresh peonies.

48
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,644
This space is beautiful.

49
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,983
Come on.
I want to show you upstairs.

50
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,589
What's up here?
My room?

51
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:09,658
No, I put you down here,
closer to me.

52
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:15,831
This...is your room.

53
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,008
And this...
is my room.

54
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,251
Norman,
we've been through a lot.

55
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,186
This is our chance
to start over.

56
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,189
Maybe some people
don't get to start over.

57
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,358
Maybe they just bring themselves
to a new place.

58
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,760
They do get to start over,

59
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,463
but they have to try.

60
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:51,133
Yeah?
Norman, please, for me.

61
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,737
It's all gonna be good.
You'll see.

62
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,425
You're new.
What's your name?

63
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,715
Norman Bates.

64
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,205
When did you move here,
Norman Bates?

65
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:12,774
Last night.

66
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,876
Where?
What house?

67
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,644
Oh, here.
The house at the motel.

68
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,479
Oh, so you bought the motel?

69
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:19,781
Are you actually
gonna live here,

70
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,482
or are you just flipping
the property?

71
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,818
- We're not flipping.
- Do you have any brothers?

72
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,220
An older brother.
But he doesn't live here.

73
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:29,457
- Just me and my mom.
- You have a girlfriend?

74
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:31,192
No.

75
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,728

- Come on.

79
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,035
Come with us. Come on.

80
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,977
Am I too heavy?

81
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:52,480
No.

Bradley Martin.

86
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:09,030
You have any questions
at school, you call me.

87
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:12,133
- Okay?
- Thanks.

88
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,560
Hello, Dylan.

89
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:43,031
Thanks for letting me know
you moved, mom.

90
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:46,067
Well, I'm pretty sure
the last time we spoke,

91
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,102
you told me
to "drop dead, bitch."

92
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,937
Sorry I took it personally.

93
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,372
What, so you thought
that it was okay

94
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:55,710
not to tell your own son
that you moved?

95
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:58,746
What if I was hurt?
What if I was in the hospital?

96
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,948
What if I needed you?

97
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,718
Are you hurt?
Are you in a hospital?

98
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:07,321
I need some money.
My job fell apart.

99
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:11,759
Hello? Norma?
Hello?

100
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,796
So I want you to just think
about poetry tonight.

101
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:17,598
I mean, what does it mean?
Why is it timeless?

102
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,001
Why is there power in words

103
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,737
arranged in cadences
and structures?

104
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:26,841
Be ready to talk tomorrow.

105
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,445
Norman, can I talk to you
for a minute?

106
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:31,846
Sure.

107
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,614
I'm gonna be your advisor here,

108
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,584
and I was just reviewing
your school records and, um...

109
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:39,353
Your test scores are...

110
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:41,689
really impressive.

111
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,958
But your grades
just don't match up with them.

112
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,860
That's a shame.

113
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,029
Why do you think that is,
Norman?

114
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,164
- We move a lot.
- Mm-hmm, yeah, I see that.

115
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:52,333
You've been
to five different schools.

116
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:53,935
Is everything okay at home?

117
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:56,938
Yeah, yeah.

118
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,341
My mom's just a little...
impulsive.

119
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,776
She gets these ideas
about things,

120
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:05,379
and--and then we move
and start over...

121
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,749
- which is good.
- Mm.

122
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:21,729
You know, I think
it might be a good idea,

123
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:22,964
now that you're here,

124
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,166
to try to put down some roots.

125
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,802
You know, get involved,
maybe join a sports team?

126
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,871
I don't really play any sports.

127
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,405
My mom never really liked them.

128
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:35,143
Hmm.
What about track?

129
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,714
You look like a runner.

130
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:43,084
- You ever do any running?
- Not as a sport, no.

131
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:45,253
Well, track team tryouts
are today.

132
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,156
Why don't you go talk
to coach carpenter after school?

133
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:51,826
I'll--I'll tell him
that you're coming down.

134
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,662
Okay.

135
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,665
Norman, I...

136
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:59,934
I see that you
lost your dad recently.

137
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,170
I know how hard that must be.

138
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:04,906
So please know
that you can come to me

139
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:09,043
if you have any issues
or questions about anything,

140
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:12,980
because I'm here for you.
Okay?

141
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,185
I have to go now.

142
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,367
Wow.
Dinner smells great, mom.

143
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:49,150
I've been--
I've been waiting for you.

144
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,619
I stayed after school
to try out for the track team.

145
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
Oh, the track team?

146
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:55,890
Yeah, well, it was
Miss Watson's idea, I...

147
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:57,091
Who's Miss Watson?

148
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,460
My language arts teacher.

149
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,796
But yeah, she thought
it'd be a good idea

150
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:05,132
for me to get involved
at school.

151
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,568
That it'd be good for me.

152
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:11,639
I need you to sign this parent's
permission slip, though.

153
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,081
Honey, this is, like,
every day after school,

154
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,250
and track meets on Saturdays?

155
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,019
We just bought a motel.

156
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,854
I mean, how do you
expect me to get it

157
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,522
up and running
without your help?

158
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,525
I mean, you're putting me
in a tough spot here.

159
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,261
Mom, it's okay.
I don't have to do it.

160
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:35,162
No, I'm not gonna be

161
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:39,834
the mother who tells her kid
he can't be on the track team.

162
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:41,535
It's fine.
It's okay.

163
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:46,040
I'll just do everything myself,
the way I always do.

164
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:48,709
Mom, come on, sit down.
Let's eat dinner.

165
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,546
You know, Norman,
I just spent all day...

166
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,016
doing all of this.

167
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:57,385
You know, I just--

168
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,562
Never mind, I'm not hungry.

169
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,667
It's fine.

170
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:15,403
You know, it doesn't matter.

171
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,473
I have to get some groceries.
Just eat your dinner.

172
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,744
Mother!

173
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:36,390
- Norman Bates?
- Yes.

174
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,978
Just moved in
a couple of nights ago.

175
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,593
How do you like it?

176
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,147
Yeah, it's fine so far.

177
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,997
You live here with your mom?

178
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,666
Yeah.
Yeah, do you know her?

179
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:49,103
I know--
I know about her.

180
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,772
- Do you want me to get her?
- You're 17.

181
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,008
You're from Arizona,
and your father died.

182
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:57,912
- Yeah, let me get my mom.
- It's just the two of you.

183
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:00,681
What do you know about
running a motel, anything?

184
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,350
'Cause you look like
a little kid to me.

185
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:03,718
I don't think you could run
much of nothing.

186
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,387
Can I help you with something?

187
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:07,849
I think it's you
that needs help.

188
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:10,925
Really?
How might that be?

189
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:14,595
I'm Keith Summers.

190
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,032
Summers!

191
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,968
This is my family's property.

192
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:24,138
My great-great-grandfather
built this house in 1912,

193
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:27,441
and my grandfather
built that motel in the '50s.

194
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:30,544
And that's
my grandmother's rug!

195
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:34,215
This property has been in
my family for over a century.

196
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:43,324
I'm sure it was very hard
for you to lose it to the bank,

197
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:47,328
and I'm very sorry, but, uh...

198
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,664
well, it is ours now.

199
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,501
I know everything
about this place.

200
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,102
Every nook and cranny.

201
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,104
Every dirty secret.

202
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:59,640
You don't know
how this place works.

203
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:00,941
This town?

204
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,411
You know nothing
about this town.

205
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,280
What makes you think you
can run this place by yourself?

206
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,383
Because I can.

207
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,188
Now get the hell off
my property.

208
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,024
And if I ever see you here again
I will call the police,

209
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,594
or I will shoot you myself.

210
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,263
You're gonna call the police?

211
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,100
- Get in, get in!
- Go ahead, call the police.

212
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,135
I go fishing with half of 'em.

213
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:30,871
I grew up here.
This is my house!

214
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,840
So you're gonna
call the cops on me?

215
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:36,944
Well go ahead!
Go ahead, call 'em!

216
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,151
Do you think you should've
said all that stuff to him?

217
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:49,557
He's just some pathetic,
drunk loser slob, honey.

218
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,792
He's--he's not gonna
bother us anymore.

was redone on this place
was the '50s.

Hi, are you Mrs. Bates?

231
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,851
- I am.
- I'm Bradley Martin.

232
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:52,553
Oh, we're friends
with Norman from school

233
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,355
and we're going to the library,

234
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:57,691
and we were wondering if he
wanted to come study with us.

235
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,461
- Hey.
- Hey, Norman.

236
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,232
I'm sure he would love to go,

237
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,468
but we're in the middle
of a lot of stuff.

238
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:11,272
We still have unpacking to do.

239
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,708
I totally understand.

240
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,278
I like your house.
It's so cool.

241
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,547
Thank you.
There's--

242
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:21,882
We got a lot of work to do,
but it's--it's got potential.

243
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,651
- Well, maybe I could--
- No, Norman, not tonight.

244
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:25,819
No, it's not a good idea, no.
Another time.

245
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,254
No worries.

246
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:28,889
It was really nice meeting you,
Mrs. Bates.

247
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,725
Nice to meet you too.
Thanks for stopping by.

248
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,761
- Nice to meet you.
- Good night, Norman.

249
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:36,830
- See you, Norman.
- See ya.

250
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,900
How could you do that?

251
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,569
You didn't even let me answer.

252
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:42,937
Well, there was no point
in answering

253
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:44,638
because I knew
you would say "Yes,"

254
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,241
and I knew that
I would have to say "No."

255
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:48,909
I could have gone, mom.

256
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,912
You can go another time,
when we're settled in.

257
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:53,973
This is what it's always
gonna be like with you.

258
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,950
"Later."
"Another time."

259
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,451
When, mom?

260
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:58,786
You said you wanted me
to have a life here--

261
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:00,454
this is how you have one!

262
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,089
You meet friends, you let
other people in your life!

263
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,691
- Friends?
- Yeah, she's pretty.

264
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,093
Maybe she kind of likes me.
I'm 17!

265
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:07,361
Norman,
you don't even know them!

266
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,702
You have to be
a little careful.

267
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,130
Why do I have to be careful?

268
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:11,865
Norman, don't lose
your temper with me!

269
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:15,102
I'm just looking out for you.

270
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,512
Well, maybe you better
just stay there

271
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:28,616
the rest of the night then!

272
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:43,030
I suck.

273
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:33,013
Oh, my God, you're so cute.

274
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,129
You actually thought
we were gonna go study.

275
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:36,219

No, it's fine.
There's a lot to look at.

Is that a line?

You don't seem like
a guy who would have lines.

No, I've--
I mean, really.

297
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:06,409
There's a lot to look at.

298
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:07,910
It wasn't a line.

299
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:10,913
You're different, aren't you?

300
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:14,383
I don't know, maybe.

301
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:16,185
I think people who are different
don't know they're different

302
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:19,288
'cause they have nothing
to compare it to.

303
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,725
Yeah.
You're different.

304
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:25,928
- What's so different about me?
- I don't know, it's just...

305
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,099
a feeling I get.

306
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,568
You're like...

307
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:36,572
a beautiful, deep, still lake

308
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:40,009
in the middle
of a concrete world.

309
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,912
I am?
That's...kind of weird.

310
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:46,282
You're kind of weird.

311
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:48,684
Weird good.

312
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,289
Hey, Brad, you know who's
doing the recycling around here?

313
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,124
Oh, hey, Richard.

314
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:58,761
You get your diorama finished?

315
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:00,863
Richard had to do a diorama
for the globe theater

316
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,598
for his drama lit class.

317
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,967
I mean, seriously,
what grade are we in?

318
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,570
Yeah, I got it done,
and it actually kills.

319
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:11,574
Richard, this is Norman.

320
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,409
- He's new at our school.
- Hey.

321
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:16,445
Hey.

322
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,749
Babe, Jones just got here.
Let's go say hi, all right?

323
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,585
Okay.
You wanna come?

324
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,253
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm--I'm good.

325
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,790
You sure?

326
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:29,659
♪ See sparks ♪

327
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,795
- Yeah.
- Okay.

328
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:04,420
No!

329
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,160
Norman!

330
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,168
Norman!
Aah!

331
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:41,724
Ow! Ow!

332
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,359
Norman!

333
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:45,761
Norman!

334
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:49,799
Norman!

335
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:05,815
This house...

336
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:07,750
This house is mine.

337
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,986
And everything
in this house is mine.

338
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,332
Norman!

339
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:31,674
Norman! No!

340
00:25:35,178 --> 00:25:38,614
Norman!

341
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:00,336
Norman!

342
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:02,538
Mom?

343
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:07,143
Norman, the handcuffs.
See if he has a key.

344
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:24,160
Hurry, hurry!

345
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:28,731
Give it to me.
Give it to me, give it to me!

346
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,809
- Ow!
- Mom, your hand.

347
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,178
Get the emergency kit.
It's in the bathroom cabinet.

348
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,647
Yeah.

349
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:23,285
You liked it.

350
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,210
Mother!

351
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:00,456
We have to call 911.

352
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,491
No!
No.

353
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,159
We're not calling 911.
Not doing it.

354
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:07,496
Mom, he attacked you.
It was self-defense.

355
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:14,803
It was self-defense,
wasn't it?

356
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:19,241
Norman, no matter what,
this will become public.

357
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:21,777
And it'll be in all the papers.

358
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,345
Everyone in town
will know about it.

359
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:27,316
Who is gonna book a room
in the rape/murder motel?

360
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:30,185
It will ruin us!

361
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:34,523
It's gonna make me
a laughingstock.

362
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:37,526
You know, we came here
to start over.

363
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:41,030
We came here to start over.
I am starting over!

364
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,936
And where the hell
were you, Norman?

365
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,370
I-I was upstairs.

366
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:49,972
No, you were not!
You were not upstairs.

367
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,540
If you were upstairs,
you would have come down,

368
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:54,643
and you would have helped me.
So where were you?

369
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:58,647
I snuck out of my room
and went to a party.

370
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:00,215
Mom, I thought
I was gonna study with them,

371
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,151
but they took me to a party.
I didn't know.

372
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,886
It hardly matters right now.
There's a--

373
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,521
there's a dead man on the floor,
there's a lake of blood!

374
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:07,056
What are we supposed to do,

375
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:08,457
clean this up with paper towels
and spray cleaner?

376
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:09,992
I don't think so.

377
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,727
Holy hell, mother,
we're totally screwed!

378
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:13,462
What are we doing?
We don't know what we're doing!

379
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:14,697
- Norman? Norman.
- We just don't know

380
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,231
- what we're doing!
- Okay.

381
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,834
Calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

382
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:20,402
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.

383
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:23,005
Look, it's gonna be fine.

384
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:27,076
It's gonna be okay.

385
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:29,912
Here's what we're gonna do...

386
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,747
Okay, we're gonna take
all the bed linens

387
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:33,649
from every motel room,
and we're gonna use it

388
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,517
to soak this all up.

389
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:38,053
We're gonna wrap the body
in one of the comforters,

390
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:40,422
and we'll put it in a--
in one of the tubs

391
00:29:40,523 --> 00:29:42,191
in one
of the motel rooms just--

392
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:46,095
just until I can figure out
what to do with it tomorrow.

393
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:49,298
Okay.
Yeah?

394
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,734
Norman, I'm sorry.

395
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:55,404
I'm sorry that this dirtbag
raped me, okay?

396
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:58,674
But here you are,
and here I am,

397
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:01,810
and he's not gonna win
this one.

398
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:12,421
Go wash up a little.

399
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:15,524
Put your bloody clothes
in the trash bag.

400
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:27,102
Mother, are you sure
we shouldn't call for help?

401
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:35,244
No one's ever
gonna help us, Norman.

402
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,549
No one's ever helped us.

403
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,123
Don't go so fast.

404
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:50,292
I can't walk that fast
backwards.

405
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,994
It's heavy!

406
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:54,897
Shh.

407
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:58,467
Norman!

408
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,470
How can there still
be more blood?

409
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:02,971
Just get him in the tub first,

410
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:05,841
then we'll figure
everything else out.

411
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:16,618
Unh.

412
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,789
Get him off me!
Get him off me.

413
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,858
Okay.

414
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,194
One...two...three.

415
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:41,510
Mom, what are gonna do?

416
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,613
We're gonna deal with the rug.

417
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,892
We're gonna have to pull up
the whole carpet.

418
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:58,293
Tonight?
It's already midnight.

419
00:31:58,361 --> 00:31:59,995
And not only this one,

420
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:02,131
we're gonna have to pull up
four through seven.

421
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:04,867
They all have the same carpet.

422
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,401
So that way,
this creep goes missing,

423
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:09,905
anyone comes,
starts asking us questions,

424
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:12,174
you know, nothing will be
out of the ordinary here.

425
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:15,077
We're just--just doing
some renovations, you know?

426
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:18,180
We're just--
just recarpeting.

427
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:24,186
How the hell
do we pull up carpeting?

428
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,956
Good evening, gentlemen.

429
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:26,937
I was about to tell you

430
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:29,201
we're not open
for business yet, but...

431
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:32,697
it doesn't look like
you're looking for a room.

432
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:36,034
I'm Norma Bates.
We moved in a few days ago.

433
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:37,902
No, ma'am.
No, not looking for a room.

434
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:40,204
Deputy Zack Shelby.

435
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,640
- This is Sheriff Alex Romero.
- We just wanted to make sure

436
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,142
everything was all right here.

437
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,877
We didn't know anybody
had moved in yet.

438
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,579
Oh, that's kind of you.
Yeah, we're all fine.

439
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,081
Yeah, my son and I are just

440
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:51,649
pulling up some carpeting
we're replacing.

441
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,918
We're just updating.
God knows it could use--

442
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,420
You have a son?

443
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:58,589
Yeah, my son, Norman.
He's 17.

444
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:02,360
- Norma and Norman.
- Yeah.

445
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:04,662
That's...unusual.

446
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,265
Well, boys take their father's
names all the time.

447
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,567
You know, it's almost
2:00 in the morning.

448
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:10,935
Your son's got school tomorrow.

449
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:12,203
You really think
this is a good idea to--

450
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:14,839
I had no idea it was that late.

451
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,841
But thanks for letting me know.
I'm gonna go close up shop.

452
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:18,576
What happened to your hand?

453
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:20,445
Um...

454
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:23,681
I just--
I scratched it with, um...

455
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:26,451
I was cutting carpet,
and it just--

456
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:29,387
It's nothing.
It's a nick.

457
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:36,627
It was nice to meet you.

458
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:39,764
Thank you.

459
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,936
- Mrs. Bates, you...
- Yes, sheriff?

460
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:48,306
Wouldn't mind if we take
a look inside, would you?

461
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,608
No, no, not at all.
Come.

462
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:53,044
Yeah.

463
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:02,153
Evening.

464
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:08,793
Norman...

465
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:11,562
This is Sheriff Romero
and Deputy Shelby.

466
00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:13,798
They--they saw the lights on
and were kind enough

467
00:36:13,866 --> 00:36:15,066
to check on us.

468
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:18,102
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

469
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:21,672
That's extremely good of you.

470
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,276
Oh, everything's good here.

471
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:28,846
- Except for this carpeting.
- Sheriff Romero wanted to...

472
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:30,448
Well, you wanted
to see what we're doing.

473
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:32,984
I guess you're
a little interested in design?

474
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:35,286
Wouldn't put it that way.

475
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:38,322
It's a rare man that is.

476
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:41,793
Let me tell you, nothing bored
my late husband more,

477
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,294
may he rest in peace.

478
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:46,064
Oh, you're a widow.
Sorry about that.

479
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:47,799
Yeah.
Six months ago.

480
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:50,101
We're trying to get used to it.

481
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,837
Can I use your bathroom?

482
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:56,307
- This bathroom?
- Yeah.

483
00:36:56,408 --> 00:37:00,211
- This bathroom is broken.
- What's wrong with it?

484
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:02,232
- It's not flushing.
- All these toilets do that.

485
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:05,483
I told Summers he needed
to replace them ten years ago.

486
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,819
You gotta jiggle the chain.
It--I'll take a look at it.

487
00:37:27,306 --> 00:37:29,574
- Nice night, huh?
- Yeah.

488
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:31,587
Where you guys from?

489
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:33,956
We're from--
we're from Arizona.

490
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:35,297
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, right--like,

491
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:36,725
right outside of Scottsdale.

492
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I know Arizona.

493
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:39,628
I was there once.

494
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:42,130
Yeah, the air there,
it was--

495
00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:44,933
it was unlike anything else
I'd ever experienced.

496
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,735
The air here at night
is nice too.

497
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:50,239
Yep, yeah.
Yeah, it is, it's--

498
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,875
It is.

499
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:07,456
You just gotta jiggle it.

500
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:10,553
Unit one,
we have a vehicle collision,

501
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,928
multiple injuries,
at Ocean and Sea Bluff.

502
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,403
Ma'am...
Get the boy to bed, ma'am.

503
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:23,472
Ms. Bates.

504
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,728
He's new, all right?

505
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:22,397
He's not used to the food yet.

506
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,834
Make sure you're done.

507
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:29,504
Don't try to cut it short
just because it's embarrassing.

508
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:33,208
I think I'm done.

509
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:37,179
Mint.
It'll calm your stomach.

510
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,513
Thanks.

511
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:40,182
I'm kind of an expert
on vomiting.

512
00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:43,352
I have C.F., so I've been
on meds my whole life.

513
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:45,554
Some of them give you any number
of hideous side effects,

514
00:39:45,655 --> 00:39:48,757
puking being one
of the more pleasant ones.

515
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:53,362
Do you have some sort
of chronic illness?

516
00:39:53,463 --> 00:39:55,664
- No.
- Oh.

517
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,335
I'm Emma...Decody.

518
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:01,737
Nor--Norman Bates.

519
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,273
Yeah, I think we have
Language Arts together.

520
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:11,013
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

521
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:14,016
Are you...okay?

522
00:40:14,117 --> 00:40:16,418
I'm okay.

523
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:10,939
God, I hope he fits
in the trunk.

524
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:36,665
Are you all right?

525
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:39,768
I'm fine.
Let's do this.

526
00:41:55,351 --> 00:41:57,652
I suck.

527
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,654
Mom, he attacked you.

528
00:41:59,756 --> 00:42:02,991
I'm not even talking about him.

529
00:42:04,494 --> 00:42:07,529
I found out today
that the city is building

530
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:09,998
a new bypass
on the far side of town.

531
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:12,058
It's gonna be
the new main road.

532
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,872
I bought a motel that no one

533
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:18,874
is ever gonna know
is even there.

534
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:21,543
Why didn't the real estate guy
tell you that?

535
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:24,346
Because, Norman, people suck.

536
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:27,649
I'll tell you, everyone
I have ever known has sucked.

537
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:30,819
Except you.

538
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:35,824
God, you're too good for me.

539
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:37,826
I'm the worst mother
in the world.

540
00:42:37,894 --> 00:42:40,164
- Mother--
- Look at what we're doing, Norman.

541
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:42,664
You deserve so much better.

542
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:44,333
You know, when you were born,
it was like

543
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,269
God gave me a second chance.
And all I ever wanted

544
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:50,397
was for life to be beautiful
for you, and look at it.

545
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:53,842
Look at what your life
has been.

546
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,579
I mean,
what good am I doing you?

547
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,249
Mom, you're everything...

548
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,718
everything to me.

549
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,823
And I don't ever want to live
in a world without you.

550
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:13,361
You're my family.

551
00:43:13,462 --> 00:43:17,465
My whole family, my whole life,
my whole self.

552
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:23,171
You always have been.

553
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:29,077
It's like there's
a cord between our hearts.

554
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:37,886
Honey, that's--
that's from <i>Jane Eyre.</i>

555
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:40,889
Yeah.
Orson Welles says it to...

556
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,426
- Joan Fontaine.
- Right.

557
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:47,095
But you know what I mean.

558
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:51,066
It's you and me.
It's always been you and me.

559
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,905
We belong to each other.

560
00:43:59,008 --> 00:44:00,675
I love you, Norman.

561
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:03,901
You're the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

562
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:05,344
I love you too, mom.

563
00:44:19,984 --> 00:44:21,718
I guess this is deep enough.

564
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,126
Come here!
I have a surprise for you.

565
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:06,696
Okay, look, look, look,
look, look!

566
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,441
I turned it on.

567
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,104
I made it blue.
It's your favorite color.

568
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,249
- It's cool, mom.
- Yeah.

569
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:19,623
It's ours, Norman.
It's our very own.

570
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,046
And you know what?
You know that new bypass?

571
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,083
- They're not gonna build it.
- When did that happen?

572
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,719
It didn't, yet.

573
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,821
I'll think of something.

574
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,824
I'm sure you will.

575
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,065
What's important
is that we're together.

576
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:39,034
And as long as we're together,

577
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:41,170
then nothing bad
can really happen.

578
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:44,707
- Right, Norman?
- Right, mother.

579
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:47,610
Yeah.

580
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:59,566
