00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:02,781
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,806 --> 00:00:04,789
"That I take this obligation freely,

3
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:07,974
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion..."

4
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:09,575
That I take this obligation freely,

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,074
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

6
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:13,214
"...and that I will..."

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,019
One heartbeat away from the presidency,
and not a single vote cast in my name.

8
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:19,044
Democracy is so overrated.

9
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,227
I lean more toward
Raymond's thinking.

10
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,254
The last thing we want to do
is rock the boat.

11
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,121
- You promised you'd make this go away.
- You starting over...

12
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:29,731
I already started over.
I don't want to start over again.

13
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,080
I wish you didn't have to.

14
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:34,816
<i>DC Police have ruled</i>
<i>the death an accident.</i>

15
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:35,941
Are you giving up on this?

16
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,768
There are only three people in
the world that know what he has done,

17
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:39,804
and one of them is gone.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,588
- Like who they called? - Yeah. Who they
called, texted, what they texted, when.

19
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:44,270
- How do you access it?
- I could show you if you want.

20
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,180
But I gotta warn you, be careful what
you click. Some crazy shit there, man.

21
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:53,891
Raising the age of retirement is
an unacceptable erosion

22
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:55,692
of the American dream.

23
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:58,793
If the Republicans fail to pass
a reasonable omnibus package

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,209
by demanding entitlement reform,

25
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,930
they will force the federal government
into a spending freeze.

26
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,009
The frostbite will be
on their hands, not ours.

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,329
Do you think that's a bit much?
The frostbite bit?

28
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,329
It's the State of the Union.
We want to appeal to fly-over states.

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,049
- They'll like that line.
- I want something more forceful.

30
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,009
- "Blood on their hands"?
- No.

31
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,689
- "Throw us back into the ice age."
- Oh, I like that, Christina.

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,650
Let's try that. Linda.
Christina, you come up here too.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,074

34
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,049
There are two types of vice presidents:
doormats and matadors.

35
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,689
Which do you think
I intend to be?

36
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,131
Raymond.

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,649
He's hung up on the domestic agenda.
Not a single word about China.

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,048
His instincts are right. If the government
shuts down one day after the speech,

39
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,169
not a single word in the speech matters.
We have to address the freeze now.

40
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,570
- China comes later.
- Both parties have been wrangling

41
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,889
over entitlements for months.
What makes you think

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,889
a miracle's gonna happen
in the next three days?

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,249
We give the Republicans
exactly what they want.

44
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,210
- Retirement age?
- Yes.

45
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:15,729
That's a line in
the sand we cannot cross.

46
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,889
We will cross it, eventually.
So why keep fighting it?

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,969
I can push this through the Senate,
and once I do, the president will announce

48
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,490
a major bipartisan agreement
in the State of the Union.

49
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:29,849
We avoid a government shutdown
and the White House gets credit.

50
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,809
It's a huge risk, and if it fails,
a huge embarrassment.

51
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,248
The embarrassment will be
entirely my own. This is on my shoulders.

52
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:42,088
Even so, the president is
gonna require some serious persuasion.

53
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:45,489
- I'm happy to talk to him.
- No.

54
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,009
No... I'll do it.

55
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,569
He'll be more amenable
if it comes from a friend.

56
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,290
You're right.
A trusted confidant.

57
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,610
Let me test the waters.

58
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,449
The Cult of Tusk.
one.

59
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,809
But that one disciple
just so happens to be

60
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,330
the most powerful man
in the free world. For now.

61

<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

62
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:48,289
Entitlements. Raising
the age of eligibility to 67.

63
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,728
Your people will
never go for it.

64
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,169
They will if the
leadership does,

65
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,648
and the leadership will.

66
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,568
They've fought us on this
since I was in diapers.

67
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,609
Assuming that I can get this past
my people and convince them,

68
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,649
- can you convince yours?
- It's a tough sell.

69
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,809
You're the Senate majority leader, Hector.
You don't have to sell, you can dictate.

70
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,008
- What do you want in return?
- A working government.

71
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,369
- We stave off the freeze.
- You won on education,

72
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,369
we confirmed you
as vice president.

73
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,928
- The Republicans need a win, Frank.
- And that's what I'm offering.

74
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:16,329
You get a win on entitlements,
we avoid a shutdown.

75
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,528
Everyone gets points
for bipartisanship.

76
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,489
- You know who I'm worried about?
- Curtis Haas.

77
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,609
- He's a troublemaker, Frank.
- Who controls a third of your caucus.

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,609
And he'll never go for this.
He wants to see the Democrats suffer.

79
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,450
Just bring him to the table.
That's all I'm asking.

80
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,769
Miss Gallagher?
My name is Lucas Goodwin,

81
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,729
I'm a deputy editor
of the<i> Washington Herald.</i>

82
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,489
- Mr. Goodwin, please.
- Just a few moments,

83
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,849
- that's all I'm asking.
- If I wanted to talk to you,

84
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,849
- I would've returned your calls.
- Did you read my e-mails?

85
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,529
Yes. Which is
why I didn't call.

86
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,969
Give me a chance
to walk you through it.

87
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,529
I have to get back
to the White House.

88
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,049
- Peter Russo was killed.
- Let go.

89
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,848
So was Zoe Barnes.
I was working with her.

90
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,569
- Stop and listen.
- Frank Underwood is the one who did this.

91
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,969
Listen! This is nuts.

92
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,728
- The DUI, the brachiums. All of it...
- This has to stop. OK?

93
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,968
Underwood talk to you?
Tell you not to speak with anybody?

94
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,049
- No.
- Doug Stamper?

95
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,449
Whatever you think happened,

96
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,328
whatever compelled you
to stalk me like this...

97
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,889
You're the only person
who might know something,

98
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,089
who could understand.

99
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,889
I've got no one else
I can talk...

100
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,089
I don't understand.
And I don't want to. OK?

101
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,489
- There's no story here.
- Please, five minutes.

102
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,249
Think about what you're doing.
Waiting outside...

103
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,770
Peter would be alive if it
wasn't for Frank Underwood.

104
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,729
I've worked really hard
to put Peter behind me.

105
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,929
So if I see you again,
if I hear from you again,
I'll not only contact the police,

106
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,969
I'll let the vice president
know what you're saying,

107
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,930
and then you can deal
with the Secret Service, too.

108
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,128
It's the usual overseas chatter.

109
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,729
A bit of a bump in China,

110
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,929
but we chalk that up
to the trade tensions.

111
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,449
- Secret Service?
- Average number of death threats

112
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,089
to both POTUS and the VP.

113
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,449
We passed them along
to our dear friends at the FBI.

114
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,889
FBI?

115
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,568
The FBI confirms the level

116
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:01,448
of activity of our dear friends
at the Secret Service.

117
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,489
We've followed up on everything.
No high-level threats.

118
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,609
So nothing we need to report directly
to the president or vice president?

119
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,889
- No.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

120
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,409
The e-mail you sent,
has anyone else seen it?

121
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,568
Except for the agent
that alerted me, no.

122
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,089
Other agencies might
have stumbled upon this.

123
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,608
Even so, they
probably ignored it.

124
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,609
Any idea who's making the posts?

125
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,129
Deep Web forums. Almost impossible
to trace. Lone wolf, most likely.

126
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,128
- I want you to find him.
- We need a direct threat to life.

127
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,128
The vice president
just assumed office.

128
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,848
I can't have this conspiracy
stuff going mainstream.

129
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,969
- This sort of thing usually fizzles out.
- I can't take the chance.

130
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,329
I want you to find him
and put him away.

131
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,769
- He hasn't committed a crime.
- But he wants to.

132
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,728
- So help him.
- That requires manpower.

133
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,368
- You've got men.
- It exposes me, Doug.

134
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,009
I've always kept you informed
because you're an old pal and I trust you.

135
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,610
But...

136
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,848
We're talking
about an operation.

137
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:03,490
I'm an old pal who now works
at the White House.

138
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,648
Between old pals,

139
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,610
I've been stuck at the
executive liaison for way too long.

140
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,288
How worried are you that a mass
shooting could happen in a school

141
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,449
in your community? Great deal,
somewhat, not so much, not at all, unsure.

142
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,168
<i>You sound hot. Are you hot?</i>

143
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,770
- Sir...
- <i> Somewhat hot, a great deal hot?</i>

144
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,568
<i>Lynchburg Children's,</i>
<i>Pediatric Division.</i>

145
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,209
Can I talk to Cheryl Posner?

146
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,609
<i>Sorry,</i> <i>she's on duty right now.</i>

147
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,010
- It's her daughter.
- <i> Hold on one moment.</i>

148
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,168
<i>Rachel? Rachel?</i>

149
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,370
<i>Sweetheart, are you there?</i>
<i>Please don't...</i>

150
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,889
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Mr. Jay, my name is Rachel

151
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,809
and I'm calling on behalf
of the National Firearm Education Center.

152
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,768
Would you be able to speak with
me briefly regarding firearm legislation

153
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,808
and Second Amendment protection?

154
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,009
So you're Willa's top choice.

155
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,849
Why should you be my
husband's and my top choice?

156
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,168
Over the past ten years, the two
of you combined have gotten less coverage

157
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,328
than the average junior
congressman from Nebraska.

158
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,529
- Well, we don't seek the spotlight.
- I'm not suggesting you should.

159
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,289
But am I correct in assuming that your
husband will be an active vice president?

160
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,849
Well, it's harder to keep
an active VP out of the press than in it,

161
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,488
but it's possible if we give the media
just enough to keep them from starving.

162
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:17,769
- Where'd you grow up, Connor?
- Texas. Just like you.

163
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,008
- Dallas?
- Lubbock.

164
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,928
I had a much thicker accent
to get rid of than y'all.

165
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,329
- How do you know I had one?
- Your first joint interview,

166
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,450
when your husband was running
for state Assembly in '86.

167
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,608
- That's on the Internet?
- No. No, I contacted the
local affiliate in Greenville.

168
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,449
They wouldn't send me
the tapes via mail,

169
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,169
so I went down there
and watched in their vault.

170
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,728
To South Carolina?

171
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:42,409
When I want a job,
I do my homework.

172
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,848
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

173
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,370
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

174
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,170
Thursday.

175
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,289
I don't see how this
is a victory for us.

176
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,248
Our choices are the freeze,
which the Democrats get blamed for, or...

177
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:13,288
- Not necessarily, the Republi...
- Which we definitely get blamed for.

178
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,968
- Or we offer them...
- Entitlements, Frank?

179
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,728
We took a stand.
We can't turn back now.

180
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,448
I'd rather see the
government grind to a halt.

181
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,849
Think of the headline:
"Democratic Leadership

182
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,288
Enacts Entitlement Reform,
Staves Off Freeze."

183
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,848
We show unity.
We offer progress.

184
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:30,409
Let's convert some
lifelong conservatives.

185
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,928
You have Mendoza's assurance
he'll work with us?

186
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:37,609
- I do.
- I don't want to put our necks out there

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,369
just to have the
guillotine fall.

188
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,649
You won't. My neck will be right
out there with you.

189
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,729
Francis faints at the sight of blood.
He'd never let them break the skin.

190
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,369
To unity.

191
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,610
No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.

192
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,690
Larry, can you come by? Something weird's
going on with my computer. Thanks.

193
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,730
Come on!

194
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,689
- Hey, what's the problem?
- Nothing. It's fine. I fixed it.

195
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,450
- OK. Cool.
- Yeah.

196
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,609
- It's not as progressive as I'd like.
- You mean radical.

197
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,168
Raising retirement age to
67 makes entitlements solvent until 2055.

198
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:21,448
And it saves us over a trillion dollars
without a single penny of taxpayer income.

199
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,448
Sixty-eight would give us
another 300 billion,

200
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,088
and I'd like to
eliminate early retirement.

201
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,688
- Entirely?
- Forget it.

202
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,809
What about... 68 and 64?

203
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,128
I have a responsibility
to my constituents.

204
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,609
- I promised I wouldn't waver...
- Are we really going to allow

205
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,727
the tea party to determine
fiscal legislation?

206
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,289
- Never been beholden to the tea party.
- Come on. You wouldn't have won

207
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,088
reelection if their PACs hadn't dumped
ten million into your campaign.

208
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,928
If their definition of budgetary
conservatism happens to overlap with mine,

209
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:47,968
- that's a function of...
- Curtis, let's show some goodwill.

210
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:51,127
- Can you stomach 68 and 64?
- Effective immediately?

211
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,328
- Five years from now.
- Not interested.

212
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:55,729
We can't throw this on people
without any warning.

213
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,249
- They need some time to digest.
- I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

214
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,529
OK, meet with your staff,
consult with your colleagues,

215
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,289
I'll consult with mine
and let's talk tomorrow.

216
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,049
- All right. I can agree to that.
- But this is a good first step.

217
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,847
How do we make sure Curtis
can't filibuster

218
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,048
- when we get the amendment passed?
- Assuming we do.

219
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,008
Between you and me,
I'm sure we can turn him around.

220
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,249
I just want to be
on the safe side.

221
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,169
Make sure the
passage of the amendment

222
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,968
- constitutes the passage of the bill.
- By previous agreement.

223
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,088
We pass the amendment,
then we're done. Wham-bam.

224
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,488
- Can we put that in writing?
- Have Erikson reach out to me.

225
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,049
"Muchas gracias."

226
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,449
Lucas Goodwin?

227
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,849
<i>Good evening, Lucas.</i>

228
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,328
<i>Speak into the microphone.</i>

229
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,128
- Who are you?
- <i> Go to the home screen.</i>

230
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:56,248
<i>- Open the other app.</i>
- Tell me who you are.

231
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:00,008
<i>You've done your research.</i>
<i>You know who I am.</i>

232
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,248
Well, I know
who you claim to be.

233
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:06,169
<i>If you're not</i>
<i>convinced by now, goodbye.</i>

234
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,168
Wait a minute. Uh...

235
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,449
- All right, I'm on the home screen.
- <i> Open the notary app.</i>

236
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,728
What is this?

237
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,808
<i>To ensure you</i>
<i>aren't law enforcement.</i>

238
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:24,208
- I'm not.
- <i> Then sign.</i>

239
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,410
- How? <i>- Hold your thumb to
the camera and press "capture."</i>

240
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,128
How do I know you're
not law enforcement?

241
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,849
<i>Sign the document or walk away.</i>

242
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:41,529
All right. I did it.

243
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,408
<i>- Press "send."</i>
- Where is this going?

244
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:51,290
<i>I'm VPNing through Iran and 12 other
countries, don't worry. It's secure.</i>

245
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:56,008
<i>Now, one last thing.</i>

246
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:00,689
<i>I need the two-step verification code
for the</i> Herald's<i> internal servers.</i>

247
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:05,087
- I don't even know
how to do that.

248
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,249
- <i> Yes, you do. Check your</i>
<i>e-mail.</i>

249
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,408
<i>Destroy the iPad,</i>
<i>especially the serial number,</i>

250
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,768
<i>and delete the e-mail</i>
<i>after you've memorized it.</i>

251
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,609
<i>Good luck.</i>

252
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,769
<i>Hello?</i>

253
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,690
Raymond, are you there?

254
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:38,128
Yeah, uh, sorry, Frank, I...

255
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,807
I thought I saw an Inca dove.

256
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,928
<i>It must have flown</i>
<i>the wrong direction for winter.</i>

257
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,209
- It sounds windy. Where are you?
- <i> Top of my building.</i>

258
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,248
<i>Got a bird feeder up here.</i>

259
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:51,448
Nice work with the president.
I hear we have a green light.

260
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:56,569
He pushed back in the beginning but, yeah,
his writers are reworking the speech now.

261
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,409
I'm very close to a deal.
Sixty-eight, 64 in five years.

262
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,168
- Spending cuts as discussed.
- That rock solid?

263
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,608
<i>- Soon as we shake hands.</i>
- What's the holdup?

264
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:10,688
Curtis Haas, which isn't a surprise.
I'm meeting with him soon.

265
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,728
- He's the final hurdle.
- <i> Cutting it pretty close, Frank.</i>

266
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,328
Well, this is...
this is historic.

267
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,967
The Republicans have wanted
entitlement reform since Johnson.

268
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:23,007
Curtis will come around. In the meantime,
we should get the new retirement ages

269
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:27,208
<i>- into his speech.</i>
- I would stay away from specifics.

270
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:30,488
- I mean, even if it passes, the House...
- I know the House

271
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:34,848
better than you know birds. Believe me
when I say they'll pass the Senate version.

272
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:38,688
I'll talk to the president.

273
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:42,088
<i>- Just make sure this is airtight.</i>
- Thank you. What is it?

274
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:45,208
- Lucas Goodwin.
- From the<i> Herald?</i>

275
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,048
He must have been
working with Zoe.

276
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,608
- How much does he know?
- No more than she did.

277
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,008
- She knew enough.
- I'm on it, sir.

278
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,088
- Proof?
- Not yet.

279
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:57,888
- Jesus, Doug. - It's under control.
I thought you should be aware.

280
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:00,248
I'm juggling the president,
the Republicans, Tusk. I can't...

281
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:05,409
And you should stay focused
on that. Goodwin's on my plate, not yours.

282
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,529
It wasn't until the 20th century

283
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,088
that the notion of noble objectivism
came into the forefront.

284
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,767
- But facts are facts.
- Nineteen ninety-two.

285
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:20,528
George Bush Sr. is shown asking how
a grocery scanner works,

286
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:25,287
and he gets nailed for it.
they were showing him a new model.

287
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,729
He was asking how the new one
was different than the old one.

288
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,368
Curiosity, not ignorance.

289
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:35,288
But the lack of context
told a more powerful narrative.

290
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,128
There is no arrangement of facts

291
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:41,288
that is purely objective.

292
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,688
We can finally do something.
We have the means to act.

293
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:45,528
Some teenage,
pimple-faced hacker...

294
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:47,288
This was a
sophisticated infiltration.

295
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,448
It's not the work of a child.
Look, here's the e-mail.

296
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:54,608
"Heronymous Bot." The FBI's
been hunting him for years.

297
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,448
- Listen to me...
- If we get these records,

298
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,769
I'll need your help tracking
timelines, piecing together...

299
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,727
No! You want somebody to hold
your hand and say it's OK to go on this

300
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:03,848
fucking goose chase.

301
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,847
You shouldn't be teaching in Ithaca.
You're better than that.

302
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:08,607
- You should be back...
- I belong here.

303
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,448
Droning on to a bunch
of hung over English majors?

304
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,327
- Exactly.
- You're wrong about the truth.

305
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:16,488
There is objective truth.
He killed her.

306
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:18,128
You know it's a fact.

307
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:21,689
Here's a fact: my mom has ten,
15 years left at best.

308
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,048
I've seen her more in the past
month than since I left for school.

309
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:30,449
It's simpler here. It's quiet.
I need that. She needs me.

310
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:41,247
I'm sorry, Lucas. I'm sorry
that night how I reacted.

311
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:42,969
I'm sorry you lost
your girlfriend.

312
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,808
I'm sorry the world
is this fucked up.

313
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,888
I really am.

314
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,008
But I can't help you.

315
00:20:58,249 --> 00:20:59,769
Thank you.

316
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:08,848
- Where's everyone else?
- I did you a disservice yesterday.

317
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:11,488
We shouldn't have put you
on the spot in front of all the leadership.

318
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,409
Have a seat, Curtis.

319
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:21,168
We know that you have an obligation
to take a firm stance,

320
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,688
but entitlement reform
is something you ran on,

321
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:27,648
and now it's within your grasp.

322
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,848
So tell us your fears.

323
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,008
That the Democrats
get another win.

324
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,807
We suffer in the midterms and
the next Congress dismantles the agreement.

325
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:37,767
You think we're
being disingenuous.

326
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:40,208
My constituents
don't trust the administration.

327
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,648
I can't have them thinking the wool has
been pulled over our eyes.

328
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:46,048
As I suspected. Hector?

329
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:49,728
Frank and I propose this:
we include a super majority point of order

330
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,968
against revisiting
the issue for ten years.

331
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:55,128
You'll have it in black-and-white.
A serious, long-term commitment

332
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:56,608
with no opportunity
to dismantle.

333
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:59,047
That's on top of everything
else we asked for.

334
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:01,168
VA services and FEMA
stay at current levels.

335
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:04,528
Everything else at 80 to a hundred
percent of the cuts you propose.

336
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:08,888
You get your win, Curtis.
We just avoid disaster.

337
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:12,089
Maybe the country needs
to see what disaster looks like.

338
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,208
The tea party is a strong voice,
and you're its bullhorn.

339
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:21,809
Show your people that voice can translate
into law, and not just add to the noise.

340
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,968
Fifteen years before
revisitation, not ten.

341
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:32,368
- OK. - And if the House fails to pass
the bill after we do,

342
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,409
you go on record blaming your
own party for the gridlock.

343
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:40,249
I believe we have a deal.

344
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:57,928
What are you listening to?

345
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:00,528
- Sorry. I'll turn it down.
- No, it's nice.

346
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,768
Can I listen?

347
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,247
My ears are clean, I promise.

348
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:09,368
OK.

349
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,129
Thanks.

350
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,888
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

351
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:23,729
- It's so sad.
- It helps me relax.

352
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:27,528
Long day?

353
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,527
I work at a call center.
So yeah.

354
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:32,967
Two hundred strangers an hour.

355
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:35,928
I'll leave you alone. You probably
don't want to talk to another one.

356
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,807
It's all right. As long as you don't
hang up on me.

357
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:44,848
Do you ever just talk to them?
The strangers?

358
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:48,529
- We're not allowed to. - All I would want
to do is ask them about who they are.

359
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,968
What about you?
What do you do?

360
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:55,608
I... I work at the bookstore,

361
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:56,689
at the day-care center.

362
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,847
I had that same look on my face the first
time somebody handed me one of those.

363
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:06,328
- I'm just... I'm not religious.
- Just keep it.

364
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:09,567
Check it out. Or don't.

365
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:11,969
We've got really
good music there.

366
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,529
Thank you.

367
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,888
The House sent a bill to the
Senate. What Frank wants to
send back bears zero resemblance.

368
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,887
Because it's bipartisan,
unlike ours.

369
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:35,888
That sounds like
something Frank would say.

370
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:38,848
- I'm not Frank.
- He has a desk in your office.

371
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,848
- If this bill passes in the Senate...
- It won't.

372
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:45,247
We should be prepared, Bob.

373
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:50,448
Well, I'm prepared
to wait and see.

374
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,527
Have a good afternoon, ladies.

375
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:56,647
- Ladies?
- He's threatened.

376
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:59,687
- He's a pig. - Give him time. He used to
have two white, middle-aged guys

377
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:02,728
at his side. Now he's got a black guy and
a woman 20 years his junior.

378
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,728
Who knows how to shoot a rifle.

379
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:07,448
We just need to keep at him.

380
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:10,569
- Yes?
-<i> Catalina Rodriguez</i> <i>is on line four.</i>

381
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:15,089
Give me a moment.

382
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:26,008
- Catalina.
-<i> Ted told me</i> <i>it was you.</i>

383
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:29,567
- <i> You there?</i>
- Yes. I'm here.

384
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,808
<i>The press won't leave us alone.</i>
<i>For weeks.</i>

385
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:35,088
<i>They're showing up, trying to</i>
<i>get pictures of me and Emily.</i>

386
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:38,767
- It wasn't me.
- <i> You're the only one who knew.</i>

387
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:42,527
- I don't know how the story got out.
- <i> Why would Ted lie about that?</i>

388
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,688
I don't know.
Maybe... maybe he's ashamed.

389
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:47,967
<i>So, what do I do?</i>
<i>When will they leave us alone?</i>

390
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:50,888
I... I don't know, Catalina.

391
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,328
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

392
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:55,648
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

393
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:04,687
How... how is Emily doing?

394
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,089
Catalina?

395
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,408
- He's very confident.
- Yeah, but does he have what it takes?

396
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,048
- We'll see when I get his media plan.
- What about his personality?

397
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:29,607
Charming. Direct.
Very thorough.

398
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,928
He found our first
interview together, in '86.

399
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:34,968
I would love to see that.
Does he have a copy?

400
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,648
I don't think so. The TV
station made him watch it there.

401
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,167
We should screen that for the
president and the First Lady.

402
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:42,888
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Christina.

403
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:45,567
- What about her?
- Have you noticed anything strange

404
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:48,927
- between her and the president?
- How do you mean?

405
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:52,208
I passed them
in the hall yesterday.

406
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:56,048
They seem, I don't know...
very intimate.

407
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,768
They did seem cozy
at the prep session.

408
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:04,086
- Do you think...?
- No. Not necessarily.

409
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,207
An interesting thought, though.

410
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,447
- Sorry to interrupt, sir.
- We're having lunch.

411
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:11,448
The Republicans are backing out. Mendoza's
chief of staff just gave me the heads up.

412
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:15,647
- Get Mendoza on the phone.
- It's Curtis Haas. He got cold feet.

413
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:19,567
Too many cages. It's
really... kind of inconvenient,

414
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:22,567
but, you know, people look at
them. It's kind of funny. And...

415
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,607
- I got your e-mail.
- Now good for you?

416
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:28,487
Yeah, sure.
Can I call you right back?

417
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:30,247
What exactly did you
need to know?

418
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,487
We're doing some follow-up pieces
on the cyberwarfare thing.

419
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:34,688
I just wanted to get
a layman's understanding

420
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:36,967
of how the Chinese might
get through a firewall.

421
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:39,327
It's a bit complicated,
but I can show you the basics.

422
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:40,808
That's all I need.

423
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,968
We use a standard
N-tier architecture.

424
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,967
Think of it like a big sandwich,
with layers of bread.

425
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:06,328
Between each is the lettuce, the tomato,
the roast beef, you know, whatever.

426
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:09,767
What I'm pulling up here is the
org code which separates the database...

427
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,487
Shit, I forgot there's a meeting
with sales in a couple minutes.

428
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,567
- You wanna do this later?
- No, I'll just run over

429
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,767
and let them know I'll be
a few minutes late. Be right back.

430
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,568
Cool. I'll be here.

431
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:36,849
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

432
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:41,849
Yeah.

433
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,608
Come on.

434
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:00,648
OK.

435
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,888
Delete. Go.

436
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:16,127
- Something wrong?
- Can't find my phone.

437
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:17,648
It's weird,
I had it a minute ago.

438
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:25,008
Oh!

439
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,647
- Here it is. Sorry about that.
- No problem.

440
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:32,568
So the N-tier architecture, the
hi-tech sandwich I was talking about....

441
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,807
I thought Mendoza was
willing to work with us.

442
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,727
He is. The problem
is Curtis Haas.

443
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:41,127
- And have you spoken with him?
- His office isn't returning our calls.

444
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,847
- Neither is Mendoza's, but...
- I should've stuck to my guns.

445
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,608
The vote isn't until tomorrow afternoon.
I'll reach out to Mendoza...

446
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:53,008
This is the State of the Union,
Frank. I won't be left in limbo.

447
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,327
If we need to start rewriting that
speech now, I don't want to waste a minute.

448
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,927
I can turn this around, sir.

449
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:02,527
Raymond told me this was your
idea, to pursue this compromise.

450
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:06,168
- I suggested it as an option.
- No, he said you bullied him into it.

451
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:08,368
That he thought
it was a mistake.

452
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:11,167
If he felt so strongly,

453
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:13,287
he should've have
advised you otherwise.

454
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:16,647
Raymond's not a politician.
He relies on our political expertise

455
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,527
as much as we rely
on his business acumen.

456
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,967
Maybe we shouldn't
point fingers until there's a problem.

457
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:23,487
- You wouldn't call this a problem?
- Not if it's solved

458
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,768
before it becomes one.

459
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,607
You see, I wanted a vice president
who can manage Congress,

460
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,888
not one who bites off
more than he can chew.

461
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:35,367
Then have faith you made
the right choice, sir.

462
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:38,648
Whatever faith I have...
is quickly evaporating.

463
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:43,047
Don't humiliate the administration, Frank.
You're part of it now.

464
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:46,967
- Yes, sir.
- We're done.

465
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:49,369
Thank you, Mr. President.

466
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:56,967
Give me the private line,
please.

467
00:30:56,968 --> 00:31:00,607
Tusk is blocking my way.
Goodwin at my heels.

468
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,367
There can be no false steps now.

469
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:05,848
The higher up the mountain,
the more treacherous the path.

470
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:09,047
Lucas Goodwin went up
to visit her.

471
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:11,608
- They may be looking for you.
- Nobody's contacted me.

472
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:13,167
I don't think anyone
knows I'm here.

473
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:15,687
We need to make sure
it stays that way.

474
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:19,129
Don't speak to anyone you don't have to.
Don't go anywhere you don't need to be.

475
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:24,768
- Tell me you heard what I said.
- I heard you. I get it.

476
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:40,808
I'm fine.

477
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,129
- Let me put some ice on it.
- I said it's OK.

478
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,127
What is this?

479
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:14,248
What, are you going
through my garbage now?

480
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,208
Someone gave it
to me on the bus.

481
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:32,848
You let me know
if anyone contacts you.

482
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,687
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

483
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,448
No worries.

484
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,087
How much more you wanna
do right now? Fill in this area?

485
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,407
Yeah, and one
more poppy down here.

486
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:30,127
- That's a lot for one sitting.
- I know.

487
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:32,008
OK.

488
00:34:02,128 --> 00:34:04,168
Francis?

489
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:16,407
- You're heading in?
- Mendoza's an early riser.

490
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:20,848
- You'll figure this out. - I need to prove
what the vice president is capable of.

491
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,888
Don't prove it to them.
Prove it to me.

492
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:31,527
Curtis has me by the
tea bags, Frank. I don't have
a working majority without him.

493
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,486
- He wasn't elected leader.
- True. But I have to pick my battles.

494
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,406
If you can't control him
on budgetary issues...

495
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:40,126
It's not just him. It's the 15
senators he has under his thumb.

496
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:41,968
I won't be the leader next year
if they turn on me.

497
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,687
So he wants to be courted.
Sit him down...

498
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:45,808
I already tried talking
to him. He wouldn't budge.

499
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,767
- We'll both talk.
- He's made his position clear.

500
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:49,607
We all shook hands
at this table.

501
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:51,927
The most I can do is put
the substitute amendment on the floor

502
00:34:51,928 --> 00:34:55,687
with limited debate. And your people
can say whatever they want for the record,

503
00:34:55,688 --> 00:34:57,127
but we're gonna vote
the amendment down.

504
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:01,048
I'm not interested
in symbolic gestures.

505
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:03,487
Well, that's all I can offer.

506
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:08,527
- Where's your courage?
- My power has limits, Frank.

507
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:11,247
Five Republicans makes
you the deciding vote.

508
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:14,127
Now, it's highly doubtful we can get
them to vote against their own party.

509
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:16,367
- But they might abstain.
- - You'd need ten.

510
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:19,327
Entitlement is the Republicans' white
whale. I can get at least two to flip.

511
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,687
Then you'd only
need six abstaining.

512
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,127
Erikson's already making calls.

513
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,007
- Donner.
- And Pulaski.

514
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:25,967
Get me a call list
so I can tag-team with him.

515
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,088
Got it right here.

516
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:29,207
We have to get medieval.

517
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,608
When it comes to parliamentary
procedure, there's not a rule I don't know.

518
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:33,447
Find me the ones we can bend.

519
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:37,407
Mark, you're a sensible man.

520
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:42,407
Yes, I... I know. I understand.

521
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,127
What if...

522
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:47,928
Tell you what, what if both
VA hospitals in your district...

523
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:49,727
Yes, both of them. Hold on.

524
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:51,768
- Who?
- Moriarty. I promised him an amendment

525
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:53,126
for his bovine research center.

526
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:55,166
- That makes six.
- Mark, if I can get you

527
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:59,608
funding for both,
are you with us? Excellent.

528
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:02,328
Well, you come by the White House
and have lunch with me sometime soon.

529
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,447
Bye-bye. We have the numbers.

530
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:06,887
Once you break the quorum call,
it's gonna be a little tricky.

531
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:08,007
Tell me on the way.

532
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:09,807
Sir.

533
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:13,367
- Sir, we might not have a majority.
- What?

534
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:16,447
The Dems are poaching people.
Donner, Pulaski. Maybe more.

535
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:18,887
- Voting for the amendment?
- Some. Others abstaining.

536
00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:21,127
- I'm still trying to figure out who.
- We need to delay

537
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:23,728
- and figure out what is going on.
- Quorum call.

538
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:27,128
There's 49 hours until the
recess. We call a name an hour.

539
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:39,008
- Mr. Avendale?
- Here.

540
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:53,328
Excuse me, I do believe
you're sitting in my chair.

541
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:00,088
Mr. Drewery, what is the order
of business?

542
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:03,486
- We are in a quorum call, sir.
- Then why aren't you calling the roll?

543
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,208
- We are, sir, in a deliberate manner.
- Let's speed it up.

544
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:11,647
- Mr. Brown.
- Here.

545
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,886
- More expeditious than that.
- Mr. Burr.

546
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,127
- Here.
- Ms. Cantwell.

547
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:16,607
- Here.
- Mr. Cerini.

548
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:22,967
- Thank you.
- Cornwall.

549
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:24,247
- Here.
- Mr. Colson.

550
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:25,487
- Here.
- Ms. Douster.

551
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:27,367
Here.

552
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:29,848
They have a quorum.
We don't have the numbers.

553
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,966
- Out, let's get all our people out.
- Mr. Demerell.

554
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,407
- Mr. Darling. Mr. Daswani.
- Here.

555
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:37,127
- Mr. Donner.
- Faster.

556
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:39,127
- Mr. Dobben. Mr. Dwyer.
- Here.

557
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:42,328
- Erinburgh, Engle, Erikson.
- Here.

558
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,968
Mr. Feld. Farrison. Gentry.

559
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:49,888
Mr. Haas.

560
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:52,327
- Mr. Whitehouse.
- Here.

561
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:55,087
Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wyden.

562
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:59,488
Mr. President,
a quorum is not present.

563
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,927
The chair recognizes the
minority leader, Mr. Erikson.

564
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:11,727
Mr. President, "I move to direct the
sergeant at arms to compel the attendance

565
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:15,247
of absent senators, that
warrants for the arrests of all senators

566
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:20,207
not sick nor excused be issued under
the signature of the presiding officer."

567
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,648
The question is on the motion,
all those in favor say aye.

568
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:24,926
- Aye.
- All those opposed nay.

569
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,487
- Nay! - The ayes have it,
and the motion is agreed to.

570
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:31,248
The sergeant of arms is hereby
instructed to compel the
attendance of absent senators.

571
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:43,127
It feels good
to be back in Congress.

572
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:45,487
<i>The Democrats have now empowered</i>
<i>the Capitol Police</i>

573
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:47,887
<i>to arrest absent members</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

574
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:50,287
<i>According to Republican</i>
<i>Senator Curtis Haas,</i>

575
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,007
<i>one of the staunchest opponents</i>
<i>of the entitlement amendment,</i>

576
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:56,248
<i>the vice president is, quote:</i>
<i>"Replacing democracy with tyranny.</i>

577
00:38:56,249 --> 00:39:01,048
<i>He's transformed the Senate into
a police state within the Capitol." But...</i>

578
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:04,126
Well, it'll be even harder
to stay out of the news now.

579
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:08,647
- Then why the joint interview?
- I watched the South Carolina one again.

580
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:12,006
Convinced them to make me
a copy. It's powerful.

581
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:14,167
Here you go.
I thought you might want it.

582
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:17,886
There's a moment where
you ran your fingers through his hair.

583
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,687
It's intimate. Human.
That moment alone

584
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:22,207
would've made me want
to vote for your husband.

585
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:26,167
Something like that
will buy you months

586
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:27,687
of flying beneath the radar.

587
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:30,167
And who do you have in mind
to conduct the interview?

588
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,248
Does this mean I have the job?

589
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:35,767
It means you still
haven't been ruled out.

590
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:38,288
Well, I'll
consider that progress.

591
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:07,207
This is the Democratic cloak room, Hector.
Yours is on the other side.

592
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,767
- What you're doing won't work.
- It might.

593
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:14,767
Which is why you made the long walk
over here. Ice water?

594
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:17,327
I have my people in planes,
trains and automobiles.

595
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:19,567
All I need is six
to make my quorum.

596
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:23,367
Think what I can do with
26 votes, and I've got 45.

597
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:26,046
You won't be able to get your planes
and trains back here fast enough.

598
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:27,367
I'll roll those dice.

599
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:31,327
The sergeant at arms
is very good at his job.

600
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:35,167
And this is the perfect way
to show Curtis who's in charge.

601
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:38,767
- I'm doing you a favor, Hector.
- Tell me what you want.

602
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:41,368
What I've always wanted.
The package we shook hands on.

603
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:45,006
Then I'll give you
your Senate back.

604
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:48,887
- They can't come back voluntarily?
- Pick your six best actors.

605
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:52,766
- We can't give in, Hector.
- We wouldn't be in this situation

606
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,768
had you toed the party line.

607
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:01,087
- Mr. Mendoza is present.
- Under protest.

608
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:04,047
- Ms. Cornwall is present.
- Under protest.

609
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:07,086
Mr. Ullman is present.
Mr. Walsh is present.

610
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:09,447
Ms. Douster is present
and Mr. Haas is present.

611
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:13,047
- Mr. President, a quorum is now present.
- You can pass the amendment.

612
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:16,006
- I'll just filibuster the main bill.
- No, you won't.

613
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:18,247
- Watch me.
- As much as I'd like to see you

614
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:21,367
hold your piss for two days,
we struck a deal with Hector.

615
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:25,847
Passage of the substitute amendment
constitutes passage of the main bill.

616
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:29,126
- I wasn't informed of that.
- Pay attention to the fine print, Curtis.

617
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:31,607
It's far more important than
the selling price. Let's go.

618
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:34,607
I want an immediate call to the roll.
Don't let half a second pass.

619
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:37,287
- Yes, sir.
- A quorum is present.

620
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:40,727
The question is on the adoption
of the substitute amendment to HR 934,

621
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:43,646
the yeas and nays have been
ordered and the clerk will call the roll.

622
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:45,406
- Mr. Abner.
- Aye!

623
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:47,006
- Mr. Avendale.
- Aye!

624
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,366
Mr. Brown.

625
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:50,127
I'd like to propose an amendment
to HR 934.

626
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:52,286
Mr. Haas, you are out of order,
the roll call has begun,

627
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:55,847
- the clerk will continue to call roll.
- Mr. Brown. Mr. Burr.

628
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,406
- Aye!
- Ms. Catwell.

629
00:41:57,407 --> 00:41:58,727
- Aye!
- Mr. Cerini.

630
00:41:58,728 --> 00:42:00,047
- Aye!
- Mr. Chess.

631
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:01,447
- Aye!
- Ms. Cornwall.

632
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:03,047
- Nay!
- Mr. Colson.

633
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:03,727
- Hey.
- Hey.

634
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:06,647
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.

635
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:12,247
- What did you think?
- The music was really beautiful.

636
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:16,647
- Not what you expected?
- I wasn't sure what to expect.

637
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:21,167
- I'm Lisa.
- Rachel. Sorry.

638
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:25,367
No. We've got cookies
and cake inside, if you...

639
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:29,047
- I think I'm gonna...
- If you want to meet some of my friends.

640
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:32,206
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

641
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,688
- OK. Yeah.
- OK.

642
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:41,287
We should add miracle worker
to your résumé, Frank.

643
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,887
Lazarus makes
for a good magic act,

644
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,526
but life would've been a lot easier if
the bastard hadn't died in the first place.

645
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:50,927
Well, the president wanted to go ballistic,
but I calmed him down.

646
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,527
<i>I said don't worry,</i>
<i>Frank will pull this out.</i>

647
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:56,807
Did you? I don't blame you
for being two-faced, Raymond.

648
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:58,526
It's good politics, as long
as you don't get caught at it.

649
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:00,527
Now, Frank,
if you think that I...

650
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:01,886
<i>It's OK, Raymond.</i>

651
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:04,967
Jesus forgives you. Good night.

652
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:28,127
Hello?

653
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,047
Hello?

654
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:42,287
- Care for some wine?
- No.

655
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,688
Step into the room.

656
00:44:52,328 --> 00:44:54,767
Closer. Closer.

657
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,046
- State your name and the date.
- Wait, why?

658
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:00,527
State your name and the date,
please.

659
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:05,206
Lucas Goodwin. February 13th.

660
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:08,606
- Year.
- Two thousand fourteen.

661
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:10,686
Are you currently or have
you ever been a member...

662
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,326
- What is this?
- Are you or have you ever been

663
00:45:12,327 --> 00:45:14,127
a member of any
law enforcement agency?

664
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,167
- I already told you I wasn't.
- Two-step verification.

665
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:19,526
No. I'm not and I haven't.

666
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,967
Are you currently or have you ever been an
informant for law enforcement?

667
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:25,007
- No.
- - You think you might've been followed?

668
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:27,246
- Anything strange the past few weeks?
- You know what?

669
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:28,407
This is making me feel
uncomfortable.

670
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:30,647
We're not fucking around here.

671
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:34,046
If you think the FBI hasn't been
tracking your posts, then you're naive.

672
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:40,327
- You think they know who I am?
- No, you hid yourself well.

673
00:45:40,328 --> 00:45:41,886
What are you going to do
with the<i> Herald?</i>

674
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:44,047
- Nothing.
- Then why did you want access?

675
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:46,606
I already had access. It's how I contacted
you in the first place.

676
00:45:46,607 --> 00:45:50,008
I just needed to know
if you were serious.

677
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:58,567
That's Cashew.

678
00:45:58,568 --> 00:46:01,287
Why did you contact me?

679
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:04,687
Because you're desperate.

680
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,566
And I'm not fond of authority.

681
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,167
<i>Just today, under the leadership
of Vice President Underwood,</i>

682
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:16,326
the Senate passed HR 934,

683
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:20,046
along with an historic
entitlement reform amendment.

684
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:23,806
By raising the retirement age
to 68 and 64

685
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:26,926
<i>for normal and early</i>
<i>retirement respectively,</i>

686
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:30,968
<i>we will ensure entitlements</i>
<i>for generations to come.</i>

687
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:44,286
And when the House passes that bill in
a few weeks, as I fully expect them to do,

688
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:47,287
we will put the government
freeze to rest.

689
00:46:47,288 --> 00:46:53,126
We will continue the business of serving
our country rather than paralyzing it.

690
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:55,846
The American people
deserve no less.

691
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:59,927
<i>We stand at the</i>
<i>altar of democracy.</i>

692
00:46:59,928 --> 00:47:03,367
<i>Let us stand together.</i>

693
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:13,487
I spoke to Jackie. You have
my support in the House.

694
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:15,806
But it hasn't passed
the House yet.

695
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:19,127
We've a long march before it
arrives on the president's desk.

696
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:23,087
As for me, I used to be
on the edge of the frame.

697
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:26,928
Now, I'm only three feet away.
