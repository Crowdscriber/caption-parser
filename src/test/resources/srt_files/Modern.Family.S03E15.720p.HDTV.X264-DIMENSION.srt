1
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,346
Whoa. What's all this?

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,814
Mom heard us say
we were bored.

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:08,949
Suckers.

4
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:11,018
She heard us from outside.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,951
She has super good hearing,
like a seeing eye dog.

6
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:16,226
They have overdeveloped hearing
to make up for the fact that--

7
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,529
Wait, the dogs aren't blind.

8
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:20,697
Wait. Are they?

9
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:23,000
No, that wouldn't make sense.

10
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,351
You're right.

11
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,314
If I wait long enough,
she can get there by herself.

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,433
Quick, girls--

13
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,706
famous Danny from "Moonstruck."

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,646
Aiello?

15
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,981
Hey, Phil. I'm glad I caught ya.

16
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:33,955
What's up?

17
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:36,139
Uh, it's about Steven and Stefan.

18
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:37,741
They wanna see
that house on Briar again.

19
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:39,242
Really? I showed it
to them five times.

20
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,311
Last time we were there,
I think they got mail.

21
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,712
Yeah, well, that's
why I'm calling.

22
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,931
They hate upsetting people,
unless, of course, it's me.

23
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,549
Then they don't mind
waking me up at 7:00 A.M.,

24
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,750
asking me to call you.

25
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,252
It's no problem.
I'm just hanging around.

26
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:50,753
Kind of bored, really.

27
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:52,606
What?

28
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,536
Well, we did our good
deed for the day.

29
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:58,519
Yeah, for the enemy.
Don't they have enough?

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,901
It's been about a year

31
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,720
since we decided to adopt a boy.

32
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,772
Meanwhile, our friends
Steven and Stefan

33
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,440
decided that they
wanted a baby, too.

34
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:06,709
Wonder where
they got that idea?

35
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,515
Well, we're still waiting, but
they already got their kid

36
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,517
because they went
through a surrogate.

37
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,386
Which is all they talk about.

38
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,737
Are you gonna keep doing that?

39
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:15,996
I might.

40
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:18,423
I have to go show a house.

41
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:21,241
But first, what was Elton John's
sexual orientation in the '70s?

42
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:21,986
Bye.

43
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:24,492
- You've done that one before.
- And it never gets old,

44
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:27,004
like the good
Captain Fantastic himself.

45
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:29,347
Hey, Claire, guess what?

46
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,615
I'm sorry, honey,
I can't talk right now.

47
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:32,216
I told Bethenny I would
take her to the airport.

48
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,952
I'm late, and she's gonna miss her flight.
Where are my keys?

49
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:36,487
Why is that chair still here?
I thought you and Luke

50
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:37,822
were gonna put it out
on the sidewalk.

51
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:40,458
So you can't talk unless
it's about my chores?

52
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:43,384
Why don't you just do it now,
and you won't be so bored?

53
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:45,010
You heard that?

54
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:47,146
I hear everything.

55
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,326
That's for me.

56
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,940
Hey, Leon. Nice buzz cut.

57
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:57,242
Yeah, for some people,
the shampoo doesn't work.

58
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,753
It only makes the lice angry.

59
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:02,281
Nice to see you.

60
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,914
Oh, no. No--oh, God.

61
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:06,916
Um, Alex, do not move.

62
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,350
Haley, clean this up, okay?

63
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:10,052
Who fills a vase with marbles?

64
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,204
Who doesn't see a vase
filled with marbles?

65
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:14,122
Who wants to hear a bunch
of plates crashing?

66
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,692
Phil! Honey, the girls
need you in the kitchen!

67
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:20,161
Thanks for the hat, Leon.
It kind of tickles.

68
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,084
Phil!

69
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,536
How much electricity do
we need to bring this back?

70
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:24,687
It's not rocket science.

71
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,489
We're only reanimating a squirrel.

72
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:28,775
Phil! Now!

73
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,688
Sync by YYeTs, corrected by susanaLC
www.addic7ed.com

74
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,155
Sounds great. No, hang on.

75
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,423
Gloria, where's Manny?

76
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,042
Some neighborhood kids have
invited him to play football.

77
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:51,066
He said he was taking
his morning constitutional.

78
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,635
He's working on his go-cart,
but he'll be there.

79
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,070
Okay. See you then.

80
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,473
No, Manny cannot go and
play with those boys.

81
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:59,575
Margo is trying to
get us theater tickets

82
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:00,657
for this afternoon.

83
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,185
Gloria, you and Manny
do enough together.

84
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,620
Let's let him decide.
Where's he walking?

85
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,822
I don't know. But according
to the song he was singing,

86
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:09,392
he was going to the sunny
side of the street.

87
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:12,695
I cannot express to you enough
how bad this kid needs football.

88
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:14,666
Mom! Look what I found!

89
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,216
Number 99!

90
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,802
When Manny was 5,
we didn't have much.

91
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:20,086
We were on our own.

92
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,799
So we always dreamed of
winning the lottery.

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,516
We figured if we collected
100 lucky heads-up pennies

94
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:27,452
and bought a ticket with
them, we couldn't lose.

95
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:30,340
But now I have
a wonderful husband,

96
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,708
a beautiful home...

97
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:34,811
I feel like I already
won the lottery.

98
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,312
So I can keep whatever we win?

99
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:39,582
I think no.
I found most of them.

100
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:44,145
Can you put this in
the jar with the others?

101
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:44,946
Sí.

102
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,132
Ay. I forgot.

103
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,800
What is the combination
to your safe?

104
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:51,736
I'll just come with you.

105
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,405
Oh, yes, 'cause that's how
this arrangement works--

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,752
I take money from you!

107
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,327
Hello?

108
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,696
Oh, hi, Margo.
No, she just ran upstairs.

109
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,848
Listen, about these theater tickets--

110
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:05,517
don't knock yourself
out trying to...

111
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,218
Oh, you did?

112
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,787
Well, sorry to do this
last minute,

113
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,415
but they can't go.

114
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,518
No, Manny has
a football game, so...

115
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,367
Jay, could you steep my tea?

116
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,738
I cannot express to you enough

117
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:20,978
how much this kid
needs football.

118
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,027
And that is the whole house...

119
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,461
Again.

120
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:27,930
I love it, but
I just don't love it.

121
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:28,490
Do you love it?

122
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,970
I love it.
I absolutely love it.

123
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,138
I'm just not sure
if I'm in love with it.

124
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,273
Oh, yeah.

125
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,791
We have an expression
around the office

126
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,917
for when a sale
just isn't happening--

127
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,812
"Commission: Impossible."

128
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,895
Maybe for some people.

129
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,714
Not sure if I mentioned
it before,

130
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:45,983
but the house does
come with a hookup

131
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,684
for a European washing machine.

132
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:49,348
Oh, I love that.

133
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,340
Oh, so sorry.

134
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,375
It's the boss.

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,282
Hey.

136
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:58,583
Hi. I'm on my way home.

137
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:00,385
I've been calling Haley,
but nobody's answering.

138
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,386
Is everything okay there?

139
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,488
Everything here is great.

140
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,668
Oh, thank God.
Did you put the chair out front?

141
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:06,836
Not yet.

142
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,471
Honey, you're gonna miss
the trash pickup.

143
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:09,989
Don't worry. If they don't
take it, someone else will.

144
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:10,957
Who is gonna pick up

145
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,575
that ratty chair off our lawn?

146
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:14,477
Are you kidding?
It's in great shape.

147
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,746
Super cozy.
People are always commenting on it.

148
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,394
Trust me, it'll be gone
by the end of the day.

149
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:20,666
Please, just do it now.

150
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,716
I can't.

151
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm so sorry.

152
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,018
When I'm done
with these clients,

153
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,503
I'll call Luke and Leon.

154
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,205
I know I can talk them into it.

155
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,090
We are not losing this
house to Luke and Leon.

156
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,959
What do you mean,
"call Luke and Leon"?

157
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,943
Aren't you at home?

158
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:34,066
No, I left right before you did.

159
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,768
Phil, the house... the--the kids...

160
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,170
Oh, God, the squirrel.

161
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:40,516
Hello?

162
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,052
We'll take it.

163
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,620
Oh!

164
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,322
Commission...

165
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:48,124
Accomplished.

166
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:51,994
So how great is
your life right now, huh?

167
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,330
A new house, a new baby,

168
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:56,398
Stefan's Propecia's kicking in.

169
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:57,956
Ooh.

170
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,675
That's him. He's on his way.

171
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,026
He texted "OMW."

172
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,994
We try to keep our texts short

173
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,128
when we're driving with the baby.

174
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,481
Oh, well, what
wonderful parents you are.

175
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,984
You guys hate us
a little bit, don't you?

176
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:09,919
- No. God, no.
- Just a little.

177
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,319
Have you thought
about surrogacy?

178
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,717
At least you'd be making a baby

179
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:14,362
instead of waiting around
for some pregnant mom

180
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,497
to maybe pick you.

181
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,682
Well, we considered it,

182
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,990
but how do you decide
which one will-- Where's Lily?

183
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:20,624
Sleeping. Ice the cupcake.

184
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:22,259
That you couldn't say
in front of Lily?

185
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,261
- Well, then, she'd want a cupcake.
- Yeah, well...

186
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:25,896
But that's the beauty of the swirl.

187
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,896
The swirl?

188
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,739
You both donate,
they mix it up,

189
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,757
fertilize the egg.

190
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,613
You never know
who the father is.

191
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,923
Ooh. That's Stefan.

192
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:38,140
Yeah, maybe we should
think about this swirl.

193
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:40,126
Well, I-I didn't think
surrogacy was for us.

194
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,910
But, you know, 'cause one
of us would feel left out.

195
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,929
Yeah, but if you don't
know whose it is...

196
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,463
Sorry we're late.

197
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:48,601
Guys, meet Roco.

198
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:51,441
Roco or cocoa?

199
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:54,874
Look at him out there.

200
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:57,048
Oh, ay. This is so exciting.

201
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:02,081
Go ahead! Attaboy!

202
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,250
- Go! Go ahead! Attaboy!
- Go, Manny! Run!

203
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:07,487
I knew Gloria would find out
I lied about those tickets.

204
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:09,455
But I figured when
she saw Manny out there,

205
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:11,224
playing with all
those other kids,

206
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,693
she'd thank me.

207
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:15,428
That's what I figured.

208
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:16,429
Go! Go!

209
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:17,700
What the hell's he doing?

210
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,395
Run, Manny! Run!

211
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,052
Mom! Number 100!

212
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,907
Now we have the lucky-- Oh!

213
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:36,248
Oh, thank God.

214
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:37,233
Nobody's dead.

215
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,614
Or... we're all dead.

216
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:41,286
How many plates did we lose?

217
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,481
None. Luke and Haley
used cookie sheets

218
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,916
to clear a path through
the marbles for me.

219
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,883
Where are the marbles?

220
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,337
Right here.

221
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:47,907
Oh, Haley!

222
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:50,298
I put glue on them so it
doesn't happen again.

223
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,366
What about the chair?

224
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,435
Leon and I rolled it outside
on some skateboards.

225
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:54,935
Oh.

226
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:56,020
The squirrel?

227
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:58,522
You think I was going
to let that happen?

228
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,452
These kids are going
to survive.

229
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:04,174
They are the best
of me and Phil.

230
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,344
Luke using the skateboards,
Haley gluing the marbles--

231
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,046
that is pure Phil.

232
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,281
Alex keeping everyone in line--

233
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,478
pure me.

234
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,888
Sometimes I worry
no one's gonna like Alex.

235
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:22,359
There you go, buddy.

236
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:23,277
Thank you.

237
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:25,565
Uh...

238
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,084
What? You need anything?
I'll get it.

239
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:28,952
Steak sauce, but it's okay.

240
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,827
It's probably good for me
to move around.

241
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,262
Oh, Jay, it's so nice to see
you take care of him like that.

242
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,014
Why are you surprised?
He's our kid.

243
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:42,298
We take care of each other
in this family.

244
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,121
I want to kill you.

245
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:46,994
Wild guess-- Margo?

246
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,103
Let me explain.

247
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:50,221
There is no excuse.

248
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:52,774
This is something private.
I'm gonna get outta here.

249
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,876
So that's why you
were being so nice.

250
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,144
You lied to my friend...

251
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:58,413
You made Manny play
the American football...

252
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,466
It is your fault that
he got estampeded.

253
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,575
Or is it your fault?

254
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,443
He stopped to pick up
a penny, for God's sake.

255
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,629
Be careful what you say, Jay.

256
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,479
You're skating on
thin eggshells right now.

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,926
I tried to get him out there

258
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,095
with kids his own age...

259
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,463
Which is what
he should be doing...

260
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,398
And not spending another
afternoon with his mommy.

261
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,284
If you have a problem with
the way Manny's being raised,

262
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,970
you talk to me!

263
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:21,853
- I am.
- I don't wanna hear it!

264
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,392
Phil, you really didn't
have to do this.

265
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,510
I sold a house today
because of you two.

266
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:34,085
The least I can do
is buy you dinner.

267
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:35,769
I saw that house.
It is gorgeous.

268
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,304
- I know.
- Yes, we're real happy for them.

269
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:38,488
They showed me
a picture of the baby.

270
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:40,040
How adorable is that little guy?

271
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,385
Yes, we're real happy for them.

272
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:44,458
Okay, you might wanna
slow down there.

273
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,288
What? I'm playing a new drinking game.

274
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:48,757
It's called "every time
I'm depressed, I take a drink."

275
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:49,976
That game exists.

276
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,794
It's called alcoholism.

277
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:53,952
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm...

278
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,187
I'm wallowing, and it's not cute.

279
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,221
To happier things.

280
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,389
- Yes.
- To happier things.

281
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:00,091
- Happier things, yes.
- There you go.

282
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,036
I remember the first few drinks...

283
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,740
And, um, after that,
the night's just bits and pieces.

284
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,792
I wanna do something I never do--

285
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,543
brag about my kids.

286
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:12,829
Today, they were resourceful,

287
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,265
they were responsible, they...

288
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,850
Put 40% down.

289
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,518
It was worth showing
the house five times

290
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,619
and waiting...

291
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:21,338
Almost a year.

292
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,490
Seriously! Who do you have to...

293
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:24,891
Blow. That's really hot.

294
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:26,726
Why don't you let it cool down?
Try some of the...

295
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,078
Mexican!

296
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:31,366
The baby is clearly Mexican!
So, you know, the swirl is out.

297
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:34,302
Ugh. It's enough to make you lose...

298
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:35,303
Track.

299
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:37,272
Is this my fourth drink?

300
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,523
It's my fourth.

301
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:40,658
I said "four" twice, didn't I?

302
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,960
I did, didn't I?

303
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:44,596
I think we're gonna
need four cabs...

304
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,497
Two! Two! You made me!

305
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:52,084
I-I vaguely remember...
someone crying?

306
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,147
If we ever did surrogacy,

307
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,533
I would want you to be the donor.

308
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,418
- Mnh-mnh! - You're so smart,
you're so handsome.

309
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,003
Oh, stop it! It should be you!

310
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,022
- You're so fun! You're so talented!
- Okay.

311
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,909
It's not fair.
I love you both so much.

312
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:07,493
If you could have a baby that
was a mix of the two of you,

313
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,211
I would love that baby so much.

314
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,313
Aw, that is so sweet.

315
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:14,232
I meant it. That is so sweet.

316
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:17,273
Oh, my God. You guys,
we could do this.

317
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:18,458
We could do this.

318
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:20,176
We could make a baby

319
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,108
that is half Tucker
and half Pritchett.

320
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,521
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

321
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:26,522
Yeah.

322
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,123
Cloning?

323
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:29,537
No. No.

324
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:31,071
I'm saying...

325
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,256
I give the egg.

326
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:33,808
Oh! Yeah.

327
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:35,526
I give the egg. That's the pritchett side.

328
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,629
And then, Cam,
you're the father, right?

329
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,598
And then we just, like, mix it

330
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,517
and put it in a, like, a
surrogate lady thing,

331
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,186
and then bang!
We have a baby.

332
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:48,420
Oh. Are--are you serious?

333
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:49,655
You would do that?

334
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,240
I would be honored.

335
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:55,294
You guys, you guys, if there's
one thing I have learned today,

336
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:57,763
it's the pleasure of
looking at your children,

337
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,749
and seeing both--
both of you in there.

338
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,135
And I want you to have
that experience. Yeah.

339
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,137
- Yeah.
- We want that.

340
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,805
And something else...

341
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,525
Guys, I make really good babies.

342
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,943
Yes. I have, like,
magic eggs or something.

343
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:13,178
- Yes!
- They're golden.

344
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,214
Oh, gosh. Oh, Phil,

345
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,249
I don't--what do-- what
do you say about this?

346
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,967
I think we're all having a baby!

347
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,452
Aah! Table hug!

348
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,688
Oh! Aah!

349
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:26,271
Sweet potato fries!

350
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,306
- What have I done?
- I know.

351
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,407
Oh.

352
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,754
What was I thinking?

353
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,303
I-I-I just get drunk and
I bring a baby into the world?

354
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:42,607
That would be 4 for 4.

355
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:43,879
I can't go through with it.

356
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,439
Don't panic.
You haven't donated anything yet.

357
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,941
Besides, what are the chances
your eggs even work?

358
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,043
What are the chances we can
pretend I never said that?

359
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:53,531
It's weird. It's my brother.

360
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:55,384
And then there would be
this baby over there

361
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,168
that's my baby,
but it's not my baby...

362
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:58,971
That actually sounds good.
Just say that.

363
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,340
We're gonna see him for brunch
in two hours over at your dad's.

364
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,942
Ooh. That seems... soon

365
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,761
and--and hard.

366
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:10,425
What if... what if
I blame it on you?

367
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,404
What if we say that
you're not okay with it?

368
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:13,791
- No!
- Why?

369
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,261
Are you really okay with another
man fertilizing your wife's egg?

370
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,850
Of course not! That's creepy.

371
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:21,431
- Yes. - Plus, what if you and Cam
make a better baby than we did?

372
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:24,911
It's settled. Phil says "no."

373
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:26,196
Like they're really gonna believe

374
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,330
that I overruled you?

375
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:28,298
- Right.
- Come on.

376
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:30,867
Mm. They're gonna be crushed.

377
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:33,805
They've waited so long
for this baby.

378
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe they're having
second thoughts, too.

379
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:40,160
Look--this is what my baby
with Claire would look like.

380
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,645
What is this? What...

381
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,330
Okay, well, I found a web site

382
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,115
where couples can upload pictures...

383
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,451
- Oh. - And then it shows them what
their baby would look like.

384
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,976
This is... Gloria and I.

385
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,678
Couldn't resist.

386
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:53,644
Wow. That--

387
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:55,345
that looks exactly like Manny.

388
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,824
Like--like weirdly so.

389
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,409
What--what's this other picture?

390
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:00,849
Don't be jealous.

391
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,651
But this...

392
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,954
Is me and Justin Timberlake.

393
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:07,791
Cam, we have a problem.

394
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,627
Oh, what? You can talk about
Ryan Gosling all day,

395
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:10,969
- but the moment I say something--
- No, no, no,

396
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,817
about this baby. I...

397
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,452
I don't think I can do it.

398
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,788
What--why? Why--it's perfect!

399
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,424
It's our chance to have a baby
that's part me, part you!

400
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,493
No, no! It's part you
and part Claire.

401
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:23,727
I'm nowhere in there.

402
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,995
And it's not like I can pretend.

403
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,264
It's--she's not some egg
donor that we don't know.

404
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:28,232
It's Claire.

405
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,134
You know, we see her all the time.

406
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,993
And what are we supposed
to tell the baby?

407
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:33,994
"Say hi to your aunt mommy!"

408
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,296
- Adorable.
- No, not adorable.

409
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,808
Appalachian.

410
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,750
Okay, I'm--I'm sorry, Cam.

411
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:46,041
Jay says that
I'm smothering Manny...

412
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:48,210
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm just enjoying him.

413
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:51,113
I mean, they're only gonna
be boys for a short time.

414
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,183
Best time ever in this house!

415
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,419
I'm uncomfortable with this, Phil.

416
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,636
The manual specifically
says "no towing."

417
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,438
There are two types of
people in this world--

418
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:00,906
people who follow the manual,

419
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,875
and people who stick it
to the manual.

420
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,243
You... are hurt.

421
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,228
Hi!

422
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,580
Manny, what happened?

423
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:08,581
Football injury.

424
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,905
My mom will yell you
all about it.

425
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,823
Hola, Lily!

426
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:16,027
Does my little princess
want a cookie?

427
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,195
Oh, well, you know,
maybe just one.

428
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,963
She's already had
her sugar limit for today.

429
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,164
How can you tell?

430
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:21,398
- Aah!
- Ay!

431
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,417
Okay, Lily.

432
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,854
Hey.

433
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,305
- Hey, you two.
- Hey!

434
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:28,773
So where-- oh, where are the kids?

435
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,608
Oh, Haley's driving them
over separately.

436
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,446
- Oh.
- Oh! Big girl now.

437
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:34,345
- That's great.
- Yeah.

438
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,631
So that was... so fun last night.

439
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,366
- So fun.
- Yeah, we had a great night.

440
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,612
- Yeah.
- Yes.

441
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:42,813
We should--

442
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,051
Jinx!

443
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,949
Yeah, we're going this way, so...

444
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,301
- This should do for 30. - Yeah.
- We'll see you in a bit.

445
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:51,958
I cannot tell them.

446
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,143
I cannot break their hearts.

447
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:55,628
So you're gonna have Cam's baby

448
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,296
just to keep things
from being weird?

449
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,364
Um, what?

450
00:15:58,382 --> 00:15:59,999
You and Uncle Cam
are having a baby?

451
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,401
Kids, shh.

452
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,319
- There was a discussion about
the possibility... - Mm-hmm.

453
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,537
Of your mom donating an egg...

454
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:06,305
so that the guys
could have a baby.

455
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,174
But we decided it was
not a good idea.

456
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,959
Why? Because Lily's such a mess?

457
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,778
For a lot of reasons.

458
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:15,281
- They have-- - But we can agree that
she's a disastrous human being?

459
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,065
I think it's a great idea.

460
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:20,518
Yeah. It's a really beautiful offer, mom.
I'm impressed.

461
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:24,072
Oh, my God.
Cam, they told the kids already,

462
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,218
and they seem to be totally into it.

463
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,653
All right, is it just me?

464
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,796
Am I the only one
that thinks this is weird?

465
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:31,866
Maybe it's not weird.
Maybe we're pioneers.

466
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,153
Mm, no we're hardly pioneers.

467
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:34,455
You have three different hair dryers

468
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:35,287
for different types of weather.

469
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,665
Maybe it's just gonna take some
time to get used to the idea.

470
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,323
- What idea?
- Oh. No.

471
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,874
Um, well, Jay...

472
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,142
- Cam.
- Claire has--

473
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:43,843
No. I-I-I just don't think

474
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,779
my dad's really ready for
this conversation. So...

475
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,848
Oh, stop acting like I'm some
stodgy old coot. I've grown.

476
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:49,916
Okay.

477
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,486
Um, Jay, Claire has, um, offered

478
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,187
to give us one of her eggs

479
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,758
so we can have a baby that's
half Pritchett, half Tucker.

480
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,348
That's unnatural. I'm against it.

481
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:04,237
Oh, surprise, surprise.
Jay is against something.

482
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,455
Cam and Claire wanna
have a baby together.

483
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:07,673
Ugh!

484
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,030
You're not gonna do that.

485
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,613
It's not your decision, dad.

486
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:11,580
You're not thinking straight.

487
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,942
And you're not in charge.
Okay, Claire and I are adults.

488
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:16,961
If--if we want this to happen,
it--it's gonna happen.

489
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,479
So much for second thoughts.

490
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:20,631
Young lady, I need
to have a talk with you.

491
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,217
- I don't... now?
- No.

492
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,137
You don't get to tell everyone
how to live their lives,

493
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,073
that boys cannot spend
time with their mommies

494
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:31,926
or that brothers and
sisters can't make babies.

495
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,994
- So you're all for this?
- No.

496
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,359
It's a freak show, but
it's their freak show.

497
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,933
So this is happening again?

498
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,550
Well, I'm not gonna not do it

499
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,152
'cause my dad thinks I shouldn't.

500
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,686
You know, I'm not following.

501
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:44,988
We're not doing it 'cause
I don't want to do it.

502
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,020
What we're not doing

503
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,456
is not doing it 'cause
he doesn't want us to do it.

504
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,057
Just say baby or no baby.

505
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,493
Isn't it enough this family
spends a lot of time together?

506
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,378
Now we have to inbreed.

507
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,364
Okay, dad, it's not technically
inbreeding. It's, um...

508
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:01,163
For the record, I think what
my mom is doing is very brave.

509
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,008
I like it.

510
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,777
I've always kind of wanted a
half-brother, half-cousin.

511
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,543
Really? "Always"?

512
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,481
Well, I mean, if you think about it...

513
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,477
Oh, wow.

514
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,632
When was the last time
we talked under a table?

515
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,983
Dad and Gloria's wedding reception.

516
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,167
Oh, yeah.

517
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,702
Um, mm...

518
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,590
I love you. You know that...

519
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,691
But I can't do this.

520
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,042
No, no, neither can I!

521
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,083
Really? Yeah.

522
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:34,419
Are you serious? You can't--oh, God.

523
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,621
I'm so relieved. I'm sorry.

524
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,039
I-I-I... ugh.

525
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:39,491
I am so sorry I led us
down this road.

526
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:40,859
No, no. No, Claire,
don't be. Don't be.

527
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:44,098
It was--it was generous and
thoughtful, just like you.

528
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,827
How could I not want those
qualities in my child?

529
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:48,262
Ohh.

530
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,413
Oh, come here.

531
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,159
So this is really happening?

532
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,592
- Ah.
- What if it is, dad?

533
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:53,727
Yeah. What if we love each other,

534
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:54,511
and this is a beautiful thing?

535
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,980
- Okay, it's our decision.
It's not yours. - Yeah.

536
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:58,949
So baby? No baby?

537
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:02,569
- No.
- Mnh-mnh.

538
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:06,217
You okay?

539
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,335
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

540
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,004
Mm, I know it's been hard on you.

541
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,446
Hey, what if we went out
for a nice dinner tonight?

542
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:12,864
Oh, that'd be fun.
Should I call the sitter?

543
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:14,298
Yeah. Oh, you know what
I was thinking today?

544
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,466
What about Luke?

545
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:16,668
Oh, he's so good with her,

546
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,336
the way he looks at her...

547
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,171
My God, Cam.

548
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:22,453
Oh, look, she's organizing her things.

549
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,888
- Look at how she's dressed.
- Oh!

550
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:29,045
We didn't make her,
but she sure is us.

551
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,597
Hey, Lily, honey, it might make
more sense with the shoes...

552
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,149
- Mitchell.
- Because...

553
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,168
I like what she did with the dolls--

554
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:40,773
- Play as you will. Play as you will.
- It's nice.

555
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,374
The big one, remember?

556
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,842
One of the first ones we found.

557
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,544
It was at the bottom of
the gutter in the street.

558
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:47,271
Ay, yes.

559
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:50,758
We put the gum at the bottom
of your walking stick.

560
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,677
Ay, look at this one-- the green one,

561
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:55,330
the one we found
at the floor of my taxi.

562
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,248
- Your taxi?
- Yes.

563
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,384
Before I had somebody
running my life for me,

564
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:01,636
I used to drive a taxi at night.

565
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,172
Manny would sleep
in the seat next to me.

566
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,140
One time, I had to hit
the brakes so hard

567
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,943
that he fell into the floor
and he found the penny.

568
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:11,112
Pretty lucky, huh?

569
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:13,754
Eight years.
I can't believe we're finally done.

570
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:16,967
Me, either.

571
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:19,897
Come. Let's go get
your lottery ticket.

572
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:27,712
- Gloria.
- Hmm?

573
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:28,979
I think you made a mistake here.

574
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,581
What did I do now?

575
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:33,384
I counted these, and you've
only got 96 pennies.

576
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,452
Are you sure?

577
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,746
Afraid so.

578
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,543
I guess you're gonna
have to keep lookin'.

579
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,578
Dang it! I counted those.

580
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:43,623
See for yourself.

581
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,959
And now we upload your picture.

582
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,008
- This is fun. This is fun.
- Yeah.

583
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,260
And in just a few short moments,

584
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:59,128
thanks to the magic of technology...

585
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:00,313
We'll know what our baby
actually looks--

586
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:02,518
- Oh! No!
- What happened? What is that?

587
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,053
Did you put one of us
in upside-down?

588
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,237
No! That's actually--

589
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:06,705
Okay, I-I don't want
to see this anymore.

590
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,723
Ohh. Turn it off.

591
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:08,857
Oh, it's not turning off.

592
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,626
Well, throw something over it!
That--oh, God!

593
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,928
Yeah, well, we played God, and
look what we brought forth.

594
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:15,264
Daddies, what are you looking at? Aah!

595
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:16,710
Oh!

596
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,735
Maybe it wasn't that bad.

597
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,253
No, no, it's possible
that we overreacted.

598
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,839
Yeah. Maybe our expectations
were just a little bit too high.

599
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:25,541
That little guy had some
cute features. Huh?

600
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,427
- Of course he did. It's us.
It can't be that bad. - Yeah.

601
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,661
- Let's just take--
- Ahhh!

602
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,244
