1
00:00:02,571 --> 00:00:05,319
(phone rings)
WOMAN: <i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

2
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,440
MAN: <i>You need to send
a car to Briarcliff.</i>

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,908
<i>They're waiting. Who's waiting?</i>

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,810
<i>I've been a very busy boy.</i>

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,479
WOMAN:
<i>Can you give me your name?</i>

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,916
Hello?

7
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:16,920
MAN: <i>You'll know my name</i>
<i>when you see them.</i>

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,137
<i>They were imposters.</i>
(line clicks)

9
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:19,253
Police.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,754
Anybody here?

11
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,928
Jesus, Bobby.

12
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:35,032
Holy shit.

13
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:54,170
WOMAN: <i>I used to think
it must be my fault.</i>

14
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:58,961
<i>My own child, who lived</i>
<i>inside me for nine months,</i>

15
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:03,176
<i>someone I nursed and bathed</i>
<i>and held and sang lullabies to.</i>

16
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,629
I have two other children, Sister,

17
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,902
both of them perfectly normal.

18
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,133
She sounds like quite a handful,
Mrs. Reynolds,

19
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:14,599
<i>but we do not have</i>
<i>a children's ward here.</i>

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,564
MRS. REYNOLDS: <i>Oh, but she's
more than a child, Sister.</i>

21
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:18,727
In fact, that's the problem.

22
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,127
She's always seemed like an adult.

23
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:21,858
Do you know that she's never cried?

24
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:24,090
Not once, not even
when she was a little baby.

25
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:25,490
I'm going to tell you something

26
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,354
I haven't told anyone.

27
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:28,752
<i>Jenny and her little friend, Josie,</i>

28
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,717
<i>were playing after school.</i>

29
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:33,683
<i>I had told them to go out into</i>
<i>the woods to gather leaves.</i>

30
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,712
<i>We were gonna make a fall wreath.</i>

31
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,944
See, Josie was the only one
who would play with Jenny,

32
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,344
and I wanted it to go well.

33
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:44,972
I tried to stop him,
but he was bigger than me,

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,503
and he said he would kill me, too,

35
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,867
if I didn't stand very
still and be quiet.

36
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:55,064
He was tall, he had a
beard and a brown jacket.

37
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:57,995
And they never found the bearded man

38
00:02:58,062 --> 00:02:59,528
with the brown coat, I take it?

39
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,658
They searched.

40
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:04,290
Two days ago, I was doing the laundry,

41
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,422
(voice breaks):
And I found this in her pocket.

42
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,087
I can't go to the police.

43
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:11,552
Sister, I can't.
She's my daughter.

44
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,050
Oh, Mrs. Reynolds...

45
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:14,715
One of my dreams

46
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:17,414
for Briarcliff has been to open

47
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,546
a children's ward.

48
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,411
There are so many

49
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:24,442
little souls who could use our help.

50
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,806
But we can do nothing until that time.

51
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,004
Prayer...

52
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,901
is your strength and your ally.

53
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,933
Could you just meet with her?

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,831
She's right downstairs
with her coloring book.

55
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:40,430
Sister, just help me understand,

56
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,794
where does this evil come from?

57
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:45,226
Could she have been born that way?

58
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:55,783
(utensil scraping on plate)

59
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:21,161
(man sighs)

60
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:22,659
THREDSON: Is there
anything more heavenly

61
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,326
than waking from a nap

62
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:25,657
to the smell of
croque-monsieur?

63
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,387
I bet this is what your mother made you

64
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:33,784
after school on a rainy day.

65
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:35,451
(screams)

66
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:36,715
(yells)

67
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:43,777
You can scream all you want.
No one will hear you.

68
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:47,408
Obviously, the basement is soundproof.

69
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,140
Believe me, girls with
bigger sets of lungs

70
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,571
than yours have tried before.

71
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,067
Where's Wendy?

72
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,563
What did you do with her body?

73
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,528
I put her somewhere where
she'll never be found.

74
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,596
It wouldn't do to have her body pop up

75
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:07,298
now that Kit Walker has confessed

76
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,397
to all those horrendous murders.

77
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,659
Can I tell you a secret?

78
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,956
Nutmeg makes all the difference

79
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:22,056
in the world.

80
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,349
Croque-monsieur
and tomato soup.

81
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,446
The perfect mommy snack.

82
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:40,083
Only I didn't have

83
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,124
a mother to make this for me.

84
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:44,961
Well, of course,

85
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,897
I had a mother, but I never knew her.

86
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,837
She was about your age
when she abandoned me.

87
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,406
You grew up in an orphanage?

88
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:59,543
Yeah. In the system.

89
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,613
Where all my basic needs were met:

90
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,349
Food, water,

91
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,318
a rudimentary education.

92
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,486
And with the help

93
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:09,987
of a leather crop,

94
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:13,190
learning the difference
between right and wrong.

95
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:14,624
They followed all the rules.

96
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,326
Especially the rules against affection

97
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:19,963
or any unnecessary bodily contact,

98
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,935
because touch would certainly
spoil the child.

99
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,607
This is good.

100
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,842
You're right.

101
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,679
This is good.

102
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:36,714
It's delicious.

103
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,786
I'm not trying to patronize you, Oliver.

104
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:44,555
I just want you to know

105
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:47,692
how much I appreciate
this act of kindness.

106
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:53,765
I know what it's like to be abandoned.

107
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,635
That's how I felt at Briarcliff.

108
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:10,944
I was right about you.

109
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,982
You're the one. (Snickers)

110
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:29,260
Lana, I've always
been self-aware.

111
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,129
I knew I was different
from the other kids.

112
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:32,931
I was smarter.

113
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,201
But I was also more afflicted.

114
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:39,538
It's what led me to study psychiatry...

115
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:41,873
to better understand my disorder.

116
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,708
It wasn't until medical school

117
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,911
<i>that I had</i>
<i>my first breakthrough, though.</i>

118
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,715
Hey, Thredson, from what I hear,

119
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,951
this is the closest you'll get
to a girlfriend this quarter.

120
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,853
(laughter)

121
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,357
<i>I would laugh along</i>
<i>with my idiot colleagues,</i>

122
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:00,860
<i>but I knew the woman on the</i>
<i>table wasn't my girlfriend.</i>

123
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:02,796
I trust you gentlemen
have reviewed the material

124
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:04,531
in preparation for today.

125
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:07,567
<i>She was my mother.</i>
<i>She was 33 years old,</i>

126
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:10,203
<i>the same age as my mother</i>
<i>when she abandoned me.</i>

127
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,446
The same age as you, Lana.

128
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:29,061
<i>Now, I knew logically, rationally,</i>

129
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,824
<i>that the woman on the table</i>
<i>wasn't my mother.</i>

130
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:34,828
<i>But somehow, in the</i>
<i>cosmic joke that is my life,</i>

131
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:37,064
<i>I felt like she could be.</i>

132
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:42,669
<i>And it was poetic justice</i>
<i>that I would be meeting her</i>

133
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:45,706
<i>for the first time on a slab</i>
<i>in my gross anatomy class.</i>

134
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:04,226
<i>It was then that I knew</i>
<i>what I was missing.</i>

135
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,624
A mother's touch.

136
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,874
Skin-to-skin contact.

137
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,945
<i>It's what I was craving.</i>

138
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:27,017
<i>It's what I was missing my whole life.</i>

139
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:33,725
<i>Oh, but she smelled of formaldehyde.</i>

140
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,793
(sniffs)

141
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:45,802
And her skin, even after I
removed it, was cold and stiff.

142
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,772
Have you ever read

143
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,075
or heard about the Harlow studies?

144
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:53,777
Baby rhesus monkeys

145
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,746
were separated
from their mothers after birth,

146
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:58,483
and they were given
two substitute mothers:

147
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,052
A wire mesh one with milk

148
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:05,022
and the other covered in terrycloth.

149
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,360
<i>Every</i> monkey preferred
the terrycloth-covered mother,

150
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:11,529
even if it didn't have milk.

151
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:13,731
Because of the warmth?

152
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,932
Because of the skin.

153
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:20,237
Even monkeys know the difference.

154
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:28,011
I tried, I really tried.

155
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:36,250
But that cadaver did nothing
to quiet my craving.

156
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:38,251
I needed someone...

157
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:43,189
...a little more lively.

158
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:48,593
(blow lands) (gasps)

159
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,820
(quiet sobbing)

160
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,522
Warm living skin.

161
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,558
(sobbing)

162
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,627
No, no, no, no, no.

163
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,763
It's okay.

164
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,899
It's okay, because now that you're here,

165
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,868
all of that work is behind me.

166
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:30,741
Mommy.

167
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:35,512
(phone ringing)

168
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,383
Hello?

169
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,783
SAM: Sister Jude.

170
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,016
It's Sam Goodman.

171
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,816
Sam, I tried calling you,

172
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:46,451
but you never got back to me.

173
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,686
I was working on your case.

174
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:51,956
Yes, but I-I-I asked you
to stop.

175
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:53,257
I mean, this girl, this mental patient,

176
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:54,859
she wasn't Anne Frank.

177
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:58,095
I mean, she just made
the whole thing up.

178
00:11:58,162 --> 00:11:59,529
Well, somehow,

179
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:00,997
she got it right.

180
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,465
He is Hans Grouper.

181
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,801
He was an SS officer and a physician...

182
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:07,437
at Auschwitz. What?

183
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:10,173
Did you say...

184
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,441
she got it right?

185
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,642
After the liberation,

186
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,943
he obtained a laissez-passer

187
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:19,713
from the International Red Cross
under the name Arthur Arden.

188
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:24,852
I have the original documents

189
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,354
from the Red Cross,

190
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:31,425
but I need Grouper's fingerprint
to establish a match.

191
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:34,427
Be careful. The man is dangerous
and a flight risk.

192
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,131
These men are always on their guard.

193
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,032
The moment they get nervous,
they disappear.

194
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,368
As soon as you have the print,

195
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:45,704
bring it directly to the motel.

196
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,541
(dial tone drones)

197
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,143
Who are you?

198
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:55,278
I'm Jenny.

199
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,914
(groans) I told your mother,

200
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:01,116
we don't have a children's ward here.

201
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,484
Where is she? She's gone.

202
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:04,986
She kissed me on the cheek

203
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,955
and said, "Be good, Jenny."

204
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,863
Sister Mary Eunice!

205
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,565
I need help here.

206
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:24,640
Monsignor, thank you for coming.

207
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,175
Oh, it's my pleasure.

208
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,444
I consider it a privilege
to perform last rites.

209
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,445
Oh, thank God you're
a man of compassion.

210
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:32,113
We called several priests in the area,

211
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,048
but they were all in a panic
over the news reports.

212
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:38,385
Especially after they published
those grim pictures of her.

213
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:39,853
What exactly is wrong with her?

214
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,354
No one knows.

215
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:44,357
Our doctors have ordered
a battery of tests.

216
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,326
But she did test positive for TB.

217
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,162
Oh, I didn't realize
there were still new cases.

218
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,297
I should warn you...

219
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,533
the sight of her is quite shocking.

220
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,036
We're all God's creatures.

221
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,981
I'll be in the hall if you need me.

222
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,616
(faint breathing)

223
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,519
Hi, child.

224
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,958
(wheezing)

225
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:29,304
Shelly?

226
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,667
Oh, look at that,

227
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:44,772
Father James.

228
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,023
This will make a splendid dayroom

229
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,291
for our residents. (Coughing)

230
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:51,060
All right, I thought all.

231
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:53,429
TB patients had been cleared out.

232
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,997
ARDEN: These are
the incurables,

233
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:57,366
those whose tuberculosis
was too far advanced

234
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:58,834
for any of the new miracle drugs

235
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:01,370
to have an effect. God bless.

236
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:05,174
ARDEN: Well, he hasn't yet.

237
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:07,476
Dr. Arthur Arden, Briarcliff's.

238
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:10,146
Tubercular Ward's supervising physician.

239
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:12,649
Former supervising
physician, I should say.

240
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,985
Father Timothy Howard...

241
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:16,520
Yes, I know who you are.

242
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:17,621
You're the new owner.
(coughing)

243
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:20,991
Sally Starns.

244
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:23,393
She was actually a
nurse here at one time.

245
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:26,863
She won't live till morning,
not if she's lucky.

246
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,464
MONSIGNOR:
Through this holy anointing,

247
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:29,766
may the Lord and his love

248
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,267
and mercy help you with the grace

249
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:32,535
of the Holy Spirit.

250
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,573
May the Lord who frees you from sin

251
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,809
save you and raise you up.

252
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,444
It's all right, my daughter.

253
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:41,945
The Prince of Peace

254
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:44,182
opens his arms to you.

255
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,456
Back when the epidemic was at its worst,

256
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,124
we'd sometimes move more than

257
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,393
100 bodies a week down through here.
Oh.

258
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:57,663
How did you manage to keep up with
all the burials? - There were no burials.

259
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:00,966
Most of the people here
have long since been forgotten.

260
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:02,902
We incinerate the bodies

261
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:05,371
in the crematorium out back

262
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:07,640
and store the ashes in here.

263
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,275
All these wasted lives.

264
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:12,644
All these wasted opportunities.

265
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,179
I suppose it will be a relief for you

266
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,748
to finally leave this place.

267
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:17,483
ARDEN: The end of my
tenure at Briarcliff

268
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,485
also means the end of my research.

269
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,520
Research?

270
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:24,889
ARDEN: I've been working
on an immune booster.

271
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:28,293
It's a sort of bacterial
cocktail, if you will.

272
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,961
It would actually inhibit most disease

273
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,297
from ever taking hold in the human body.

274
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,566
What would you need
to further your work?

275
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,636
Human trials would have
been the next step.

276
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,372
I assume it would be difficult
to find volunteers.

277
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,207
From the general public, yes.

278
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:44,244
But there are those whose lives
otherwise serve no purpose.

279
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,946
Through our work together,
they would have contributed

280
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,214
to the greater good.

281
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:48,683
(brakes screech)

282
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,953
A good that would not go unnoticed.

283
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,121
Even in Rome.

284
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,996
(panting)

285
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:10,769
(classical music playing)

286
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:13,005
(humming)

287
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,452
(record scratches, music stops)

288
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,650
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,584
Would you have preferred Mozart?

290
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,286
Jude was right about you.

291
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:31,253
You're a monster.

292
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,889
Why do you look for the speck

293
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:37,325
of sawdust in your brother's eye...

294
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:40,560
and pay no attention
to the plank in your own?

295
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:43,997
I saw that girl, what you did

296
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,298
to Shelly.

297
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,566
All in the name of progress.

298
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,167
Isn't that what we agreed upon?

299
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,602
No, you told me this
was for the greater good.

300
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,104
You mutilated her!

301
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,038
Perhaps.

302
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:57,006
But you're missing the entire point.

303
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,709
Briarcliff is a receptacle

304
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:02,177
for human waste.

305
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,813
Each patient a perfect example

306
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:07,382
of an evolutionary failure.

307
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,617

314

Another mess to
clean up, Mr. Spivey?

315
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,173
You seemed to have

316
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,708
mistaken the broom closet
for the playground,

317
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,009
where you used to expose yourself

318
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,744
to innocent little boys and girls.

319
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:35,878
No, never the boys, Doc.

320
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,513
I had my standards.

321
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,682
You are utterly depraved.

322
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,818
You've done nothing to improve yourself.

323
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:42,819
No, you're wrong, Doc.

324
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm a new man.

325
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,723
I used to have these disgusting urges

326
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,357
that wouldn't quit
until I busted a nut...

327
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,292
I mean, even in public...
but I'm not sneaking around

328
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,995
with my pants down anymore.

329
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,563
It was Sister Mary Eunice that asked me

330
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,599
to come watch her flash her pussy...

331
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,802
My aim was to give
these wasted lives purpose,

332
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,137
meaning,

333
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,305
and I've succeeded

334
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,474
beyond my wildest imagination.

335
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,342
My experiments

336
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,578
<i>with a combination of syphilis</i>
<i>and tuberculosis</i>

337
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:12,083
<i>have produced results unseen in</i>
<i>the history of medical science.</i>

338
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,285
When they arrived here, these
patients were less than men.

339
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,554
Now, because of me,

340
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,857
they're more than human.

341
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,293
(keys rattle) Would you care to see what

342
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,262
your benevolence has produced?

343
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,405
Witness the next stage
of human evolution.

344
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,474
(faint breathing)

345
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,042
MONSIGNOR:
Have you lost your mind?

346
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,412
Why on earth would you do this?

347
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,414
Why?

348
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,616
When the Russians launch
their nuclear missiles,

349
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,253
20 million Americans will
be incinerated instantly.

350
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,824
Another 20 million will suffer
a slow, agonizing death.

351
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,759
Natural selection would have

352
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,763
weeded out the weak, but only
over the course of time.

353
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,933
Whereas I have managed
to improve the species now,

354
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,202
so that we can survive the atomic blast,

355
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,404
live through the radiation and become

356
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,639
dominant once again.

357
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,407
You should be locked away.

358
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,942
With you to keep me company?

359
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,410
We're in this together, Father.

360
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,145
Remember?

361
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,347
You gave me your blessing,
along with the facility

362
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,815
and the subjects.

363
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,283
I cannot allow this to continue.

364
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,884
I have to expose this
to the light of day.

365
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,652
If you do open that window,

366
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,389
the light will illuminate
everything in Briarcliff.

367
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,192
And I mean everything.

368
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,193
(faint breathing)

369
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,433
Yes, that's what I thought.

370
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,235
Now, you listen to me.

371
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,471
You and I have nothing
to fear from each other.

372
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:42,708
However, we do have a threat in common.

373
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:46,245
We both know where the real danger lies.

374
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,881
Can I try that?

375
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,384
You're too young to use a knife.
You'll cut yourself.

376
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,886
Why'd your mother
abandon you here anyway?

377
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,322
She's scared of me. Really?

378
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,724
Why?

379
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,792
She thinks I killed Josie.

380
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,494
Did you?

381
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,162
No.

382
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,098
Did so. How do you know?

383
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,813
I know everything.

384
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:08,969
I'm the devil.

385
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:14,779
She deserved it, that Josie.

386
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,848
She was a phony little shit.

387
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:19,050
She didn't even like you.

388
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:21,252
She just played with you
because her mother told her to.

389
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
(groans)

390
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:24,955
But you're lucky, because you were born

391
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:28,029
with the gift of authentic impulse.

392
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,430
Don't ever let them kill it.

393
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,865
I wasted so much time

394
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,033
trying to be a good girl.

395
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,700
All I wanted in the whole world

396
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:35,736
was for people to like me.

397
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:39,106
WOMAN:
<i>Okay, okay everyone, it's time!</i>

398
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:42,209
Let's all welcome Mary Eunice McKee

399
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,912
to our annual pool event.

400
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:47,175
(clapping)

401
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,352
Hey, why don't you get up on
the diving board, Mary Eunice?

402
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:52,720
You're our guest of honor today.

403
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:55,856
♪ Love me... ♪ Go ahead.

404
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:58,358
♪ But how do I know? ♪
♪ <i>Tell me</i> ♪

405
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:00,026
♪ <i>How do I know?</i> ♪
All right, everyone.

406
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:01,955
On the count of three,

407
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:04,630
we're all gonna drop our robes.

408
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,092
One...

409
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:12,406
two... three!

410
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,609
(laughter)

411
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:23,284
I was just everyone's victim.

412
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,953
Poor Mary Eunice.

413
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:27,214
(groans)

414
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:28,402
(sniffles)

415
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:32,000
The only place I thought
I'd be safe was with God.

416
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,167
(chuckling): God.

417
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:34,835
You know there's no God, right?

418
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:37,337
You already figured out that it's just

419
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:38,705
a bunch of crap someone made up

420
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:40,207
to keep you from being who you are,

421
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:43,944
from doing what you really want to do.

422
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,747
What a chump.

423
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:48,348
Look where it got me.

424
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,884
Right here, taking shit
from a mean old bitch

425
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:55,021
who drinks and wears trashy red lingerie

426
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:57,758
(whispers): under her habit.

427
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,827
(both chuckle softly)

428
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:03,163
But not for long.

429
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:04,899
They're gonna lock me up in my room.

430
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,736
I'll never be able to do
anything I want ever again.

431
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,906
Don't be a whiner.

432
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,741
You're smarter than they are.

433
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,809
Don't you ever forget it.

434
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,378
Maybe you just need to learn
how to defend yourself.

435
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,883
SISTER JUDE:
<i>Fine. We'll be expecting you.</i>

436
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,523
Monsignor.

437
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,926
Crisis averted.

438
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:33,762
I mean, she-she went off

439
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,532
and-and left her daughter here,

440
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,402
as if we're some kind of
personal child care facility.

441
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:44,875
(chuckles): For heaven's sakes,

442
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:48,111
what is that expression
on your face, Timothy?

443
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,347
It seems Briarcliff's become
quite a burden for you.

444
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,448
No, no.

445
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:55,485
We just had a few, uh, difficult days,

446
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,587
but the order has been restored...

447
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:00,290
Sister, I've contacted a colleague,

448
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,759
Father Bernard, in Pittsburgh.

449
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,929
He's just opened a home
for wayward girls.

450
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,132
I've recommended you highly

451
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,901
to run it.

452
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:12,736
Are you firing me?

453
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:14,038
You've lost your way.

454
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:15,406
You need a new beginning.

455
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:18,577
You're booked on a plane

456
00:24:18,644 --> 00:24:22,280
out of Logan Airport,
Friday morning, 8:30 a.m.

457
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:28,721
This is... this is all
about Dr. Arden, isn't it?

458
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:30,589
Dr. Arden is not
the issue here!

459
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:33,792
Dr. Arden is
entirely the issue here!

460
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,582
He's turned you against me.

461
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:39,133
But I was right about him.

462
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:40,759
Pack up your things, Sister.

463
00:24:59,614 --> 00:25:01,381
(knocks)

464
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,487
Little Jenny Reynolds' mother
came by and picked her up.

465
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:08,390
That's fine.

466
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,092
(sniffles)

467
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,928
Is there anything else, Sister?

468
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,062
No, Sister.

469
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:15,898
Yes, Sister.
What are you doing?

470
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm packing.

471
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,336
I'm leaving Briarcliff.

472
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:23,105
The monsignor, in his wisdom,

473
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:28,277
has decided that my talents
would serve better elsewhere.

474
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,346
Pittsburgh, as it turns out.

475
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:33,182
Pittsburgh?

476
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,484
No, Sister Jude,
you can't leave Briarcliff.

477
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:37,353
I have no choice.

478
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,789
But what will become of us?

479
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,894
(chuckles softly)

480
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:49,932
No, I won't leave you

481
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,301
to the tender mercies
of Dr. Arden.

482
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:55,301
There's something I can do
before I'm exiled.

483
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:56,501
Go to the kitchen.

484
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:02,174
The special bottle of cognac
I keep for the monsignor...

485
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:05,010
bring it to me.

486
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:06,979
And two very clean glasses.

487
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:15,020
(phone ringing)

488
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,791
Thredson residence.

489
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,259
KIT: Thank God you picked up,
Dr. Thredson.

490
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:22,594
You're my one phone call.

491
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:24,363
Listen, you got to help me.

492
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:26,832
The cops put me in jail,
and they say they have proof

493
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,267
I killed Alma and those other ladies.

494
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,568
They say

495
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:30,769
they have a tape of my confession.

496
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,044
<i>I thought we had a deal.</i>

497
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:39,979
I thought you said, if I say
all that stuff out loud,

498
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:41,247
you'll tell the courts
I could stay at Briarcliff.

499
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:42,849
No, no, Kit.

500
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:46,619
I told you to say
what you believe is true.

501
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,221
KIT: <i>I was confused.</i>

502
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:49,355
Now I know the truth.

503
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,424
Alma's not dead. Grace saw her.

504
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:53,292
She told me. Kit...

505
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,961
you need to take responsibility
for what you did.

506
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,997
(sobs)

507
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,094
You said you'd lie for me
so I could avoid the chair,

508
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:02,568
but all you did was lie to me.

509
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:03,803
How'd the cops get the tape, huh?

510
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:04,904
Did you give it to them?

511
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:06,005
Oh, come on.

512
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:07,106
(panting)

513
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:08,141
<i>I bet this was</i>

514
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,275
your plan all along, wasn't it?

515
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:10,910
You didn't want to help me.

516
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:12,212
You're full of shit, and you're a liar.

517
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,281
Stop. You stop calling me that.

518
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:16,751
You're a phony, lying bastard!

519
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:19,086
Stop...! Stop calling me that!

520
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,493
(gasps)

521
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,367
He's unbelievable.

522
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:33,768
(panting)

523
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:36,471
He has the nerve to call me a liar,

524
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,541
when he's the one spouting fantasies

525
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:40,977
about little green men!

526
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:42,612
Kit?

527
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,380
You talk to him?

528
00:27:58,897 --> 00:28:00,965
Perspiration from a rise
in body temperature.

529
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:05,036
Accelerated heart rate.

530
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:07,872
What are you up to?

531
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,907
Nothing.

532
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:13,945
(panting)

533
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:17,414
I knew it.

534
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:21,251
You were gonna abandon me.

535
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:24,388
Just like my mother.

536
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:26,357
(yelling)

537
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:29,428
(sobbing)

538
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:31,797
You're all the same.

539
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,866
I'm not...
Shut your dirty mouth.

540
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:34,867
I'm not like them.

541
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:36,342
I'm not.

542
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,571
I'm not like them.
I'm not like them.

543
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:40,472
It's such a disappointment...

544
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,208
I'm not.

545
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:45,744
...when people don't
live up to expectations.

546
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,079
(panting)

547
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:54,287
Sometimes all you can do is...
end it.

548
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:03,463
(sighs)

549
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,507
This is your fault.

550
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:16,709
You have no one to blame but yourself.

551
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:17,811
Please.

Hello.

565
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:11,956
SAM: It's Sam Goodman.

566
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:15,092
This is Sister Jude.

567
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:24,067
(knocking)

568
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,035
Toast, Arthur.

569
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:29,738
A toast to what?

570
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,274
You won.

571
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:37,077
And I've always prided myself
on my good sportsmanship.

572
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:48,021
To your impressive
single-mindedness.

573
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:50,356
I thought this was
supposed to be a toast.

574
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,593
Ah, yes.

575
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,061
We're abstaining these days, aren't we?

576
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:59,799
I wouldn't dream of drinking alone.

577
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:08,107
You know...

578
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:10,609
there are times in life
that warrant an exception.

579
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:13,612
To you.

Yes?

I'm sorry, did Sister Jude send you?

586
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:05,096
She doesn't know I'm here.

Mr. Goodman?

590
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,481
I came as fast I could.

591
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,016
I have the glass with the fingerprints.

Hello. Hello?

595
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,006
(line clicks, dial tone)

596
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:54,973

What? Listen...

608
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:17,964
Arden did this.

609
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:19,299
No, no.

610
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,534
Nun. Ah... What?

611
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,303
What? What?

612
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,442
What did...? A nun...

613
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,678
A nun. A nun...

614
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:30,046
A nun?

615
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:31,647
What? One of...

616
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:33,049
yours.

617
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,550
One of... yours.

618
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:38,055
Hans Grouper.

619
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:39,223
You were handsome.

620
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,695
Do you mean to tell me Sister Jude

621
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:49,400
has this Israeli Sherlock Holmes
holed up in some motel?

622
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:52,436
She was determined to expose you.

623
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:54,705
But you don't need to worry anymore.

624
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:56,874
I've taken care of everything...

625
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:58,409
Hans.

626
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:00,378
Don't...

627
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:02,380
call me that.

628
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:03,948
Ever.

629
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,954
Are you quite sure this is all of it?

630
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:11,188
No.

631
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,357
It's not all of it.

632
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,827
I've hidden some evidence away

633
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:17,429
in case you try
and double-cross me.

634
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,501
You must understand, these...

635
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:27,005
so-called Nazi hunters
are nothing but...

636
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:30,809
self-loathing, self-seeking,

637
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:33,311
money-grubbing Jews!

638
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:36,747
The Catholic Church
certainly understood that.

639
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:39,316
At least the Pope had
the good sense to...

640
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:41,618
Arthur... I am not a monster!

641
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:43,620
I'm a visionary.

642
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:51,396
Do you have any idea how
lonely a path this is?

643
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:53,932
What it's like to have to
carry on your work in secret,

644
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:57,135
hiding from those pious vigilantes?
Arthur!

645
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,372
You're preaching to the converted.

646
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:05,043
Why?

647
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:09,148
Why are you protecting me?

648
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:17,189
You're not in love with me.

649
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:18,457
(chuckles)

650
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:21,160
I'm no fool.

651
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:23,163
I know I'm too old.

652
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,333
Too ugly.

653
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,635
Is there something...

654
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:30,070
you want from me?

655
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:35,175
This is the beginning
of a whole new era.

656
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:38,179
All you need to do

657
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:40,080
is trust me

658
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:43,483
with your entire soul,

659
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:46,519
and I promise you

660
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:48,522
that everything will work out.

661
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:58,833
Who killed her?

662
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,468
Did you see him?

663
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,637
He was tall.

664
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:04,005
He had a beard

665
00:36:04,073 --> 00:36:05,840
and a brown jacket.

666
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:08,744
First, he slashed my brother
and sister's throats,

667
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:11,647
then he stabbed my mother in the back.

668
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:13,815
I tried to stop him,

669
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,817
but he said he would kill me, too,

670
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:18,119
if I moved a muscle.

671
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:28,162
THREDSON: You're trying not to scream.

672
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:32,500
But you will.

673
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:39,274
They always do
when I make the first incision.

674
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,577
But then shock will take over...

675
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,415
...and you won't feel anything.

676
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:53,487
It doesn't have to be this way.

677
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:57,524
I wish that were true, Lana.

678
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,759
(sobs quietly)

679
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:03,195
I had such high hopes for you.

680
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,464
From the moment

681
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:08,267
I saw you, so ambitious,

682
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:10,603
so... alive.

683
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,372
I was never alive in there.

684
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:16,609
No, not there.

685
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:19,712
Before Briarcliff.

686
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,180
LANA: <i>Oh, come on, Phil.</i>

687
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:23,449
Aren't you sick and tired
of writing the same piece

688
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:25,017
with different names?

689
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:27,219
Start with some blood and guts,
a pinch of sympathy

690
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,754
for the poor victims,

691
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,856
and then top it off with moral outrage.

692
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:32,391
Isn't that the recipe?
You're the one who knows about recipes.

693
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,592
What are you doing here?

694
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,160
And when did you get
assigned to the crime beat?

695
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:38,595
You think Upton Sinclair
waits to be assigned a story?

696
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:40,131
I'm making this my story.

697
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:42,500
Oh, a woman's touch, huh?
Yes, exactly.

698
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,502
That's what's been missing
from this story.

699
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:47,037
You think this mook's just some monster,

700
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:49,139
but no monster starts off that way.

701
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:52,142
He was somebody's precious baby,
crying for his mommy.

702
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,944
Here comes your precious baby now.

703
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:55,679
(reporters clamoring)

704
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,147
REPORTER:
Hey, Walker, why'd you do it?

705
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:58,449
Huh?

706
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:00,518
Where's the body?

707
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:02,554
Come on, Walker.

708
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,756
What, you got nothing to say?

709
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,459
You got a statement, Walker?

710
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,494
I thought that you

711
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:12,229
were the first person

712
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:14,097
who could understand. I do.

713
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:16,332
I do understand. No.

714
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,500
You don't.

715
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:23,573
That's all right, Oliver.

716
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,474
I don't want you to feel guilty.

717
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:28,444
A mother's love is unconditional.

718
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:30,747
You never had that, did you?

719
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:32,282
Everyone deserves that.

720
00:38:33,718 --> 00:38:35,519
Even you.

721
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,127
Baby.

722
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,368
(sobbing)

723
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:51,270
It's me.

724
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:53,172
My baby.

725
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,475
(sniffs)

726
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:02,148
Baby needs colostrum.

727
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:18,164
Car out front is registered

728
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,766
to a Leo Morrison out
of Encino, California.

729
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,334
He one of our dead
trick-or-treaters?

730
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,471
Doubtful. Mr. Morrison's
in his early 30s.

731
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:25,904
We're putting these three as teenagers.

732
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,930
Still trying to I.D. them.

733
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,531
MAN: Detectives!

734
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,466
We got another one!

735
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,505
Mr. Morrison, I presume.

736
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:42,643
All right, full search of the grounds.

737
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:44,578
Let's do it before we lose daylight.

738
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,247
We're looking for at least a body part.

739
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:49,416
Chances are whoever
called this in is our perp.

740
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:51,251
(cell phone ringtone plays)

741
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,598
This is Detective John Grayson.

742
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:05,673
Who is this?

743
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:07,434
MAN: You know who I am.

744
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:08,836
No, I don't.

745
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:10,137
Did you kill these people?

746
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:11,496
Only the imposters.

747
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:13,607
I just wanted you to know that.

748
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,744
Just spoke to Leo Morrison's sister.

749
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:18,847
He's out here on his honeymoon.

750
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:20,115
Shit.

751
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:21,783
Where's his bride?
