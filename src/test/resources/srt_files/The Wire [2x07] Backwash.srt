Sync'd by Mothman

1
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,106
Something in particular?

2
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:26,305
-Funeral.
-I'm sorry.

3
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:27,806
No, funeral, you know?

4
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:30,007
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

5
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,507
Yeah.

6
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,508
That's a popular one.

7
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,210
-Who was it that passed, a relation?
-No, we worked together.

8
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:47,210
-I see. A professional relationship.
-Yeah, professional.

9
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,111
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.

10
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,212
I think I'm on it. Follow me.

11
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,214
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.

12
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,614
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.

13
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:12,015
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.

14
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:15,216
-Pink?
-Your boy was too fierce for the pink?

15
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:17,116
No, he wasn't all that.

16
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:20,717
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...

17
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:22,817
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.

18
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,318
True that. How did your boy fall?

19
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:28,619
Hung himself.

20
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,020
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,820
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.

22
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,021
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?

23
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:43,122
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.

24
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:47,222
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?

25
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:55,024
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.

26
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:58,224
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...

27
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,926
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.

28
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:04,226
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?

29
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:05,827
Hell, yeah.

30
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,827
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.

31
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:13,228
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.

32
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:17,129
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?

33
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,729
Like what?

34
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,630
"Rest in peace," "In Remembrance,"
something like that?

35
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,830
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.

36
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,932
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just....

37
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:38,633
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?

38
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,234
All right. Thanks.

39
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,755
-You cloned a what?
-A computer.

40
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:29,956
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...

41
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:33,157
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.

42
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,158
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...

43
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:41,859
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.

44
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,559
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...

45
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:49,060
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,561
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...

47
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,261
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.

48
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,162
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.

49
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,862
-Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
-Yeah.

50
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:07,464
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.

51
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:11,364
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.

52
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,567
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.

53
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,168
I don't know.

54
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,368
What's next?

55
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:32,369
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.

56
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,970
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.

57
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,570
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...

58
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,470
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.

59
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,771
How are they gonna think that?

60
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,771
No, see, that ain't the way it works.

61
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,073
It ain't.

62
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:51,873
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?

63
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:55,674
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.

64
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:58,074
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...

65
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:01,475
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.

66
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:05,376
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...

67
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,777
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.

68
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:10,177
Hey, Frog.

69
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:13,977
Come here.

70
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,379
No, seriously. Come here.

71
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,379
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...

72
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,580
without hurting you deeply...

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,881
first of all, you happen to be white.

74
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:35,482
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...

75
00:06:35,582 --> 00:06:38,282
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...

76
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:41,783
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.

77
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,583
Second, I'm also white.

78
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:49,185
Not hang-on-the-corner-
don't-give-a-fuck white...

79
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:52,785
but Locust-Point-l.B.S.-Local-47 white.

80
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:56,186
I don't work without no fucking contract...

81
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,387
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...

82
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,387
Iike my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...

83
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:06,889
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.

84
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:12,289
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...

85
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,890
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...

86
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,991
you can work my package.

87
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,391
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?

88
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:27,893
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.

89
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:31,693
All right.

90
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:39,595
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.

91
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:42,395
-Keep it real.
-Whatever.

92
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:30,206
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yeah, you on it.

93
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:36,006
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?

94
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,407
Seems so.

95
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,008
My cousin always works clean.

96
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,808
None of my business, I know...

97
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,810
but did your man Avon even know about it?

98
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,111
You're on your own here?

99
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:03,512
You're right. It ain't none of your business.

100
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,713
And if I were you...

101
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,514
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.

102
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,315
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.

103
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:23,317
All y'all.

104
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:33,119
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.

105
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,120
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.

106
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:46,621
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.

107
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,422
Man, fuck him.

108
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:55,123
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.

109
00:09:55,323 --> 00:10:00,224
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.

110
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,624
He knew that.

111
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:06,025
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.

112
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:12,526
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.

113
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,728
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.

114
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,827
I tried to bring him up, bring him along--

115
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:22,228
-You were real good to him.
-I was.

116
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:27,029
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.

117
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,930
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.

118
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,531
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...

119
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,532
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?

120
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:39,532
I'm just saying...

121
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,233
it might've been for the best, you know?

122
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,435
His name is Head. Dick Head.

123
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,637
Check this out. Put your finger right there.

124
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:05,337
-Nice.
-Nice, right?

125
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:08,538
-Fellows.
-We need a bug.

126
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:10,939
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...

127
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,139
of the modern urban crime environment.

128
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,840
Let me show you.

129
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,341
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.

130
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,942
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.

131
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,643
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...

132
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:33,443
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.

133
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,544
-How much?
-$1,500.

134
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:41,945
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.

135
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:46,246
-You in?
-Am I in?

136
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:48,746
The man just said $1,250, Herc.

137
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:52,847
Can we give it a test run?

138
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:56,248
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?

139
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:59,849
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.

140
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:02,449
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.

141
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,149
-Let me consult my partner.
-Of course.

142
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,850
You got a credit card?

143
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:11,851
-Don't you?
-It's maxed to the max, man.

144
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:14,851
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...

145
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,653
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.

146
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:22,553
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.

147
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,655
I gave your man some room, that's all.

148
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,555
You gave him a home.

149
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:36,656
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.

150
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,156
-No.
-Yes.

151
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,257
You could take these 14 homicides...

152
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:46,058
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.

153
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:49,659
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.

154
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,359
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...

155
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,861
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.

156
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,961
It's win-win for me.

157
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,362
-No.
-Come on, Lieutenant.

158
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,962
A good turn here will not be forgotten.

159
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:12,164
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.

160
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:15,064
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...

161
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,664
and I'm out from under with Burrell.

162
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,666
Sorry, Colonel.

163
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,866
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.

164
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,369
Smarter than he looks.

165
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:56,572
-Where's your friend?
-Who's that?

166
00:13:57,273 --> 00:14:01,373
-The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
-Case is done, for all I know.

167
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:03,875
Yeah?

168
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:08,075
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.

169
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:11,075
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.

170
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:15,176
-So you back to the usual then?
-Yeah, the usual.

171
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:19,277
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.

172
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:22,478
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.

173
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:23,678
Fairfield?

174
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:26,879
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.

175
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,179
Because of terrorism, I guess.

176
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:33,080
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.

177
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,681
You need to be uptown here with us.

178
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,784
You got stripes in the Southeast...

179
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:56,285
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?

180
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,685
Man, I've never seen that thing.

181
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,886
-Snug.
-As a bug.

182
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:04,987
In a rug.

183
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,487
Let's go.

184
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:20,790
-This shit is hypnotic.
-Boring, too.

185
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,590
You make a show of it?

186
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,691
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.

187
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,992
Is that the Valparaiso?

188
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:35,493
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.

189
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:37,993
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.

190
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:41,694
-Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
-Nothing's wasted.

191
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:45,995
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.

192
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,995
-So when they lose a can--
-I see it go.

193
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:56,197
Gentlemen. Ladies.

194
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,398
The future is now.

195
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,699
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...

196
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,699
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...

197
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,500
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.

198
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,201
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...

199
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,402
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.

200
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:22,003
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.

201
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:25,103
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...

202
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:29,504
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.

203
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:32,504
Smart card technology
provides greater security...

204
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:37,205
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.

205
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:40,406
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.

206
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:44,307
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?

207
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,408
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.

208
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,008
It's like you in a store working the register...

209
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,309
and at the end of the day,
the shitjust add up.

210
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:54,510
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...

211
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:57,110
and I want to have the package
right for once.

212
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,910
Hey, Carver.

213
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,411
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?

214
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,112
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...

215
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:09,512
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...

216
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,713
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part--

217
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,713
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.

218
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:20,015
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...

219
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:22,915
Ieaving Singapore a distant second.

220
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:26,016
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?

221
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:29,316
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.

222
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:32,017
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.

223
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:36,018
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?

224
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,418
-That's right.
-That's efficiency, Nat.

225
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,919
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...

226
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,419
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...

227
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,420
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.

228
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,121
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?

229
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:51,221
Question? Yes?

230
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,321
The GPS readings, are they exact....

231
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,921
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?

232
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:59,122
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.

233
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:00,523
Coming.

234
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:06,124
-Hey, Jackie.
-String. You, too?

235
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,624
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.

236
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:11,525
How's Brianna? ls she back there?

237
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,325
What's up, little man?

238
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,527
How you holding up?

239
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,730
Bri.

240
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:33,842
-Nicky boy, you get days this week?
-No.

241
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:37,743
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.

242
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:49,946
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.

243
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:53,446
It's all there, cuz.

244
00:19:56,846 --> 00:20:00,047
-What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
-Nothing.

245
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,048
What did Frog say?

246
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:09,049
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?

247
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,450
The packages were my thing, Nick.

248
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,050
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.

249
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,751
Zig, we're making money.

250
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,953
It's your move, Nicky.

251
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:33,954
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.

252
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:43,856
Paternity?

253
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:49,757
Priscilla Katlow.

254
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:55,859
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?

255
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:58,359
I only fucked her once.

256
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,060
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.

257
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,760
How do you know it's yours?

258
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,361
You call this lawyer?

259
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:12,262
Figured I'd get drunk first.

260
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,562
That's a good plan.

261
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:43,469
-Russians?
-Lot of girls. Pretty ones.

262
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:47,769
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.

263
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,470
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?

264
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,970
You got the club people, I guess.

265
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,772
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.

266
00:21:56,872 --> 00:21:58,372
She looks a little bit older.

267
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,872
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.

268
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,773
She looks about 40.

269
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:08,274
Grab any ass, Prez?

270
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:17,276
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.

271
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:19,476
-I have.
-For us?

272
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:25,778
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.

273
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,578
But once Burrell reached out--

274
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:32,479
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?

275
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,780
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.

276
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,380
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...

277
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,781
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.

278
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,682
It isn't about the casework, I know that.

279
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,283
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...

280
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:57,284
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.

281
00:22:57,384 --> 00:23:00,484
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.

282
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,585
If I'm looking out for number one...

283
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,185
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...

284
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:08,486
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.

285
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:12,687
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.

286
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:19,488
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.

287
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:22,889
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...

288
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:25,090
but now, you're asking too much.

289
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,590
One more year, Nat.

290
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,891
-Not for me, for the fucking union.
-The election's been scheduled.

291
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,391
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...

292
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:35,092
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.

293
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:38,192
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.

294
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,093
It's our turn, Frank.

295
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:43,394
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?

296
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:47,094
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.

297
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,195
Or Polacks, pardon mine.

298
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,095
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.

299
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:55,796
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.

300
00:23:56,395 --> 00:24:00,397
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.

301
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:03,097
Think about it.

302
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,601
-Hello?
-Brucie, baby.

303
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:22,401
-Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
-You talk to the presiding officers yet?

304
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,204
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.

305
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:43,906
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.

306
00:24:45,906 --> 00:24:50,307
-When did you get served with these?
-I got them in the mail this morning.

307
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:53,908
-In the mail?
-Yeah, this morning.

308
00:24:57,608 --> 00:24:59,809
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...

309
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:03,710
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.

310
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:24,114
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?

311
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:29,415
-Who are you calling?
-The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.

312
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:34,116
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.

313
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:42,418
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.

314
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:02,922
-He got you, Zig.
-Who got me?

315
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:08,423
Maui?

316
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:13,324
Love child, never meant to be

317
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:17,925
Love child, born in poverty

318
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:22,126
Love child, never meant to be

319
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:04,435
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...

320
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,035
I just don't have the authorization.

321
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:09,535
Okay.

322
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:13,737
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?

323
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:16,537
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?

324
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,838
Sorry. Wrong building.

325
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,440
Sixth floor, all of them.

326
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:36,542
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.

327
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:39,342
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.

328
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:42,542
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.

329
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:45,743
-So we're on.
-We're gonna need help with surveillance.

330
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:48,944
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.

331
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:52,745
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.

332
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:55,045
Should we tell the Lieutenant?

333
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:59,946
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...

334
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,947
the happier he'll feel.

335
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,548
New truck?

336
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:13,449
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?

337
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:15,350
-Hell, yeah.
-For real.

338
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,150
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.

339
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,251
-You got more for me?
-I got ifyou got for me, right?

340
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:27,852
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.

341
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:29,753
Fuck!

342
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:36,753
I'm with you on this, man....

343
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:42,854
All right, dawg.

344
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,259
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

345
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,260
Keep it fucking moving.

346
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,760
Jesus Christ!

347
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,962
No!

348
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:32,565
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

349
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:35,666
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

350
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:39,067
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.

351
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,767
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.

352
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,368
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.

353
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:49,568
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.

354
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:53,370
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.

355
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,871
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.

356
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,771
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.

357
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:02,871
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?

358
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:07,873
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...

359
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,973
in the service of the city of Baltimore.

360
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:24,776
-Nothing's alive in these, right?
-If they don't go hot to a truck...

361
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,876
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.

362
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,277
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.

363
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:35,178
-How you hanging?
-Good. I'm good.

364
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,878
You ain't been working much.

365
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:44,080
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

366
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,982
Jesus on the main line

367
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:56,782
Tell him what you want

368
00:30:56,882 --> 00:31:00,984
Oh, Jesus on the main line

369
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:04,184
Tell him what you want

370
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:07,784
Jesus on the main line

371
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:10,886
Tell him what you want

372
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:15,986
Call him up and tell him what you want

373
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:19,287
Ifyou want salvation

374
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:21,988
Tell him what you want

375
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:26,088
Oh, ifyou want salvation

376
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:29,289
Tell him what you want

377
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,690
Ifyou want salvation

378
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,790
Tell him what you want

379
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,491
Call him up and tell him what you want

380
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:44,792
Oh, call him up, call him up

381
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,393
Tell him what you want

382
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:51,493
Oh, call him up, call him up

383
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:54,694
Tell him what you want

384
00:31:54,894 --> 00:31:58,195
Call him up, call him up

385
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:01,195
Tell him what you want

386
00:32:01,496 --> 00:32:06,397
Jesus on the main line

387
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,999
You did the 221?

388
00:32:16,998 --> 00:32:18,400
Shit look tight.

389
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:46,004
Sorry for the loss.

390
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:49,405
You all sent him off right, though.

391
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,906
As good a homecoming as I been to.

392
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:55,207
-You been to your share, man, I know.
-No doubt.

393
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,407
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...

394
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:02,408
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.

395
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,909
-Got a proposition here.
-Go ahead to the car, man.

396
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,411
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...

397
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:17,211
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.

398
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:22,212
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.

399
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:26,813
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.

400
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:30,514
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.

401
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:34,115
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...

402
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:36,915
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?

403
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,817
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.

404
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:45,917
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.

405
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:49,718
85, 90%. And you know it's true.

406
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:52,919
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...

407
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:56,420
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.

408
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,820
-You connected?
-This shit is straight off the damn boat.

409
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:03,621
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.

410
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:08,522
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.

411
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:13,022
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...

412
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:15,123
so you see where this thing needs to go.

413
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:18,524
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.

414
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:22,225
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean--

415
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:26,526
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.

416
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:30,427
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.

417
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,627
Later for all that bullshit.

418
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:38,528
-I'll talk to Avon.
-You do that.

419
00:34:57,332 --> 00:35:01,332
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.

420
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,234
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.

421
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:08,534
-But the grain pier is still in there.
-And the rest is just talk?

422
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:11,735
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.

423
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:14,435
Talk is your fucking job description.

424
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,136
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.

425
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:20,836
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.

426
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:28,439
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?

427
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,239
-Jason's at Princeton.
-Princeton.

428
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,940
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?

429
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,941
-Whatever he wants.
-Right.

430
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,441
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.

431
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:49,542
You know, back when we were kids...

432
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:54,743
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.

433
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:58,344
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.

434
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:02,246
-Tang?
-Just invented.

435
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:06,146
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.

436
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:09,547
-You drink it....
-You could be an astronaut, too.

437
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:13,148
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.

438
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:15,748
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...

439
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:19,149
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.

440
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:21,849
What do you think they grew up to be?

441
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:26,251
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?

442
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,451
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...

443
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:33,351
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.

444
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:35,852
You're out of line, Frank.

445
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:43,053
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.

446
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:46,654
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...

447
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,355
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.

448
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,255
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...

449
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:54,856
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...

450
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:57,656
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.

451
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,557
You're talking history, right?

452
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:03,958
I'm talking now.

453
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:08,159
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.

454
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,359
Then it's, "Who's your son?"

455
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,960
But after the horror movie I've seen today....
Robots!

456
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,061
Piers full of robots!

457
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:20,962
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.

458
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:25,262
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...

459
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:29,963
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.

460
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:39,765
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.

461
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,968
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...

462
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:56,668
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.

463
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:05,370
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...

464
00:38:05,471 --> 00:38:08,571
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...

465
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:11,572
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...

466
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,873
and we get some ships in here.

467
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:38,278
Bring it down!

468
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:10,584
-Got one that disappeared.
-Get the container number?

469
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,685
-1 1-37 to 1 2-14.
-Go ahead, Lester.

470
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,785
-We got one, you prepared to copy?
-Send it.

471
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:21,086
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...

472
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:25,387
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.

473
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,487
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.

474
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:31,188
-1 1-99.
-11-99.

475
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:33,989
We got a live one. Be up.

476
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,689
-What am I looking for?
-Stand by on that.

477
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:40,090
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...

478
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,690
blue overalls.

479
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,291
He's hooking the truck onto the....
What do you call it?

480
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,692
Copy that. What next?

481
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:53,293
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...

482
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,994
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...

483
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,794
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.

484
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:04,495
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.

485
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,996
1 1-37 to 1 2-14.

486
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:10,396
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.

487
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,697
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.

488
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:14,898
Copy.

489
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:25,099
1 2-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.

490
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,100
-11-37 to 11-99.
-99.

491
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,101
Target's coming at you, you see it?

492
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:38,402
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.

493
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,703
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.

494
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:46,103
-Target approaching your 20.
-1 1-34, copy that.

495
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:50,105
I got him going straight on Newkirk.

496
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,806
-He's all yours, Bunk.
-Copy.

497
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:13,509
-1 1-34, you got the eyeball.
-Copy.

498
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,916
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 34.

499
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:45,916
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.

500
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,116
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.

501
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,319
Be advised, it is a warehouse.

502
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:05,220
Pyramid lnc. 5605 Newkirk.

503
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:08,921
Copy that.

504
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:18,423
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?

505
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:25,524
Avon, you knew he was using?

506
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:29,925
I seen it, but I didn't see it.

507
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,625
I mean, he came up off that shit...

508
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:37,126
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought....

509
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,128
Fuck.

510
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:51,130
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.

511
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,830
-Yeah?
-Yeah, everybody showed.

512
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,431
-How did Brianna do?
-Rough.

513
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:05,132
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.

514
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:08,233
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...

515
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,434
-you know what I mean?
-What are the prison people saying?

516
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:14,034
That he just hung himself like that?

517
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:19,836
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.

518
00:43:28,637 --> 00:43:32,438
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?

519
00:43:34,038 --> 00:43:35,438
What are you gonna do?

520
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:39,039
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?

521
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,840
He gonna find a way if he wants to.

522
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,140
It ain't on you.

523
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:50,742
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.

524
00:44:11,546 --> 00:44:14,046
What's up with that other thing, man?

525
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:18,147
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.

526
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,849
-We gonna discount it.
-Do I look like Kmart to you, man?

527
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:26,049
-I'm saying, I mean--
-What are you saying? That's ridiculous.

528
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:28,349
Re-package it and sell it off.

529
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:31,750
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.

530
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,651
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...

531
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:39,451
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.

532
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:43,653
-You know, it's a thought--
-It's not even a thought, man. No.

533
00:44:43,753 --> 00:44:47,453
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?

534
00:44:47,553 --> 00:44:49,754
-I know.
-All of it.

535
00:44:58,356 --> 00:44:59,956
Anything come out?

536
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:05,257
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.

537
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,859
-Your DNRs go where?
-Phones for dockworkers local.

538
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,060
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.

539
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,861
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.

540
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,862
On February 4th, and March 16th...

541
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:30,463
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cell phone.

542
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:33,563
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.

543
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:36,263
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.

544
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:38,564
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.

545
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:41,365
-Conspiracy to do what?
-Smuggle shit.

546
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,065
Smuggle what?

547
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:47,566
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?

548
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:51,566
-That one we know about.
-You need to do better for a wiretap.

549
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:59,568
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...

550
00:45:59,668 --> 00:46:03,068
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...

551
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:06,169
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?

552
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,170
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...

553
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,570
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?

554
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,071
That's the law.

555
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,672
Honey, I'm home.

556
00:46:25,174 --> 00:46:27,474
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.

557
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:29,975
-We can pay.
-How?

558
00:46:30,674 --> 00:46:33,675
-Got a new job.
-Off the docks?

559
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:41,377
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.

560
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:45,478
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.

561
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:49,279
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.

562
00:46:49,379 --> 00:46:50,879
How much, Nick?

563
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:55,180
Come here.

564
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:05,282
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.

565
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,582
But steady. You know, we can count on it.

566
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:13,983
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...

567
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,084
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...

568
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:20,785
for someplace nice out in the county.

569
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:31,987
$1,500.

570
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:35,788
$1,250, with the police discount.

571
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:40,889
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.

572
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,490
All right, slow up. This is it.

573
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,891
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.

574
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:04,194
-Sobotka?
-That's what it says here.

575
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:07,895
That mean anything to you?

576
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,996
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.

577
00:48:14,096 --> 00:48:15,596
Frank Sobotka.

578
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:18,797
But we got Nicholas.

579
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:23,197
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?

580
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:27,599
-You know what this means?
-What?

581
00:48:28,098 --> 00:48:31,399
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...

582
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:35,000
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.

583
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,101
-No fucking way.
-Are you out $1,250?

584
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:42,002
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...

585
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:44,402
has to be worth $200 for starters.

586
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:50,004
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.

587
00:48:50,903 --> 00:48:54,304
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.

588
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:58,304
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.

589
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:02,406
-Me?
-We need to bring in the Lieutenant...

590
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,807
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.

591
00:49:05,907 --> 00:49:08,507
And Daniels listens when you talk.

592
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,507
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.

593
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:18,909
-We all got roles to play.
-What's your role?

594
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,010
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.

595
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,310
You give yourself too much credit.

596
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,212
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.

597
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,616
I'll be goddamned.

598
00:50:13,821 --> 00:50:16,821
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...

599
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:18,821
I'm gonna clock his ass good.

600
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:21,522
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.

601
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:24,222
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.

602
00:50:24,323 --> 00:50:28,124
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.

603
00:50:29,324 --> 00:50:31,324
You think I can take him?

604
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:33,724
You can take him.

605
00:50:39,226 --> 00:50:41,726
-Man down, berth five.
-Who?

606
00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:43,226
New Charles.

607
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:53,929
-Ambo's on the way.
-Jesus Christ.

608
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:56,429
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.

609
00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:59,329
-You guys gonna move this thing or what?
-Jesus. Fuck.

610
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,330
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.

611
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,631
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.

612
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,931
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.

613
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:07,631
One, two, three.

614
00:51:11,132 --> 00:51:13,233
Charlie, here. Take a drag.

615
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,934
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.

616
00:51:22,935 --> 00:51:24,235
Right over there.

617
00:51:25,635 --> 00:51:28,536
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.

618
00:51:32,237 --> 00:51:34,537
Frank, how does the leg look?

619
00:51:40,938 --> 00:51:44,639
-Which leg is that now?
-Sir, can you hear my voice?

620
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,739
Squeeze my hand.

621
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,041
Let's get him into the ambulance.

622
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,641
You need to clear the way for us, guys.

623
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,442
-And you followed the can?
-Right to the warehouse.

624
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:01,643
-Surveillance set up?
-Kima is on it tonight.

625
00:52:02,443 --> 00:52:05,243
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.

626
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:07,744
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...

627
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:12,245
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.

628
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:17,146
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.

629
00:52:19,946 --> 00:52:21,747
Rawls came to me.

630
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:25,648
-Asked if I would take the homicides.
-You should.

631
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:30,649
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.

632
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,150
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.

633
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:39,150
But you let it pass...

634
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,251
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

635
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:42,951
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

636
00:53:09,357 --> 00:53:11,257
From the guys in 15-14.

637
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,060
He should be all right.

638
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:34,962
You know how he got the name
New Charles?

639
00:53:36,663 --> 00:53:38,562
First day of work was the same day...

640
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:41,963
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.

641
00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:44,963
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.

642
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:48,564
Ever since then, New Charles.

643
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:52,965
He's gonna lose the leg.

644
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:06,969
Where's the money from?

645
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:25,072
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.

646
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:28,773
No bullshit, no arguments.

647
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:31,773
No arguments.

648
00:54:44,176 --> 00:54:46,777
-You're wasting all the batteries.
-So?

649
00:54:46,877 --> 00:54:49,377
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.

650
00:54:49,477 --> 00:54:53,178
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.

651
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:54,778
-Snitch.
-Punk.

652
00:54:55,178 --> 00:54:56,779
-Squirrel.
-Mope.

653
00:54:57,278 --> 00:55:00,380
-Shut up.
-Who teaches them this stuff?

654
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:03,580
It's my turn, you just had it.

655
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,280
Elena.

656
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:10,281
No.

657
00:55:17,383 --> 00:55:18,983
I don't trust you.

658
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:24,285
I can care about you...

659
00:55:25,184 --> 00:55:27,685
and I can want us to be friends...

660
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:30,786
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...

661
00:55:30,886 --> 00:55:33,886
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.

662
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:40,488
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?

663
00:55:40,787 --> 00:55:42,888
Mom, quick, it's a spider.

664
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:46,089
It's a big, hairy one.

665
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:48,389
-Oh, my gosh.
-Come on, Mom.

666
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:12,594
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.

667
00:56:12,894 --> 00:56:14,994
It could still work for me.

668
00:56:15,495 --> 00:56:17,295
Listen to yourself.

669
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:20,995
I love the job, Marla.

670
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:24,797
-I can't help it.
-The job doesn't love you.

671
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:29,097
You know what I love?

672
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:34,499
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...

673
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,200
the person who never stops
thinking it through.

674
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,900
That's what I fell in love with first.

675
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:45,200
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?

676
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,501
Your ambition.

677
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,603
Where did that man go?
