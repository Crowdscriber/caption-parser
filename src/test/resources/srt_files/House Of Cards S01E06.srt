00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,280
We're almost a
month into the strike,

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
and we've got millions of kids
stuck home from school.

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Do you blame
the White House or Congress?

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
I personally have very
little sympathy for the teachers.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,440
We're over three weeks
into this strike.

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,880
It's costing the country
billions of dollars,

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,240
and instead
of offering solutions--

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
There's a big difference

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,680
between taking a stand
and sitting on your hands.

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,360
I don't know whether
to call it cowardice...

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
It's his agenda,
and the problem

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
is that he stole sound,
conservative ideas.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,480
The only smart thing he's done is lift his
platform from the republican platform.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,440
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,240
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,560
While our approval ratings
continue to nosedive?

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,840
Spinella and I worked together for years
on dozens of labor-related bills.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,880
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- You were wrong about that.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,680
Well, I didn't think he'd be
insane enough to go on strike,

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,320
and I didn't think the strike
would last this long.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,960
So you've been wrong
twice about this.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,480
Why should I believe
you're right about holding out?

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,240
We threatened
collective bargaining

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,480
in order to get performance
standards and charter funding.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,600
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,880
We lay down now,
we lose it all.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,800
There'll be no reform,
just an empty bill.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,680
I understand the logic, Frank,
but we're in damage control now.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
We can't close one wound
by opening another.

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,240
But we're the democrats.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
We're the ones who are supposed
to be defending the teachers.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,360
But you can't have it
both ways, Linda.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,160
You can't have the reform
you want

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,400
and keep the teachers happy
at the same time.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,520
You knew that when we started.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,840
Okay,
then if we have to choose,

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,720
we choose to keep
the teachers happy.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,760
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the rubicon.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm telling you this-- the president
wants to change the bill.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,080
We should've done it
three weeks ago. We didn't.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
So you have to do it now.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
Give me more time,
Linda, please.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,680
If I can break this strike and get
everything we want in this bill,

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
can we agree that's preferable
to folding?

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,400
Of course.
If we can count on that--

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Then count on me
for just one more week.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
If the strike isn't over
by then, I'll change the bill.

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
- Frank--
- No. One more week. That's all.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,080
This is the worst
possible position to be in.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,880
If I water down the bill, the
president will still me as a failure.

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,880
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I forced myself into a corner.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,240
Only total victory will put
me back in his good graces.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,840
The alternative is exile,

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
which would mean the last
five months were for nothing.

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,760
I cannot abide
falling back to square one.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,040
You need me, ma'am?

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,040
No. I just was wondering
if you wanted a cup of coffee.

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,520
I just brewed a fresh pot.

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,200
- I'm good, ma'am. But thanks.
- Are you sure?

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,640
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
No. Come on.
Stretch your legs.

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,200
I won't take no for an answer.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,240
What did you do before you
joined the leadership detail?

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,000
I was a cop here in DC.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,240
Before that,
I was in the Marines, ma'am.

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,200
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?

68
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,440
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.

69
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,480
Served most of my second tour
in the Korangal Valley.

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,480
You wanna know
if I killed anyone?

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,760
I think I know the answer.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,160
- I got a dinner meeting with birch.
- I invited him in for coffee.

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Well, drink it fast. We leave in five...

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,640
Get down! Stay away
from the windows!

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,960
Stop!

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
You'll have six of my best men
covering you around the clock.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
I guess I'm wondering why
we didn't at least have

78
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
one of your best men
covering us now.

79
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,960
He'll be disciplined, sir.

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,200
He shot a gun
in a residential neighborhood.

81
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,360
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation,

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
and we'll take
the necessary action.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,560
Steve never would've
let this happen.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,040
Is he better yet? Because I would
feel a lot safer if he was with us.

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Unfortunately,
he won't be coming back, sir.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I thought he just had
a gallbladder infection.

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,760
He did, but they found more.

88
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,040
His pancreas, stage four.

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,680
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God. That's awful.

90
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
How much longer does he have?

91
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
Not long.
A few weeks.

92
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,840
At least that's what
his wife told me.

93
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,440
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?

94
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
Of course. I'll make sure
you get it right away.

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,280
You're welcome.
Good night.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,120
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Your weapon.

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
Your badge too.

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
Am I suspended, sir?

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,680
You had a suspect on foot,
and you fire your gun?

102
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,560
- Sir, I realize that--
- Do you know how this reflects on me?

103
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,800
That one of our men
could be so careless?

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Not only do you abandon
your post for coffee...

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,320
You could've
killed a bystander.

106
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,360
That slug was found
in somebody's front stoop.

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,480
What if it went in their house?

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
Your badge, Meechum.

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,640
Two reasons, which are
really the same reason.

110
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
I was sick of working
for other people,

111
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,920
and I knew I could do
a better job than my bosses.

112
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,880
They kept trying to suppress me,
shutting me out.

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,480
So I said, "fuck it.
I'll do it my way."

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,280
- Then you just quit?
- Not like you did.

115
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,360
I slaved away until I lined up
the money to start Slugline.

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,800
Once Slugline gets big enough,
what's the plan?

117
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
Are you gonna sell it
like Arianna?

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
Probably.
And then who knows?

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.

120
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,040
So I shouldn't expect
to have a job in two years?

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,240
Do you ever wanna have
any job for more than two years?

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,760
What about you?
What's your big plan?

123
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,320
Uh, I don't know yet.

124
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,920
Come on. Slugline is just
a stepping stone for you.

125
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,920
- You know what? I should take this.
- Go. Do your thing.

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,960
Hey. You have proof Spinella
was behind it?

127
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
Put it in context. Three weeks
into a national teachers' strike--

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
At the home of Francis Underwood,
who has led the charge on--

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,400
There you go. Now post that before one of
my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.

130
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,800
- When do I see you next? - I'm background
on this. I'm not your source.

131
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,880
You can't talk now?

132
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
- No.
- When?

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,560
Soon, with bells on.

134
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
What about "more school books,
less bricks"?

135
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
Nah, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Something specific, something that
points the finger directly at Spinella.

137
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,640
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Of course he will.

138
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,320
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?

140
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,880
He's gonna shift blame for
the strike back on congress.

141
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,440
No. We need something clear,
something clean,

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,960
something that sticks
in your head.

143
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
"Teachers need a lesson
in self-restraint."

144
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,240
No. You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.

145
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,760
No. We need something
that makes Spinella the villain.

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,920
- His lack of control, his inability--
- Disorganized labor.

147
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,520
It's disorganized labor,
plain and simple.

148
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,960
When you've got angry teachers

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,080
throwing bricks
through congressmen's windows,

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,880
you've gotta blame
the union leadership.

151
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,000
We'll be beefing up the security
for the entire leadership.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,720
And I strongly encourage
Marty Spinella

153
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
to keep his people in line.

154
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,960
This is starting to look
like disorganized labor.

155
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,400
Do you really think
Marty Spinella is to blame?

156
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,080
Whether Mr. Spinella
is behind this or not,

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,800
he might wanna
tone down the rhetoric

158
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
before disorganized labor
turns into organized crime.

159
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,720
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.

160
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,600
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.

161
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
It's congress that should
take responsibility.

162
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,640
I don't want to degenerate
to Frank's level.

163
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,520
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.

164
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,520
She's right. It'll eat up one
cycle, and it'll disappear.

165
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,800
No. This story
is getting traction.

166
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
Support for the strike
is dipping.

167
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,520
So is the president's
approval ratings.

168
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,680
But he gets to say in the oval office
another three years, no matter what.

169
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,240
We can't afford
another three weeks.

170
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
When I told
the unions to strike,

171
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,320
I told them to prepare
for the long haul.

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
All right? Their accounts
dry up, we keep going.

173
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,920
We figure it out. I am not going
to blink over something like this.

174
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,520
Fine. But if we lose
the public relations battle,

175
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,320
none of that does us any good.

176
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,360
Frank wants us on the defensive.

177
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,320
I think this story
is going to blow over.

178
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,360
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.

179
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,960
But I wanna give it
another day or two first. Okay?

180
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,880
Hi, Adam.

181
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You all right?
I saw the news.

182
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,400
Yes, I'm fine.

183
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,800
That's gotta rattle
the nerves--

184
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
A brick
coming through the window.

185
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
It did, some.

186
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,120
So are you staying
in the house?

187
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,080
We've got extra security
now, so...

188
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,080
Well, um, it made me
think of you,

189
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,800
so I figured I'd just check in.

190
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,600
I appreciate that.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,520
We still haven't talked,
have we?

192
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,600
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Here's how I see it.

194
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,360
You asked me to come down.
I did.

195
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,600
We both had ideas
about what that could mean.

196
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Probably very similar ideas.

197
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,640
But then you changed your mind.

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
So be it.

199
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,200
There's no reason

200
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,040
we can't be in touch
or remain friends.

201
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,520
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.

202
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960
So I won't call again.

203
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,040
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.

204
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
What are you saying?

205
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,040
I just called
because I care about you.

206
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
No agenda.

207
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
If you wanna talk again,
call me.

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,360
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.

209
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,960
You think
I'm being unreasonable?

210
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,000
I think you're doing
whatever it is you need to do,

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,280
and I'm not gonna question it.

212
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,200
It was sweet of you to call.

213
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Listen, you probably
need to get back to work.

214
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
I know I do.
I should go.

215
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah. Okay.

216
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
- Take care.
- Okay.

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,880
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I wanna be governor,
and I want your help.

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,760
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.

220
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,720
I haven't had a drink
in over a month. I'm clean.

221
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,240
Is that because I asked,
or because it's what you want?

222
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
It was about time I took
responsibility for myself.

223
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,520
Taking responsibility is one
thing, and it's admirable.

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,080
But running for governor of a major
state is a whole other ball game.

225
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,440
Let me tell you something,
Frank.

226
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,960
I got elected to congress

227
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,120
'cause I seized the moment
that opportunity struck.

228
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,520
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.

229
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,560
If you help me out,
I'll give you everything I got.

230
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,520
Well, that's all
I've been waiting to hear.

231
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
All right.
I'll tell you what.

232
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,360
I need to make some calls,
check in with some people.

233
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.

234
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
- Of course.
- And, Peter...

235
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,760
I feel like I've met
the real you

236
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,200
for the first time just now.

237
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,680
Janet.

238
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,120
- Is this a bad time?
- No.

239
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
No, not at all.

240
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.

241
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,280
Here. Take my chair.

242
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,960
- Oh, no. I'm fine.
- I'll take these.

243
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,600
Thank you.

244
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,080
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.

245
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,440
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.

246
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,960
Francis and I were so upset
when we heard.

247
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.

248
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,720
I didn't want
too many people knowing.

249
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,680
Yes.

250
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
Francis wishes he could be here.

251
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,120
He wants you to know
he's praying for you.

252
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,120
- Couldn't make it, huh? - No, there's a
big teachers' strike going on right now,

253
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,440
and he's been stuck
in his office for weeks.

254
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
I get it.
I saw on the news.

255
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,040
- The brick.
- Right.

256
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,880
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have
happened if you were there.

257
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,720
No. Probably not.

258
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,440
I never seen him pray.

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,720
Not in eight years.

260
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,960
You said he was praying for me.

261
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
You've seen us in church.

262
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,160
Yeah, but...

263
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I never went inside.

264
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
They're just gorgeous.

265
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Mrs. Underwood,
thank you so much.

266
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,280
Please, call me Claire.

267
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,520
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.

268
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,200
If you need anything at all,
call me. You have my cell.

269
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,080
Anything at all. And I'm sorry
to have surprised you.

270
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,760
No. It was so nice of you
to come.

271
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,600
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.

272
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,040
Check this out.

273
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,960
It's foam.

274
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,160
- How many of these we have?
- 200. But I can get more.

275
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,800
Get more.

276
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,760
Bring it on!

277
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,400
You need to give the teachers
the respect they deserve.

278
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,880
We can't back
away from this, Marty.

279
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,400
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.

280
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,640
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.

281
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
We're gonna come off
the bad guys here.

282
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Okay. Okay.
I get it. I get it.

283
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,440
But I wanna be smart about this.

284
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
I wanna do something definitive
that'll put this to bed

285
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
- and get us back on message.
- CNN,

286
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
one on one, you and Underwood.

287
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
8:00 tonight.

288
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,560
Frank is excellent in debates.

289
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,240
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.

290
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,840
Okay. But I want as much prep
as possible, okay?

292
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,120
I want to run questions.

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,640
You moderate,
you play Underwood.

294
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Wear this one.

295
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,160
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.

296
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,120
Well, somebody at the studio
can do that.

297
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.

298
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,080
War paint.

299
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,200
How bloody do you think
it'll be?

300
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,440
Oh, I think I oughta be able to
dispatch with him easily enough.

301
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,800
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?

302
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,440
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.

303
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,400
Oh, good for him.
I like him.

304
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,440
Oh, good,
because he could use your help.

305
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,400
- How?
- We're running him for Governor.

306
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,680
- Ambitious.
- Mmm.

307
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,920
We wanna create jobs
in his district.

308
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,720
It's on the Delaware River.

309
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,200
I thought we might be able
to put a bill together.

310
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,240
Something with
an economic upside.

311
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
This has to do
with the shipyard closing?

312
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
We need the shipbuilders'
support for his campaign.

313
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,600
You think you might be able

314
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
to draft a bill
that he can sponsor?

315
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,720
I'm really trying to focus on
international projects, Francis.

316
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,240
Not domestic legislation.

317
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,800
I understand, but I could really
use your help, Claire.

318
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,280
Does Catherine durant
still owe us?

319
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,800
When you make someone
Secretary of State,

320
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,280
they owe you for life.

321
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
We're having trouble
getting our water filters

322
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,200
through sudanese customs.

323
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,360
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.

324
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,000
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm ready for battle.

326
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
You wanna come watch?

327
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,760
- No. You go on ahead.
- Oh, come on.

328
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,680
Watch me put the final nail
in Spinella's coffin.

329
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,000
It'll be fun.

330
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,880
Marty.

331
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,040
Frank.

332
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
Come on, people.
Take your marks.

333
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,560
Congressman, would
you like to respond to that?

334
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,080
Yes, I would. Two billion dollars
of taxpayer's money being wasted.

335
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
And congress should be ashamed
of itself for that, Frank.

336
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,560
Oh, what? Did congress force
the teachers to go on strike?

337
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,840
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?

338
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,080
When you threaten
teachers' ability

339
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
to negotiate as a union,

340
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,400
when you threaten
their job security,

341
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,880
you threaten their livelihood,

342
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,880
of course you force them
to strike.

343
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,880
And did we also force them to start
throwing bricks at people's houses?

344
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm really glad
you brought that up,

345
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,200
because you know
there's absolutely no proof

346
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,600
that that incident had
anything to do with this strike.

347
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,080
And I wanna take the opportunity
to say publicly

348
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,600
that we categorically condemn

349
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,920
any use of violence whatsoever
or intimidation.

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,360
What you're saying essentially

351
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,720
is that you can't control
your own people.

352
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,080
- That is not what I'm saying. - That is
what you're saying. You're disorganized.

353
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,720
- Disorganized labor. - You can keep
trotting out that phrase all you like,

354
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,400
but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back

355
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,840
to the issue here
of educating our children

356
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,440
and the fact that congress is not
living up to their commitment.

357
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,840
Well, you know
what I would like?

358
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,600
What?

359
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,480
An apology.

360
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
If not to me, then to my wife.

361
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,280
When that brick came through
our window, it was terrifying.

362
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,640
She's standing right over there.

363
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,280
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.

364
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,640
Now, why don't you
look her in the eye

365
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
and tell her that your people had
nothing to do with that brick.

366
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,400
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,640
Okay.

368
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
I am sincerely sorry

370
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,880
that you had to go through
that ordeal, truly.

371
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,680
And it actually sickens me

372
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,760
that someone made you
feel unsafe in your own home.

373
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,080
And I give you my word that
to the best of my knowledge,

374
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,320
none of our people
had anything to do with it.

375
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,000
But you know
what sickens me more?

376
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,280
That right now,
your husband is using you

377
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,440
as a prop on national television
to try and win a debate.

378
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,040
So I think you're the one
that owes your wife an apology, Frank.

379
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,360
And when
you're done apologizing,

380
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,240
can we please get back
to the issue here

381
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,480
of educating our children?

382
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,920
No. You've got this wrong,
Marty.

383
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,960
There is no "you" and "I"
in education.

384
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,320
Well, I mean, yes,
there's the letters

385
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,480
"U" and "I" are in
the word "education."

386
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,280
But "Education"
with a capital E...

387
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,440
You know what
I'm talking about.

388
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,560
I don't think I do.

389
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,400
Yes, you do, Marty.

390
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,200
U and I-- Education.

391
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,160
So, what, we're gonna waste the rest of
this debate naming all the vowels in--

392
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,680
I'm happy to play
the vowel game.

393
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,040
You wanna play the vowel game
with me?

394
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,320
All right.
U think I O

395
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,640
U A apology.

396
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,200
But no, no, no.

397
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,040
U O I...

398
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,720
Interesting.
You left out E for "Education."

399
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
- So let--
- Defecation--

400
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,040
Edification.
I'm sorry. LOL.

401
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,440
Uh, uh...

402
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,840
Uh...

403
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,920
You like sesame street so much?

404
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,800
Why don't you give the kids
the money they deserve?

405
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,240
What I'm trying to say
about education...

406
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,600
Well,

407
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,520
I guess school's
still in session.

408
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,360
I guess you
schooled me there, Marty.

409
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,600
Let's move on.
Please.

410
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,320
Humor aside, there are more
important issues out there.

411
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,240
I had no intention
of bringing you into this.

412
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,880
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.

413
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,360
I know.

414
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,880
The idea just struck me,
and I went with it.

415
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,200
I don't mind
that you improvised.

416
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,520
I just wish
you'd done it better.

417
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,360
Congressman Frank Underwood
says he got, quote, "schooled"

418
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,800
by AFT spokesman and chief
strategist, Martin Spinella,

419
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,720
during a debate last night
on this network.

420
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,120
In the past 24 hours,

421
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
reruns of the gaffe

422
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,320
have played non-stop on TV news
programs and the internet.

423
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,760
A YouTube clip
set to techno music

424
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
has logged
more than 300,000 hits

425
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,920
and spawned
dozens of other spoofs.

426
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,080

427
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,000

431
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,960
That was as clumsy

432
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,360
as the Lee Harvey Oswald
prison transfer.

433
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,280
What was he thinking?

434
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,960
Just give me one second.

435
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,200
There's a deli.
Down the street.

436
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,880
Patti, thanks for coming.

437
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,160
Sit down.
You want some coffee?

438
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,000
No, thanks. I'm good.

439
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Hey, did you see
bill Maher last night?

440
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
No, I didn't.

441
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,240
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.

442
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,840
I have to admit, Frank,
it was kinda funny.

443
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, I'll have
to catch a rerun.

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,400
How you doing? You holding up
all right with the strike?

445
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,880
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.

446
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,080
I have your candidate.

447
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,400
Peter Russo.
First Congressional District.

448
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,720
We crossed him off.

449
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,160
I know. It's a mistake.

450
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,080
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.

451
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,280
Nobody knows who he
is outside of Philadelphia.

452
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,160
There's no donor base,
no infrastructure.

453
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,280
You start me off
with funding from the DNC

454
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,160
and I'll raise an army
around this guy.

455
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,720
I will personally
oversee his campaign.

456
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
Is that the best we can do?

457
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,280
What's better than a blank slate
in the right hands?

458
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,520
Ed, you need to go.

459
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Congressman,
do you have a moment?

460
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,680
Thank you, Patti.

461
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,880
- Have him call me.
- I will.

462
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,240
Ed? Please.

463
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,000
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.

464
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,560
One second, sir.
Please.

465
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,880
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.

466
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
It's not easy for me
to ask this,

467
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,440
but I was wondering
if you could put in a good word

468
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,920
with my boss.

469
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,200
A good word?

470
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,640
They're going to discharge me,
sir.

471
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,200
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.

472
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,640
But my job,
it means everything to me,

473
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,760
and I know a good word
from you would...

474
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,840
Look, I have nothing
against you personally, Meechum,

475
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,560
but I can't get involved
in these sort of affairs.

476
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
There's protocols and rules.

477
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,040
Sir, please,
if you spoke to Cardiff--

478
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,760
There is nothing that I can do.

479
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
If anyone can convince
the captain,

480
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,320
it would be you, Congressman.

481
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,240
I'm sorry. I wish you
all the best, Meechum.

482
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,120
Doug.

483
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,080
What did Barney hull say?

484
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,400
That we'd be the first to know.

485
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,840
I can't believe
there hasn't been

486
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,800
a single 911 call.

487
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,160
There's been plenty.

488
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,240
It's just not the sort
we're after.

489
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,880
We got that kid in Atlanta.

490
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,080
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.

491
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
It looks too opportunistic.

492
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,600
Maybe if we open it up
a little bit.

493
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,160
No, we cannot
lower our standards.

494
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,520
We just have to be patient.

495
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,280
New rule--
now that the debate's over,

496
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,960
Frank Underwood has to tell us
what the hell that was.

497
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,120
Seriously, Congressman,
was that a joke?

498
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,280
I haven't seen something
just lay there like that

499
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,800
since, uh...

500
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,560
I gotta go all the way back
to my prom night.

501
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,680
Can we just settle
this strike please?

502
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,640
Teachers have been out
of the classroom for so long,

503
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,960
middle schoolers are starting
to have sex with each other.

504
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,520
Enough.

505
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,440
I don't know why you had it on
in the first place.

506
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,560
I love you, Francis.

507
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,760
I know.

508
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,200
We should say that
more often to each other.

509
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
I need to clear my head.

510
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,200
...north and east
of the airport.

511
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,760
I'm gonna need that
in time for that meeting.

512
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,760
Peter, let's talk.

513
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,080
So. I've spoken
to Patricia Whittaker.

514
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,600
She's on board.

515
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,320
You'll be getting four million
in start-up funding

516
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
from the DNC.

517
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,760
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.

518
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,080
But the campaign starts today.

519
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,360
Are you ready?

520
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
I've already
put together a platform.

521
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
It's mostly broad strokes,
but we can hone it.

522
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,160
Good. The first thing
we need to address

523
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,520
is your sobriety.

524
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,040
Oh, you don't need to worry
about that.

525
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,400
Have you been
going to meetings?

526
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,640
You mean AA?

527
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,920
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.

528
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,640
If you want my help,

529
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,680
then going to meetings
is my one requirement.

530
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,320
I know I had a problem, Frank.

531
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,560
I accept that.

532
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,240
And I've taken
responsibility for that,

533
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,720
but I don't think going
to meetings is necessary.

534
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,120
You cannot white-knuckle
your recovery, Peter.

535
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,760
This campaign will be
the hardest thing

536
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,040
you've ever done in your life.

537
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,640
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.

538
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.

539
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
The party's investing in you.

540
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,400
I need to make sure
you're investing in yourself.

541
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.

542
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,840
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.

543
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,160
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?

544
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,480
He's been sober 14 years.

545
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,880
Doug has a drinking problem?

546
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,680
Had. Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.

547
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,600
In the meantime, I want you
to meet with my wife, Claire.

548
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,080
She runs the clean water
initiative.

549
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,480
She's expecting you,

550
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,320
so clear your schedule
and head over there now.

551
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,360
Frank.

552
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,360
Thank you.

553
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,560
For believing in me.

554
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,280
You're gonna make
a great candidate, Peter.

555
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,320
The shipyard closing frees up
1,100 acres of federal land.

556
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,960
Our goal is to pass a watershed
act for the Delaware River.

557
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,840
We develop the land in an
environmentally-responsible way,

558
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,040
creating jobs in the process.

559
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,920
How many jobs?
Thousands.

560
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,720
We're aiming
for the $200-million mark.

561
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,040
We got a lot of work to do.

562
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,280
We do, but you can start
with the congressman

563
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,040
whose districts
fall within the watershed.

564
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,600
Do you have a draft of the bill
you can show me?

565
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
We haven't sponsored
any environmental legislation.

566
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
We'll draft it in consultation
with your staff.

567
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
Gillian will be
the point person on our end.

568
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,720
I don't have any
legislation experience.

569
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,800
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?

570
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,160
We just did.

571
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,880
Will you introduce him
to the research team?

572
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,400
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.

573
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,120
Mr. President?

574
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,320
I want it over.

575
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,560
As soon as possible.

576
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,760
Gut the bill, Frank.

577
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,040
Do whatever's necessary
to end this.

578
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,480
Mr. President,
if we give in now,

579
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,320
the public won't credit you
with a victory.

580
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,200
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up

581
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,360
as a colossal defeat.

582
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,840
Well, that's on you, Frank.

583
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,160
You let this situation
devolve to where it is.

584
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,560
I've already been blamed

585
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,680
for the largest teacher's strike
in US history.

586
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,240
I won't be held accountable
for it dragging on

587
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,880
months and months.

588
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,200
Mr. President, we have to end
this strike on your terms.

589
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,440
Not anyone else's.

590
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,600
How? By debating
Marty Spinella on CNN?

591
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,120
Sir, you have placed your faith
in me thus far.

592
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
I would ask
that you continue to do so.

593
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,000
Whatever you're doing, Frank,
isn't working,

594
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,240
so I'm stepping in.

595
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,720
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.

596
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,800
No.

597
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but I will not do that.

598
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,400
Are you letting pride
cloud your judgment, Frank?

599
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,600
Respectfully, sir,

600
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,040
you're allowing fear
to cloud yours.

601
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,120
Not an easy thing to say no

602
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,000
to the most powerful man
in the free world.

603
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,960
But sometimes the only way
to gain your superior's respect

604
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,320
is to defy him.

605
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,680
What do we have
on the schedule, Linda?

606
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,320
Your meeting with the...

607
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,600
Thank you, Mr. President.

608
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,080
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.

609
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,680
Good.
Let's look it over.

610
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,200
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?

611
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,960
It went well.

612
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,160
Is he game?

613
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Completely.

614
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,760
Ugh. Thank you.

615
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,440
That's a big weight
off my shoulders.

616
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,520
You sound tired.

617
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,400
Tired. Impatient.

618
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,840
What can I do?

619
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.

620
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,160
I don't like when
we leave things to fate.

621
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,920
Neither do I.

622
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,280
Does that mean I'm gonna have
the bed to myself tonight?

623
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,080
Probably.

624
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,680
Can't Doug man the fort?

625
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,320
Well, he could,
but I'd just toss and turn.

626
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,760
If I'm not gonna sleep,
I might as well not sleep here.

627
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,720
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.

628
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
Call me if you want company.

629
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,720
I will.
Goodnight.

630
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,080
Goodnight.

631
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
You should go home.
I can take it from here.

632
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,560
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.

633
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,560
10-59. Corner of 16th and Q.
10-59.

634
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,280
What's that?

635
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,600
Disorderly conduct.

636
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,560
Do you believe in karma?

637
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,240
Absolutely not.

638
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,640
Well, I do.

639
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,320
At least tonight.

640
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,000
Get Captain Cardiff
on the phone.

641
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,720
Let's do something
about Meechum.

642
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,800
What?

643
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,600
Get him his job back.

644
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,680
He fired his weapon.

645
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,320
He overreacted.

646
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,000
Cardiff.
On the phone. Now.

647
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff,
please.

648
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,960
We might as well do one
productive thing while we wait.

649
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,480
It requires very little of me

650
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,120
and will mean the world to him.

651
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,440
It's a very
inexpensive investment.

652
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,560
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.

653
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,520
I have Francis Underwood
for you.

654
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,280
I got him on.

655
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,240
Captain, I know it's late,

656
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,400
but I'd like to talk to you
about Edward Meechum.

657
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,920
Good morning, gentlemen.

658
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,840
Thank you.

659
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,840
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

660
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,040
You have any trouble
getting in?

661
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,160
Nah, they made me put it through
the X-ray machine twice.

662
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,920
So I hope it didn't
overcook it.

663
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,720
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.

664
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,480
For the inconvenience.

665
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,400
You know, 20 years
you been coming to my joint.

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,320
This the first time
I been to yours.

667
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,600
What do you think?

668
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,640
I could get used to it.

669
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,200
Well, you're welcome any time.

670
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,440
Thank you, Freddy.

671
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,520
Always, Frank.

672
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,600
Got a...
446 3rd Street...

673
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,280
That's a drive-by shooting.

674
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,040
Get details.

675
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,200
Sir, I want to thank you
for talking to the captain.

676
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,480
He told me you called,

677
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,360
and I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

678
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,480
I want you to listen
very closely

679
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,200
to what I'm about to say.

680
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,480
From this moment on,
you are a rock.

681
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,400
You absorb nothing,
you say nothing,

682
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
and nothing breaks you.

683
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,800
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

684
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,880
Welcome back.

685
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,360
Steve?

686
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,200
I'll leave you be.

687
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,480
Where, uh--
where's Janet?

688
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,560
She's been here every day
for the last few weeks.

689
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,440
I told her go home,
get some rest.

690
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,800
Well, is everything okay?

691
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
Your text
said it was important.

692
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,920
I don't know how to put this.

693
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,360
The thing is, I...

694
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,320
I've been thinking.

695
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,280
A lot.

696
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,320
About my life.

697
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,440
About the things I haven't done.

698
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,680
Things I haven't said.

699
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,400
I hate your husband.

700
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,800
A lot of people do.

701
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,240
The past eight years,
I watched over him.

702
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,840
But it wasn't him
I was watching.

703
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,360
And every time I saw you,

704
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,640
every time I heard your voice,

705
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,200
all I could think to myself was,

706
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,640
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."

707
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,600
I can't tell you how many times
I thought about that.

708
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,040
You know what Francis said to me
when he proposed?

709
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,280
I remember his exact words.

710
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,840
He said, "Claire,
if all you want is happiness,

711
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
say no.

712
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm not gonna give you
a couple of kids

713
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,560
and count the days
until retirement.

714
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,000
I promise you
freedom from that.

715
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,200
I promise
you'll never be bored."

716
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
You know,
he was the only man--

717
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,720
and there were a lot
of others who proposed.

718
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,400
But he was the only one
who understood me.

719
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,080
He didn't put me
on some pedestal.

720
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,320
He knew that I didn't want
to be adored or coddled.

721
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,200
So he took my hand
and he put a ring on it.

722
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,920
Because he knew I'd say yes.

723
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,600
He's a man who knows
how to take what he wants.

724
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,640
Is this what you wanted?

725
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
Is that the way you wanted it?

726
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,400
Stop. Stop.

727
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,880
Please. Please. Stop.

728
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,960
Don't.

729
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,320
You told me your truth.

730
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,160
Now you know mine.

731
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,720
Hey, it's Peter.

732
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,760
I don't expect you
to call me back,

733
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,080
but I wanted to let you know
I stopped drinking,

734
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,120
and I went to my first
AA meeting.

735
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,560
Um, I'm supposed to reach out

736
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,160
and make amends
to those I've hurt.

737
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
But I guess the real reason
I called you

738
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,960
is just to say I love you
and I miss you.

739
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,560
I hope you're well.

740
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,800
This is work, not play.

741
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,960
Then why'd you bother
coming over?

742
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,840
I was hoping you'd answer
the door naked.

743
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,400
That would be play.

744
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,120
That would be work with a view.

745
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,680
Sorry to disappoint.

746
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,600
How many characters in a tweet?

747
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,800
140.

748
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,640
Type this, let me know
where you land.

749
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,880
"Eight-year-old
Washington DC boy

750
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,640
killed by a stray bullet
in gangland shoot-out."

751
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,720
61 characters left.

752
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,840
"Should have been in school"?

753
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,240
30 left.

754
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,320
"Spinella to blame?"

755
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,560
128.

756
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,760
Press "send."

757
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,320
Now give me a name, details.

758
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,280
Tyler Davis. Third grader
at Vernon Baker Elementary.

759
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
Shot outside his home
in southeast

760
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,360
just before noon today.

761
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,600
Sent.
Where are you going?

762
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,280
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...?

763
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,320
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.

764
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,880
Tyler never did anything wrong.

765
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,400
He was a good boy.

766
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,360
Everybody loved him.

767
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,080
It's okay.

768
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,120
If Tyler's school
had been in session,

769
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,560
this senseless killing
would have never taken place.

770
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,640
We need to end this strike now

771
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,680
and get all our children
back in school

772
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,640
where they belong before we risk
another death like this.

773
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,120
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed
to the capitol right now,

774
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,000
and I will remain there until
you are ready to meet and talk

775
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,320
so that we can end
this pointless strike.

776
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
Thank you all for coming.

777
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,560
Let's go back inside.

778
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,400
Mr. Spinella, one question...

779
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,680
Mr. Spinella is not to make
a comment at this time.

780
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,040
No comment. No comment.

781
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,680
Thank you.

782
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,920
Frank.

783
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,880
So?

784
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,080
You said you wanted to talk.

785
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,800
You said you wanted
to work out a compromise.

786
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,200
I lied.

787
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,960
Excuse me?

788
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,600
I have no intention
of working out a compromise.

789
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,960
So then why the fuck
are we here, Frank?

790
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,080
What the hell's
the matter with you?

791
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,360
You think this
is some kind of a game?

792
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,720
No.

793
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,160
These are real people
with families to feed.

794
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,400
Would you please stop that?

795
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,960
Stop what?

796
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,560
In five seconds,
I'm out of here.

797
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,240
One. Two. Three.

798
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,440
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.

799
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,600
You know the difference
between you and me, Marty?

800
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,040
What?

801
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,160
I'm a white-trash cracker

802
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,480
from a white-trash town

803
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,160
that no one would even bother
to piss on.

804
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,320
But here's the difference--

805
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,920
I've made something of myself.

806
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,000
I have the keys to the capitol.
People respect me.

807
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,600
But you, you're still nothing.

808
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,280
You're just an uppity dago
in an expensive suit

809
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,840
turning tricks for the unions.

810
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,880
Nobody respects
the unions anymore, Marty.

811
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,120
They're dying.
And no one respects you.

812
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,040
The most you'll ever
make of yourself

813
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200
is blowing men like me.

814
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,440
Men with real power.

815
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,360
Yes. I can smell the cock
on your breath from here.

816
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,120
You think you
can get under my skin?

817
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,480
I know I can.

818
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,880
Kiss my ass, Frank.

819
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,400
You can't afford to walk out.

820
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,880
Watch me.

821
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,320
I've got a dead, underprivileged
kid in my pocket.

822
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,800
What do you have?

823
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,800
I have 2 million
honorable teachers.

824
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,880
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.

825
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,920
Go ahead. Open it.

826
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,440
Okay.

827
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,320
I'll play your game.

828
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,200
You're an idiot.

829
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,760
Stamper threw it.

830
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,520
You're full of shit.

831
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,160
Oh, no, Stamper
threw the brick.

832
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,360
And I made sure Claire
distracted my security.

833
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,840
Are you kidding me?

834
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,160
And to think you wanted me
to apologize to my wife.

835
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,240
You would do something
that low, Frank?

836
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,680
I arranged the brick, Marty,

837
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,960
just like I arranged
this meeting this afternoon.

838
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,240
Back off, Frank.

839
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,880
Why don't you just
get down on your knees

840
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,200
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.

841
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,400
Because the only thing
you're gonna get from me

842
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,080
- is come on your--
- Fuck you!

843
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,640
Everything okay in there?

844
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,800
Ugh.

845
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,720
Look, I'll-- I'll tell them
you provoked me.

846
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,120
I'll tell them that you threw
the brick yourself.

847
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,720
And who's going to believe you?

848
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,480
You just assaulted
a United States congressman,

849
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,520
which is a felony.

850
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,000
But I'm not gonna press charges,
Marty.

851
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,720
Because the strike ends now.

852
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,400
You think it'll leave a scar?

853
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,280
I have a thick skin.

854
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,200
The next time you ask me
to invite someone in for coffee,

855
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,960
will you please make sure
no guns go off?

856
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,360
I'll do my best.

857
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,440
I saw Steve again today.

858
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,760
How is he?

859
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,920
In a lot of pain.

860
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,560
Should I go see him?

861
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,840
I don't think you need to.

862
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,600
Zoe Barnes.

863
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,360
When he dies,
we'll pay for his funeral.

864
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,400
You don't need to take it?

865
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,480
No.
I'm done with work today.

866
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,840
