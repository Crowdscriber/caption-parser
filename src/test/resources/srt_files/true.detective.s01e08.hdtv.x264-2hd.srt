to that observation.

654
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:56,320
Nah, I don't mean like that.

655
00:48:56,354 --> 00:48:58,888
It's something else.

656
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:03,093
Well, so...
talk to me, Rust.

657
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:08,599
[Sighs]

658
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:12,936
There was a moment--

659
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,472
I know when I was
under in the dark

660
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:17,942
that something...

661
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:20,110
whatever I'd been reduced to,

662
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:22,179
you know, not even
consciousness.

663
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:26,149
It was a vague awareness
in the dark,

664
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:29,119
and I could--

665
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:32,656
I could feel my definitions

666
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,158
fading.

667
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:38,729
And beneath that...
darkness, there was another kind.

668
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:41,698
It was-- it was deeper,

669
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:45,869
warm, you know,
like a substance.

670
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:50,206
I could feel, man,

671
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:54,245
and I knew, I knew my daughter

672
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,647
waited for me there.

673
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,649
So clear.

674
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,785
I could feel her.

675
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:05,622
[Voice trembling]
I could feel...

676
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:10,294
I could feel a piece
of my-- my pop, too.

677
00:50:12,163 --> 00:50:14,631
It was like I was
a part of everything

678
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:18,635
that I ever loved,
and we were all...

679
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:23,307
the 3 of us, just--
just fadin' out.

680
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:30,680
And all I had to do
was let go...

681
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:33,317
and I did.

682
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:38,322
I said, "Darkness,
yeah, yeah."

683
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,326
And I disappeared.

684
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:47,698
But I could--
I could still feel

685
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:50,467
her love there,

686
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:53,603
even more than before.

687
00:50:55,373 --> 00:50:57,474
Nothing...

688
00:51:00,845 --> 00:51:03,847
There was nothing
but that love.

689
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:05,983
[Sobbing]

690
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:19,296
Then I woke up.

691
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:26,803
Hey, uh...

692
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:31,675
[Sobbing]

693
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,144
Didn't, uh...

694
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:37,648
didn't you tell me
one time at dinner

695
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:41,618
once, maybe,
about you used to...

696
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:45,356
you used to make up
stories about the stars?

697
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:49,226
[Sniffles]
Yeah, that was--

698
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,728
that was, um,

699
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,164
in A-Alaska,

700
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:56,366
under the-- under
the night skies.

701
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:59,903
Yeah, you used to lay
there and look up,

702
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:02,539
yeah, at the stars?

703
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:05,876
Yeah, and you remember I...

704
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,378
I never watched
a TV till I was 17,

705
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:10,880
so there wasn't much
to fuckin' do out there

706
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:13,417
besides walk around
and explore and--

707
00:52:13,451 --> 00:52:15,386
And...

708
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,423
and look up at the stars
and make up stories.

709
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:21,558
Like what?

710
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:27,097
[Sighs] I tell you, Marty,
I've been up in that room

711
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:31,268
looking out those windows every
night here and just thinking...

712
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:39,276
It's just one story.

713
00:52:40,678 --> 00:52:42,779
The oldest.

714
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,283
What's that?

715
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:52,489
Light versus dark.

716
00:52:55,393 --> 00:52:57,327
Well,

717
00:52:57,362 --> 00:53:01,298
I know we ain't
in Alaska, but...

718
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:06,070
appears to me that the dark
has a lot more territory.

719
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:11,908
Yeah.

720
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:15,145
You're right about that.

721
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:19,015
[Grunts]

722
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,518
Hey, listen, hey.

723
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:22,952
Yeah, what?

724
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:25,955
Why don't you point me in the
direction of the car, man?

725
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,993
I've spent enough of my
fuckin' life in hospitals.

726
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:33,530
Jesus. Oh.
You know what?

727
00:53:33,565 --> 00:53:35,499
I'd protest,

728
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:39,002
but it occurs to me
that you're unkillable.

729
00:53:39,036 --> 00:53:41,471
You want to go back,
get clothes or anything?

730
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:45,676
No, anything I left back
there, I don't need.

731
00:53:50,515 --> 00:53:55,552
You know, you're looking at it wrong,
the... sky thing.

732
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:59,022
How is that?

733
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:02,626
Well, once,
there was only dark.

734
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:08,031
If you ask me,
the light's winning.
