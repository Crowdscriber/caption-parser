Sync'd by Mothman

1
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,776
WMD. Got that WMD here.

2
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:29,777
I'm looking for what you had the other day.

3
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:33,077
-This shit right here?
-The other day you was calling it bin Laden.

4
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:36,778
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.

5
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,678
So this the hi-test?

6
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:40,678
Same shit, new name.

7
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,679
You be all right.

8
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:00,382
Okay, get dressed.

9
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:03,082
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.

10
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:05,283
And don't forget that book bag neither.

11
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:10,784
You got your chrome, young one?

12
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:16,585
I'll take mine.

13
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:23,086
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?

14
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:24,286
Let's go.

15
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:34,488
They coming up the alley!

16
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,489
They coming back!

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,190
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?

18
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,691
Slide up.

19
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,892
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?

20
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,093
-You hear me, boy?
-Okay, Mama.

21
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:02,193
Come on!

22
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:03,593
Fuck!

23
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,195
Shit!

24
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,996
-Why you running?
-What the fuck?

25
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,196
Oh, shit!

26
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:20,697
Hit that nigger cold.

27
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:22,698
Bitches!

28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,900
Why you hiding?

29
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:59,004
Drama done with, boy.

30
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,405
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.

31
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,406
Get in, damn it!

32
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,907
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.

33
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:21,908
Get your bags and get yourself to school.

34
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,509
I told you, you gotta get ready....

35
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:42,912
No!

36
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,232
They're changing up?

37
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:33,733
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?

38
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:36,233
-That shipment is tomorrow.
-Got it.

39
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,333
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.

40
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:42,634
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.

41
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,434
Now listen.

42
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:46,335
Pyramid, lnc. May I help you?

43
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:51,036
-You got them Davinas or what?
-I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.

44
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,836
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...

45
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,137
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...

46
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,037
since we followed that truck off the docks.

47
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:01,238
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.

48
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:04,838
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.

49
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:09,539
-We tipped our hand somewhere.
-That second can, maybe.

50
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:13,139
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.

51
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,040
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.

52
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,741
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.

53
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,741
-What?
-They probably changed that up, too.

54
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,442
If they think we're onto them...

55
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:28,843
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.

56
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:31,443
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...

57
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:34,044
-just to see if we pull them up.
-Which we did.

58
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,843
Which I did.

59
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:39,344
No, they're not on us completely.

60
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:42,945
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.

61
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:47,445
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...

62
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:49,546
waiting us out.

63
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:52,547
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.

64
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:59,348
Don't waste film.

65
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:03,648
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.

66
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,749
Anything?

67
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,049
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?

68
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,153
Little late.

69
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:28,253
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...

70
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,654
a district commander would be there
within minutes.

71
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,954
I guess we're living in a brave new world.

72
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,255
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.

73
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,055
D.C.? What for?

74
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:40,256
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...

75
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,256
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.

76
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:45,056
So what do we got?

77
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:47,057
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...

78
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:50,157
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.

79
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,557
-Dead?
-Pronounced at University.

80
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:54,958
-Witnesses?
-No one offering a name...

81
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,959
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.

82
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,759
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.

83
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:03,360
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...

84
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,160
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.

85
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,961
Fucking pointless.

86
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,761
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.

87
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,762
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.

88
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,162
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.

89
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:21,963
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.

90
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,564
You'll feel better when you do.

91
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:29,365
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?

92
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,465
-You said that--
-I said change the name of our product.

93
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,065
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.

94
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,866
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...

95
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,266
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.

96
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,167
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.

97
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,568
Who shot the young one?

98
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,668
I don't know. I don't think it was us.

99
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,969
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean--

100
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:54,869
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.

101
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,369
They got to.

102
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,370
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.

103
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,470
That means the Towers, the low-rises.

104
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,471
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!

105
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,272
I know, String.

106
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,272
I'm sorry, man.

107
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,674
Let me tell you something, man.

108
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:24,174
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...

109
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:25,474
the corner you hold.

110
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,675
You gotta be fierce, I know that.

111
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:32,376
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.

112
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:35,576
Give and take on both sides.

113
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,577
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

114
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:43,378
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...

115
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:45,178
has gotta disappear, you understand me?

116
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,078
I'm not talking about the storm drains.

117
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:51,080
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.

118
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,780
All right.

119
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:05,182
Coming up.

120
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,888
I got people waiting on a package from me...

121
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,689
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police....

122
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:44,990
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.

123
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,490
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.

124
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,991
But, Niko...

125
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:56,991
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.

126
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,192
Why not?

127
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,892
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.

128
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,093
I'm kind of small-time, huh?

129
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:12,094
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.

130
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,595
Call that number.

131
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,396
-Talk to him.
-Mike?

132
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,996
This White Mike?

133
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:27,397
-You know him?
-From Curtis Bay.

134
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:31,498
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.

135
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:35,599
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.

136
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,799
Now, for the rest of our business....

137
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,201
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.

138
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Take them to Newkirk Street.

139
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:51,001
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...

140
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,901
or we will see the police.

141
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:57,502
If not, no more worries.

142
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:00,903
All right.

143
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:07,104
We are off the warehouse phone now?

144
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:10,005
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.

145
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,706
This is bullshit.

146
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:16,506
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?

147
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,208
Five-O!

148
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,609
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.

149
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,411
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!

150
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,612
Come on, keep moving.

151
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:47,911
Get him. Down.

152
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,813
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.

153
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:01,114
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:

154
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,014
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.

155
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:08,516
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Man, I'm clean, you hear me?

156
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:11,516
-What are you doing in the Pit then?
-Saying no to drugs.

157
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:15,516
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."

158
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:20,018
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.

159
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,818
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.

160
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,119
Slide over, asshole.

161
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:29,219
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.

162
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,420
What exactly is it that we're doing?

163
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,921
Young boy killed over bullshit.

164
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,521
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.

165
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,622
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.

166
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:51,323
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.

167
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:54,824
I'll be out there selling that real.

168
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,824
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.

169
00:13:56,924 --> 00:14:01,525
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.

170
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,726
You're Westside.

171
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:06,926
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?

172
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:08,326
No.

173
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:11,027
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.

174
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,928
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.

175
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:17,128
-Sollers?
-Sold heroin like it was water.

176
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,029
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.

177
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,029
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

178
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,130
I know you don't.

179
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,430
And the police don't.

180
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,331
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.

181
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:34,031
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.

182
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:39,432
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.

183
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:44,133
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.

184
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,134
I know. I been there.

185
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,333
But you ain't gotta live by it.

186
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:52,835
Avon's a soldier.

187
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,635
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.

188
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,936
But as far as business go....

189
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,438
-You still got that connect?
-Right off the boat, String.

190
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:10,138
All right.

191
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:13,839
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...

192
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,939
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.

193
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,740
You can have 734, 770 and 221 .

194
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,241
I keep the other three.

195
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:29,141
How you gonna tell it to Avon?

196
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:32,342
It makes sense, don't it?

197
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,743
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.

198
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:39,743
Right?

199
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:51,346
No shit.

200
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,647
-I thought you was in with Nicky.
-Fuck Nick.

201
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:05,948
He said you was his other half.

202
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,848
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.

203
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,549
And fucking drugs are bad, right?

204
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,649
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.

205
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,449
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?

206
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,851
A man can grow.

207
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,151
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.

208
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:24,651
I'm telling you.

209
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,652
You want in?

210
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:32,453
-What do I gotta do?
-What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.

211
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:36,854
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?

212
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:40,154
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.

213
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:47,655
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.

214
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,956
New Charles in the house.

215
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,956
-Moving pretty good.
-Waiting on a prosthetic.

216
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,157
You got a decent lawyer?

217
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:58,058
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.

218
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,458
What's with the duck?

219
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,559
-You know you gotta let go of your name.
-Say what?

220
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,060
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.

221
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,861
Yeah, maybe "Stump."

222
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,060
You know what? "Peg."

223
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,361
"New Peggy."

224
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:20,061
-How about "Tilt"?
-Tilt?

225
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,063
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.

226
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,563
Tilt. I like that.

227
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:37,165
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.

228
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,265
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?

229
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:43,666
-So, this is your first time?
-Yep, first time for me.

230
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,666
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?

231
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,467
-Do you work with the police?
-No. Christ, no.

232
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:54,168
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know....

233
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:57,568
-Where do you live?
-I'm not gonna tell you that.

234
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:00,869
I live out of town.

235
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,269
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.

236
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,470
Thank you.

237
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:12,571
You sucked. I mean, really.

238
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:14,772
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.

239
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:18,473
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?

240
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,575
Hey, fucknuts.

241
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,375
What the fuck is wrong with you?

242
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,077
Christ, Ziggy.

243
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,879
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?

244
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,383
What's up with my cousin?

245
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:15,283
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.

246
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,384
-Drank himself to death.
-Oh, shit.

247
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:26,785
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?

248
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,686
That boy ain't right.

249
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:32,586
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.

250
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,887
La-Z-Boys?

251
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,988
And Davinas. Male and female.

252
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,788
Dope and coke.

253
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:48,889
-What the hell is a Davina?
-It's like a love seat, kind of.

254
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,690
-Any line on weight?
-All whole numbers.

255
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,090
-No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
-Ounces?

256
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,290
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?

257
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,291
Nothing much above five.

258
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:03,691
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.

259
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:07,593
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.

260
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:10,593
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

261
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:11,292
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

262
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,593
-What was coming and going last night?
-Not much.

263
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,094
No trucks in, some cars in and out...

264
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:19,894
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.

265
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:24,196
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.

266
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,596
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.

267
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,996
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.

268
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,297
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...

269
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,497
will get you anywhere else you want to go.

270
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:35,797
All we need is the new number.

271
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:37,898
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?

272
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:40,299
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.

273
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:41,799
Probably going to a cell phone.

274
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:44,899
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cell phone.

275
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,399
Okay, then.

276
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,700
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.

277
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,901
Bunk and Russell, man the other.

278
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,301
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...

279
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,902
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.

280
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:59,702
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.

281
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:01,803
But so far, the people handling the girls...

282
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:03,902
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.

283
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:06,403
So we're gonna need a new angle there.

284
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:07,803
Questions?

285
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,405
What was your play with those girls?

286
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:18,705
Out-of-town salesman.

287
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,906
-How far out of town?
-What do you mean?

288
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,007
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.

289
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,706
Less like a cop you sound.

290
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,007
You do any accents?

291
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:28,207
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?

292
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:29,508
Crikey!

293
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:33,308
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...

294
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:37,908
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.

295
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:40,510
Work on it, son.

296
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,709
$200,000?

297
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,711
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.

298
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:49,811
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.

299
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:52,212
-And then?
-That is all.

300
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:59,713
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.

301
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:01,413
They are cheats.

302
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:04,714
-The chemicals we sent are good, no?
-No complaint.

303
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:06,915
They say they want more, even.

304
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:10,915
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?

305
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:12,415
Right.

306
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:17,316
-And still, they try to chisel.
-Why?

307
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:20,017
What are they thinking?

308
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,917
That it is all profit for us.

309
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:26,118
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...

310
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:29,018
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.

311
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,119
The Greek will be angry.

312
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,419
This is business, Eton.

313
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:38,720
The Greek? He will be smart.

314
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:48,722
Jesus.

315
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,722
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...

316
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:53,823
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.

317
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:55,723
To err is human, that's what I like to say.

318
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:58,123
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.

319
00:22:58,223 --> 00:22:59,523
Said the crime will not stand.

320
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:02,425
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.

321
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:03,825
How about the street talk?

322
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,825
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.

323
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,125
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.

324
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:12,126
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...

325
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:14,126
around one of our interrogation rooms?

326
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,027
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.

327
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:20,927
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?

328
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,929
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.

329
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:31,029
You want in, you gotta deal with me.

330
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,330
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.

331
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,930
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.

332
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,331
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.

333
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:39,531
Nothing stripped.

334
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,931
-Off the docks?
-No shit, off the docks.

335
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:44,832
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?

336
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:46,133
Twenty on the dollar.

337
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:50,533
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.

338
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,133
Or else it ain't worth it for me.

339
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,234
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.

340
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,634
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.

341
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:02,736
A stolen car is a stolen car.

342
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:05,536
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?

343
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:08,737
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...

344
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:11,537
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...

345
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:14,337
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.

346
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:17,038
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...

347
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,438
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...

348
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,839
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.

349
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,240
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.

350
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,241
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...

351
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,442
Stepney and Mersey.

352
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,742
Excuse me?

353
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,942
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...

354
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:43,043
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.

355
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:44,843
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...

356
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:47,844
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.

357
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,244
Good work.

358
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:52,144
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.

359
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,645
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.

360
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:57,445
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.

361
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,646
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.

362
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,147
One other thing.

363
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:07,948
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...

364
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,848
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.

365
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,849
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?

366
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,349
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.

367
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,349
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...

368
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,949
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?

369
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,050
So what? You do that to everybody.

370
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:27,051
This is George Glekas.

371
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:31,451
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.

372
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:35,753
Run his ass, too.

373
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,454
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?

374
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:43,554
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...

375
00:25:43,654 --> 00:25:45,655
is gonna suspect an inside job.

376
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,754
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...

377
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,855
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...

378
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,855
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.

379
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:53,955
Why bother?

380
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:57,057
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.

381
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,956
That ain't the plan.

382
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,058
I just saw a can disappear.

383
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:09,559
-Talco line?
-Pakusa working it?

384
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,559
-It's him. Do we try to follow?
-We know where it's going, right?

385
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,260
1 2-08, you copy?

386
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,461
1 2-08, what's up?

387
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,861
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.

388
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:26,262
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...

389
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:30,462
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.

390
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:34,464
-What do you want us to do with it?
-See if it arrives.

391
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,164
And if it does?

392
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,264
See what happens then.

393
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,465
You wanna know something, Carv?

394
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:47,266
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...

395
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:49,365
we're not really respected.

396
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,966
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.

397
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,467
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.

398
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,068
Who do I tell?

399
00:26:57,368 --> 00:27:01,168
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.

400
00:27:01,268 --> 00:27:03,168
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.

401
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,969
You piss them off, you ride the boat.

402
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,069
Here...

403
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:09,569
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...

404
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,470
to some fucking dustbowl
lndian res in Arkansas.

405
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,671
-Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
-Fuck it.

406
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:16,871
What you got there, brother?

407
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:23,172
White boys. A different look for you.

408
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:27,072
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?

409
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:29,473
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.

410
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:32,574
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.

411
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,076
You said Customs had intel on him?

412
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,476
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.

413
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:53,578
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.

414
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:54,878
Got something out of San Diego.

415
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:56,878
-On Glekas?
-We'll see.

416
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,480
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...

417
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.

418
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,981
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.

419
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:13,281
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.

420
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:15,182
Agent Koutris?

421
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:16,982
Not much to it.

422
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:21,283
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.

423
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,683
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.

424
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:29,084
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.

425
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:32,885
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.

426
00:28:33,985 --> 00:28:35,186
All right.

427
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,786
If you need it, let me know.

428
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:05,291
We need to talk.

429
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:15,793
Anyone following?

430
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:31,495
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.

431
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:33,996
-All week I've done it. Nothing.
-Again.

432
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,997
The truck is here.

433
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:42,998
Lester, it's here.

434
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,298
They offload anything?

435
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:46,699
Not yet.

436
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:48,499
Okay, wait on it.

437
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:54,500
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.

438
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,801
You are.

439
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,101
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.

440
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,101
He doesn't think so.

441
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,802
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.

442
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,302
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.

443
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:09,803
We know what happened.

444
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:13,703
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.

445
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:22,205
Where that lawyer at, man?

446
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:31,506
See, you just fucked up.

447
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:34,507
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?

448
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:38,208
That's you, right there, fucking up.

449
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,910
-I don't know what you talking about.
-No, you fucked up.

450
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,911
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.

451
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,311
Which one?

452
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,913
That's you right there.

453
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:11,214
Lawyer.

454
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:15,314
They were asking about me?

455
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:18,515
San Diego.

456
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:22,216
San Diego was a long time ago.

457
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,917
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.

458
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,117
Only that the people asked.

459
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:31,418
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.

460
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:32,818
They were.

461
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:34,318
No FBl.

462
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,118
We've been running only clean containers?

463
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:41,919
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.

464
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,020
No one stops anything.

465
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,921
And we changed the warehouse phone?

466
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,021
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.

467
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:56,622
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.

468
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:01,023
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?

469
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,623
Fair is fair.

470
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:04,924
The Colombians, I think.

471
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,424
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.

472
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:11,825
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.

473
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:16,526
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.

474
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:22,527
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.

475
00:32:22,627 --> 00:32:24,027
They're trash.

476
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,928
The world is a smaller place now.

477
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:34,529
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.

478
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,630
Fair is fair.

479
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,731
Sergei's making a call.

480
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:51,732
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.

481
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:53,632
I will meet you there.

482
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,233
Recognize that voice?

483
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,433
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?

484
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:00,334
-That's the same guy?
-Same guy, new number.

485
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:04,834
-Who you calling?
-Pearlman, at home.

486
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,935
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.

487
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:27,039
Shit is raw, String.

488
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,939
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.

489
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,539
All right.

490
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,740
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...

491
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,341
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.

492
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,641
All right.

493
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:47,442
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.

494
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,043
Start connecting the dots...

495
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:52,343
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.

496
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:55,243
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.

497
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:56,944
FBI didn't have much.

498
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,145
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...

499
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,345
-in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
-San Diego?

500
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:04,746
These guys move around.

501
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:08,047
-What's with the suit?
-Date night.

502
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,647
The undercover at the brothel.

503
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:13,547
Run like hell, ma'am.

504
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:17,148
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.

505
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:18,948
Who's the affiant?

506
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,951
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.

507
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,051
Whatever you need, chief.

508
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,251
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.

509
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,651
Whatever you have.

510
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:40,952
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.

511
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,253
It's a long story.

512
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:48,254
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so....

513
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,254
Listen...

514
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:53,055
you think I can get an advance on this?

515
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:56,555
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.

516
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,156
-I'm just asking.
-Payment on delivery.

517
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:01,857
Don't worry about it, chief.

518
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:05,657
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.

519
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:10,357
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.

520
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:13,458
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.

521
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,359
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.

522
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,359
No, that's not enough.

523
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:21,759
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.

524
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:25,560
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.

525
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,661
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.

526
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,961
But when push come to shove...

527
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:35,362
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...

528
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:38,463
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.

529
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:42,364
-Hold up, String--
-No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.

530
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:44,864
You drive the guns to the water.

531
00:35:44,964 --> 00:35:49,364
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.

532
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,565
In the water.

533
00:35:52,665 --> 00:35:54,066
Splash.

534
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,267
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.

535
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,768
Except you, young one.

536
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:13,869
You ain't say shit back there?

537
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:17,770
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?

538
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,971
And I wiped them shits down myself.

539
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:22,571
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.

540
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:27,872
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?

541
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,873
-All right.
-All right, String.

542
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:39,474
Lock that door.

543
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:49,376
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.

544
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,876
Got two in the window there.

545
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,576
Got two in the window there.

546
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,377
You hung this on a duck?

547
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:58,678
Of course.

548
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:01,478
$1,200.

549
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,579
Fair enough.

550
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,481
-Nick.
-It's been a while, Mikey.

551
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:18,181
Yeah, it has.

552
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:21,081
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.

553
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:22,281
Yeah?

554
00:37:22,582 --> 00:37:23,582
My man called.

555
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,582
Said you was gonna take a re-up from me.

556
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:27,883
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

557
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,883
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.

558
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,984
Who fucking knew?

559
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:36,884
-So how much you looking for?
-Two or three G-packs a week.

560
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:39,485
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.

561
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,085
-Four each.
-Four?

562
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,385
I wholesale for five, man.

563
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:46,086
I don't know.

564
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:49,287
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.

565
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:55,188
Sergei. What up, dawg?

566
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:58,588
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.

567
00:37:58,788 --> 00:37:59,688
Yeah?

568
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:02,489
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.

569
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:04,589
Another thing.

570
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,590
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

571
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,990
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?

572
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,191
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...

573
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,091
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

574
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:19,492
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

575
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:22,493
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

576
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:24,293
Idiot.

577
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:27,994
You got friends in high places, Nicky.

578
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:30,894
-Four a pack for you.
-All right, cool.

579
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:38,895
Thank God for the Russian's cell phone.

580
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:43,097
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.

581
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:46,698
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

582
00:38:46,898 --> 00:38:49,698
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

583
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,501
-What the fuck is that?
-It's a man's purse.

584
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:10,301
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.

585
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,102
Them people ain't right over there.

586
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:16,602
The mike has to go somewhere.

587
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:20,904
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.

588
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:22,604
Indeed I might, luv.

589
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:25,504
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.

590
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:29,205
You want us in, you say.... What was it?

591
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:32,805
"Spot on." It means "exactly."

592
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:36,706
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...

593
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:40,307
then an overt attempt to engage.

594
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:43,808
Spot on.

595
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:46,908
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.

596
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,509
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...

597
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:55,210
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?

598
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,310
Middle Atlantic region probably.

599
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:32,817
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.

600
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:36,018
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.

601
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:38,017
Congratulations, Frank.

602
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:45,119
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?

603
00:41:03,222 --> 00:41:05,323
So, Nat, about the election.

604
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:10,224
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.

605
00:41:10,324 --> 00:41:12,024
That's what I need.

606
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:15,025
Ott's turn, Frank.

607
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,626
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.

608
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,926
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.

609
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:27,827
-Terrorism?
-He needs our help tonight.

610
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,931
1 1-34, what's your 20?

611
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,231
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.

612
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:54,332
Copy that.

613
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:59,832
Okay, we're on here.

614
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,733
Good evening.

615
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:24,537
Paint pigments.

616
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:28,038
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.

617
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,339
It's in there somewhere.

618
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:31,939
Run it.

619
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:04,245
Same consistencies on all the barrels.

620
00:43:04,944 --> 00:43:06,644
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

621
00:43:06,644 --> 00:43:07,645
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

622
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,746
-What's going on?
-I don't know nothing, Horse.

623
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:17,047
Swear to God.

624
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:20,447
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.

625
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,151
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.

626
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,852
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...

627
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,852
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.

628
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:46,352
You think so?

629
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:51,553
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?

630
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:55,954
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...

631
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:57,654
and what happened?

632
00:43:58,854 --> 00:44:00,454
He feel for that.

633
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,155
He feel for you.

634
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:06,456
I know he didn't see it coming.

635
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:09,456
-None of us seen it coming.
-I did.

636
00:44:10,757 --> 00:44:12,357
I swear, I saw it.

637
00:44:13,057 --> 00:44:17,458
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?

638
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,458
'Cause we got a weak product...

639
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,559
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.

640
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:27,060
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.

641
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,161
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.

642
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,462
I know.

643
00:44:39,062 --> 00:44:41,362
But them wolves is at that door.

644
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:53,264
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.

645
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:58,766
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.

646
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,066
So I'll talk to him.

647
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,370
Mr. Cromwell.

648
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:32,472
Decisions, decisions.

649
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:37,673
Would it be wrong to take two?

650
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:40,773
Attaboy.

651
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:44,773
We should get upstairs.

652
00:45:48,174 --> 00:45:50,975
Nothing but paint pigments.

653
00:45:51,074 --> 00:45:53,475
Trust me, old friend. It's there.

654
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,478
Son of a bitch!

655
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:27,882
Okay, then.

656
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:31,382
Right.

657
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:35,183
Maybe, we could talk about this first?

658
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:45,685
Any time you guys want.

659
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:47,786
The money changed hands, right?

660
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:49,486
Sounded that way.

661
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:52,686
-And they talked about sex?
-Definitely.

662
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:54,587
Any time you guys want.

663
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,887
Hang on.

664
00:46:57,788 --> 00:46:58,787
Oh, God.

665
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:01,988
Is it soup yet?

666
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:05,088
Spot something. Spot on it.

667
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,288
Let's go.

668
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,591
-Whoa.
-Why?

669
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:17,891
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.

670
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,091
Calm the fuck down.

671
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:22,491
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.

672
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:28,593
-Who is it?
-Baltimore police.

673
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:32,194
-What do you want?
-To lock your ass up.

674
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:40,495
Hands. Let me see them.

675
00:47:53,298 --> 00:47:55,998
-Two more in the back.
-Come on, ladies.

676
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,001
You're late.

677
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:19,002
He okay?

678
00:48:20,302 --> 00:48:21,602
He'll live.

679
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:29,004
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms
ofprocessed crack cocaine...

680
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:32,405
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.

681
00:48:32,604 --> 00:48:35,205
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...

682
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:37,106
that their investigation is ongoing...

683
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,205
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...

684
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:42,806
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...

685
00:48:42,906 --> 00:48:45,907
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist--

686
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,307
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.

687
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:56,209
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...

688
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,410
I would die happy.

689
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,810
Our case is progressing.

690
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,710
-Great, what can you charge?
-We're not at that point.

691
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,712
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.

692
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:12,512
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...

693
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:14,713
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.

694
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:18,813
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.

695
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:21,114
And last night, if you check the 24s...

696
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:23,714
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.

697
00:49:23,814 --> 00:49:25,714
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...

698
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:28,314
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.

699
00:49:28,414 --> 00:49:32,215
-You hit a brothel?
-Waterfront condo, high-end.

700
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,016
Jesus.

701
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:38,917
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.

702
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:42,618
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.

703
00:49:44,018 --> 00:49:46,017
Any problems on the raid?

704
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:49,718
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.

705
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:51,619
Immigration is holding the girls.

706
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,220
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.

707
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,420
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?

708
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,721
Not while the taps are up.

709
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:02,320
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

710
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:02,921
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

711
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:06,722
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?

712
00:50:06,822 --> 00:50:09,322
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...

713
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:10,922
then, yeah, we're closer.

714
00:50:11,022 --> 00:50:14,523
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.

715
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,724
What about Frank Sobotka?

716
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:19,524
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.

717
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:21,525
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...

718
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:24,625
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.

719
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:28,026
This is about Frank Sobotka.

720
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,326
The case is bigger now.

721
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:35,427
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.

722
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:40,928
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?

723
00:50:41,028 --> 00:50:43,528
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...

724
00:50:43,628 --> 00:50:45,229
and a chance at the real targets.

725
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:48,729
-He is the real target.
-Patience, Stan.

726
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:53,030
-I'm sure if they bring the case--
-You owe me on this, Erv.

727
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,631
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.

728
00:50:57,331 --> 00:51:00,131
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.

729
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:03,532
Okay.

730
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:06,733
Now the votes are in...

731
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:10,833
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...

732
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:13,034
now you're freezing me out, huh?

733
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:16,334
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.

734
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:19,835
This is my case.

735
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:21,435
Mine!

736
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:25,136
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?

737
00:51:26,136 --> 00:51:28,637
Not fucking likely.

738
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:38,838
He's saying no.

739
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:42,839
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...

740
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,440
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.

741
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,540
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...

742
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,041
and we might never get out from under.

743
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:54,742
-We don't have the product or the muscle.
-I told him.

744
00:51:55,642 --> 00:51:56,742
I did.

745
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:01,943
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.

746
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:03,743
And for muscle...

747
00:52:03,843 --> 00:52:06,743
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.

748
00:52:08,944 --> 00:52:10,545
Brother Mouzone.

749
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:16,545
He sending in Brother?

750
00:52:17,446 --> 00:52:18,946
From New York.

751
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:23,547
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.

752
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:26,347
-Brother Mouzone?
-Yep.

753
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:35,249
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...

754
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:39,049
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...

755
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:43,351
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."

756
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:47,951
You're famous behind this, you know that?

757
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:51,252
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.

758
00:52:51,352 --> 00:52:53,752
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.

759
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:58,254
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.

760
00:52:58,354 --> 00:53:02,254
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.

761
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:04,855
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.

762
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:08,055
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?

763
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,856
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.

764
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:29,259
You fucking with me, right?

765
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,360
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?

766
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,660
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.

767
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,961
-Played it like that.
-Yeah, and he reached out.

768
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,961
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.

769
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:44,062
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.

770
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:45,861
Deal with how?

771
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:48,563
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...

772
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:51,063
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?

773
00:53:51,163 --> 00:53:55,164
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?

774
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,464
Shit.

775
00:53:56,664 --> 00:53:59,764
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.

776
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:00,864
True.

777
00:54:00,964 --> 00:54:05,465
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.

778
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:08,366
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.

779
00:54:08,466 --> 00:54:11,066
All right, so listen, we got some time here.

780
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:15,367
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...

781
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:18,868
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.

782
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:20,668
And that's like a week or maybe two.

783
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:23,368
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...

784
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,470
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.

785
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:30,370
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.

786
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,570
All right?

787
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,972
1 2-08 to 1 1-37, you there?

788
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:44,373
1 1-37, what you got?

789
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,773
That last truck is on the move.

790
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:49,673
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.

791
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:51,974
-10-4.
-They're testing us.

792
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:54,175
They been moving clean cans.

793
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:09,777
-The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
-No?

794
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:13,978
-Wejust took out the last of it. No problems.
-Okay, then we go.

795
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:17,879
-What about llona?
-She is home. They kept the children.

796
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:20,479
There are always more children.

797
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:26,380
Why don't we tap that cell phone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?

798
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,881
That call might just be our PC.

799
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:34,382
And this here is the little king of everything.

800
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,685
So how many we got in the sector?

801
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:53,785
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...

802
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:56,385
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.

803
00:55:56,485 --> 00:55:58,286
We're on every corner.

804
00:55:59,187 --> 00:56:01,186
Pretty damn quiet today.

805
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:03,987
Today.

806
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:08,888
Let's go.

807
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:53,696
Officer.
