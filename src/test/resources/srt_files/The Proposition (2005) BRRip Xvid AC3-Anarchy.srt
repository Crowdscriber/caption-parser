1
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:07,272
Where's my gun? Fuckin' hell.

2
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,360
Fuck. Fuckin' bastards. Fuckin'...

3
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,949
Come on, you fuck... Argh! Argh!

4
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,951
Mikey, get down. Christ!

5
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,445
Mikey!
Arggh!

6
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,335
I'm hit, Charlie. I'm hit.

7
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,920
You'll be alright, Mikey. Hold strong.

8
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,380
You'll never take me alive,
you bastards.

9
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,973
Argh!

10
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:52,940
Ugh!

11
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,132
Do I need to introduce myself?

12
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:22,551
I know who you are.

13
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,887
Good.

14
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:27,222
I know who you are.

15
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:33,061
My brother's taken a bullet, Stanley,
and is in need of medical attention.

16
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:36,477
Well, allow me to address
the subject of your brother, Mr Burns.

17
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,110
Christmas, as you're probably aware,
is fast approaching.

18
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:47,325
And Christmas this year
will hold a unique significance

19
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,660
for young Micky here.

20
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,534
Mikey.

21
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,332
Because on Christmas Day,

22
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:58,960
I have made plans
that he be taken from the jail in Banyon

23
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,962
and hanged by the neck until he is dead.

24
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:02,839
Charlie.

25
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,050
You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

26
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,343
Well, clearly, Mr Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

27
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:14,600
So what is it that you want?

28
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,178
I want Arthur Burns.

29
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,146
I no longer ride with my brother.

30
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,819
Arggh!

31
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,445
Now, I will allow you
a moment to think about it.

32
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:54,179
What's happening, Charlie?

33
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,764
It's alright, Mikey.

34
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:58,968
It's alright.

35
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:10,187
Australia.

36
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,779
What fresh hell is this?

37
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:21,579
I have kept company
with bad men all my life.

38
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:26,626
I was 22 years
in Her Majesty's land forces.

39
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,837
I've dealt with your type many times.

40
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,663
Touch my brother again and I'll kill you.

41
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,099
Make no mistakes, Mr Burns.

42
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,144
It will be done. I will civilise this place.

43
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:47,267
What the fuck
are you talking about, Stanley?

44
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,403
Listen to me now, Charlie.

45
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:55,946
Don't speak.

46
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,073
Hush, Mikey. You'll be fine.

47
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,659
Hush.

48
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,325
I wish to present you with a proposition.

49
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,547
I know where Arthur Burns is.

50
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,759
It is a godforsaken place.

51
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,980
The blacks won't go there,
nor the trackers.

52
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,889
Not even my own men.

53
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:40,645
I suppose, in time,
the bounty hunters will get him.

54
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:46,243
But I have other plans.

55
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,328
I aim to bring him down.

56
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,871
I aim to show

57
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,957
that he is a man like any other.

58
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:53,875
I aim to hurt him.

59
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,448
When you're ready, sir.

60
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,795
And what will most hurt him?

61
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,344
Hmm.

62
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:08,547
Well, I've thought
long and hard about that.

63
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:13,060
And I have realised, Mr Burns,

64
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,104
that I must become
a little more inventive in my methods.

65
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,613
Now, don't speak, Mr Burns.
Listen to me now.

66
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,653
Don't say a word.

67
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,912
Now, suppose I told you there was a way

68
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,411
to save your little brother
Mikey from the noose.

69
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,750
Suppose I gave you a horse... and a gun.

70
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,592
Suppose, Mr Burns,

71
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,845
I was to give both you
and your young brother, Mikey, here,

72
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,884
a pardon.

73
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:58,394
Suppose I said that I could give you

74
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,980
the chance to expunge the guilt...

75
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,601
...beneath which you so clearly labour.

76
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,940
Suppose I gave you till Christmas.

77
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:13,033
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is I want from you.

78
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,576
Hmm?

79
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,320
You want me to kill my brother.

80
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:19,286
I want you to kill your brother.

81
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:27,964
Arthur Burns is a monster.

82
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:31,425
An abomination.

83
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,933
You were right
to part company with him

84
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,973
and to take Mikey with you.

85
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:47,023
What happened at the Hopkins place
was unforgivable.

86
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:53,279
I have never seen
such a sickening sight.

87
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,615
Did you know that
that poor woman, Eliza Hopkins,

88
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,654
had a child in her belly?

89
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:57,882
Your business
with your brother is unfinished.

90
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,958
You have nine days, Mr Burns.

91
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:12,312
Bring the horses round.

92
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:16,475
Coming now.
Come on. Get that on now.

93
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,052
It's the fucking Burns boy.

94
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,546
Come on. Let's hit 'em.

95
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,295
Got 'em.

96
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:54,550
I fucking got him!

97
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,698
Pigs.

98
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:09,607
Who have you got?

99
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:16,322
Troopers... dismount!

100
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:24,297
The man I have brought in...

101
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,799
...is Mike Burns...

102
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,293
...of the Burns gang.

103
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:37,510
That's one down and two to go,
gentlemen.

104
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:42,397
You've got to
get the other ones now.

105
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:45,682
I will... civilise this land.

106
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,395
Make yourself at home, Mikey.

107
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,947
Good evening to you, Mrs Stanley.

108
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,441
Good evening, Mr Broussard.

109
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:51,835
He's not so fuckin'
dangerous now, is he?

110
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,430
Martha?

111
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:15,860
Good evening, gentlemen.

112
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,278
Evening, Mrs Stanley.

113
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,739
You should... really not come here.

114
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:23,902
Cannot a lady visit her husband
in his place of work?

115
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,715
You men...

116
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:40,209
...you wait outside.

117
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,310
We spoke about
why you shouldn't come here.

118
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,853
This is not appropriate...

119
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:55,011
Morris, you've been gone for three days.

120
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:59,891
It's lonely up there at the house.

121
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:03,321
It's so quiet without you.

122
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,031
Are you coming home now?

123
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,569
Well, I have things to attend to.

124
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:12,538
I'll have Officer Dunn escort you home.

125
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,373
I'll be back soon.

126
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,375
You look terrible, Morris.

127
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,869
Yes.

128
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,838
Yes, I do.

129
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,637
Dunn.

130
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,345
Who is that?

131
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,017
But he's no more than a boy.

132
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,936
He's man enough, ma'am.
He's man enough, indeed.

133
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,893
Enough.

134
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:49,448
Escort Mrs Stanley home
and wait there till I return.

135
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,367
How long will you be, dear?

136
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,861
Later.

137
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,505
Never speak to my wife
about such things again.

138
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,382
Do you understand?
My apologies, Captain.

139
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,927
What happened today on the flats,
that's between you and me.

140
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,762
Of course, sir.

141
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,431
Because there would be consequences
were it to become common knowledge.

142
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,589
Yes.

143
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,863
Eliza Hopkins
was a good Christian woman,

144
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,740
and she was my friend.

145
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,285
I pray to God that her death
was mercifully swift.

146
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:23,537
It was, wasn't it?

147
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:27,700
Martha, can we speak of other things?

148
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,414
Come here, Captain Stanley.

149
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,474
Mmm.

150
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,858
My poor husband.

151
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,076
Oh.

152
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,876
The world you live in in there.

153
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,259
Don't be gloomy, dear.

154
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:32,300
This burden you carry...

155
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,308
...you might let me carry it too.

156
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,360
I believe in you.

157
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,951
Stay down. Stay in bed.

158
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,648
What in God's name...?

159
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,650
Christ, sir...

160
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,523
...l've shot my bloody toes off.

161
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:35,036
There's nothing to see here, Martha.
Go back to bed.

162
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:36,779
Officer Dunn has shot his t...

163
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:40,995
Martha, go back inside.

164
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:50,557
Bloody flies.

165
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:55,320
Kill one and a dozen more
turn up to his funeral.

166
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,196
Ha!

167
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:11,501
Oh, a thousand pardons, my dear man.

168
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:15,172
It appears that I am a little scuppered.

169
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:19,551
Oh, no need for that, sir.
No need for that.

170
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,709
We are white men, you and I.

171
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,848
Permit me to introduce myself.

172
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:28,851
My name is Jellon Lamb.

173
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:31,145
Citizen of the world, you might say.

174
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:32,813
An adventurer.

175
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:38,602
And, if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

176
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:42,030
And you, sir?

177
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,407
By what name
am I honoured to address thee?

178
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:54,249
Of course, a... mere detail.

179
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:57,958
Mere detail.

180
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,758
Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here

181
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:07,596
with no-one but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit for conversation.

182
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:12,559
Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly.

183
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,468
Sit, sir. Drink with me.

184
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:20,525
One more crack about the Irish,
Mr Lamb, and I'll shoot you.

185
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,068
Am I clear?

186
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:24,570
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

187
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,614
Let us drink, then, to the Irish.

188
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:30,991
No finer race of men
have ever... peeled a potato.

189
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:35,205
Do you pray, Mr Lamb?
Good Lord, son.

190
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,124
No, I do not.

191
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:40,293
I was, in days gone by, a believer.

192
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:44,881
But, alas, I came
to this beleaguered land

193
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,920
and the God in me just...

194
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:50,303
...evaporated.

195
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:54,140
Let us change our toast, sir.

196
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,844
To the God who has forgotten us.

197
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:01,897
But first...

198
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,525
...cardinal rule.

199
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:10,230
Never raise a glass with a man
whose name you do not know.

200
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:14,908
My name is Charles Murphy.

201
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,924
Charles, eh?

202
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:32,468
Perhaps you've read

203
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:35,429
'On The Origin Of The Species
By Means Of Natural Selection'

204
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:37,347
by Charles Darwin.

205
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,015
Oh, don't be thrown by the title.

206
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:43,269
He had some most fascinating
things to say.

207
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,063
Chilling things.

208
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:51,027
Mr Darwin spent time
studying Aboriginals.

209
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:55,406
He claims we are, at bottom,

210
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,575
one and the same.

211
00:24:02,913 --> 00:24:06,625
He infers, Mr Murphy,

212
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:11,796
that we share
a common ancestry with monkeys.

213
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,094
Monkeys!

214
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,936
Mr Murphy, Russia, China, the Congo.

215
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:31,898
Oh, I have travelled
among unknown people

216
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:34,568
in lands beyond the seas.

217
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:39,406
But nothing...

218
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,616
...nothing could have prepared me

219
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:44,786
for this godforsaken hole.

220
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:48,617
You see... Mr Murphy...

221
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:54,207
...I am something of a fortune hunter.

222
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:02,135
And what fortune do you hunt
out here, Mr Lamb?

223
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:04,175
That would be my question
to you, Mr Murphy.

224
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,307
Unhand me, Murphy, or I'll slit
your fucking throat.

225
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:22,601
We are white men, sir.

226
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,982
Not beasts.

227
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,551
Ah!

228
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:50,379
He sits up there
in those melancholy hills.

229
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,145
Some say he sleeps in caves
like a beast.

230
00:25:56,145 --> 00:26:00,148
Slumbers deep like the kraken.

231
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:04,486
The blacks say that he's a spirit.

232
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:07,489
The troopers will never catch him.

233
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:11,576
Common force
is meaningless, Mr Murphy,

234
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:17,115
as he squats up there
on his impregnable perch.

235
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:24,077
So I wait, Mr Murphy.

236
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:28,671
I wait... Arggh!

237
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:37,642
Aye, you wait.

238
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:39,681
You wait here, bounty hunter.

239
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,365
Hang him, sir.
Hang him high, sir.

240
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,046
Hail the conquering hero.

241
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,889
What a vile specimen of humanity.

242
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,646
What a little piece of filth.

243
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:38,783
Not really the one that
we're looking for, though, is it, Captain?

244
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,077
In the end, justice will be done.

245
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,537
Mm. Justice.

246
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,036
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

247
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,587
Has he told you where his brothers are?

248
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,839
With due respects, Mr Fletcher,

249
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,924
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work

250
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,548
to be done by policemen.

251
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,212
Hmm.

252
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,388
What a little piece of filth.

253
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:12,815
Still, better than nothing, I suppose.

254
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:15,685
Good evening, Captain.
Good evening.

255
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:26,111
"When?"
Said the moon to the stars in the sky.

256
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:31,279
"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home.

257
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:37,167
"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry.

258
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:42,259
"Him," said the rider, dry as a bone.

259
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:57,399
Me roses are looking lovely.

260
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,190
I got green thumbs, I 'ave.

261
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:02,729
I was just
thinking about England.

262
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,862
Do you not miss it, Martha?

263
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:10,744
There's much to miss.

264
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:13,449
There and here.

265
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:20,162
Let's get rid of that headache.

266
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:25,133
Now... Captain Stanley,

267
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:28,636
eat your breakfast before the flies do.

268
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:37,228
Made by
me own fair 'ands, them eggs.

269
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:39,480
Me eggs
have never tasted so fine, ma'am.

270
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:43,692
You're a good man, Morris.

271
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:46,612
And you're a good woman, Martha.

272
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:52,617
Do we have company?

273
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:54,661
Yes, I'm afraid we do.

274
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,827
Captain!

275
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,258
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, sir.

276
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,602
Martha, would you excuse us?

277
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:22,937
It's fine, Morris.
No, Martha, please.

278
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,847
This is police business.

279
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:36,367
How dare you come
to my house in that state?

280
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,244
Sir.
What exactly do you want?

281
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:41,538
We just got back from
the Arooka Ranges, sir.

282
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,625
We rounded up six rebel blacks, sir.
Sean killed one.

283
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,877
Thought you'd want to know
about it straightaway.

284
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,509
Captain?

285
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:57,332
Captain?

286
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,518
No, leave the door open.
It's rank in here.

287
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,012
Yes, sir.

288
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:10,732
Are you sure you've put enough iron
on these men, Sergeant?

289
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:14,027
They have been
adequately secured, sir.

290
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,613
Jacko, get over here.
Yes, Captain, sir.

291
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:20,367
Ask them how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

292
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:25,655
He says they very tired.

293
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,001
Well, you'll have a nice long rest

294
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:33,671
if you don't open your fuckin' mouths
and start yapping, you black bastards.

295
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,916
Sergeant.

296
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:38,050
Wait outside.

297
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,968
Wait outside the door.

298
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:42,008
I'll call you if and when I need you.

299
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:55,024
Ask them again

300
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:58,393
how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

301
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,829
Captain, sir, he said
they don't hide in the ranges,

302
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,372
they live in the ranges.

303
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:13,417
Then ask him how long
they have lived in the ranges.

304
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:16,501
Them always been living
in the ranges, Captain, sir.

305
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:22,759
Ask him if they've seen
a white man up there.

306
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,214
Yes, Captain, sir. I'll ask them.
Mm.

307
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:39,775
They seen white man.
White man catches them.

308
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,651
Jesus Christ.

309
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,229
I don't mean the police.

310
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,571
This... this man.

311
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:51,619
This man. A man with this man.

312
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,113
A white man.

313
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,290
This man. This man.

314
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,421
Ask him.

315
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:07,509
Fella in the picture...

316
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,428
...he live in a cave.

317
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:11,054
Dog man.

318
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:12,597
Big fella.

319
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:17,477
He said dog man never sleep.
He sit there all day.

320
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:21,230
Sit down in a cave. Way up.

321
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,682
He live with small fella... and black fella.

322
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:28,612
Cannot catch him. Cannot kill him.

323
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:30,864
He's dog.

324
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:33,492
What, he eats dog?

325
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,869
No, Captain, sir. He is dog.

326
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:38,580
He changed to dog.

327
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,998
He grows hair.

328
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,626
He grow teeth. Sharp.

329
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,211
And he grows a tail, this way.

330
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,754
Long.

331
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:50,216
And he stand with two leg, like this.

332
00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:53,344
And he goes...

333
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:59,808
Sergeant.

334
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,848
Sergeant!

335
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:08,848
"When?"
Said the moon to the stars in the sky.

336
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,395
"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home.

337
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,451
"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry.

338
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:26,750
"Me," said the rider, dry as a bone.

339
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,997
"How?" said the sun
that melted the ground.

340
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,668
"Why?" said the river that refused to run.

341
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,264
"Where?" said the thunder
without a sound.

342
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:48,644
"Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun.

343
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:05,745
The captain is weak, a weak man.

344
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:09,708
Oh, so you reckon he's weak,
eh, Lawrence?

345
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,251
Fuck off, Cox.

346
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,919
Come out here
to sort out the niggers.

347
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,796
Fuck me, he's done nothing.

348
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:17,340
These black bastards,
they're running all over us.

349
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,634
They chose
the wrong man for the job.

350
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:22,720
This isn't London. It's not England.

351
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,263
This is fuckin' Australia.

352
00:35:25,806 --> 00:35:29,518
Did I say I wanted to fuck
the captain's wife?

353
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,020
Will you go back to sleep, Paul?
For gawd's sake.

354
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,688
I would like to fuck his wife.

355
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:37,025
If I was married to that bucket
of pig's tripe you call a fuckin' wife,

356
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:38,568
I'd want to fuck her too.

357
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,779
"I want to fuck his wife."

358
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:43,448
I want to fuck his wife.

359
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:45,116
 I could fuck her so...
Yeah, alright.

360
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:48,411
We all want to fuck Mrs Stanley.

361
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:52,990
She certainly isn't getting anything
from the good captain, is she?

362
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,794
You know why?

363
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:58,288
Ah, because he's weak.

364
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:02,340
He's got other things on his mind.

365
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,677
Because he really fucked up this time.

366
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:07,512
He got the boy, yeah.

367
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:09,722
He let the other one go.

368
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:11,217
Eh?

369
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:16,835
Fix him right up.

370
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:19,678
Got him good...

371
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:21,930
Got him good medicine.
Fix him no time good.

372
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,933
Gonna need sleep. Gonna need rest.

373
00:38:27,602 --> 00:38:31,147
Don't cry, Daddy.
Blood all gone. Good and clean.

374
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:33,638
 Gonna need sleep.
Gonna need rest.

375
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:36,132
Good afternoon, Mr Broussard.

376
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,810
Remember to save a turkey for me.

377
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,812
Of course, Mrs Stanley.

378
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:43,603
Is everything alright?

379
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:50,612
Go home, you stupid cow.

380
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:52,854
I'm sorry. What did you say?

381
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:58,785
Mrs Stanley... perhaps
you'd better ask your husband.

382
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,126
Oh.

383
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,303
Shut up, dog.

384
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:26,980
Holy mother of mercy.

385
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,731
Look who's raised himself
from the dead.

386
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:31,776
Him much better now.
Him much better because I fixed him.

387
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:33,270
He don't look better to me.

388
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:37,197
You know, Samuel, the thing
I relished the most while I was away

389
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:40,325
was not having to see
your fuckin' face all the time.

390
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:43,245
If it weren't for me and my crack
shooting, you'd be fuckin' dingo dinner.

391
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:46,164
30 yards away, I was, and...

392
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:49,042
Blew that black bastard's head right off.

393
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,710
It was beautiful.

394
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,881
Show a bit of respect
or I might just have to shoot you...

395
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:56,624
...with my new Winchester.

396
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:01,385
Fuck! That hurt!

397
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:06,448
Aw, Charlie.
Go easy there.

398
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:07,942
It's alright, Charlie.

399
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:13,872
Do you want to know
why I've come back?

400
00:43:13,872 --> 00:43:16,279
I know why you've come back, Charlie.

401
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:19,495
Look at that.

402
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:28,469
Be humble of heart, Charlie.
This is the end of things.

403
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:30,221
You're my brother, Charlie.

404
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:31,715
You belong with me.

405
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,100
We are a family.

406
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,974
All of us.

407
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:39,604
Yeah, I was just getting reacquainted.

408
00:43:39,604 --> 00:43:41,731
Samuel.

409
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:45,735
Oh, be kind. A little tolerance, Charlie.

410
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:47,278
Samuel's a boy.

411
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:48,821
He's a vicious little cretin.

412
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,044
Where's Mikey, Charlie?

413
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:06,255
Mikey stayed behind in Clarence.

414
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:08,710
You left Mikey alone?
He met a girl.

415
00:44:10,926 --> 00:44:13,803
Mikey met a girl?
Aye.

416
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:16,259
Mikey met a girl.

417
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,647
What's her name, Charlie?
Molly.

418
00:44:24,647 --> 00:44:26,524
Molly.

419
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:29,026
Molly O'Boyle.

420
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:30,520
Molly O'Boyle.

421
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:36,450
A red-headed colleen, no doubt.

422
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,326
Aye. Red.

423
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:40,283
Like the sunset.

424
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:42,865
Like the sunset.

425
00:44:57,553 --> 00:45:00,764
What does she do,
this... Molly O'Boyle?

426
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:06,436
I'm feeling a bit tired right now, Arthur.

427
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:09,022
Is she a farmer's daughter?
Can she cook a good lamb stew?

428
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:10,516
Would you stop it?

429
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:23,119
Mikey's not
the same stuff as us.

430
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,574
We'll be flung to the depths, you and I.

431
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,373
He worships you, you know.

432
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,206
There was a time
we both did.

433
00:45:42,345 --> 00:45:45,056
Mikey deserves better.

434
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:47,926
You were right to leave -
take him with you.

435
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,104
I need to rest.

436
00:45:52,104 --> 00:45:54,565
Mary O'Boyle.

437
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:56,942
Molly, Arthur. Molly.

438
00:45:56,942 --> 00:46:00,062
Molly. Molly. Right. Molly.

439
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:31,885
Mikey, Mikey.

440
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,709
Only five more days to go, Mikey.

441
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:17,634
Martha.

442
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,014
Martha.

443
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:26,068
When Sergeant Lawrence said...

444
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:30,528
...that the boy that you are holding
at the lock-up was man enough...

445
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,617
...what did he mean by that?

446
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,829
Sergeant Lawrence is an ignorant thug
with the moral fortitude of a snake.

447
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,456
Just disregard...
What did he mean?

448
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,500
What did the boy do?

449
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,043
He's a member of the Burns gang.

450
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:46,128
There are certain things
a woman should not be privy...

451
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:47,797
I know that. I asked you a question.

452
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,673
I asked you not to visit me at work.

453
00:47:49,673 --> 00:47:51,383
Tell me what he did to Eliza.
Enough.

454
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:54,254
She was my friend!
Enough!

455
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:58,221
That's enough.

456
00:48:01,935 --> 00:48:04,556
Headache, Captain Stanley?

457
00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:15,152
So, what can I do for you, Mr Fletcher?

458
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:26,583
Word has it that your men captured
half a dozen rebel blacks two days ago,

459
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,622
and that one was shot in the process.

460
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:33,419
Do you have a problem with that?

461
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:36,551
Yes, Captain, I do.

462
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:39,011
Word came this morning
from Eight Mile Creek

463
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:41,681
that Dan O'Reilly's place was attacked.

464
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,265
Are you sure it was blacks?

465
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:45,351
Dan O'Reilly had so many spears in him

466
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:49,135
that he resembled your good old
garden variety English hedgehog.

467
00:48:50,481 --> 00:48:52,316
It's simple, Captain.

468
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:55,068
It's called the law of reciprocity.

469
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:59,197
Kill one of them and they're
going to kill one of ours.

470
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:04,077
Do the job I brought you
here to do, hmm?

471
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:06,329
If you have to kill one,

472
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:08,617
make sure you bloody well kill them all.

473
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:11,788
Well, I'll send some troopers out today.

474
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:19,671
Well, is our business here finished?

475
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:23,178
I'm going to have Mike Burns flogged.

476
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:25,263
What?
100 lashes.

477
00:49:30,393 --> 00:49:31,936
Martha.

478
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,771
Thank you.

479
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:36,143
I thought you gentlemen
might like a little tea.

480
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:38,727
Please, sit down.

481
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:43,524
Thank you, Martha.
That would be lovely.

482
00:49:47,076 --> 00:49:48,570
Thank you, Martha.

483
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,054
Is there anything else I can get you?

484
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:10,627
No, thank you, Martha. This is lovely.

485
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:16,391
Well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

486
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:34,578
A clever and well-bred woman,
your wife.

487
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,572
You did well for yourself, Captain.

488
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:45,756
Word has it...

489
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:47,795
...that you had Charlie Burns.

490
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,135
And you let him go.

491
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,267
Word has it... that you offered him
some kind of deal.

492
00:50:57,267 --> 00:50:59,306
Tell me this isn't so, Captain.

493
00:51:00,436 --> 00:51:02,522
Word has it
that you promised

494
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:05,858
those animals who raped
Eliza Hopkins a pardon

495
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:08,194
if Charlie Burns
brought back his brother.

496
00:51:08,194 --> 00:51:11,572
A pardon for the annihilation
of the Hopkins family.

497
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:14,658
Are you completely out of your mind?

498
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:17,494
Listen to me.
Mike Burns is a simpleton.

499
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:20,288
He spends all day in his cell,
crying like a child.

500
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:23,124
It is my belief that he is
not responsible for his actions.

501
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:26,294
I'm not interested in
your beliefs, Captain Stanley.

502
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,463
Who do you think you are?
The judge and jury?

503
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,465
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

504
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,801
It is he who is responsible
for this outrage.

505
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:37,847
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

506
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:40,088
to protect his younger brother Mike.

507
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,478
So all we need do now is wait.

508
00:51:44,478 --> 00:51:46,688
Wait?

509
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:49,357
My God, man. They raped a woman.

510
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,144
Tomorrow morning,
I want Mike Burns flogged.

511
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:58,157
As I said, 100 lashes.

512
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,368
This will kill him.
So be it.

513
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,745
But what if I'm right?

514
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:07,208
What if Charlie Burns does as I ask?
What if he comes back?

515
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,496
Then we will hang the lot of them.

516
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,253
Good day.

517
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,679
Martha.

518
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:32,106
Martha. Stay here.

519
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:34,976
Do not let anyone in.
I shall return tomorrow.

520
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:39,321
Martha! Do you hear me?

521
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,112
Please. Stay here.

522
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,656
What's going on in here?

523
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,169
I believe Officer Davenport
and Officer Matthews

524
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:40,712
were entertaining the prisoner, sir.

525
00:53:40,712 --> 00:53:43,423
Is that right, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.

526
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:46,009
Well, I've got a job for you.
Yes, sir.

527
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:47,969
You have unfinished business
in the Arooka Ranges.

528
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:50,096
Sir.
Rebel blacks, Sergeant.

529
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:53,349
Within two hours,
you must find Jacko...

530
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:57,937
...and recruit some more troopers

531
00:53:57,937 --> 00:53:59,431
and depart.

532
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,188
You fucking snake.

533
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:11,867
Why are you still standing there?

534
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:14,025
You've been dismissed.

535
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,953
Where's Charlie, Mr Stanley?

536
00:54:27,757 --> 00:54:30,134
I don't know, son.

537
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,628
I don't know.

538
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,973
Captain?

539
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:03,496
Captain?

540
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:20,720
Bring him out, Stanley!
Bring him out, Captain!

541
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:39,491
Michael Burns.

542
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:41,567
Let's see him, Stanley!

543
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,369
Give him to us, Stanley!

544
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:53,671
Bring him out, Stanley.

545
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:56,422
Stand aside, Stanley.

546
00:55:57,675 --> 00:55:59,252
We want justice.

547
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:07,851
I'll shoot...

548
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:12,313
...the first person
who lays hands on Mike Burns.

549
00:56:12,313 --> 00:56:13,807
Give him to us.

550
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:21,562
He'll sort it.

551
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,577
You heard me.

552
00:56:26,577 --> 00:56:28,700
You move, I'll shoot you dead.

553
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:33,205
Are you going to shoot
your wife as well, Captain?

554
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:39,339
Martha?

555
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:43,343
She was with child, for God's sake.

556
00:56:43,343 --> 00:56:46,676
Martha, if this flogging goes ahead...

557
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:52,852
...it will be our death sentence.

558
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:55,177
What if it had been me?

559
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,583
Come on,
you fuckin' nasty...

560
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:19,418
Captain Stanley?

561
00:57:19,418 --> 00:57:21,462
Help me!
Get up, Mikey!

562
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:23,088
Get it over and bloody done with!

563
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:27,384
Go on! Go on. Get up.
Stop it!

564
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:29,928
Get off me!

565
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:32,681
Now stay still.

566
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:34,432
My good people...
Stay still!

567
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:39,395
...before you stands

568
00:57:39,395 --> 00:57:42,774
one of the vilest,
most bloodthirsty villains

569
00:57:42,774 --> 00:57:45,776
this country has ever seen.

570
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:47,445
Rapist.

571
00:57:47,445 --> 00:57:50,489
Looter. Murderer.

572
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:52,825
His crimes are
of the most heinous kind.

573
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:56,620
Before the year is out,
this man will hang.

574
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,413
Today, he will be flogged.

575
00:57:58,413 --> 00:57:59,956
A message to all

576
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:03,752
who would dare transgress
the laws of this land.

577
00:58:03,752 --> 00:58:05,545
100 lashes.
 Please.

578
00:58:05,545 --> 00:58:07,005
Proceed.

579
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:09,173
One!
Please!

580
00:58:09,173 --> 00:58:10,800
Arggh!

581
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,915
Two!

582
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:16,347
Three!

583
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:17,389
Please!

584
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:19,678
Arggh!

585
01:00:36,521 --> 01:00:39,142
He could shame a nightingale.

586
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:52,324
Thirty-eight.

587
01:00:54,871 --> 01:00:56,828
Thirty-nine.

588
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,290
Go on.

589
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,569
Your days are over, Captain Stanley.

590
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,876
Martha.

591
01:01:47,212 --> 01:01:48,706
Come on.

592
01:03:34,605 --> 01:03:37,191
Martha, you must eat.

593
01:03:37,191 --> 01:03:39,230
Tobey's made you some soup.

594
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:56,076
Here you go.

595
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,915
This is good.

596
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,554
You must eat something,
Martha, please.

597
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,306
No.

598
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,770
No.

599
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,241
I'm so sorry.

600
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,335
Forgive me, please.

601
01:04:42,335 --> 01:04:44,375
I just wanted to protect you.

602
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:48,624
I had an idea about justice and...

603
01:04:50,385 --> 01:04:52,424
...for the town, for the country...

604
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:55,048
...for you.

605
01:04:56,474 --> 01:04:57,968
For you.

606
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:01,721
And now...

607
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:05,725
...I don't know.

608
01:05:07,693 --> 01:05:09,151
Hey, quit pissing down my leg.

609
01:05:09,194 --> 01:05:11,112
Well, find your own fuckin' tree.

610
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:12,989
What do you need a fuckin' tree for?

611
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:14,699
Just piss out there, not on me.

612
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:16,451
Fuck off. You pissed on me, you idiot.

613
01:05:16,451 --> 01:05:19,620
Strange mob... you whities.

614
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,747
Mm.

615
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:28,712
Good news.

616
01:05:28,712 --> 01:05:30,207
Sergeant Laurie...

617
01:05:31,715 --> 01:05:33,258
...over there.

618
01:05:33,258 --> 01:05:34,968
What?

619
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:36,511
Where?

620
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,805
See it?

621
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:40,299
Hard to see it.

622
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:43,143
At foot of the ranges.

623
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:45,270
What? I can't see a bloody thing.

624
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,813
There.

625
01:05:46,813 --> 01:05:48,307
What?

626
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,895
Smoke.

627
01:06:10,418 --> 01:06:11,912
Love.

628
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:14,707
Love is the key.

629
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:18,632
Love and family.

630
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:24,682
For what are night and day -

631
01:06:24,682 --> 01:06:28,477
the sun, the moon, the stars -

632
01:06:28,477 --> 01:06:29,971
without love...

633
01:06:31,605 --> 01:06:33,644
...and those you love around you?

634
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:40,113
What could be more hollow...

635
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:43,616
...than to die alone... unloved?

636
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,412
What the fuck was that?

637
01:06:47,412 --> 01:06:49,872
Fuckin' trooper's rifle... 450s.

638
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,500
Shooting blacks.
Be calm, Samuel.

639
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,658
The shots are miles away.

640
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:22,543
Burn it.

641
01:08:22,543 --> 01:08:25,294
Burn the fuckin' lot.

642
01:08:27,256 --> 01:08:28,798
Don't stand there moping.

643
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:32,844
What are you doing?

644
01:08:32,844 --> 01:08:35,596
Burn everything!

645
01:08:41,394 --> 01:08:43,636
Molly O'Boyle, my arse.

646
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:21,338
Who the fuck left Danny Boy
out in the sun?

647
01:09:27,854 --> 01:09:30,565
Hey, Jacko, you lazy bugger.

648
01:09:30,565 --> 01:09:33,485
I told you to bury that bastard last night.

649
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:36,821
He stinks worse than you.

650
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:38,315
Jacko.

651
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:44,453
You got the wrong fuckin' black man.

652
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:45,996
Slowly now, Sergeant.

653
01:09:45,996 --> 01:09:49,330
Put your privates back in your pants
and turn around.

654
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:56,840
Come to steal my brother a horse
and we find ourselves a copper.

655
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,093
You fire that gun,
you'll have eight more all over you.

656
01:10:00,093 --> 01:10:01,587
Fair enough.

657
01:10:06,474 --> 01:10:09,560
Step into the shade, Sergeant.

658
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,885
To the back.

659
01:10:18,902 --> 01:10:21,113
Has... has Charlie found you, then?

660
01:10:21,113 --> 01:10:23,407
Stanley's little mate.

661
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:24,901
Over there.

662
01:10:26,243 --> 01:10:27,786
By the straw.

663
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:29,454
Good boy.

664
01:10:29,454 --> 01:10:33,583
That's right.
Stay. Lay down, Sergeant.

665
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,501
Hey, hey. Whoa. Come here.
Lie down.

666
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:38,087
I know something you don't know.

667
01:10:38,087 --> 01:10:41,549
Hush now, Sergeant.
Whoa, whoa.

668
01:10:41,549 --> 01:10:43,717
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
Hush.

669
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:45,427
Your brother's come to kill you.

670
01:10:45,427 --> 01:10:49,128
I can help.
You can help me?

671
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:53,101
Help... your... fuckin'... self.

672
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:54,686
Steady. Come on.

673
01:10:54,686 --> 01:10:56,438
Help... your... fuckin'... self.

674
01:10:56,438 --> 01:11:00,692
Help... your... fuckin'... self...

675
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:02,980
... copper.

676
01:11:12,036 --> 01:11:14,075
Here's your knife back, you dog.

677
01:11:24,839 --> 01:11:26,879
There's something
I want to tell you.

678
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:33,344
I've been having a dream...
most nights.

679
01:11:34,432 --> 01:11:36,475
I've kept it from you.

680
01:11:36,475 --> 01:11:38,515
But I don't suppose it matters now.

681
01:11:40,521 --> 01:11:42,015
I'm in a room.

682
01:11:43,148 --> 01:11:44,817
It's our bedroom, I think.

683
01:11:44,817 --> 01:11:46,818
And...

684
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:48,776
...l'm searching for something.

685
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:54,951
And then suddenly...
I feel a presence in the room and...

686
01:11:54,951 --> 01:11:57,407
...I stand up and I turn around...

687
01:11:58,872 --> 01:12:03,126
...and there in the doorway
is Eliza Hopkins.

688
01:12:03,126 --> 01:12:05,419
And she looks frightful.

689
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:11,050
Her... her dress is all...
creased and torn...

690
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:15,053
...and covered in blood, and her face, too.

691
01:12:15,053 --> 01:12:18,140
All battered and bruised
and splashed with blood.

692
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:21,184
Martha...
But listen to this.

693
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:23,687
In her arms... she's holding something.

694
01:12:23,687 --> 01:12:27,269
I... I... I can't see what it is...

695
01:12:29,275 --> 01:12:31,683
...because it's covered by her hair.

696
01:12:33,154 --> 01:12:35,479
And then she walks towards me.

697
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:38,485
Very slowly.

698
01:12:41,036 --> 01:12:42,530
And...

699
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:46,613
...she hands me a tiny bundle.

700
01:12:49,753 --> 01:12:51,626
And I look down...

701
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:56,627
...and I see that it's a baby.

702
01:12:58,386 --> 01:12:59,880
A newborn.

703
01:13:02,098 --> 01:13:05,431
And this baby...
Oh, it's a beautiful baby, Morris.

704
01:13:07,728 --> 01:13:11,356
And it... it opens its eyes.

705
01:13:11,356 --> 01:13:15,319
And then... I feel a pressure on my hand

706
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:17,362
and I look down and I see

707
01:13:17,362 --> 01:13:21,449
that the baby has taken hold of my finger

708
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:24,485
and it's squeezing it tight in its tiny fist.

709
01:13:29,665 --> 01:13:31,705
Then I wake up.

710
01:13:39,258 --> 01:13:41,760
But after I wake, it's...

711
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,054
...it's the strangest thing.

712
01:13:44,054 --> 01:13:48,183
I can still feel...
I can still feel the pressure

713
01:13:48,183 --> 01:13:50,226
of that dream baby's hand

714
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,349
on my finger.

715
01:13:56,524 --> 01:13:58,600
What do you think of that?

716
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:14,958
That's the boy. Argh! Good boy.

717
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:19,914
Nice and tight, eh? Right.

718
01:14:21,172 --> 01:14:23,414
Up we get.

719
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:27,512
Oh, no. I wouldn't try that if I were you.

720
01:14:27,512 --> 01:14:30,596
Ligatures and knots
are one of my many talents.

721
01:14:37,187 --> 01:14:39,856
And it appears
that you are singularly bereft

722
01:14:39,856 --> 01:14:43,110
in any talents whatsoever, Mr Burns.

723
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:47,781
To be speared by a savage.

724
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:51,031
How extraordinarily quaint.

725
01:14:52,952 --> 01:14:56,155
Easy, Mr Burns.

726
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,043
I was drunk.

727
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,254
You only got me because I was drunk.

728
01:15:03,254 --> 01:15:07,037
Well, I'm not drunk now.
I'm on the job now.

729
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:10,761
Not a bad day's work either.

730
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:16,099
What is an Irishman...
but a nigger turned inside out?

731
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,851
Now...

732
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:21,020
We're going to sit down...
Charlie!

733
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,939
On this log.

734
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:26,525
Nice and easy, Mr Burns.

735
01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:28,903
There.

736
01:15:47,045 --> 01:15:49,589
I really should stop saving
your life, brother Charlie.

737
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:51,795
Come on! Come on!

738
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:54,844
All things considered.

739
01:15:54,844 --> 01:15:59,014
"There's night and day, brother.

740
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:02,059
"Both sweet things.

741
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:07,682
"Sun and moon and stars,
all sweet things.

742
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:14,317
"Likewise... there's a wind on the heath.

743
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:19,200
"Life is very...

744
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,952
"...sweet, brother..."

745
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:28,042
"Life is very sweet... brother.

746
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,670
"Who would wish to die?"

747
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,255
George Borrow, I believe.

748
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,760
A worthy writer.

749
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,262
And a beautiful sentiment, sir.

750
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:44,345
But you're not my brother.

751
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:57,352
Finish him.

752
01:16:58,529 --> 01:17:00,936
Oh, dear.

753
01:17:05,702 --> 01:17:08,371
This may hurt.

754
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:11,291
Arggh!

755
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:16,045
Arggghhh!

756
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,692
Why can't you ever just...

757
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:40,186
...stop me?

758
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:48,357
They're hanging Mikey
come Christmas Day.

759
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:52,163
When's Christmas, Charlie?

760
01:17:52,163 --> 01:17:54,331
I have some riding to do.

761
01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:55,909
Brother!

762
01:18:13,808 --> 01:18:15,351
Where did you get it?

763
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:17,436
I'm a very resourceful woman.

764
01:18:17,436 --> 01:18:19,230
I never doubted it for a moment.

765
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:20,815
Look real good, missus.

766
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:22,983
Thank you, Tobey.

767
01:18:22,983 --> 01:18:25,474
And...

768
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,574
And look.

769
01:18:45,463 --> 01:18:46,957
Snow.

770
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:55,848
Ho, ho, ho.

771
01:18:55,848 --> 01:18:57,641
Ho, ho, ho.

772
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:04,643
Who is it?
Dr Bantrey.

773
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,154
Are you alone?
Yes.

774
01:19:16,075 --> 01:19:17,569
Then you may come in.

775
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:28,587
It doesn't look good, Morris.
The boy is dying.

776
01:19:28,587 --> 01:19:31,956
Nothing I can... do.

777
01:19:35,844 --> 01:19:38,721
Sure is pretty.
Ah!

778
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,723
You can never get your fill
of nature, Samuel.

779
01:19:40,723 --> 01:19:44,644
To be surrounded by it is to be stilled.
It... it salves the heart.

780
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:48,981
The mountains, the trees,
the endless plains.

781
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:51,025
The moon, the myriad of stars.

782
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:54,027
Every man can be made
quiet and complete.

783
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:57,656
Even the lowliest misanthrope
or the most wretched of sinners.

784
01:19:57,656 --> 01:20:00,533
What's a misanthrope, Arthur?

785
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:03,036
Some bugger who fuckin' hates
every other bugger.

786
01:20:03,036 --> 01:20:05,205
Hey, I didn't ask you,
you black bastard.

787
01:20:05,205 --> 01:20:06,748
He's right, Samuel.

788
01:20:06,748 --> 01:20:08,657
A misanthrope
is one who hates humanity.

789
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:12,920
Is that what we are - misanthropes?

790
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,541
Good Lord, no. We're a family.

791
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:29,694
Best you go now, Tobey.

792
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:43,124
Tobey.

793
01:21:45,632 --> 01:21:48,123
Merry Christmas.

794
01:21:57,227 --> 01:21:58,970
Merry Christmas, Captain.

795
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:32,377
Prisoner coming through!

796
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:36,097
Prisoner coming through!

797
01:22:36,097 --> 01:22:37,723
Stand back, ladies and gentlemen,

798
01:22:37,723 --> 01:22:39,558
this black fella bites!

799
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:42,353
Keep moving,
you murdering bloody bastard!

800
01:22:42,353 --> 01:22:43,937
'Tis the jailhouse for you!

801
01:22:43,937 --> 01:22:46,273
You led us a merry bloody dance
for many days,

802
01:22:46,273 --> 01:22:49,609
but alas for you,
you dirty mongrel, we've got you!

803
01:22:49,609 --> 01:22:51,862
How am I doing?

804
01:22:51,862 --> 01:22:54,187
You're doing just fine, Sergeant Stoat.

805
01:22:57,242 --> 01:23:00,370
Keep moving,
you dusky devil. Don't lag.

806
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:03,623
And keep your lustful eyes
to the ground, you lecherous dog,

807
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:06,540
or I'll whip the filthy
black hide right off you!

808
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:09,246
Good morning, miss.

809
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,312
What's happening?
I don't know.

810
01:23:33,484 --> 01:23:36,362
It must be some of Lawrence's lot.

811
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:39,114
Oh, shit.

812
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:45,412
Mikey. Mikey.

813
01:23:45,412 --> 01:23:47,164
This one's pissed himself.
Help!

814
01:23:47,164 --> 01:23:50,034
Where are the keys,
you bastards?

815
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,327
The fuckin' keys.

816
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:58,257
Please. Oh, God. Oh, please.

817
01:23:58,257 --> 01:23:59,882
Mikey?

818
01:24:01,177 --> 01:24:02,762
Mikey.

819
01:24:02,762 --> 01:24:04,555
Mikey. Mikey.

820
01:24:04,555 --> 01:24:06,265
Will you shut him up, Charlie?

821
01:24:06,265 --> 01:24:08,100
Mikey! Mikey!

822
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,853
Mikey! It's Charlie.

823
01:24:10,853 --> 01:24:11,848
Two Bob.

824
01:24:13,605 --> 01:24:15,148
I think the job's fucking done.

825
01:24:15,148 --> 01:24:16,858
Two Bob, you fuckin' yellow dog.

826
01:24:16,858 --> 01:24:19,569
Come on, sons of bitches, get down.

827
01:24:19,569 --> 01:24:21,237
Arthur!
Arthur!

828
01:24:21,237 --> 01:24:24,324
I'll see you at the good Captain's.
We'll save the best till last.

829
01:24:30,538 --> 01:24:31,831
Get!

830
01:24:31,831 --> 01:24:34,291
Stand back.

831
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:35,785
Get!

832
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:50,401
You look grand, Samuel.

833
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:56,494
Well... we're going visiting.

834
01:25:56,494 --> 01:25:57,988
That's right.

835
01:27:23,117 --> 01:27:27,577
It's all your fault, Charlie.
You should never have left us.

836
01:27:44,387 --> 01:27:45,930
Would you like me to carve?

837
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:48,219
No. No, no, no. I'll carve.

838
01:28:10,912 --> 01:28:13,206
Finest bird I ever 'ad, ma'am.

839
01:28:13,206 --> 01:28:15,910
Made with my own fair 'ands.

840
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,774
Thank you.

841
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:15,932
For what we are about to receive...

842
01:29:15,932 --> 01:29:17,892
...may the Lord make us truly thankful.

843
01:29:17,892 --> 01:29:19,718
Amen.
Amen.

844
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:23,473
Merry Christmas.

845
01:29:25,482 --> 01:29:26,976
Merry Christmas.

846
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:32,525
Mmm!

847
01:29:54,551 --> 01:29:57,095
Guard the woman, Samuel.

848
01:29:57,095 --> 01:29:59,337
Shit.

849
01:30:15,112 --> 01:30:17,531
Move out of your seat again, ma'am,

850
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:20,449
and I'll stick this fork
through your fucking eye.

851
01:30:21,535 --> 01:30:23,078
Shut up.

852
01:30:23,078 --> 01:30:25,284
I said shut up.

853
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,514
It's Christmas.

854
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:20,667
What does that say?

855
01:31:33,478 --> 01:31:36,064
"To my darling wife...

856
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:38,149
"...whom I love so much.

857
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:39,643
"I'm sorry."

858
01:31:42,194 --> 01:31:43,854
Sorry for what?

859
01:31:49,618 --> 01:31:51,112
Oh!

860
01:31:58,126 --> 01:32:01,379
Oh... ma'am...

861
01:32:01,379 --> 01:32:02,922
...they're beautiful.

862
01:32:02,922 --> 01:32:05,716
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

863
01:32:05,716 --> 01:32:07,552
Samuel!
That's us.

864
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,840
Come on.

865
01:32:29,697 --> 01:32:31,908
You won't want to miss this, Captain.

866
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:53,674
Arggh!

867
01:33:05,856 --> 01:33:08,943
Samuel,
sing us Peggy Gordon.

868
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:28,711
Charlie.

869
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:30,505
Just in time.

870
01:33:30,505 --> 01:33:33,424
Mikey's dead.

871
01:33:35,301 --> 01:33:38,095
Listen to that. He sings like a bird.

872
01:33:54,611 --> 01:33:56,402
Oh!

873
01:33:59,907 --> 01:34:01,947
Not the gut, Charlie.

874
01:34:03,828 --> 01:34:06,205
Shit.

875
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:10,910
No more.

876
01:34:58,087 --> 01:35:00,127
I'm going to be with my brother.

877
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:12,482
Ah! You got me, Charlie.

878
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,576
What are you gonna do now?
