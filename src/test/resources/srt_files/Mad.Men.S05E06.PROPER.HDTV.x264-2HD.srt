1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,031
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,744
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

3
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:05,006
They'll knock the door...

4
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:07,628
- What time is it?
- Shut up.

5
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:10,861
- You want it so bad...
- I don't want you!

6
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:15,766
I'm really sorry about that.

7
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:17,012
Please!

8
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:18,316
This is a process.

9
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,942
I just want to be
a part of this place.

10
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:21,629
I think it's on the way up.

11
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:22,913
I got the job.

12
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,441
You don't say...

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,407
I can't stay that long...

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,667
I have to go back and
redo the Heinz speech.

15
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:59,267


16
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,773
Did you eat my pack
of violet candy?

17
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,509
What?

18
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:17,379
It's purple and silver.

19
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:19,749
Don gave it to me
before a presentation once.

20
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:21,884
- No.
- I need it.

21
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,854
- So you'll buy another one.
- That's not the same.

22
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:26,490
Don't be such
a strict catholic.

23
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:28,392
I'll buy one for you
and I'll say a brucha.

24
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,896
How about tonight we go
see that stupid movie

25
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:34,098
about the guy being
hunted in Africa?

26
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:37,168
- "The Naked Prey."
- I don't know, Abe.

27
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:39,437
You're gonna resist the chance
to see Cornel Wilde naked?

28
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,173
I heard he wrestles a boa constrictor.
Sounds pretty dirty.

29
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,075
I can't think beyond
my presentation.

30
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,579
There's always special
circumstances.

31
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,416
That's not true.

32
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:51,252
I've been working
on Heinz for months.

33
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:54,924
You know what you want?
You want to take me to work with you

34
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,794
and stick me in a drawer and
open it whenever you get bored.

35
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:00,998
Fine. You don't want to
see each other anymore?

36
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,068
Jesus!

37
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:06,173
You always want to push the
button on the whole thing.

38
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,107
I come all the way
up here to make love.

39
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:11,646
Half the time you don't want to and then
you just do it to get it over with.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,515
It's just hard when I come
right from work.

41
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,317
I need a second
when I walk in the door.

42
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:18,353
- You sound like my dad.
-  Fine.

43
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,658
We'll go to the movies. I just can't
promise that my mind won't be elsewhere.

44
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,393
Your mind is always elsewhere.

45
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,630
Why are you doing
this right now?

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,935
St men wouldn't even have this conversation.
They'd just leave.

47
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,904
And why would they do that?

48
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:34,541
I'm your boyfriend,
not a focus group.

49
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,777
Have a shitty day.

50
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,084
I don't know.
Can't you make it till Friday?

51
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:46,289
Because today
is not a good day.

52
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:49,193
This conversation went in a circle
and we're back where we started.

53
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:51,194
The answer is no.

54
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,432
Yeah, me, too.

55
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,202
I just had the same
conversation.

56
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,004
No, I think they were different
because yours was private.

57
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,473
Sorry I'm late.

58
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,410
There's no place
to pee in this city.

59
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:04,912
- She just got here.
- Then why are you giving me a hard time?

60
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:08,016
We had the funniest thing
outside our building.

61
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,587
A bunch of students with backpacks
asked us how to get to Broadway.

62
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,123
What's so funny
about that, Jethro?

63
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,027
It's like the campaign.
We could have cast it right there and then.

64
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,896
Mmm.

65
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:21,833
- Megan, can I have a moment?
- Oh, uh, sure.

66
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,935
- She goes to casting now?
- I guess so.

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,638
She's kind of been
my junior on this.

68
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,942
I was buying dinner last night
for this large-breasted girl

69
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:31,411
who calls herself salome,
and she's looking at the menu,

70
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:35,217
ridiculing this Grandma Moses drawing
and she's bas-out funny.

71
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:38,320
But I ignore her
because all I can think of

72
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:41,657
is I'll never be able to draw
as well as a photograph.

73
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:48,299
Oh, thank God.

74
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,535
I couldn't take
one more omen of doom.

75
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,238
I'm sorry. We're gonna have
to miss the presentation.

76
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:55,141
We have to head upstate
for Howard Johnson's.

77
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,476
- Really?
- You're running the show.

78
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,746
How does me sitting there
change anything?

79
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,281
Howard Johnson's, huh?

80
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,851
I love the colors,
the atmosphere,

81
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:06,388
- the clams.
- She's never been to one.

82
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,794
I'm really sorry.

83
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:13,197
No, we have all
your work, I guess.

84
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,567
I'll check in from the road.
Get your stuff.

85
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,577
Um, break a leg.

86
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,782
- Well, that's a disaster.
- Don't listen to him.

87
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,418
That's a vote of confidence.

88
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,353
Give me one of those.

89
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,928
The fire is primal.

90
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:43,033
These kids, they all
come there alone,

91
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,836
and gathered in a circle,
they suddenly feel

92
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,474
included.

93
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,743
They're safe from
whatever is out there

94
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,813
in the night, in the darkness.

95
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:56,150
It's the beans
that brought them together

96
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:59,088
on that cool night
at the end of the summer.

97
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:06,530
"Home is where
the Heinz is."

98
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,134
I wish someone
was eating beans.

99
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,970
That guy is.

100
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:13,805
I did ask for college students.

101
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,675
I know that, Raymond.

102
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,944
And we want you to have
everything you asked for.

103
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:20,380
Well, stop writing down
what I asked for

104
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:22,283
and try to figure out
what I want.

105
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:25,755
Raymond, I saw you
when she was talking.

106
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,057
- You were off somewhere.
- It's very sentimental.

107
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,626
I have that memory.

108
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,696
That's for me.
That's not for kids.

109
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,968
Kids have memories.

110
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,872
And so do the homemakers
who make a home with Heinz.

111
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,774
Raymond, can you see
how passionate she is?

112
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,678
Photography will really capture
the fun on their faces.

113
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:46,882
- And the glow.
- Did Don sign off on this?

114
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,653
Don loves this work.

115
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,989
Maybe Don doesn't understand
what you wanted either.

116
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:53,457
Let's not speak for Don.

117
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,794
I'm sorry. I'm not a word
person like you people.

118
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,296
Sure, you are.

119
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,566
And your words are always
"I don't like it."

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,704
And I think you're right.
We don't understand you.

121
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,873
Because you do like it.

122
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,642
I think you just like fighting.

123
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:08,977
Peggy, you're being
oversensitive.

124
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:12,348
Do you know how often
people come in here

125
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:15,319
and look at work
and feel something?

126
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,588
Almost never.

127
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,424
You have to run with this.

128
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,894
It's young and it's beautiful.

129
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:25,332
And no one else is gonna figure
out how to say that about beans.

130
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,936
Can you believe this girl?

131
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,938
I don't know.

132
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,941
Can you?

133
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,512
Miss, you're lucky
that I have a daughter

134
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:37,380
or I wouldn't be
so understanding.

135
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:40,218
Raymond, they're frustrated,

136
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:42,521
but they're not through.

137
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:45,024
I'm frustrated, too.

138
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:50,264
- It's close, I guess.
- It's damn close.

139
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,233
Why don't just you and I
have dinner tonight?

140
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:55,003
Maybe take in a show?
Take your mind off things?

141
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:57,005
You can try.

142
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,818
<i>I've got to admire you.</i>

143
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:09,789
That was a completely
suicidal move.

144
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,826
Women usually want to please.

145
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,196
Give me sketches
of the talking beans.

146
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,199
I'll write new dialog.

147
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,810
- You're off the business.
- What'd he say?

148
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,846
He said you're off
the business.

149
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,770
Everyone has
somewhere to go today.

150
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,339
I'm going to the movies.

151
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,208
Very good.

152
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:59,025
<i>One of them gave Sam</i>
<i>a first-class scratch.</i>

153
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,227
Not very good-tempered,
are they?

154
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,963
<i>Well, neither are
you when you're hungry.</i>

155
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,632
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>you've fed them.</i>

156
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,602
<i>No, I can't say I have.</i>

157
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,406
<i>You didn't pack any lion's</i>
<i>milk for me before I left.</i>

158
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,677
<i>You didn't ask me.</i>

159
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,448
You're going to get in trouble.

160
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,717
Want some?

161
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,221
Sure.
What the hell.

162
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,431
<i>Come on.</i>

163
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:35,874
- Hello.
- Hi.

164
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,843
<i>But why don't they?</i>

165
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,512
<i>It's at least two days</i>
<i>since they've eaten.</i>

166
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:41,180
- <i>They'll just die.</i>
- <i>Yes, I know.</i>

167
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,584
<i>It must be the formula.</i>
<i>We haven't hit on it yet.</i>

168
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,487
<i>We'll just have try again.</i>

169
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:48,058
<i>Right, back to</i>
<i>the drawing board.</i>

170
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,360
<i>Formula...</i>
- <i>13.</i>

171
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:57,669
<i>Oh, George, I've just been
thinking about the cod-liver oil.</i>

172
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,214
She's not gonna make it
out there on her own.

173
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:08,617
- Shh.
- You've got to keep it down.

174
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:11,387
Okay.

175
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,792
Aren't you worried?

176
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,499
It'll turn out all right.

177
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:37,754
<i>That evening, we suffered
all the agony of parents</i>

178
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,591
<i>whose teenage daughter</i>
<i>is out on her first date.</i>

179
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,361
No.

180
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:47,903
Just watch the movie.

181
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,945
<i>We returned the next day</i>
<i>only to find Elsa</i>

182
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:57,580
<i>minus both the young</i>
<i>lion and her food.</i>

183
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:13,035
<i>I told you a dozen</i>
<i>sometimes I was coming in.</i>

184
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,638
And I said no,
you're not coming in.

185
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:16,173
'Cause you don't want
I should see you?

186
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,943
<i>You see me at home,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake.</i>

187
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,712
You stare at me
when I'm sleeping.

188
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,381
Eh, I don't want
to see you anyway.

189
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,350
- I just want to use the photocopy.
- For what?

190
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,954
I'm building my case.

191
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,023
Again?

192
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,759
Who's this?

193
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:32,829
I'm Peggy Olson.
I work with Ginsberg.

194
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,400
Well, I'm the original.

195
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,769
Okay. Ahem.
It's bedtime.

196
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:10,446
Miss Olson.

197
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:18,190
- What time is it?
- It's 8:30.

198
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,725
Mr. Draper's on the phone.

199
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:25,833
I'll take it in here.
You can go.

200
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:26,868
Good night.

201
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:36,213
- Hello. - Dawn didn't get any
calls. Did you get any calls?

202
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:39,083
- About what?
- Has anyone called you?

203
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,985
I don't think so.

204
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,355
Oh, okay.

205
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,426
Listen, it didn't go well.

206
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,197
- <i>I've got to go.</i>
- I take full responsibility.

207
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,136
Hello?

208
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,591
Why didn't you tell me
you had a family?

209
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,996
- Your father's nice.
- He's not my real father.

210
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,098
People don't understand.

211
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,902
- Are you adopted?
- Actually, I'm from Mars.

212
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,775
It's fine if you don't believe
me, but that's where I'm from.

213
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,579
I'm a full-blooded martian.

214
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:28,718
Don't worry.
There's no plot to take over Earth.

215
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,856
We're just displaced.

216
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,025
Okay.

217
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,262
I can tell
you don't believe me.

218
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,567
That's okay.
We're a big secret.

219
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:42,538
<i>They even tried</i>
<i>to hide it from me.</i>

220
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,375
That man, my father,

221
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,312
told me a story I was born
in a concentration camp,

222
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,980
but you know that's impossible.

223
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,853
And I never met my mother because
she supposedly died there.

224
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,121
That's convenient.

225
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,259
Next thing I know, Morris there finds
me in a Swedish orphanage.

226
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:02,962
<i>I was five.</i>
<i>I remember it.</i>

227
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,866
That's incredible.

228
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,601
Yeah.

229
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,604
And then I got
this one communication.

230
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,573
A simple order.

231
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,914
Stay where you are.

232
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:19,186
Are there others like you?

233
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:20,956
I don't know.

234
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:25,762
I haven't been able
to find any.

235
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,399
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

236
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,902
You at work?

237
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,605
No, I'm home.

238
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,744
Come up here.

239
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,881
You need me, huh?

240
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,151
I always need you.

241
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,288
<i>What happened?</i>

242
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:14,592
This guy told me the strangest
thing at work today.

243
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:16,660
<i>Yeah?</i>

244
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:19,965
He said he was born
in a concentration camp.

245
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,368
But that's impossible, right?

246
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:25,338
It happened.

247
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,877
- Come up here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

248
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,646
Hurry.

249
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,504
I'm going to go in there and
sit down with the door closed.

250
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,773
And I want you to buzz me
when he comes in.

251
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:53,278
One buzz for Don, two
buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.

252
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,397
- Who died?
- Let's play hooky.

253
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,033
Should I close the door?

254
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,636
Remember when we used to
represent double-sided aluminum?

255
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:14,039
I remember twins
and a hospital.

256
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:15,808
Not that part.

257
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:18,011
Bob Whozit's moved over
to Howard Johnson's

258
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:19,680
to help them with
their new models.

259
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:23,284
So how about a completely
debauched and unnecessary

260
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,688
fact-finding boondoggle
to the flagship in...

261
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,859
Plattsburgh, New York?

262
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:33,097
Just an hour from
scenic lake placid.

263
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,967
- Are you kidding me? - Did you ever hear
the one about the farmer's daughter?

264
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,904
This is where
it all takes place.

265
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,375
- No.
- Don, come on.

266
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,579
Alone, I'm an escapee from some
expensive mental institution.

267
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:48,050
But the two of us, we're a couple
of rich, handsome perverts.

268
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,454
- I love Howard Johnson's.
- We'll try and stop by.

269
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,790
I think Montreal
is an hour away.

270
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:56,594
Look, the whole point of going
is to forget about her.

271
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:59,331
I mean, I'm supposed to have
dinner with Jane's snooty friends,

272
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:01,601
sit around talking about
Frank Lloyd rice.

273
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:03,736
I always say it that way.
They hate it.

274
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,739
You know what?

275
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:10,278
- I'm gonna take Megan.
- Really?

276
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:12,280
You can bring Jane.

277
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,682
Megan gets along with everyone.

278
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,618
You're very funny.
Forget it.

279
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:17,387
Newlyweds.

280
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:19,422
I'll give Dawn the guy's name.

281
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,998
Dawn, I need you to get
me out of everything

282
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:28,667
through the weekend.

283
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:33,339
It was a dumb idea.

284
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:35,076
<i>Megan, can I have a moment?</i>

285
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,844
Sure.

286
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,790
- You're not gonna say anything?
- What?

287
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:48,428
I said you look nice and I
said I don't want to do this.

288
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,129
Well, what do you want to do?

289
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,233
Go home, open your vest
and yell at the TV

290
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,570
for the next 20 years?
Go ahead.

291
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,472
God.

292
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:59,176
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't know these people.

293
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,813
I do.

294
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,015
And it's not about them.

295
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,185
It's very important to me.
I don't know how many ways to say it.

296
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:10,691
I should have worn
something more comfortable.

297
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:13,127
You really do look great.

298
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,448
It's the study of the ways the
things are true or false.

299
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:21,846
Some things are possibly true.
Some are necessarily true.

300
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,183
Some used to be true.
Some will be true.

301
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,786
Some are true on this planet,
but not necessarily others.

302
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,724
So there's no good and bad
because the truth is relative?

303
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,194
Even if the truth is what
you would call relative,

304
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:34,297
good and bad are not relative.

305
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,366
Your mistake is
that you're assuming

306
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,469
That because something
is true that it's good.

307
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:41,439
Professor's got you there.

308
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:44,209
I think the truth is good
because it's always real

309
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:46,044
on any planet.

310
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,480
I have patients who spend years

311
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:50,750
reasoning out their
motivation for a mistake.

312
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:53,152
And when they find it out, they
think they've found the truth.

313
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:54,788
They probably have.

314
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:57,959
- And then they go and make
the same mistake. - Like who?

315
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,730
Catherine has been the
psychiatrist to some celebrities.

316
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:04,002
- Wow.
- So they never get better?

317
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:08,442
I didn't say that.
I just said that it's a myth

318
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:11,546
that tracing logic all the
way down to the truth

319
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,450
is a cure for neurosis
or for anything else.

320
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:16,486
Is there a cure for neurosis?

321
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,988
Love works.

322
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:23,295
I say we postpone this conversation
until after we turn on.

323
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,698
- Shall we?
- Or after we turn in.

324
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,701
Jane, honey, you ready?

325
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,440
What do you think you're doing?

326
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:35,110
I took your college course.
I say it's time to hit the sack.

327
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:38,715
- No, we're gonna do this.
- Do what?

328
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:41,619
I told you, we're going
to take LSD with them.

329
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,188
You were supposed to
clear your schedule.

330
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,659
LSD?
Really?

331
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,630
You really are never
listening, are you?

332
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:52,802
- How long does it last?
- Please.

333
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:55,239
I don't want to do this alone.

334
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,874
It'll be good for us.

335
00:18:58,044 --> 00:18:59,544
Okay.

336
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,254
Just copy what they're doing.

337
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,659
I think we are going to go.

338
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,363
- Oh, no.
- We had a lovely time.

339
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,978
No one has to stay.

340
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,947
All I'll say is

341
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:31,785
that I have taken it
now four times

342
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:34,822
and every experience was more
beautiful than the last.

343
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:37,626
And I'm not gonna take it.
I'll be here to guide you.

344
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,828
I'm excited.

345
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,932
I'm not gonna lie;
I'm a little nervous.

346
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,469
This is an experience
of self-fulfilling prophecy.

347
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,804
You have to enter into it
with a spirit of optimism.

348
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,708
It's like a boat trip.
You don't cast off thinking about sinking.

349
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:52,712
And this boat is perfect.
And the water is calm.

350
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:55,349
No, you hold on to that.

351
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:58,153
Go ahead.

352
00:19:58,187 --> 00:20:01,791
Just let it melt
on your tongue.

353
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:08,100
You always say
I never take you anywhere.

354
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,969
Well, Dr. Leary,
I find your product boring.

355
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:58,465
<i>Only awareness</i>
<i>can make reality.</i>

356
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:00,668
And only what's real
can become a dream.

357
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:03,404
And only from a dream
can you wake to the light.

358
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:05,407
Okey-dokey.

359
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,444
He's not making this up.

360
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,046
<i>It's from the Tibetan</i>
<i>book of the damned.</i>

361
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:13,617
The dead, my dear.
"Bardo Thodol" is a guide to dying.

362
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,559
Oh, my God.

363
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,129
Look at my arm.

364
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,936
- I don't want to die.
<i>- Some party.</i>

365
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:36,246
All absence is death
if we let ourselves know it.

366
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,650
<i>Weren't you the one who said we
were supposed to think positive?</i>

367
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:41,020
Yes.

368
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,489
I feel like that
when Roger goes to work.

369
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:47,029
A mere change
is incremental and shallow.

370
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,599
<i>I'm sitting here listening
to these people have a conversation.</i>

371
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,936
<i>It has nothing to do with me.</i>

372
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,672

<i>Don't look in the mirror.</i>

381
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,416
What?

382
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,519
Don't look in the mirror.

383
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:32,721
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I did.

384
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:35,691
I already looked.

385
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:38,862
Look at me.
Everything's okay.

386
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,532
You are okay.

387
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,736
Now go to your wife.

388
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,304
Why?

389
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:48,407
Because she wants to be alone
in the truth with you.

390
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:50,410
Just go already.

391
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:59,922

It's so...

394
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:33,132
It's perfect here.

395
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,669
Let's go home.

396
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:40,243
<i>♪ You and I together ♪</i>

397

00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:14,590
Why are you laughing?

401
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,361
Are you laughing at me?

402
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:19,697
What's wrong with me?

403
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,400
It's the World Series.

404
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:24,838
1919.
The Black Sox.

405
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:27,609
Were you there?

406
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:29,678
No, but I'm there.

407
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,489
Look at the cars--
Model T, model T,

408
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:39,524
model A, model T.

409
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,961
I can't see it.

410
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:56,246
What time is it?

411
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,784
How could a few numbers
contain all of time?

412
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:04,424
I can feel your lips.

413
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,595
- I'm still here.
- I can see you.

414
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:09,998
- You're beautiful.
- You always say that.

415
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,934
It's all you ever say.

416
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,972
Now I know why
your friends are so smart.

417
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:18,810
Catherine is not my friend.
She's my doctor.

418
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:22,049
I knew that,
but I didn't know it.

419
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,654
Sometimes I think she knows
me better than you do.

420
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:27,758
Do I want to know?

421
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,930
Probably not.

422
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,933
Because it's over?

423
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,770
She's just waiting
for me to say it.

424
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:38,739
And what does she think of me?

425
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:41,343
She thinks I'm waiting
for you to say it.

426
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:45,380
But instead you wrote me
this poem tonight, didn't you?

427
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:48,150
I knew we were going somewhere

428
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:50,687
and I didn't want
it to be here.

429
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:54,291
Do you feel
as relieved as I do?

430
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:56,928
All I think about
is having an affair.

431
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,930
I see them everywhere.

432
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:00,866
You never cheated on me?

433
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,769
There was a kiss.

434
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:04,871
I stopped it.

435
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,908
And then I was mad at you,

436
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,944
that you didn't appreciate it

437
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:11,313
even though you
didn't know about it.

438
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,817
A younger man?

439
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:17,155
No, Roger.

440
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:26,133
That's always been real.

441
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:30,974
And I won't even ask about you.

442
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,979
I just know for a fact that
you did not fall in love.

443
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:37,083
So what was wrong again?

444
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,251
You don't like me.

445
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:42,655
I did.

446
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,297
I really did.

447
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:17,142
- Is it morning?
- Yes.

448
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:26,888
I'm sorry I always say it,
but you are so beautiful.

449
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,961
Last night was beautiful.

450
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:32,896
It was, wasn't it?

451
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,502
Where are you going?

452
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:39,205
Out the door

453
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,141
and into the elevator,
I suppose.

454
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,076
What about me?

455
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:46,314
You can take
your time, obviously.

456
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:49,820
I figured I'd just check
into a hotel for a while.

457
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:52,055
I don't want to displace you.

458
00:27:54,426 --> 00:27:56,427
What are you talking about?

459
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:59,364
I imagined all the screaming
and fighting and lawyers.

460
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:03,303
It's just so beautiful

461
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:06,406
how we were able
to be there together

462
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:09,678
in the truth like you wanted.

463
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:16,420
- Are you leaving me?
- No.

464
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:18,524
We're leaving each other
just like you said.

465
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,894
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

466
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:22,529
You said so many
amazing things.

467
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:25,367
- You were speaking German.
- I don't know German.

468
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:26,803
You were quoting your father.

469
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:29,138
It must have been yiddish.

470
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:32,710
But I was on drugs.
I obviously didn't mean any of it.

471
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,914
So your psychiatrist
didn't tell you that you knew

472
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:37,918
is was over, but you were
waiting for me to say it?

473
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:39,921
I did say that.

474
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:44,493
It's good that you did
because we both know it.

475
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,362
No.

476
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:49,901
I don't know.

477
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:59,213
It's going to be
very expensive.

478
00:28:59,247 --> 00:29:01,216
I know.

479
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,487
Dawn, I need you to get
me out of everything

480
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:32,290
through the weekend.

481
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:35,561
It was a dumb idea.

482
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:40,901
- Megan, can I have a moment?
- Oh, uh, sure.

483
00:29:40,935 --> 00:29:44,306
Listen, there's
a Howard Johnson's upstate

484
00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:48,844
I thought we'd go and make
a long weekend of it.

485
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:50,613
- What about Heinz?
- What about it?

486
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:53,450
It'll be fine.
Remember California?

487
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:56,019
- Two hotel rooms.
- Of course.

488
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:58,956
- But we can go tomorrow.
- Come on.

489
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,327
Let's go right now.
We can do this.

490
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,464
I don't know.

491
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm the boss.
I'm ordering you.

492
00:30:06,535 --> 00:30:08,402
Come on.

493
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:18,881
You know it's like an hour
and a half from my parents.

494
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,517
They're coming to visit soon.

495
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,154
I know.
You're right.

496
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,222
And we don't have
to work much tonight.

497
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,727
Someone named Dale is going to
give us the royal treatment.

498
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,763
You like orange sherbet?

499
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,100
- I don't know.
- You've never had it?

500
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:38,539
- You are in for a treat.
- Sounds great.

501
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,743
Everything okay?

502
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:42,845
I'm just tired.

503
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,282
So take a nap.
Relax.

504
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:47,953
When you wake up, you will
feel like you're on vacation.

505
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:51,124
You know what? Tell me more about
what we're going to be doing

506
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:54,261
in Howard Johnson's
so I can get some sleep.

507
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:13,856
Could you open your window?

508
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:24,135
I wonder how Heinz went.
Peggy seemed nervous.

509
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,970
Peggy knows what she's doing.

510
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,473
What are you worrying
about that for?

511
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,476
I feel like I abandoned
the team.

512
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,579
You feel bad because you got to
take off and they had to work?

513
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,481
<i>I don't.</i>

514
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,450
There has to be some advantage
to being my wife.

515
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,557
I'll check in with Peggy later.

516
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,995
Okay.

517
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,671
They got an indoor pool.

518
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,174
Did you bring that
suit from Acapulco?

519
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,842
I forgot.
I was rushing.

520
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,079
We'll get you a new one after we check in.
I brought mine.

521
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,881
- Mr. Draper?
- It's Don.

522
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,951
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife Megan.

523
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,719
Dale Vanderwort.

524
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,257
A little more notice, I would have
rolled out the orange carpet.

525
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,360
I've got your room
all set for you.

526
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:10,097
Actually, I'd like something
to eat and something to drink.

527
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:12,399
Sure, I'm going to bring you
a sampling of everything.

528
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,136
- Do you like clams?
- I like everything.

529
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:36,297
I got you something.

530
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:44,640
I got one for Bobby and I got a
box of saltwater taffy for Sally.

531
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:46,376
What did you get for gene?

532
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,845
Sally will share
and she'll make Bobby share.

533
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,214
I was the youngest, Don.
You can't forget about him.

534
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:53,617
Trust me, he won't
know the difference.

535
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:56,087
Didn't make much of a dent.
Anything to your liking?

536
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:58,456
- We had a little of everything.
- Should I bring some desserts?

537
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,292
Yes, how about some pie?

538
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:02,929
No, you know what? Just three scoops
of orange sherbet and two spoons.

539
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,906
The colors are bright
and cheerful.

540
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:12,543
The kids have candy.
Full bar for mom and dad.

541
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:15,147
Would you say it's
a delightful destination?

542
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:17,184
It's not a destination.

543
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:19,920
It's on the way to someplace.

544
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:23,024
That's true.
It's a long car drive.

545
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,393
Mom probably needs
to use the restroom.

546
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:27,596
Kids get a look at the place,

547
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,833
force them to stay.

548
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:32,434
You like to work,
but I can't like to work?

549
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:36,740
You should have told me
if it was so important to you.

550
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:38,742
- We didn't have to go.
- I never got the chance.

551
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:41,480
It was in front of everyone.
And it's embarrassing.

552
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:44,284
I ruined the whole damn thing by
pulling you off that crack team.

553
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,287
I am on the team.

554
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:48,456
- Here we go.
- She's never tried it.

555
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:51,060
- You're kidding.
- Try it.

556
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,606
Oh, no, sorry.

557
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,243
- It's not for everybody.
- It tastes like perfume to me.

558
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:04,945
That's why we make 28 flavors.

559
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:07,048
<i>Can I get a scoop of chocolate?</i>

560
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:11,787
Really?

561
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:13,456
I don't like it.

562
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,625
There's no chance you're
trying to embarrass me?

563
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,829
You're right.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

564
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,469
Mmm, it's so delicious.

565
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:25,171
Mm-Mmm!

566
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:28,242
Mm, it's so good.

567
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,744
Stop it.

568
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,882
What's wrong with you?

569
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,421
I'm sorry. Maybe you could
make up a little schedule

570
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:38,656
so I'll know when I'm working
and when I'm your wife.

571
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:40,159
It gets so confusing.

572
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:42,728
I know, I'm terrible.
Making you eat ice cream.

573
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:45,631
Why don't you call
your mother and hurl

574
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,835
a string of complaints at her
in French like you always do?

575
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,505
- I'm always talking about you.
- The woman speaks English.

576
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,374
Why don't you call your mother?

577
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,617
Don.

578
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:08,093
Do not walk away from me.

579
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,032
- Get in the car.
- No, I am talking to you.

580
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,269
Okay, don't get in the car.

581
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:16,838
Go ahead.

582
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:20,811
You care more what some truck stop
waitress thinks than what I say.

583
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,316
Get in the car.
Eat ice cream.

584
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,152
Leave work.
Take off your dress.

585
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,188
Yes, master.

586
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:34,264
Don't you dare pull away!
I'm talking to you.

587
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:26,062
Excuse me.
Was my wife just in here?

588
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,464
- She was.
- Where'd she go?

589
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,034
- I don't know.
- To the hotel?

590
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:33,371
She was talking to
those fellas over there.

591
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:35,339
They all left.

592
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:37,742
They went towards
the parking lot together.

593
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:40,079
I thought she
was looking for you.

594
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:13,822
Wow, you're really
checking the place out.

595
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,060
I've got your room key.

596
00:37:16,094 --> 00:37:17,661
Do you want help
with your bags?

597
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,398
No. Did you give
my wife a key?

598
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,367
No. Do you want
another key?

599
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:25,339
No.
I-- No.

600
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,209
Uh, I have some bad news.

601
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:30,845
- What?
- We closed the pool.

602
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,982
Some kid had an accident.

603
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:35,384
I swear it doesn't
happen a lot.

604
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:06,258
- Oh, you took care of me, sir.
- No, can I get some dimes?

605
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:08,127
Oh, le will let you
use the phone.

606
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,395
That's okay.
Pay phone's fine.

607
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,363
It's none of my business,

608
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:13,500
but couples fight in here
all the time.

609
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:15,501
There's no reason
to think the worst.

610
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:17,771
She probably got a ride
home with those kids.

611
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:26,548
<i>Hello?</i> - Dawn didn't
get any calls. Did you get any calls?

612
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,052
- About what?
- Has anyone called you?

613
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,887
I don't think so.

614
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:33,057
Oh.

615
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:37,963
- Okay.
- <i>Listen, it didn't go well.</i>

616
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:58,358
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Marie.

617
00:38:58,392 --> 00:39:00,394
Hello, it's Don.

618
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:02,397
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

619
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:04,032
Just wanted to call...

620
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,669
to say hello

621
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:09,340
and wanted to know
if Megan had called you.

622
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:11,743
<i>Has Megan called</i>
<i>me tonight? No.</i>

623
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,812
No. Huh.

624
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:16,150
<i>Don, are you still there?</i>

625
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:19,021
Well, I wanted to buy her
some jewelry

626
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:22,559
and I remembered that she had
an allergic reaction to metal,

627
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,728
but I don't remember
if it's silver or gold.

628
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:28,333
<i>Ah, 24 karat gold is fine</i>
<i>and so is sterling silver.</i>

629
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,936
Well, good.

630
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,739
<i>What a fine husband you are.</i>
<i>It is only gold alloy--</i>

631
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:35,709
Listen, Marie,
if she does call...

632
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:39,847
Don't ruin the surprise, okay?

633
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:42,182
- <i>Of course. Of course not.</i>
- Thank you.

634
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:45,386
Okay.
<i>Au revoir.</i>

635
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:47,389
<i>Nice talking to you, Don.</i>

636
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,903
Are you okay?

637
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,471
I'm sorry to do
that to you, sir,

638
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:00,842
but they don't let patrons
sleep in the restaurant.

639
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:03,246
No, no, of course not.

640
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,215
What time is it?

641
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,385
It's a quarter to 2:00.

642
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:09,321
Oh.

643
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,627
Well, my wife, she--

644
00:40:15,698 --> 00:40:18,366
She's missing.
She took off from here.

645
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:20,937
- When was this?
- I don't know.

646
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:25,844
Almost seven hours ago.

647
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:29,449
Well, I'll be back
and forth here all morning.

648
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:31,485
I'll keep an eye out.

649
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,098
The Whitestone bridge to

650
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:15,770
the Hutchinson river
parkway to 95.

651
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:17,138
You cold?

652
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:19,074
It's like I'm in shock.

653
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,946
Where are we?

654
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,814
Where are we going?

655
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,717
To your new house.

656
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,221
I don't want to go there.

657
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:31,690
I don't want vacation to end.

658
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:34,560
Me either.

659
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,031
When can we go back?

660
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:39,901
If you go to sleep, when you
wake up, I'll tell you.

661
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,127
I thought you hated that song.

662
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:01,795
You keep telling her
to stop singing it.

663
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:03,631
And now it's stuck in my head.

664
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:27,796
Megan.

665
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,601
- Megan!
<i>- Go away!</i>

666
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:35,941
- Op the door.
- <i>No.</i>

667
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:37,809
Open the damn door.

668
00:42:37,844 --> 00:42:39,578
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

669
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:42,148
Open the door
or I'm gonna kick it in.

670
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,450
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

671
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,029
- Get out.
- I said I was sorry.

672
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:57,366
- I don't care.
- Where the hell were you?

673
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,635
I stopped every 20 miles
and called the apartment.

674
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,003
Why didn't you answer
the goddamn phone?

675
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:03,874
Because you're a pig!
You left me there!

676
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:06,878
Where the hell were you?
I thought you were dead.

677
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:09,215
Six and a half hours on a bus.

678
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,854
And then try getting a cab at Port
Authority at 5:00 in the morning.

679
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:14,589
Try getting anything
but an offer.

680
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:16,559
I thought you were dead.

681
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:50,705
How could you do that to me?

682
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,578
I don't know.

683
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:57,847
It was a fight.

684
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:01,119
It's over.

685
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:02,788
No.

686
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:08,429
Every time we fight, it just
diminishes us a little bit.

687
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:25,821
I have to go to work.

688
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,938
I thought I lost you.

689
00:45:09,446 --> 00:45:11,481
Mr. Draper.
I didn't expect you back.

690
00:45:11,515 --> 00:45:13,517
- How was your trip?
- Great.

691
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:15,286
Would you like some coffee?

692
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:22,896
- What's this? - Oh, Mr. Cooper
dropped those off this morning.

693
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,664
- Bert Cooper?
- Yes.

694
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:27,602
He's in the conference room.
Would you like me to get him?

695
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,282
What the hell is this?

696
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,854
A client left here
unhappy yesterday

697
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:44,158
because you have a little
girl running everything.

698
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:45,927
My department is fine.

699
00:45:45,962 --> 00:45:48,063
We just need more bodies,
but Lane won't let us.

700
00:45:48,097 --> 00:45:50,466
You've been on love leave.

701
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,537
It's amazing things are
going as well as they are

702
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:56,239
with as little
as you are doing.

703
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:58,141
That's none of your business.

704
00:45:59,511 --> 00:46:02,281
This is my business.

705
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:26,180
I have an announcement to make.

706
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:29,817
It's going to be
a beautiful day.
