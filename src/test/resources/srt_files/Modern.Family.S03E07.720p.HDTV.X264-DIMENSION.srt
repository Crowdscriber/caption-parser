1
00:00:01,884 --> 00:00:02,733
Honey!

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,051
- What is all this?
- Hey!

3
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:07,934
Hey mom! I'm trying to write
a stupid college essay question

4
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,043
- and I really don't even know where to
start. - OK, what's the question? Tell me.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,222
"What's the biggest obstacle
you ever had to overcome?"

6
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:17,497
Didn't my 3rd Grade teacher said
I had like ADD or something?

7
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:20,417
Oh, no honey.
She said you couldn't ***.

8
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:23,422
She put it that way because she
also knew you couldn't S-P-E-O-L

9
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,694
Wait, slow down.

10
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:27,584
Sweetheart.

11
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:28,906
What's this?

12
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:30,214
We talked about this last week.

13
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:33,120
I said I'm building Luke a treehouse,
you said fine.

14
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,885
You know? Sometimes I think
you just turn me out.

15
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:38,271
I never told her.
She just would have said "no."

16
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:41,341
I don't remember
agreeing to this, Phil.

17
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,453
This is like the time you
backed down the driveway

18
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:45,216
with a hang glider
sticking out of the car.

19
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:46,167
If you'd let me keep that,

20
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:48,015
those geese would have
followed me to the wetlands.

21
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:50,108
- You would have died.
- A hero.

22
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,656
So we spread out a nice blanket,

23
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:56,550
opened up a bottle of vino,

24
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:58,548
and watched the sun
set over the water.

25
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:00,486
It was majestic.

26
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:01,363
- Mm.
- Majestic.

27
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,840
Why? Why we never have the picnic?

28
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,452
Who wants to sit on a blanket?
There's no back support.

29
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:07,840
It's majestic.

30
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:11,720
Last week, Shorty took me
to see the Cirque du soleil--

31
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,664
It's like a circus, but classy.

32
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,632
So if you like elephants,

33
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,150
don't hold your breath.

34
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,303
She's so cute.

35
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:23,712
Jay hates the crowds,
the beach, the rainbows.

36
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:25,954
Rainbows?
It's just colors in the sky.

37
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,308
Do we have to pull over
every time and take a picture?

38
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:31,035
Shame.
There's an expression in Italian, Jay--

39
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:36,483
Dammi la tua mano e corriamo
uniti per tutta la vita.

40
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:40,397
"Give me your hand and we
will run together our whole lives."

41
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:42,606
Jay also hates running.

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,130
Modern Family 3x07 Treehouse
Sync & Corrected By Ali's Ultimately

43
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:57,339
Here you go.

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,539
Oh, thank you.

45
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,537
- And here you go.
- Oh. What is this?

46
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:03,323
You said to knock your socks off.

47
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,654
Oh, well, look.
It's already working!

48
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:07,528
Well, two more of those,

49
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:09,435
and you won't be wearing
any underwear either.

50
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,459
- Oh! Look...
- Cam, down. Down.

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,025
- Maybe later.
- Oh, okay, maybe... maybe later.

52
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,043
Did you hear that?
Waitress is flirting with me.

53
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,475
No, no. She's not flirting with you.

54
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,720
She's-- she's trolling for tips, okay?

55
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,282
She totally knows you're gay.

56
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,882
How would she know I'm gay?

57
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,838
Uh, maybe it's the way
you ordered a drink-a-doodle-doo.

58
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,088
Cam has this crazy theory
that if he were straight...

59
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,998
And Julia Roberts were single...

60
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,649
- They'd be dating.
- It's not crazy.

61
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,985
I met her once
at an A.I.D.S. walk,

62
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:36,584
and our chemistry was palpable.

63
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,102
No, you handed her
a bottle of water.

64
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:39,051
And her fingers lingered.

65
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:40,531
Because you wouldn't let go.

66
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,269
I could totally pick up
any woman in here.

67
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,200
If by that, you mean
lift her off the ground,

68
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:47,859
then yes, I'll give you that.

69
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,587
I for sure could be a womanizer.

70
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,159
Or you could be someone
who just stepped out

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,261
of a machine called the womanizer.

72
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:54,815
Okay, you know what? That's it.

73
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:55,949
Pick anyone in here.

74
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,004
If I can get their number,
you do the laundry for a month.

75
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,108
If I fail, I'll do it.

76
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,451
Okay. I hate doing laundry.
So, um...

77
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,069
No, um...

78
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:06,657
Oh, okay. Right here.

79
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:08,496
Her.

80
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:12,605
Okay, great.

81
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:16,065
Great. Just get rid of my flair...

82
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,133
Whoa. Where did Cam go?

83
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:21,160
I don't know. Where is he?

84
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,447
Dinner was absolutely wonderful.

85
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,642
Amazing.

86
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:26,192
Hey, you know what?

87
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,370
Why don't you guys come
salsa dancing with us tomorrow night?

88
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,339
Oh, yeah! That would be great!

89
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,747
It sounds like so much fun.
I love salsa dancing.

90
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,193
Jay, let's go salsa dancing
with them. Look.

91
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,622
Why not?

92
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:39,611
I just bought that
pay-per-view fight.

93
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,087
I tell you what-- we'll compromise.

94
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,360
We'll watch the fight.
We'll eat salsa.

95
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,171
Who needs him?
Come dancing with us.

96
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,295
Ay, no, I wouldn't want to--

97
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,548
No, no! You'd be doing me a favor.

98
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,822
Shorty never wants to stop,
and I could use a break.

99
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:53,655
You hear that Jay?
I never stop.

100
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:55,885
All I hear is she could use a break.

101
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:01,042
Hey! Oh, my God! How are you?

102
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,467
Hey. Hey!

103
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:07,263
Wow. Look at you.
You look fantastic.

104
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,193
Thank you. So do you.

105
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:10,777
How long has it been?

106
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,117
- It feels like forever.
- Yeah.

107
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,935
Um, when is the last time
we saw each other?

108
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,002
Oh, let's see.
I think it was at Dave's thing.

109
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:21,458
You know what? I'm sorry.

110
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,638
I don't know if you've heard.

111
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,919
I was in a terrible car accident,

112
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,384
and ever since the coma,

113
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:32,906
I have a really hard time
placing names and faces.

114
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:33,821
So who are you again?

115
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,127
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

116
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:36,905
It was just a clever way
to try to approach you.

117
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,734
We don't know each other.

118
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,246
I've never been in a coma.

119
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:46,198
But you so deserved that.
That was the worst pick-up ever.

120
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,918
Oh, my God!

121
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:52,175
That was genius! And mean!

122
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:55,784
Now I know why
we're old fake friends.

123
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:57,676
Oh. Can I buy you a drink?

124
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,567
Yeah. I'm Katie.

125
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:00,974
Cameron.

126
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,369
If she were a hot guy,

127
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,543
I would never
have been that smooth.

128
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,071
It's ironic.

129
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,834
Like the gift of the vagi.

130
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,635
There you go.

131
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,286
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

132
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,205
- You, too. Bye!
- Bye!

133
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,803
Wham, bam, thank you, Cam.

134
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,360
Seriously? You got her number?

135
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,252
Sure did.
And all my shirts get ironed,

136
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:24,865
and their seams
should appear straight,

137
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,385
just like their owner.

138
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,373
Should you be using
screws instead of nails?

139
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,784
America was built with nails, son.

140
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:40,240
So was that gazebo you built
for our 4th of July party.

141
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,897
I'm telling you, you are
gonna love this bad boy.

142
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,686
You know what can't climb trees?

143
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:46,731
Raccoons?

144
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:48,081
Worries.

145
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:50,376
Raccoons can and will get up here,
so don't leave any food,

146
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:52,829
or they'll get
territorial and attack.

147
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,347
Are you sure this is a good idea?

148
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:56,989
Are you kidding me?
You're gonna have so much fun

149
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,914
hanging out up here
with your buddies.

150
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:01,159
Trust me, when you get older,
it all changes.

151
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:03,653
- Why?
- Well, life gets in the way.

152
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,309
Did I just say
"wife gets in the way"?

153
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,670
'Cause sometimes I do that.

154
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:08,990
Nope, you're good.

155
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,890
And you have lots of friends.

156
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:11,868
Yeah, I have work friends,

157
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:13,705
and your mom and I
have couples friends,

158
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,685
and there are my college friends,

159
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:17,676
but they're scattered
all over the country.

160
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,006
It's not the same
as just shouting out

161
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,283
to your neighborhood buddies,

162
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:22,507
"Hey, fellas! I'm up here
in the tree house!" Uhh!

163
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:26,067
Fix that... board.

164
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,719
I can't do this.

165
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:32,875
Why are you so frustrated?

166
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,763
Because I've never had
any obstacles to overcome.

167
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,735
Oh, honey, that's not true.

168
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,291
Really? Name one.

169
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:40,412
Well...

170
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,758
You're lactose-intolerant.

171
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,392
Oh, "dear college,
cheese makes me gassy.

172
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:47,573
See you in September."

173
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,143
Sweetie, you're not really
starting your essays

174
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,189
"dear college," are you?

175
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:52,422
What difference does it make?

176
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:55,150
I've lived a boring,
sheltered, pathetic life.

177
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,381
I am sorry we have
made things too easy

178
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,503
and comfortable for you.

179
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:01,759
Oh, you should be!
It is all your fault!

180
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,905
You have shielded me

181
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,741
from everything interesting
and dangerous!

182
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,087
You are blaming me

183
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:09,609
because I kept you
from getting hurt?

184
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,282
Gaby's mom's a hoarder.

185
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,344
That essay practically writes itself.

186
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:15,725
Maybe it is our fault.

187
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,325
But did you ever consider
there's a reason?

188
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:21,479
What are you talking about?

189
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,493
There's a reason why
we were so easy on you.

190
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:27,991
I don't understand.

191
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:30,115
Oh, honey, you're old enough now.

192
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,163
Old enough for what?

193
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,242
The truth.

194
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,156
Okay, come on.
Gotta show you somethin'.

195
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:36,497
We're gonna go for a ride.

196
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,513
Mom, just tell me.

197
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,039
You are my mom, right?

198
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:43,314
Oh, hey.

199
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:45,620
I'm a bad man.

200
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,168
Oh, no. What did you eat?

201
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,049
Mitchell, remember
the girl I met last night?

202
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,084
How can I forget her?

203
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:53,497
She's super famous for having
the world's worst gay-dar.

204
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,440
How could I be so cavalier
with her emotions?

205
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,918
You know, we had a real connection.

206
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,441
She gave me her number,

207
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,321
and right now she's probably
sitting by the phone

208
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,889
waiting for me to call.

209
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,849
I don't think you understand
how charmed she was by me.

210
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,723
Oh, my God. Where did you
get all this self-confidence?

211
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,414
I won cutest baby
at the 1974 Jasper county fair.

212
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,593
People at the time
said I could go gerber.

213
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,436
You know what? I'm calling her.

214
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:19,438
What?

215
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,912
No, I can't carry this around.

216
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:24,617
I have to come clean
so she can move on with her life.

217
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,594
This is crazy. She is not waiting--

218
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:28,957
Hi. Katie. It's Cam.

219
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:30,861
First ring.

220
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:34,171
I was hoping I would call, too.

221
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,334
Oh, smooth.

222
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,923
So listen, I forgot to mention
something last night,

223
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:42,286
and I'm--I'm actually not really
quite sure how to say this.

224
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:43,846
I'm a gay guy.

225
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:47,353
Um, it's actually
somewhat delicate.

226
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,271
As am I, on account of the gay.

227
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,763
No, no, I had a great time
with you, too, Katie.

228
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,154
It's--well, it's just that--

229
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,615
- I don't dig the ladies.
- No, no. And I want you to sit--

230
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:58,154
I want you to have a seat
on a chaise lounge.

231
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,395
Hey, you wanna go out
and grab some dinner

232
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:01,540
before the fight tonight?

233
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,280
No, thank you.

234
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,653
Wanna eat at home?

235
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:07,445
I'll grill some steaks,
open a bottle of wine.

236
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,721
Whatever you want,
because I'm not going to be here.

237
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:13,144
She's going salsa dancing
without me.

238
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:17,031
Ay, Manny, I told you,
it's a 21 and over club.

239
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:19,527
A forbidden dance floor.
Only makes me want it more.

240
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:23,251
Wait a second. You're going dancing
with Shorty and Darlene?

241
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:25,529
Yes, because even though
he's old like you,

242
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,349
he still likes to have fun.

243
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,852
We like to have fun.

244
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,860
Last week I took you to dinner,

245
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,356
went to the boat show,

246
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:33,739
got some sherbet?

247
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,254
And we were home
by 8:30 with no boat.

248
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,532
What do you want from me?
I don't like dancing.

249
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,340
- I don't like sherbet.
- Yeah, right.

250
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:41,639
How about coconut?

251
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:44,627
Who doesn't like the coconut, hmm?
Who?

252
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,309
And anyways, I'm going
dancing with or without you.

253
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,607
Fine. I hope you have
a good time with Shorty.

254
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,261
I don't need Shorty!

255
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:53,898
I won't have any problem
finding a partner on my own!

256
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,566
Wow. Way to rub it in, mom.

257
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:01,986
How'd it go, heartbreaker?

258
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,615
That is one classy lady...

259
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,869
- Which is why I couldn't tell her.
- What?

260
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,775
Well... I just couldn't
do it on the phone.

261
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,923
She seemed so excited
to hear from me,

262
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:13,959
and I'm very bad
at disappointing people, Mitchell.

263
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,076
Not all people.

264
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:16,742
Mama was right when she said

265
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,587
my charm was like a wild stallion--

266
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:21,264
if not properly bridled,
it'll bust down a barn.

267
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:23,125
Okay, you wanna get rid
of your girlfriend?

268
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:24,306
Tell her that story.

269
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,977
Maybe I will when she comes over.
She's coming over.

270
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:28,513
Are you serious?

271
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:30,239
She said she was in the area
running errands.

272
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,255
What was I supposed to say,
"don't come over"?

273
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,325
Well, I guess I could
have said that,

274
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,525
but it's too late now,

275
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:36,126
plus I wanna break it to her gently.

276
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,878
So come on.
Help me un-gay this place.

277
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,880
You know what?
I'll make it less gay by half.

278
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,181
Oh, these flowers should go, too.

279
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:42,382
You mean the ones
underneath the portrait

280
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,767
of you cuddling another man?

281
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,869
Oh, good catch.

282
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,387
Aw.

283
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:50,824
Manny.

284
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,209
What's up, big guy?

285
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:54,922
How hard is it to learn
this salsa dancing stuff?

286
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:55,956
Not hard at all.

287
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:57,974
It's about tapping
into your emotion,

288
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,426
your passion,
and your inner fire.

289
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:02,532
Crap!

290
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,535
I stink at dancing.

291
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:05,708
First dance at our wedding,

292
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,776
Gloria was all graceful
and gorgeous,

293
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,844
and I was all big and clunky.

294
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,009
Like that scene from
"Beauty and the beast."

295
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,778
Actually, that was the song.

296
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:15,419
Manny picked it.

297
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,421
He didn't like me back then.

298
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,753
Back straight. Okay.

299
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,683
Do as I do.

300
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:24,238
Other leg.

301
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:25,569
Okay, stop marching.

302
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,522
You're dancing,
not invading Poland.

303
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:36,878
Hello, hi!

304
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,847
I'm looking for Jay Pritchett.
He's about 6'2", tough guy,

305
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,616
wrestles with homophobia...

306
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,390
The hell are you doing here?

307
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,202
Uh, I had to get out of the house.

308
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,422
Cam needed a little alone time
with his new girlfriend.

309
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,129
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

310
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,697
What's going on here?

311
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,084
He's learning to dance,
but he's just so tense.

312
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:54,884
- It's not working out.
- 'Cause you're not letting go.

313
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,871
I'm trying. Don't you think
I want to be all smooth

314
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,745
and make your mom
happy out there?

315
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,430
But I just can't do it, that's all.

316
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,468
Jay, I'm not giving up on you.

317
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:05,569
Okay. Hey, Manny,
would you give us a second?

318
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,270
Thanks.

319
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,923
Dad, look, I-I know this is weird,

320
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,758
but you and I are a lot alike.

321
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,477
We're self-conscious, okay?

322
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,413
So, um, here. Just...

323
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,300
The hell is this?

324
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,369
It's just something that
some people take at clubs

325
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,009
to, you know, loosen up.

326
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,510
You take this?

327
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:24,079
A gay man who hates dancing

328
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:25,447
lives in a sad and
lonely little world.

329
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,248
This just melts your inhibitions,

330
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,050
and--and you can dance all night,

331
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,585
plus it gives you a raging--

332
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,586
I don't wanna--

333
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,171
I don't like this at all.

334
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:34,898
Just hold on to it.
Just in case.

335
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,181
Come on. It's fine.

336
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,932
Jay, I wanna show you something.

337
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:41,051
A farmer in New Zealand
taught a pig to dance.

338
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:43,577
Oh.

339
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:45,077
See how he keeps his snout up?

340
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,628
Yep. This is it.

341
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:55,409
This is what?

342
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,395
This.

343
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,880
I-I can't do this.
I can't get out of the car.

344
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,515
I'm sorry. I'm too embarrassed.

345
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,317
Would you just tell me
what's going on?

346
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:09,447
Okay. I-I want you to go read

347
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:12,556
what's carved in that tree.

348
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,991
Mom, you're freaking me out.

349
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,778
Just do it. Do it, Haley.

350
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,331
Have fun getting home!

351
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,550
There's your obstacle!

352
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:42,803
What?! Are you kidding me?!

353
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:49,476
Oh! Son of a...

354
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,452
Brisket!
Why does that keep happening?

355
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:54,171
Maybe I need a nail gun.

356
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:55,995
Okay, that's it! I'm out!

357
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:57,396
What do you mean, you're out?

358
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,414
Where are you going?

359
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,158
Dad, no offense,

360
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,717
but I've seen you
with a glue gun.

361
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:05,054
I think a nail is gonna be harder
to get out of my hair.

362
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,473
No, don't go!
I'm doing this for you!

363
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:09,175
Are you, dad?

364
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,194
Are you?

365
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,496
The kid made me
think with that one.

366
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,299
Who was I really doing this for?

367
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,266
Sometimes I just say,

368
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,412
"are you, dad? Are you?"

369
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:20,547
Because he gets real quiet

370
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:23,333
and doesn't notice
when I walk away.

371
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:30,125
It's weird, because I feel
so comfortable around you already.

372
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:31,817
You know, last night
when I got home,

373
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:35,036
I just started thinking
about all of the fun things

374
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,237
that we could do together, you know?

375
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:38,239
Yeah.

376
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:39,296
I don't wanna scare you off,

377
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,703
but my sister's getting married
in a couple of weeks,

378
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:44,879
and I so don't wanna go
to that thing alone.

379
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,615
Maybe you could be my date?

380
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:50,018
Katie, you're an amazing woman.

381
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,704
You're smart, you're beautiful,

382
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,279
and how fun is that handbag?

383
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,094
This is gonna come
as a little bit of a shock.

384
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,371
I'm fairly gay.

385
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:03,123
I don't know why I said that.

386
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:05,091
I'm--I'm totally gay.

387
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:07,846
Just gay.

388
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:10,585
You're telling me you're gay?

389
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:11,533
Yeah.

390
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:13,420
Why?

391
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:15,254
I was born that way.
I mean, you know, it's just--

392
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:18,557
No, why are you telling me?
I mean, I know you're gay.

393
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:19,992
It's obvious.

394
00:15:20,026 --> 00:15:22,161
Well, it's not that--
it's not that obvious.

395
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,228
Well, yeah.

396
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,797
The way you talk
and walk and dress

397
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,932
and your theatrical
hand gestures--

398
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,835
I do not have theatrical
hand gestures.

399
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:32,782
Okay, maybe I am
moderately... expressive.

400
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:35,402
But why would you
give me your number?

401
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,371
Oh, because I want a gay friend--

402
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:39,240
someone I can dish with,

403
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:42,009
give me guy advice,
and I can shop with--

404
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:44,655
those are totally
offensive stereotypes.

405
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:46,758
We could go see Julia Roberts
movies together.

406
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,027
I know her, and she's as nice
as she seems on screen.

407
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,579
- Shut up. Really? Is she?
- She is, yeah.

408
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,265
Wait, what--so you were
pretending to be straight,

409
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,733
and hitting on me?

410
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,236
I was just a stupid bar bet.

411
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,838
My boyfriend-- oh, he's here...

412
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:03,464
Bet me that I couldn't get
a beautiful woman's number.

413
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:06,127
And as a proud gay man,
I know it shouldn't matter,

414
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:10,104
but I-I just wish everyone
could find me attractive.

415
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:12,884
Oh. But now
he's gonna get to gloat,

416
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,760
and I guess I deserve it.

417
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,800
Hi... hi.

418
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,341
How's-- how's it going?

419
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,004
Hello.

420
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:23,793
This is Katie, and, uh,
it turns out, well...

421
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,861
No, actually.

422
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,475
It doesn't turn out well.

423
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,563
Because I thought I finally
met a nice, funny guy,

424
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,882
who is also hot!

425
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,284
And now he's telling me he's gay?!

426
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,770
He's, like, the least gay person

427
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:41,966
I have ever met
in my entire life!

428
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,312
And I thought he was the one!

429
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,219
And I even told
my mom about him!

430
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,288
You better cherish him!

431
00:16:58,745 --> 00:16:59,863
Wow.

432
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,341
Are you sure you're gay?

433
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:06,776
- No.
- Cam.

434
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,544
Yes.

435
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,980
Yes. Look...

436
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:13,049
You're gonna find somebody,

437
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,033
because you're
an amazing girl, Katie.

438
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,034
You're the whole package.

439
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:20,537
I just prefer somebody
who has one.

440
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:22,885
Okay.

441
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,717
Oh... my... God!

442
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,520
That was a lot of girl tongue!

443
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,872
I think I need
a drink-a-doodle-doo.

444
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,862
What was that?

445
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,997
Hello, Haley.
How was your day?

446
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,550
I have no money, no cell phone...

447
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:48,934
You're welcome.

448
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:49,935
What?!

449
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,903
I listened to you.

450
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,504
I stopped coddling you,
and look--

451
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,373
you overcame an obstacle.

452
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,292
Oh! Yeah! I did!

453
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,611
I grew up normal
despite my crazy mom!

454
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,529
Well, that sounds like
the beginning of a great essay.

455
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:01,697
"Dear college..."

456
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:04,685
Oh, honey, if you get stuck,
let me know,

457
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,203
and I'll make you
sleep out in the yard.

458
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:07,521
You're psychotic!

459
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:08,622
Use spell check!

460
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,198
Aah!

461
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,968
Don't just sit there!
Get out here!

462
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,187
I'm good, I'm good.

463
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:24,689
Okay!

464
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,074
Hola! You're looking so good!

465
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,141
How long has it been?

466
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:29,315
We don't know each other.
Go away.

467
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,256
Fair enough.

468
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:32,724
Hola!

469
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,766
You're looking so good.
How long has it been?

470
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:37,523
What was wrong with that guy?

471
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:38,453
Yeah, I would have
danced with him.

472
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:39,379
He's got nice shoulders.

473
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,948
Aw, you know,
salsa is so intimate and sensual

474
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,238
that it feels wrong to do it
with somebody else

475
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,456
that is not Jay.

476
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:46,924
Aw. You know, Darlene
feels the same way.

477
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,793
If I wasn't here, she's be
holding up the wall.

478
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,362
Yeah. A wall of men.

479
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,532
You know, I think I should go home
to my loving husband

480
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,169
and pull him close and tell him
that I danced with 20 men.

481
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,671
He's not home.

482
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,474
He's in a dicey neighborhood
worried about his car.

483
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,675
Yay! Hey!

484
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,844
Jay!

485
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,113
What, are we gonna kiss or dance?

486
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,114
Let's dance!

487
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,450
I'm dead set against drugs.

488
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,619
"Just say no" and all that stuff.

489
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,967
But I thought,

490
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:19,034
just this once for Gloria.

491
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,968
And if I was gonna make
a complete ass of myself,

492
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:24,383
I didn't wanna remember it.

493
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,948
The big drug I gave him-- baby aspirin.
Orange-flavored.

494
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:33,538
He could have chewed it.

495
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:39,185
Home come you never
surprise me like that?

496
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:40,060
I do surprise you.

497
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,231
No, you don't.
You never surprise me...

498
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,747
That's gonna be
a hell of a tree house.

499
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:54,217
Oh, thanks. I'm trying.

500
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,502
It's for my son, but
he's kind of lost interest.

501
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:58,588
It's kind of like my daughter
with the dog.

502
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:00,656
Which is why I'm the one
out here doing this.

503
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,159
Did you just move in?

504
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,561
Lived here eight years.
You?

505
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:07,964
- 12.
- Huh.

506
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,998
Huh.

507
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,233
You know, me and my friends,

508
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:12,210
we, uh, we built a
tree house when I was a kid.

509
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,710
We spent hours in that thing.

510
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:14,711
Loved it.

511
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,780
Me, too.

512
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:19,066
You need any help?

513
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,317
Yes, a lot.

514
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,686
But I-I don't wanna bother you.

515
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:23,854
Only thing that bothers me

516
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,689
is that drunken Amish roof
you got up there.

517
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:26,707
Do you even have a level?

518
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:28,913
I did, but I might
have gotten frustrated

519
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:31,015
and thrown it into your yard.

520
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,516
Let me find it. I'll be right over.

521
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,018
Thanks.

522
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:35,736
I'm Phil, by the way.

523
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:38,205
I'm Andre.
Nice to meet you, Phil.

524
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,707
Nice to meet you, Andre.

525
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:42,076
So I guess I was wrong
when I said once you get older,

526
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:43,861
it's harder to make new friends.

527
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,948
Honey! The dude in the tree is cool!

528
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:49,684
Andre, it turns out,
is an orthopedic surgeon,

529
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:53,354
handy with tools, and
a great guy to hang out with.

530
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:57,925
Plus he's a badass black man
that gives me extra street cred.

531
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,961
That's his joke.

532
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:03,831
He's my brotha from
a different motha.

533
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:05,266
- What was that?
- Different--

534
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,801
- That's not it.
- What is it?

535
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:08,002
It's "brother from another mother."

536
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,170
Brotha from anotha motha--

537
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:10,204
Slow down. Slow it down.

538
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,340
Brotha from another motha.

539
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:15,176
Forget it. Don't-- just don't say it.
Forget it.

540
