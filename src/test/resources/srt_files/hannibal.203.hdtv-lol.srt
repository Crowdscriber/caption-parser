00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,725
Kade Purnell,

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:08,282
Office of the Inspector General,
FBI Oversight.

4
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:09,968
I'm pleading innocent.

5
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:13,239
You'll be found guilty and
given the federal death penalty.

6
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,307
What defense
do you think I have?

7
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,810
You had no control of what
you were doing, much less

8
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:20,162
<i>remember doing it.</i>
<i>(coughing)</i>

9
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:22,915
<i>Betrayal was</i>
<i>the only thing that felt</i>

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,835
real to me.
I trusted you.

11
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,488
- Let me help you.
- I need your help.

12
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:32,258
(Jack): We investigated
your claims about Dr. Lecter.

13
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:36,128
We found nothing. You stood over
Cassie Boyle's body in that field and

14
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,932
- you described yourself to me.
- (Will): No, I described Hannibal Lecter.

15
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:42,935
- (Beverly): You think Will is innocent.
- I don't know what I think.

16
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:46,005
I think he still wants to save
lives. That's what I think.

(opera music)

24
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:53,232
Let me tell you the story of
a mild-mannered FBI instructor

25
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:56,735
who was asked to create a
psychological profile of a murderer -

26
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,023
Garret Jacob Hobbs,
the Minnesota Shrike.

27
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,609
He killed young women
that looked

28
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,362
just like his daughter.
He killed them

29
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,998
and he ate them.

30
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:13,002
Will Graham understood the way Hobbs
thought. That's how he caught him.

31
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:16,872
He shot Hobbs dead while he cut
<i>his daughter's throat.</i>

32
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,008
So, Will Graham was able
to save Abigail

33
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:21,093
Hobbs' life. But

34
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,162
the profile that he created

35
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:28,017
of her father was so vivid
that he couldn't escape it.

36
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:30,269
See.

37
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,770
See.

38
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:36,108
And in an unconscious state...
he killed

39
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:38,394
four more women.

40
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:42,815
Cassie Boyle.

41
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,403
Marissa Schuur.

42
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,305
Georgia Madchen.

43
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:52,708
Abigail Hobbs.

44
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,711
He was able to save
Abigail Hobbs

45
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:59,197
from her father, but he wasn't
able to save her from himself.

46
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:01,016
He killed her

47
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,035
and he ate her.

48
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,705
At the very least,
he ate her ear. What happened

49
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:09,975
to the rest of Abigail Hobbs
is locked away

50
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,062
in the recesses of Will Graham's
traumatized mind,

51
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,147
or so he would
have you believe.

52
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:19,902
Something else you should know
about Will Graham: he has

53
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:22,738
remarkable visual memory;

54
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:26,725
he's keenly insightful
to the human condition; and...

55
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:29,211
I would argue,
the smartest person

56
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,080
in this room.

57
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,082
He's capable

58
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,751
of creating
a psychological profile

59
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:39,004
of a completely different kind
of murderer.

60
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,593
One that would
become his alibi.

61
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:59,441
Moment of truth.

62
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:01,994
If I only knew
what the truth was.

63
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:04,480
There's nothing wrong
with your instincts.

64
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,982
My instincts have not yet
arrived at conviction.

65
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:11,103
Mine have, with the benefit
of no previous involvement

66
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,656
and no personal connections
to the accused.

67
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,659
- Meaning I can't be impartial?
- Of course you can be impartial,

68
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,012
but right now you're not.
You have to believe something,

69
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:24,166
as long as there is reason
and evidence to believe.

70
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,719
You've got reason;
you've got evidence.

71
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:29,722
Will Graham is playing a game.

72
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:33,125
I understand why that might be
hard for you to accept.

73
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:35,644
Do you?

74
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,564
It's easier to be a man who
missed his friend's suffering

75
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:40,766
than it is to be the head
of Behavioral Sciences

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,469
at the FBI who missed a killer
standing right in front of him.

77
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,555
There's a reason

78
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,142
that you're a witness for
the prosecution, Agent Crawford.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,310
Remind me what that reason is.

80
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:55,197
If you can't represent
your own beliefs,

81
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:57,649
represent the Bureau's.
(door opening)

82
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,419
(woman): Agent Crawford?

83
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:05,874
Let yourself
off the hook, Jack.

84
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:12,031
- How did you meet Will Graham? - I met
him at the opening of the Evil Minds

85
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:15,000
Research Museum. He didn't agree
with what we called it.

86
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:18,887
He told me that the title
mythologized banal and cruel men

87
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:21,890
who didn't deserve to be
thought of as super-villains.

88
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:25,227
- And what was your first impression?
- He was intelligent.

89
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:26,745
And arrogant.

90
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,948
And very likely
on the spectrum.

91
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:34,352
Which is why he wasn't
real FBI. He didn't pass

92
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,740
- the screening procedures.
- Yes.

93
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,110
- But you felt that he was qualified to
work in the field. - Under my supervision.

94
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:44,413
And you believed that he was valuable
because he could think like a killer?

95
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:47,800
- He could think like anybody.
- Sounds like a super-villain.

96
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,038
Five horrendous murders,
over 40 different

97
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,040
pieces of forensic
and physical evidence

98
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:58,410
that tell us that Will Graham can think
like a killer because he is one.

99
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,630
Rather than feel tormented
by the work he did,

100
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:06,435
Will Graham enjoyed the cover
his role at the FBI gave him

101
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:11,106
- to commit his terrible crimes.
- I don't believe that to be true.

102
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,663
Agent Crawford?

103
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:20,783
Will hated every second
of the work. He hated it.

104
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,085
He didn't fake that.

105
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,337
He hated it
and I kept making him do it.

106
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,674
Why then is it that when you offered him
an opportunity to quit, he refused?

107
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,110
(firmly): Because he was
saving lives.

108
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:36,765
I had been warned
by more than one person

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,651
that if I pushed Will,
I'd break him.

110
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:46,058
I put those checks and balances
in place, then ignored them.

111
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:49,812
And here we are.

112
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,304
What does Jack Crawford drink?

113
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:18,640
Whatever it is, I need to send
him a very expensive bottle.

114
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:21,126
He said I'm a killer
because he drove me insane.

115
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:23,128
No, he paved the road
for your defense.

116
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,130
Well, he didn't say
I'm innocent.

117
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:28,650
Innocence isn't a verdict,
Mr. Graham, but "not guilty" is.

118
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:31,353
This isn't law;
it's advertising.

119
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:34,022
Advertising trivializes;

120
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:36,808
it, uh, manipulates;
it's vulgar.

121
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:38,861
Boo-hoo.
So is the law.

122
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:42,414
We have to create desire
to find you "not guilty,"

123
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:45,200
which is nonexistent
in this courtroom right now.

124
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:48,203
We're manipulating people into
buying something they don't need.

125
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,006
- Mr. Brauer? - They don't want
your innocence. Thank you.

126
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,041
Unconsciousness
in a pretty package,

127
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:55,093
that I can sell.

128
00:08:57,096 --> 00:09:00,832
If I take the moral high ground
with you, I'll get you killed.

129
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,581
I think I opened your mail.

130
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:36,358
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

131
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:57,927
That was a good and brave
thing you did for Will today.

132
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,979
It may have cost me my job.

133
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,449
The prospect doesn't seem

134
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,768
to trouble you as much
as I would have thought.

135
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,290
Haven't felt better in weeks.

136
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:12,292
(glasses touched)
Clarity will do that.

137
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:17,497
Mm.

138
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,885
Tell me, Jack.

139
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,804
Was your testimony meant
to be a resignation?

140
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,841
There is something appealing

141
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,126
about walking away
from all of the noise.

142
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,099
I'm...

143
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,486
content to let the chips fall.

144
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,024
The magic door is
always attractive -

145
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:47,360
step through and leave
all your burdens behind.

146
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:55,251
I've given my life...
to death.

147
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:58,004
And now death has
followed you home...

148
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,542
...come to live
in your house.

149
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:04,761
(taking a breath)

150
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:11,251
Bella has kept our bedroom from
looking too much like a sickroom.

151
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,720
There are flowers,
but not too many.

152
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,555
You know.

153
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,774
She insists that there are
no pills in sight.

154
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:23,029
So, I've been thinking about
taking her to Italy where we met.

155
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,533
We could...

156
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,289
She could die there.

157
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,129
Jack.

158
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:43,600
You're not sick.

159
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:46,786
You don't have to go
into the ground with her.

160
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:54,811
When Bella's lost to you,
the FBI could still be there.

161
00:11:57,565 --> 00:12:00,400
You're telling me not
to commit professional suicide?

162
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:07,223
As a friend, I'm telling you
not to force an issue

163
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:11,361
for the short-term emotional
satisfaction it can have.

164
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,706
(inaudible)

165
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:32,015
...shrunken capillaries.
The ear was cut from a corpse

166
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,516
no more than 48 hours ago.

167
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,102
- Before the trial started.
- We fumed it all -

168
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:38,921
ear's clean, no prints
on either of the envelopes,

169
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:40,940
besides the courier,
paralegal, and lawyer.

170
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,409
We know
Will Graham didn't do it.

171
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:45,928
- It wouldn't surprise me.
- The timing's deliberate.

172
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:49,866
It was choreographed to drop the ear
at the beginning of Will's trial.

173
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,621
Such a gift has
great significance.

174
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,040
- A gift from who?
- Will claimed

175
00:12:57,074 --> 00:13:00,960
someone else committed
the crimes he's accused of.

176
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:04,147
He said that person was you.

177
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:06,833
Perhaps he was half right.

178
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:13,806
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

179
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,846
It seems you have an admirer.

180
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,732
You think someone sent me
an ear because they admire me?

181
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:25,234
The boundaries
of what's considered normal

182
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,571
are getting narrower.
Outside those boundaries,

183
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:31,074
this may be intended
as a helpful gesture.

184
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:34,577
How far would you go
to help me?

185
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:37,447
It hadn't occurred to me
to send you an ear.

186
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:42,485
But I'm grateful someone has.

187
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:47,340
Gratitude has
a short half-life.

188
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:50,093
So can doubt.

189
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,445
I have new thoughts
about who you are.

190
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:57,133
There may very well be
another killer.

191
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,387
(softly): I want there to be.

192
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,361
Some part of you
still suspects me.

193
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,680
I don't know what anyone is

194
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:13,199
capable of anymore,
least of all myself.

195
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,068
But, um...

196
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:20,740
...I know there is
no evidence against you.

197
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,558
There never was.

198
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:27,246
And accusing you
makes me look insane.

199
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:33,052
I'm not insane.

200
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,773
Not anymore.

201
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,394
And you may not be guilty.

202
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:51,904
This ear you were sent

203
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:55,241
is an opportunity.

204
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,945
If someone else is responsible
for your crimes,

205
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,963
perhaps he now wants
to be seen.

206
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:04,667
Why would he want
to be seen now?

207
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,553
He cares what happens to you.

208
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:14,454
The prosecution calls
Freddie *** to the stand.

209
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:32,956
I swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth, nothing but the truth.

210
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,098
Could you please describe

211
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,500
your relationship
with Abigail Hobbs?

212
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,894
We were very close.

213
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,890
I was helping her write a book
about surviving her father.

214
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,190
Did you ever discuss

215
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:54,194
- Will Graham with Abigail?
- Abigail told me

216
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:58,282
she believed Will Graham wanted
to kill her and cannibalize her

217
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:00,384
like her father wanted to do.

218
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,036
She was right.

219
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,242
I should've listened to her.

220
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:10,611
Do you blame yourself
for her death?

221
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,633
I blame Will Graham.

222
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:22,889
Thank you.

223
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,424
Your witness.

224
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,930
Miss Lounds.

225
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,201
Could you please...

226
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:38,939
remind me how many times
you've been sued for libel?

227
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,243
(quietly): Six.

228
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:44,861
Sorry?

229
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:49,065
- Six.
- Six.

230
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:53,287
And how many times
did you settle?

231
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,839
Six.

232
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,841
Six.

233
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,927
Thank you.
Nothing further.

234
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,632
The defense calls
Dr. Alana Bloom.

235
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,768
I believe Will's
empathy disorder...

236
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:12,606
...combined with the effects
of viral encephalitis...

237
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,794
Do we have to do this
like this?

238
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,683
I don't want the first time
you do this to be in court.

239
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:25,268
Dr. Bloom, weren't

240
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,621
you and the accused
romantically involved?

241
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,777
How is this relevant
to the case?

242
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:36,380
It's relevant
to your testimony.

243
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:39,115
In that court, your feelings,
your emotions,

244
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:42,052
your pro-everything-Will-Graham
will be on trial.

245
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:44,137
You get all starey
and non-blinky like that,

246
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:46,456
it'll undermine you and me,
but mainly him.

247
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:48,458
My testimony is based
on my professional--

248
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,228
- You are smitten
with the accused, Miss Bloom,

249
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,397
And it is adorable,
but not our brand of defense.

250
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:55,732
And Ms. Vega will
smell it on you

251
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:59,069
like you stepped in Young Adult and
tracked it into the courtroom.

252
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:03,857
Were you and Will Graham
involved romantically?

253
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,567
I have no romantic feelings
for Will Graham.

254
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,952
I have
a professional curiosity.

255
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,875
I like that.
"Professional curiosity."

256
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,593
It seems so...

257
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:26,329
heh, it seems so indifferent.

258
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:29,149
Unless you look like you're
lying when you say it.

259
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:30,851
But you didn't.

260
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,869
- (Jack): You've identified the ear?
- (Brian): We identified

261
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:51,538
- the knife that cut it off.
- It's Will Graham's.

262
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:54,524
The blade matches the cuts on Abigail
Hobbs's ear and on this one.

263
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:57,244
It was presented in court
as evidence, then it was sent

264
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,529
to the courthouse evidence room
where it was checked out

265
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:01,032
by the bailiff in Will's trial,
Andrew Sykes,

266
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:06,086
- and it never went back.
- Pretty good, right?

267
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:21,601
(quietly): Go.

268
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,844
(siren)

269
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:33,235
They wanted to give us a warm welcome
and to make sure we found something.

270
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:36,094
An arresting piece of theater.

271
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:38,963
Our bailiff was mounted
on a stag's head.

272
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:42,386
Glasgow smile. Killer lopped off
his ear and set him on fire.

273
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:44,569
Will Graham's greatest hits.

274
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,405
- Could we have been that wrong?
- About Will Graham? No.

275
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,910
We could not. He practically
takes selfies with his victims.

276
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,912
The evidence we found was
immediate and almost

277
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,998
presentational. May as well
have been gift-wrapped.

278
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:57,283
That's what Will said
about Cassie Boyle

279
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:00,370
when we found her in that field.
"Field kabuki."

280
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:03,373
There was no evidence before Will was
apprehended and there hasn't been any since.

281
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:05,091
He ate a girl's ear!

282
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:07,710
It was in his stomach. God knows
what else of her was in there.

283
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:09,829
We should've taken
a stool sample.

284
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:12,215
- Yes! We should have.
- Well, why didn't we?

285
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:16,553
- I was the one that said we should have.
- Knock it off.

286
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:19,055
What impact could
this have on Will's trial?

287
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:26,846
<i>This murder raises</i>
<i>serious doubts about</i>

288
00:21:26,864 --> 00:21:30,617
- the case against Will Graham.
- Your team provided the evidence.

289
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:33,620
- The overwhelming evidence.
- So you understand the significance

290
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:36,022
- of my questioning it.
- Agent Crawford,

291
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,626
we all heard your testimony. Are you
sure you're not just trying to assuage

292
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,045
- your own guilt?
- Yes, I'm sure.

293
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,797
- I'm not.
- Andrew Sykes was mutilated

294
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,417
in the exact same manner
Will Graham allegedly

295
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,586
mutilated his victims -
ways that have not been

296
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:53,022
made public. - Will Graham isn't saying
he didn't kill those people.

297
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:55,758
His lawyer is running
an unconsciousness defense.

298
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,312
In effect, he's admitting the acts,
but just not the responsibility.

299
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:03,066
Will's maintained his innocence all
along, in spite of memory gaps.

300
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,903
Whatever Mr. Brauer's strategy is,
this will offer a new line of defense.

301
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,405
That's for Mr. Brauer to tell
me, Agent Crawford, not you.

302
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,077
Yes, Your Honor.

303
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:23,286
(Chilton):<i>Will Graham</i>
<i>manifests publicly</i>

304
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:25,288
<i>as an introverted personality.</i>

305
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:28,341
<i>He would like us to believe he
places on the spectrum somewhere</i>

306
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,276
near Asperger's and autism.

307
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:33,813
Yet he also claims
an empathy disorder.

308
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:38,017
You choose your words
very carefully, Dr. Chilton.

309
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:40,019
You chose the word "claims."

310
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,439
Will Graham has
never been diagnosed.

311
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:45,608
He will not allow anyone
to test him.

312
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,610
He has carefully constructed

313
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:50,430
a persona to hide
his real nature from the world.

314
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:52,248
He wears it so well

315
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:54,433
even Jack Crawford could
not see past it.

316
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,703
(Vega): But you did?

317
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:59,906
Mr. Graham and I had
no personal relationship

318
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,093
for him to manipulate.
I have objectively examined him

319
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:06,112
and the crimes of which he is

320
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,331
accused.
These murders

321
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:11,951
were measured and controlled.

322
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,587
The confused man Will Graham
presents to the world

323
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,456
could not commit those crimes,

324
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,742
because that man is a fiction.

325
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:23,813
<i>So,</i>

326
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,516
you discount the encephalitis
he was suffering as a cause?

327
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:30,236
He managed his illness with
the help of his neurologist,

328
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:32,272
whom he murdered
for his trouble.

329
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,527
Is Will Graham
an intelligent psychopath?

330
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:39,963
There is not yet a name

331
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,914
for whatever Will Graham is.

332
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:44,734
He kills methodically,

333
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:48,871
and I believe would kill again,
given the opportunity.

334
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:53,476
Thank you,
Dr. Chilton.

335
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,511
Your witness.

336
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,436
Dr. Chilton,

337
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,606
Will Graham spent his time
catching murderers for the FBI.

338
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,691
You don't see a contradiction
between that

339
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:10,777
and your description
of a coldblooded killer?

340
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:12,612
No, I do not.

341
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:16,515
Will Graham is driven by vanity
and his own whims.

342
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:19,619
He has a very high opinion
of his intelligence.

343
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:22,288
Ergo, he caught
the other killers

344
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:24,123
simply to prove

345
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:26,659
he was smarter
than all of them too.

346
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:32,799
Saving lives is just as arousing
as ending them.

347
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,817
He likes to play God.

348
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:52,068
(keypad beeping)

349
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:55,271
(door buzzer)

350
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:32,759
- My admirer?
- Yes.

351
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:41,600
The forensic report
from the crime scene.

352
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:44,120
What do you see?

353
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:18,504
(soft ambient pulse)

354
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,663
(steady heartbeat)

355
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:45,465
(door opening and closing)

356
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:54,724
I shoot Mr. Sykes once,

357
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:56,392
collapsing lungs,

358
00:26:56,443 --> 00:27:00,196
tearing through his heart's
aorta and pulmonary arteries.

359
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,532
(silenced gunshot)

360
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:09,038
He will die
believing we were friends.

361
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,742
It is his last thought.

362
00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:20,633
(panting)

363
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:27,473
His death isn't personal.

364
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,240
He is merely the ink
from which flows my poem.

365
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:00,256
My tribute.

366
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,877
This is my design.

367
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,798
It's not the same killer.

368
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:14,554
He murdered his victim first,
and then mutilated him.

369
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:21,477
Cassie Boyle's lungs were removed
when she was still breathing.

370
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:24,263
Georgia Madchen was burned
alive. What I...

371
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,982
what... what I found

372
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:29,402
of Abigail was cut off
while her heart was beating.

373
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:35,691
Then this...
is blunt reproduction?

374
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:37,793
You knew that already.

375
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,948
Would've liked
to have been wrong.

376
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:44,250
Occam's broom.

377
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:49,338
You intentionally ignored facts
that refute your argument

378
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:52,458
- hoping nobody'd notice.
- You noticed.

379
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,677
Mm-hmm.

380
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,068
I wanted to dispel your doubts
once and for all.

381
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:06,305
My doubts about what?

382
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,658
Me.

383
00:29:12,863 --> 00:29:16,532
I want you to believe
in the best of me,

384
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,951
just as I believe
in the best of you.

385
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,822
This crime offered us both
reasonable doubt.

386
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,092
It offered us a distraction.

387
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:30,846
Maybe this acolyte is giving
you your path to freedom.

388
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,882
Even Jack is ready
to believe, Will.

389
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,859
It would be a lie.

390
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:53,819
- I don't want you to be here.
- I don't want me to be here

391
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:55,938
- either.
- Then you have a choice.

392
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:58,491
This killer wrote you a poem.

393
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:05,331
Are you going to let his love
go to waste?

394
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,279
I'm confused.

395
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,121
You're going to abandon
your defense strategy,

396
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:23,441
the entire case
you've built, mid-trial.

397
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:25,777
Exciting, isn't it?

398
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:28,113
And this seems reasonable
to you?

399
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:30,448
It's not only reasonable;

400
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:32,450
it's fashionable.

401
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:34,703
There's a killer on the loose,

402
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:36,821
demonstrating all the hallmarks
of Will Graham's

403
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:39,457
- alleged murders.
- Do you think this killer

404
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:42,460
- committed the crimes that you're accused of?
- Don't answer that,

405
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:44,479
not in front of me.
It's inconsequential.

406
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:47,699
- But is it true? - You're being awfully
high and mighty, Dr. Bloom.

407
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,701
Very ivory tower,
very reductive.

408
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:53,972
Very far from the point, which is
the exoneration of your friend

409
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:56,057
- Will Graham.
- And the point you're trying

410
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:58,259
- to make is reasonable doubt.
- That's a win, yes.

411
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:01,262
- The best you can hope for is mistrial.
- That's also a win.

412
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:03,815
You won't be able to plead
unconsciousness again.

413
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,167
Your fast, triumphant diagnosis

414
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:08,302
of unconsciousness was
the best play we had.

415
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:11,139
Now we have a better play.
Needless to say,

416
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,692
I won't be calling you
to the witness stand.

417
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:16,828
Who's taking the stand
in my place?

418
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,368
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

419
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:43,138
and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

420
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:53,448
Good morning, Doctor.

421
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:57,235
Please describe your
relationship with Will Graham.

422
00:31:57,286 --> 00:32:00,021
I was asked by Jack Crawford
to monitor Will's

423
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,624
emotional well-being
while he worked on cases.

424
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:05,026
I was never officially
his psychiatrist.

425
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:07,078
If you weren't his
psychiatrist, what were you?

426
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:09,130
I was meant
to be his stability.

427
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:14,552
- I failed him in that.
- How did you fail him?

428
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,408
I was unable to determine
if Will's condition was due

429
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:23,895
to mental illness or stress
from his work at the FBI.

430
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,983
My mistake was
never considering his innocence

431
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:33,304
until the murder of a bailiff
from this courthouse.

432
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:36,274
And how did you know
about that, Dr. Lecter?

433
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:39,611
I have been asked to consult
on the case by Jack Crawford.

434
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:42,614
He wanted a profile
of the bailiff's killer.

435
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,783
So, you believe

436
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:47,285
the bailiff's murder was
committed by the same person

437
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,988
guilty of Will Graham's
alleged crimes, yes?

438
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:53,241
Profiles aren't evidence; they're opinion.
This is hearsay.

439
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:55,627
I will allow it.

440
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:58,630
Thank you, Your Honor.

441
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:02,283
I believe there are alarming
similarities in the crimes, yes.

442
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:04,269
Will Graham accused you

443
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:06,855
of the crimes for which
he now stands trial, and yet

444
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:09,924
here you are, testifying

445
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:12,593
on his behalf for the defense.

446
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:16,197
Will rightfully couldn't
accept these actions to be his.

447
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,770
A mind faced with the possibility
of committing such deeds

448
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:24,322
will find an alternative reality
to believe in.

449
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:27,091
You don't blame him for that?

450
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,110
No.

451
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:31,612
Will Graham is

452
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,282
and will always be my friend.

453
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,768
Your witness.

454
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:40,672
Dr. Lecter,
what was the cause

455
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:43,124
of death
in the bailiff's murder?

456
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:46,127
A bullet to the heart.

457
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:48,379
Mm. And in Will Graham's

458
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:50,682
victims, or alleged victims,
what was

459
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:53,634
their cause of death?

460
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:55,620
Mutilation.

461
00:33:55,654 --> 00:33:58,523
That's very different
from a bullet.

462
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,024
No two crimes

463
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:02,076
of any killer are going
to be exactly the same.

464
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:06,698
The similarities-- - Your Honor,
the witness's personal beliefs and biases

465
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:09,200
are driving his conclusions.
There are clearly

466
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:11,319
two different killers
and two different cases.

467
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:15,006
Your Honor, there are sufficient
similarities to consider this a defense.

468
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,428
I'm ruling this defense
inadmissible, Mr. Brauer.

469
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:23,431
Thank you, Your Honor.

470
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:26,784
(judge): All previous testimony on the
matter will be stricken from the record.

00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,456
(Jack): So, it appears that the judge
was murdered in his chambers

473
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,379
and then he was hauled out here
to be put on display.

474
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,800
Not only is justice blind;
it's mindless and heartless.

475
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,152
How did the killer get
so close?

476
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:24,139
No sign of a struggle.
Mutilation was post-mortem.

477
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:26,675
He was shot in the chest
just like the bailiff.

478
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,678
Can't see the, uh, entry wound
because he removed the heart.

479
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,481
But there is an exit wound. No slug
- must have taken it with him.

480
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:35,734
A trophy.

481
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:37,352
Doctor.

482
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:43,441
With this judge's death,
there will be no verdict.

483
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,777
No ending.
It'll start again,

484
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,113
like the trial never happened.

485
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:50,448
But why?

486
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:54,286
Psychopathic violence is
predominantly goal-oriented,

487
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,122
a means to a very
particular end.

488
00:36:57,156 --> 00:37:00,625
So, the killer wanted
a mistrial?

489
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:04,662
It's an elegant,
if rather unorthodox, solution.

490
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,832
He spares Will a guilty verdict
and his life for the moment.

491
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,302
- Yes.
- The question is,

492
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:12,604
is it the same killer?

493
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:14,856
Is Will still on trial,
in your mind?

494
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,875
The use of a gun;

495
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,444
death first, mutilation last.

496
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,233
I feel like St. Peter ready
to deny Will for the third time.

497
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,786
I'm not sure this is
the same killer, Jack.

498
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:34,492
Excuse me.

499
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:43,418
The killer exerted careful
control of the environment.

500
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,588
He left very little
evidence behind.

501
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,423
Jeez, Jack.

502
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,925
The trial was supposed
to put an end to this.

503
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,378
Instead, the circus has
just added another ring.

504
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,547
- And we're the clowns.
- Who's "we,"

505
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,100
Jack?

506
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,269
I got off track.

507
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,390
You have to force yourself
out of this train of thought.

508
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,392
The trial was going wrong

509
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,161
before this murder.
The trial was going wrong

510
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:12,897
because you wanted
to believe Will Graham.

511
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,084
Who is he to you that makes you
want to risk everything for him?

512
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:20,238
A very cogent reminder of the pitfalls of
having faith in one's fellow man, thank you.

513
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,926
Everyone at one point or another
has to leave somebody behind.

514
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,928
You've got to cut him loose.

515
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:28,947
Otherwise, the someone
being left behind,

516
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:31,749
today or tomorrow...

517
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,551
is gonna be you.

(Hannibal): Will.

524
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:15,870
I was hoping the verdict would have
helped focus your mind to get better;

525
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:20,308
make what happened to you
less terrifying and confusing.

526
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:25,613
I can't exactly blame
your lawyer.

527
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,283
Faith in any sort
of legal justice has never been

528
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:30,385
any more comforting
than a nightlight.

529
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,807
There are so many
miscarriages of justice

530
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:39,811
when it comes to
identifying a psychopath.

531
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:42,397
You could easily have been
misdiagnosed.

532
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:46,234
I've already been misdiagnosed.

533
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,570
Not by the court.

534
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:52,190
No. Not yet.

535
00:40:57,613 --> 00:41:01,583
I walked out of that courtroom,
and I could hear my blood,

536
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:03,334
like, uh...

537
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,906
...a hollow drumming
of wings.

538
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,075
And I had the...

539
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,428
absurd feeling

540
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:15,964
that whoever this killer is...

541
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,302
...he walked out
of that courtroom with me.

542
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:29,727
He's gonna reach out to me.

543
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,648
What does he want?

544
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:42,006
He wants to know me.

545
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:51,416
What do you want?

546
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:58,339
I want to save you.

547
