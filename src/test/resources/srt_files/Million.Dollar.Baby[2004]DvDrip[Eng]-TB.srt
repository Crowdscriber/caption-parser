00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,598
You got him! You got him!

3
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,237
Only ever met one man I wouldn't want to fight.

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,673
I can't stop that.

5
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,591
Here. Get out of here, you useless tit.

6
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,797
When I met him, he was already
the best cut man in the business.

7
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,074
Can you stop it?

8
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,630
Started training and managing in the '60s,
but he never lost his gift.

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,755
No.

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,511
Let me have a look at him.

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,318
He's fine. He's fine.

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,595
Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,159
I'll give you one more round.

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,758
Seconds out. Let's go.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,035
What do we do? Tell me what to do.

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,156
You let him hit you.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,433
Sometimes there's just nothing you can do.

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,589
Cut's too wide too close to the bone.

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,512
Maybe you got a severed vein,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,751
or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,791
There are all kinds
of combinations you come up against

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,269
down in the different layers of meat,

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,271
and Frankie knew how to work every one.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,032
People love violence.

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,154
They slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,475
Same people claim to love boxing.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,233
They got no idea what it is.

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,470
Boxing is about respect -

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,391
getting it for yourself,

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,074
and taking it away from the other guy.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,872
I'll warm up the car.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,473
Mr. Dunn?

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,551
Hmm. I owe you money?

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,834
No, sir.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,273
I know your mama?

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,316
Don't rightly know, sir.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,799
Then what is it you want?

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,519
I was on the undercard. I won my fight, too.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,953
Maggie Fitzgerald.

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,508
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,113
Did you happen to see it?

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,475
- Nope.
- I did pretty good.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,915
Thought you might
be interested in training me.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,718
I don't train girls.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,509
Maybe you should.
People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,353
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,477
It's a mistake.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,675
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,194
Just push, will you?

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,271
What did Hogan want?

51
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,873
Offered us a title shot.

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,077
- 'Bout time.
- I turned him down flat.

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,948
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,436
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,954
Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,031
You lose it, it may not come around again.

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,113
Now, two or three more fights,
and we'll be ready.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,156
Whatever you say, Frankie.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,399
Frankie liked to say
that boxing is an unnatural act,

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,199
that everything in boxing is backwards.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,316
Sometimes,

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,595
best way to deliver a punch is step back.

63
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,639
Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,472
Annie, too.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,717
Other than that... you know what I want.

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,439
There's no use me repeating myself.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,116
But step back too far you ain't fightin' at all.

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,676
Thank you for your prayers.

69
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,716
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

70
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,189
Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.

71
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,679
Made me weep.

72
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,432
What's confusing you this week?

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,988
Oh, it's the same old one God, three God thing.

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,197
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

75
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,671
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

76
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,878
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

77
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,669
You only come to Mass every day to wind me
up. It's not going to happen this morning.

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,829
Well, I'm confused.

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,273
- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,238
Then here's your answer: There's one God.

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,072
Anything else? Cos I'm busy.

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,754
- What about the Holy Ghost?
- An expression of God's love.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,229
- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid.

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,039
Well, what is he, then?
Does that make him a demigod?

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,509
There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan!

86
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,311
Did you write to your daughter?

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,435
Absolutely.

88
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,637
Now you're lying to a priest.
You know what? Take a day off.

89
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,676
Don't come to Mass tomorrow.

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,956
Some people'd say the most
important thing a fighter can have is heart.

91
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,316
Frankie'd say,
"Show me a fighter with nothing but a heart,

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,233
and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating. "

93
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,509
Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,591
My name's Dangerous Dillard

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,798
Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch
out of Broward County, Texas!

96
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,671
Danger showed up a couple of years back.

97
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,629
He'd come visiting LA with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.

98
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,748
Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,914
Danger looked for him for about a week
'fore he introduced himself.

100
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,995
Hey. You know, I gots nothin' against niggers...

101
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,198
Well, that's nice to hear.

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,633
Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,871
Lots of people where I comes from does,

104
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,909
but my mama taught me not to cause hurt
to no man, niggers or not.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,958
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,079
Just one of those questions,
but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,551
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the Welterweight Champion of the world.

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,313
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,

109
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,439
to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!

110
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,114
Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.

111
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,993
You got to have at least one fight to be ranked.

112
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,991
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

113
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,752
Hey you a bad man huh?

114
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
Hey, come on, get in the ring.
Go a round with me.

115
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,913
Shawrelle...

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,353
I will.

117
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,714
Leave him alone.

118
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,959
Danger, you go on back to training.

119
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,190
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

120
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,873
Ow!

121
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,712
Them some nice tights, Danger.

122
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,155
I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.

123
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,390
Those pants look real pretty on you bro.

124
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,471
Give his mama back her tights.

125
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,314
Shawrelle Berry
had a left hook that would move a tank,

126
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,437
but he had a heart the size of a split pea.

127
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,513
Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.

128
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,797
Bobby wanted to move to Florida
and Frankie wanted some security.

129
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,599
Bobby died while he was packing.

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,434
Frankie found out most gyms lose money.

131
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,592
I thought I told you I didn't want Danger
working out here anymore.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,591
Oh, he ain't hurtin' nothin', Frankie.

133
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,318
Well, he's hurtin' me.

134
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,951
Breakin' my heart watchin' him
punch the air like it's going to punch back.

135
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,793
And how many times have I got to
tell you that bleach is bleach?

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,598
Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff?

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,830
You don't always have to buy expensive stuff.

138
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,797
It smells better, Frankie.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,917
Bleach smells like bleach.

140
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,909
Hey, Scrap.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,718
Hey, Mr. Willie.

142
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,116
Hey, nice fight last night.

143
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,634
Big Willie.

144
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,835
Hey, Sally.

145
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,559
- Nice fight.
- thanks, man.

146
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,312
People are talkin'.

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,311
"Ta cul fionn is dha shuil ghlasa agat. "

148
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,994
What the hell kind of language is that?

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,512
What do you want?

150
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,034
I just thought you might like to know

151
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,078
you got a fighter out there
not talking to another manager.

152
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,914
Not talking to another manager?

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,274
Not just any manager.

154
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,874
Mickey Mack.

155
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,789
You came in here to tell me
that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

156
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,314
Not a word. Neither one of 'em.

157
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,396
I'm trying to read here.

158
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,755
Well, if you think that's more important...

159
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,395
Who's your new girl?

160
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,590
What?

161
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,072
Jesus Christ.

162
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,513
Better hurry up.

163
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,592
If she keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

164
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,832
you�re wasting your time.

165
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,037
- I told you I don't train girls.
- Thought you might change your mind.

166
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,429
There's dozens of trainers who train girls.

167
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,351
You won't have any trouble finding one.

168
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,635
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

169
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,508
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

170
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,319
- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.

171
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,994
If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?

172
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,234
No.

173
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,191
I might as well just keep calling you it.

174
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,198
She came from
southwestern Missouri,

175
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,432
the hills outside
the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia,

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,310
set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere
between nowhere and good-bye.

177
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,914
She grew up knowing one thing,

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,752
she was trash.

179
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,188
It's for my dog.

180
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,673
She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,672
Workin' the bag, boss.

182
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
Not your boss... and that bag's working you.

183
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,357
Give her her money back.

184
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,590
You sure?

185
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,511
How much did she pay?

186
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,794
Six months.

187
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,472
Oh, Jesus Christ.

188
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,073
No I'll just give it back.

189
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,549
No. Don't be a smart-ass now, will you?

190
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,872
Woman thinks I'd throw away six months' dues
just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

191
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,236
- But just don't encourage her, understand?
- OK.

192
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,356
And... And what's Danger doing out there?

193
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,510
What's he lookin' at?

194
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,473
Looks like a bottle of water.

195
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,915
He paid his dues?

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,797
Dues?

197
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,394
Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?

198
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,596
Get out of my office.

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,879
Fuck me.

200
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,598
Can't think of it as a bag.

201
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,997
I'm not a trainer,

202
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,911
but I can show you this, if you'd like.

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,513
Appreciate any help I can get.

204
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,068
OK. Let's see.

205
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,118
What you want to do is
you want to think of it as a man, see?

206
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,553
And he's constantly moving.

207
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,191
He's moving towards you. He's moving around
you. He's moving away from you, all right?

208
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,669
You don't want to hit him
when he's coming towards you

209
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,671
cos what he's going to do is push you back.

210
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,673
He's going to smother your punches,
take your balance, right?

211
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,911
So watch him carefully.
Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving,

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,709
and keep one shoulder back
so you're always ready to fire a power shot.

213
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,153
Right? Go ahead, now.

214
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,912
Good, good. Keep rotating.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,991
Keep moving. That's it.

216
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,038
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

217
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,792
Come on around.

218
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,552
Keep moving, keep moving.

219
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,834
Good, good, good, good.

220
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,071
- Like that?
- Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots.

221
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,515
Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.

222
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,235
That's good. That's good.

223
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,029
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,831
You do have a speed bag?

225
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

226
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,431
All right, you go on home now.

227
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,873
I'll walk out with you?

228
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,428
No, I am home. Want to see?

229
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,919
Yeah.

230
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,632
It's nice.

231
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,435
Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

232
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,511
No, just...

233
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,830
pull the door closed when you leave.

234
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,996
Thank you.

235
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,834
If there's magic in boxing,

236
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,708
it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance,

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,715
beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.

238
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,950
It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.

239
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,915
OK, come on. Watch the footwork.

240
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,918
Hey, Flip.

241
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,831
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

242
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,195
I think I found somebody you can beat.

243
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,032
I don't fights women.

244
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,714
Why not, bro?
It's perfect, bro, cos you know why?

245
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,836
Cos she - nah, you- you could fight to him

246
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,356
and then you could kiss to him, and then
you could fight to him one more time.

247
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,829
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

248
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,832
- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.

249
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,319
thanks, bro. That's a girl, man?

250
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,755
I'll be damn, Flip. I think you right.

251
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,673
Look at her little bitty titties.
They're like mosquito bites.

252
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,751
Geez, man, there's barely even a mouthful.

253
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,831
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

254
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,071
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

255
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,116
Oh! Oh!

256
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,190
Canvas has titties.

257
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,431
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

258
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,992
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

259
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,676
Come on, bro, the floor is having titties?
That's funny, bro.

260
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,273
Shut up, man.

261
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,032
What you laughing at?

262
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,714
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

263
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,955
Yo, when they start making those tights for men,
Flippy?

264
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,792
Punk.

265
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,230
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

266
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,555
- I'll give you a rubdown.
- Oh, I can't, Frankie.

267
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,030
My middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Gracie I'd drive her.

268
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,951
Oh. Something wrong with Gracie's car?

269
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,589
She hates that car. Wants the old one back,
but the dealer won't do it.

270
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,592
- Said he's already got a buyer.
- Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

271
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,750
I'd appreciate that.

272
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,193
OK.

273
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,315
Thanks.

274
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,913
See you later.

275
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,511
The man's a rubdown whore.

276
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,318
Today he doesn't want one?

277
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,152
You ever do any work around here?

278
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,471
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

279
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,636
Little girl seems to be coming along.

280
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,869
Yeah.

281
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,633
It's almost like someone's been helping her.

282
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,995
She might just be a natural.

283
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,310
Looks like she's got something.

284
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,914
She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.

285
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,757
I wonder how the hell she got that.

286
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,717
I wonder.

287
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,716
I'm going to need that speed bag back.

288
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,552
- This bag?
- Yes, that bag.

289
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,269
That's my bag, and if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

290
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,396
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

291
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,879
Yes, yes, it is.

292
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,633
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

293
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,395
I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.

294
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,712
Yeah. Well,
I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.

295
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,153
I understand.

296
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,071
Yeah.

297
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,994
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

298
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,952
- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.

299
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,998
You're going to find a trainer,
either here or somewhere else,

300
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,718
that's going to want to train a girl.

301
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,394
It's the latest freak show out there.

302
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,035
But the trouble is, they're going to be wasting
your time because you're too old.

303
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,111
I don't feel that old.

304
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,715
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

305
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,315
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

306
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,391
How old are you?

307
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,234
- 31... until my next birthday.
- Oh well, there you go.

308
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,639
31.

309
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,030
You wouldn't start training
to be a ballerina at 31, now, would you?

310
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,588
Already been working it for three years.

311
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,398
And you can't hit a speed bag?

312
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,311
What kind of training is that?

313
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,311
I've never had any, boss.

314
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,358
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

315
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,715
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

316
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,792
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

317
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,871
Yeah.

318
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,952
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

319
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,836
You're not going to cry now, are you?

320
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,717
No, sir.

321
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,279
Yeah.

322
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,998
Here.

323
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,832
Keep the goddamn thing.

324
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,595
- No, you need it.
- No, take the bag.

325
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,636
I haven't seen it in 20 years, anyway.

326
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,756
I've had three since then.

327
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,434
Just uh... just enjoy it, will you?

328
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,351
I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.

329
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,395
Yeah.

330
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,152
Just don't lose it.

331
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,031
Yeah, I know, Hogan.

332
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,078
Your guy's the champ, so we don't split fifties.

333
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,673
But if I don't see 40%...

334
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,788
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40,
or don't call me back at all.

335
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,639
Hey, Willie.

336
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,188
- Hey, Frankie.
- Is something wrong?

337
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,316
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.

338
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,595
I- I know you don't like people dropping in.

339
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,559
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

340
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,790
I want to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.

341
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,757
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

342
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,719
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

343
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,950
Gracie broke out and cried
when she saw it.

344
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,996
Really?

345
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,719
I also needed to talk with you about business.

346
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,759
Oh, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan.
We're all set for September.

347
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,671
Everything but the split.

348
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,637
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

349
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,993
What?

350
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,430
Willie, the... the title is just two fights away.

351
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,839
It ain't that. It's...

352
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,639
It's like you said, I got one shot.

353
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,632
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

354
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,554
I need somebody in the action,
who can make things happen.

355
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,755
And I gotta make the change before the fight.

356
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,593
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

357
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,117
So, I get you to the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

358
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,713
Only way he'd do it.

359
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,631
I'm sorry, Frankie.

360
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,154
I know how long
you've been waiting on a title.

361
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,878
I wish it could've been with me.

362
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,150
Mickey Mack's a businessman.

363
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,515
He can't teach you nothing.

364
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,319
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

365
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,709
There's some things
people just don't want to hear.

366
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,674
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,

367
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,629
to fight me for the
Welterweight Championship of the whole world.

368
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,393
Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

369
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,438
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

370
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,950
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

371
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,439
Danger, while you thinking about that punch,
I'll be right back.

372
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,632
I'm... I'm thinking how
I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr. Scrap.

373
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,994
No one had the heart
to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.

374
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,359
I heard about Willie.

375
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,749
That's cold. That's dead cold.

376
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,753
Course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

377
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,593
Yeah. At least I can see through both eyes.

378
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,148
Yeah, mm-hm. Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

379
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,073
Well, I've got the gym.

380
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,913
Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,150
Willie tell you why?

382
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,593
It was Mickey.

383
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,193
Mickey's got the connections.

384
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,556
It ain't about connections, Frank.
It's about you not believing in him.

385
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,279
Well, I found him.
I stuck with him for eight years.

386
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,351
How's that for not believing in him?

387
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,796
You could've got him a title fight two years ago.
Hell, he knew that.

388
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,393
I'm amazed he stayed this long.

389
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,995
Yeah, well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

390
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,631
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head, not protect him?

391
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,109
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship?

392
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,155
Yeah.

393
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,629
Oh, well, now it makes sense.

394
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,553
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

395
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,518
You were a hell of a fighter,
a lot better than Willie.

396
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,353
He get you a title fight
or did he just bust you out,

397
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,319
banging your head against other people's fists
until you lost your eye?

398
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,436
I had my shot.

399
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,193
I went out swinging and no man can say I didn't.

400
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,556
Yeah, well, I remember.
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter

401
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,189
spending the second half of his life
cleaning up other people's spit.

402
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,554
Yeah right.

403
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,392
Right. You're the smart one.

404
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,630
You're the one learning Greek.

405
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,794
It's Gaelic.

406
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,997
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

407
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,798
How do you say that in Gaelic?

408
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,437
Sorry.

409
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,752
Thanks.

410
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,276
Boxing is an unnatural act,

411
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,511
cos everything in it is backwards.

412
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,873
You want to move to the left,

413
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,794
you don't step left you push on the right toe.

414
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,275
To move right you use your left toe.

415
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,796
Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do,

416
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,791
you step into it.

417
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,750
Oh my God! He hits the
champ with a right hand and the champ's down!

418
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,353
Ladies and gentlemen,
the ref has ended the count.

419
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,318
And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world!

420
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,358
It's unbelievable how this
has taken place tonight.

421
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,079
But there you have it folks, a new champion.

422
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,033
Everything in boxing is backwards.

423
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,358
Want a cheeseburger?

424
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,431
- You bought me a cheeseburger?
- Yeah.

425
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,715
I never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

426
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,792
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

427
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,553
Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.

428
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,712
You watch the fight?

429
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,950
Yeah, I watched it.

430
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,679
Willie did good.

431
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,751
That's what you've got to say?

432
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,354
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

433
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,077
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up.

434
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,593
That's good work.

435
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,193
You watch it?

436
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,111
Yeah, I got HBO.

437
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,233
How can you afford HBO?

438
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,630
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

439
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,029
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson

440
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,918
at the Stadium Club in Tupelo Mississippi.

441
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,831
That true?

442
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,993
Yeah. Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

443
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,593
Don't you remember nothing?

444
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,511
Well, I remember walking halfway,

445
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,272
and thinking I was going to be lynched.

446
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,273
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

447
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,112
Yeah, well, I got a ride.

448
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,875
The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.
I had to walk back two miles.

449
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,713
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

450
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,518
Hmm.

451
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,398
What the hell's that?

452
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,233
It's her birthday.

453
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,434
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

454
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,159
So, it's your birthday, huh?

455
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,071
How old does that make you?

456
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,676
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn...
and I'm here celebrating the fact

457
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,038
that I spent another year scraping dishes
and waitressing, what I've been doing since 13.

458
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,272
And according to you, I'll be 37
'fore I can even throw a decent punch...

459
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,397
which after working this speed bag for a month
and getting nowhere,

460
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,516
I now realize may be God's simple truth.

461
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,194
Other truth is, my brother's in prison,

462
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,716
my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her babies is still alive,

463
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,519
my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

464
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,831
If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home,

465
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,071
find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

466
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,955
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

467
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,076
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

468
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,630
That enough truth to suit you?

469
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,718
This your speed bag?

470
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,872
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

471
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,279
OK.

472
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,191
Just hold it, hold it.

473
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,750
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

474
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,193
No. Sorry.

475
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,714
- You're in a position to negotiate?
- Yes, sir,

476
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,759
because I know if you train me right,
I'm going to be a champ.

477
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,838
I seen you looking at me.

478
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,433
Yeah, out of pity.

479
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,999
Don't you say that!

480
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,719
Don't you say that if it ain't true!

481
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,518
I want a trainer.

482
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,636
I don't want charity

483
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,472
and I don't want favors.

484
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,630
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

485
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,590
Stop, stop, stop.

486
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,432
Goddamn it, stop.

487
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,913
What the hell are you doing?

488
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,912
OK.

489
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,309
If I'm going to take you on...

490
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,913
You won't never regret it.

491
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,228
Look, just listen to me.

492
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,118
- If I take you on...
- I promise I'll work so hard.

493
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,589
God, this is a mistake already.

494
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,036
Mm-mm. I'm listening, boss.

495
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,396
If I take you on, you don't say anything.

496
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,232
You don't question me.

497
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,313
You don't ask why, you don't say anything
except maybe, "Yes, Frankie. "

498
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,472
And I'm going to try to forget
the fact that you're a girl.

499
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,788
It's all I ask.

500
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,348
And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

501
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,034
- All righty.
- We got a deal.

502
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,071
No, not quite.

503
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,310
I'm going to teach you how to fight.

504
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,039
Then, we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

505
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,712
I hate to argue with you, but...

506
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,870
Don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it.

507
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,430
I teach you all you need to know, and then
you go off and make a million dollars.

508
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,956
I don't care you get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

509
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,318
I don't want to hear about it either way,
that's how it is. It's the only way I'll do it.

510
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,314
All right.

511
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,554
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is, you never move your feet.

512
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,751
You stand there just flatfooted.
You've got to move your feet.

513
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,718
That's one of the best things
I'm going to be able to teach you.

514
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,315
So, here's what you do. You get yourself...

515
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,152
Bend your knees a little bit.

516
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,832
Get in an athletic position.

517
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,070
Look like you're going to hit something.

518
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,073
- Move 'em how boss?
- Uh, just, you go hit the bag.

519
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,518
- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?

520
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,591
OK, you did two things wrong.

521
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,195
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

522
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,510
Now, what I want you to do...

523
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,352
It's not about hitting it hard.

524
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,998
It's how good you hit it.

525
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,911
So, watch me.

526
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,594
And you can count with me if you want,
just count;

527
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,710
on a one count, I hit right through the bag.

528
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,870
- Can you show me that again?
- You just...

529
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,030
Just say "one," please.

530
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,712
- One.
- OK, one.

531
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,392
- One.
- OK.

532
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,597
Yeah, just say one.
That's good. That's good.

533
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,636
Then I move over to my right foot.

534
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,439
You'll see my weight is
shifting to my right foot.

535
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,116
Then I hit it with the back of my hand,
sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

536
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,599
Then I come over,

537
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,036
and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

538
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,636
And ice pick maneuver again, and I come
over on my right foot and hit it right, left.

539
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,029
Don't watch anything but my feet.

540
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,678
One, two, three...

541
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,879
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

542
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,316
Need to show 'em how to
stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.

543
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,869
To make a fighter,
you got to strip 'em down to bare wood.

544
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,393
Rest when you're dead.

545
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,198
Come here.

546
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,188
You can't just tell 'em
to "forget everything you know. "

547
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,635
You got to make 'em forget it in their bones.

548
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,234
Left uppercut, left, left.

549
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,958
Make 'em so tired they only listen to you,

550
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,794
only hear your voice,
only do what you say and nothing else.

551
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,035
Move your feet.

552
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,350
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

553
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,994
Show 'em how to keep their balance

554
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,752
and take it away from the other guy.

555
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,353
Not so low. Look at me.

556
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,317
Right hook and just turn right over...

557
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,476
How to generate
momentum off your right toe

558
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,837
and how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.

559
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,679
How to fight backing up,

560
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,558
so that the other guy
doesn't want to come after you.

561
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,995
Then you got to show 'em all over again -

562
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,790
over and over and over till they think
they were born that way.

563
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,913
Shift. Shift away. Shift away.

564
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,037
OK, that's enough for today.

565
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,998
Good work. Good girl.

566
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,714
Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?

567
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,239
Hey.

568
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,231
Hey come here.

569
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,552
You're not breathing.

570
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,792
Hate to disagree with you.

571
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,952
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

572
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,393
Now, stop doing that.

573
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,232
OK.

574
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,914
But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?

575
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,150
I mean, for a girl.

576
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,798
I don't train girls.

577
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,230
Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?

578
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,630
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

579
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,156
I'd like to, but you've
been keeping me too busy.

580
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,237
Got any family, boss?

581
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,435
What?

582
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,872
You been spending all this time with me.
I didn't know if you had any.

583
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,273
No.

584
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,238
Well, I've got a daughter - Katy.

585
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,072
That's family.

586
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,879
We're not exactly close.

587
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,678
How much she weigh?

588
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,159
What?

589
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,595
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

590
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,879
Yeah.

591
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,315
Not very big.

592
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,391
Used to be real athletic.

593
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,550
Don't know if she kept it up.

594
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,753
So what do you think?

595
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,717
Am I ready for a fight?

596
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,953
Hey, Sally.

597
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,992
Come here for a minute, will you?

598
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,513
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, OK?

599
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,953
Can I see you a minute?

600
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,396
Sally here is a real good manager.
Has a couple Golden Glove boys.

601
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,391
Looking for a girl, Sally?

602
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,516
I'm looking for a good one.

603
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,356
Well, see, there you go.

604
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,915
Nice working with you, girlie.

605
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,270
- What'd you want?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

606
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,911
I ain't lying I been watching you work.
You've got a hell of a left.

607
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,718
Thank you.

608
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,310
So, you want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?

609
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,592
Yeah, sure.

610
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,468
Good... cos I think you're ready for a fight.

611
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,191
All right.

612
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,758
Break!

613
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,310
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

614
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,597
You're doing great. You're wearing her down.
Just keep punching.

615
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,432
I ain't doing great. I'm losing.

616
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,192
You're wearing her down.

617
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,511
Nice night, ain't it?

618
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,875
Jesus Christ.

619
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,394
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

620
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,756
Hell of a fighter. 11 and 0.

621
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,513
Your left. Keep your left up.

622
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,789
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

623
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,316
He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ.

624
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,719
Yeah.

625
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,995
Your left, damn it!

626
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,356
Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight,

627
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,112
but Sally's a good manager.

628
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,031
He must think she can take her.

629
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,838
Jesus H, your left!

630
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,876
Keep your left up!

631
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,110
You think she can hear you from back here?

632
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,314
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

633
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,231
Might even help him.

634
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,311
Lonnie's girl gets another win,

635
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,110
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

636
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,509
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

637
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,238
Hey, what do I know?

638
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,834
I just come cos I enjoy the fights.

639
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,558
Mother of God!

640
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,477
OK, break!

641
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,596
Hey! Come here, come here.

642
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,193
Hey get over here!

643
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,431
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

644
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,398
Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?

645
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,790
You're doing a hell of a job of it.
Is this how you advise your lightweight?

646
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,872
Dunn, what the hell are you doing?

647
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,315
- I'm talking. What you doing?
- This your fighter?

648
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,356
It's my fighter!

649
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,795
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

650
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,509
Fine. You take her.
She can't fight worth a shit, anyway.

651
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,352
Somebody tell me what's going on.

652
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,351
I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

653
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,829
You're telling me this is your fighter?

654
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,238
Yeah, this is my fighter.

655
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,117
Then you got ten seconds.

656
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,919
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it drops.

657
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,036
- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

658
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,758
She thinks she knows you, that's all.

659
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,274
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top,

660
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,191
so you just wait for her, see?

661
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,918
That's all she's thinking about.

662
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,309
And when she cocks
that big right hand, you hear me?

663
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,188
And when she does, you step to the side
and come over with this big "good night" hook.

664
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,633
- Got one?
- Got it right here.

665
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,789
OK.

666
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,348
- Fight, or I'm calling it.
- Go give it to her.

667
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,830
The body knows
what fighters don't - how to protect itself.

668
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,559
A neck can only twist so far.

669
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,359
Twist it just a hair more and the body says

670
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,877
"Hey, I'll take it from here cos you obviously
don't know what you're doing. "

671
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,518
Neutral corner.

672
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,953
Two, three, four.

673
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,190
- See the way she did that?
- Yeah.

674
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,953
Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.

675
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,717
"Lie down now. Rest and we'll
talk about this when you regain your senses. "

676
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,189
It's called the knockout mechanism.

677
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,919
Don't get all carried away, now. Good girl.

678
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,797
Thanks, boss.

679
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,348
You, uh... You forgot the rule.

680
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,113
- Now, what is the rule?
- Keep my left up?

681
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,919
It's to protect yourself at all times.

682
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,956
Now, what is the rule?

683
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,519
Protect myself at all times.

684
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,158
Good, good.

685
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,629
You gave me away. How's that protecting me?

686
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,358
It wasn't.

687
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,879
It's OK.

688
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,916
I'll work on my left, boss.

689
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,195
Drink your water.

690
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,919
Other than that, how'd I do?

691
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,072
Fine. You did fine.

692
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,469
You gonna leave me again?

693
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,237
Never.

694
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,518
That place you work - do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

695
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,033
Sure.

696
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,156
Not the kind with the canned filling crap?

697
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,277
Oh, big can, yea size.
It says "homemade" on the label.

698
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,552
- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.

699
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,029
You gonna argue with me?

700
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,236
Know better than to do that, boss.

701
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,195
Good.

702
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,238
All fighters
are pig-headed some way or other.

703
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,756
Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.

704
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,594
Can you uh... spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

705
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,994
Truth is even if they're wrong,

706
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,152
even if that one thing
is going to be the ruin of them,

707
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,357
if you can beat that last bit out of 'em,

708
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,112
then they ain't fighters at all.

709
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,758
Thought I said I'd see you Monday.

710
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,592
You sure did, boss.

711
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,432
That was last night.

712
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,317
You said not to argue with you.

713
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,549
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

714
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,517
You want my advice?

715
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,794
What?

716
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,750
Where are your shoes?

717
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,990
I'm airing out my feet.

718
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,395
You got big holes in your socks.

719
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,675
Oh, they're not that big.

720
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,230
Didn't I give you money for some new ones?

721
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,436
These are my sleeping socks.

722
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,314
My feet like a little air at night.

723
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,033
How come you're wearing 'em
in the daytime, then?

724
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,078
Cos my daytime socks
got too many holes in 'em.

725
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,393
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

726
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,913
Please.

727
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,953
Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.

728
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,474
Might find its way to the track.

729
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,517
Oh!

730
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,191
Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.

731
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,479
I got the breathing thing down.

732
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,109
No, you ain't breathing because you're knocking
'em out in the first round.

733
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,474
Thought that was the point.

734
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,676
The point is to get good.

735
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,558
Can't get good if you keep knocking 'em out
in the first round.

736
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,278
How am I going to get you fights?

737
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,989
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed.

738
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,674
Why am I still doing four-rounders boss?

739
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,513
Cos you haven't got the lungs for six rounds,
that's why.

740
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,751
I do if I keep knocking 'em
out in the first round.

741
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,197
Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder,

742
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,714
just to let her know who was boss.

743
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,759
Three, four, five,

744
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,910
six, seven.

745
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,036
Sorry, boss.

746
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,509
Maggie left no doubt about it.

747
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,719
Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.

748
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,355
Down!

749
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,352
To the corner. Three, four...

750
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,953
five,

751
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,553
six, seven,

752
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,039
eight,

753
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,315
nine, ten! It's over!

754
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,109
Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.

755
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,751
After that no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.

756
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,437
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her
decent fights,

757
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,513
sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.

758
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,358
But that only worked for so long.

759
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,750
Then Frankie did something he hated doing.

760
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,751
He took a chance.

761
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,710
He moved her up in class.

762
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,791
That could've been a mistake.

763
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,798
Break. Break. Step back.

764
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,279
Time.

765
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,835
- Dang.
- Dang.

766
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,838
Hey, give us two seconds, will ya?
Just two seconds.

767
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,394
- Your nose is broke.
- Dang!

768
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,879
- Fix it.
- I can't. I can't.

769
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,359
You can fix it.

770
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,830
- I can't. I've gotta call it.
- I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

771
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,753
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

772
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,273
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

773
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,828
Please. If you can stop the blood, I can beat her.

774
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,797
Bite down on this.

775
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,914
OK.

776
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,315
Inhale.

777
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,435
- What?
- Inhale.

778
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,396
What?

779
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,959
Breathe in.

780
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,989
OK, huh?

781
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,115
Yeah, it's OK.

782
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,349
Yeah. All right.

783
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,670
You got 20 seconds before
this turns into a geyser

784
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,716
and it's gonna spray all over the front row.

785
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,075
20 seconds - that's all you've got.

786
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,388
Get goin'.

787
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,594
Go to your corner!

788
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,318
Two,

789
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,198
three, four, five,

790
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,157
six, seven,

791
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,832
eight,

792
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,514
nine, ten!

793
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,392
"Mo cuishle. "

794
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,075
Whatcha reading?

795
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,594
What's she saying?

796
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,716
Wants to know what you're reading.

797
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,153
It's Yeats.

798
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,549
Keep your head back.

799
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,631
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her?

800
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,676
Show her what a treat that is.

801
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,955
When the hell they gonna get to her?

802
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,315
I'm OK, Frankie.

803
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,072
What'd you learn tonight?

804
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,116
Always protect myself.

805
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,634
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

806
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,234
- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here.

807
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,279
I'll be right here.

808
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,878
How you doin'?

809
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,359
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

810
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,317
I'm not the one who's hurt.

811
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,714
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

812
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,870
Why are you telling me that?

813
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,512
No reason.

814
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,196
But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.

815
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,319
And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.

816
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,118
Did you write your daughter?

817
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,350
Every week.

818
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,510
I've no idea why you come to church.

819
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,036
After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.

820
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,798
The first was to fight Billie, "The Blue Bear",
Osterman for the WBA welterweight title.

821
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,598
Billie the Blue Bear!

822
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,070
Billie was a former
prostitute out of East Berlin.

823
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,118
Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

824
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,838
Didn't matter to her,
something like that could kill a person.

825
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,199
And the crowds loved her.

826
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,194
He turned it down without even telling her.

827
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,677
The next was to fight the British champ,
a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.

828
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,239
Hello?

829
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,834
Not interested.

830
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,714
He turned that down too.

831
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,757
That's a lot of money, boss.

832
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,435
Yeah. You're making money.
What're you still working here for?

833
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,351
It's a title match, right?

834
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,671
Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.

835
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,593
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

836
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,591
Might still be a good fight.

837
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,468
Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight.

838
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,189
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

839
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,555
Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.

840
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,354
Well, you can get yourself another manager
any time you want.

841
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,194
In fact, if you'd learnt
to protect your face a little better,

842
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,191
I wouldn't have to turn down this money.

843
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,432
My face out there so much,
it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss.

844
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,922
No you can't work here anymore tonight.

845
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,649
I made us a reservation.

846
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,527
You um...

847
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,248
You might want to shower.

848
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,609
Here you go.

849
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,322
Here you go.

850
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,287
What's this?

851
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:05,919
Well, ain't no big secret what you're wishing for.

852
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,205
Go on and blow.

853
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,601
Thank you.

854
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,808
33 ain't so old.

855
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,245
I was still fighting at 39.

856
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,401
Fought for 23 years.

857
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,803
How's it going, Scrap?

858
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,960
Ah, doin' good, Mickey.

859
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,484
Doin' good.

860
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,720
What are you having?

861
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,687
Coffee.

862
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,203
You two not speaking?

863
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,281
Don't hardly know him.

864
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:59,199
I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday.

865
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,009
He was picking up cut work.

866
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:08,522
He used to patch me up when
I thought it was impossible.

867
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,408
Good man to have in your corner.

868
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,048
Yes, he is.

869
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:18,719
He stayed with me through my last fight
in San Berdoo.

870
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:22,439
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere and...

871
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,283
it was just Frankie and me.

872
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:30,128
I was taking a hellacious beating.

873
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:35,765
Everybody's got a particular number of fights
in 'em.

874
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,205
Nobody tells you what that number is.

875
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,406
Mine was 109.

876
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,685
I just didn't want to admit it.

877
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,805
Fourth round, this...

878
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,484
this cut opens up.

879
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,522
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

880
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,283
They should've stopped the fight,

881
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,884
but, hell, I was a black man in San Berdoo -

882
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,404
blood was what I was there for.

883
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:06,722
Round after round,
I kept getting Frankie to patch me up.

884
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,960
He's talking about throwing in the towel,

885
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,486
but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

886
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:17,007
Round after round, he's arguing with me.

887
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,048
And I'm almost laughing,

888
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,280
cos, hell, it's getting more to him than to me.

889
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,807
I go 15 rounds, lose by decision.

890
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,842
Next morning, I lose the eye.

891
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,568
In 23 years, he's never said a thing about it.

892
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,359
Doesn't have to.
I can see it in his face every time he looks at me.

893
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,281
Somehow...

894
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,442
Frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight.

895
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,124
Should've saved my eye.

896
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:57,521
Spends his life wishing
he could take back that 109th fight.

897
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,408
See, I wanted to go to 110.

898
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,929
Thing is...

899
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,966
...if you want to get to the title...

900
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:09,928
...maybe he's not the one to take you there.

901
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,003
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

902
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,004
Go on and eat your cupcake.

903
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:24,924
No. I got it.

904
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:33,163
It's the rule - always protect yourself.

905
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,804
People never take their own advice.

906
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,279
If she was going to leave Frankie

907
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,964
better she did it to him then.

908
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,246
Mr. Mickey Mack?

909
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:49,604
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

910
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,284
I hear you're a... a real good manager.

911
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,798
Doing, uh, good things for Big Willie.

912
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:59,929
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn,

913
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,685
so you don't need to make any more excuses
to bump into me.

914
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,167
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

915
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:15,159
Maggie always did like
taking 'em out in the first round.

916
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:52,928
The letters always came
back marked the same way "Return to Sender".

917
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,287
I will uh... make you some coffee.

918
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,606
What are you doing with your money?

919
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,884
Saving it.

920
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,164
Good girl.

921
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,481
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

922
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,889
Cash, no mortgage.

923
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,201
It'll be a while 'fore I can do that.

924
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,203
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch,

925
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:47,407
but, uh, you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

926
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:51,278
Go around wasting it on things that don't matter,
what do you got?

927
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,008
You understand?

928
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:56,480
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

929
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,720
OK soon as I get the money.

930
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:03,042
Well, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
I'm just trying to keep you from doing the same.

931
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,041
I know, boss.

932
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,360
I'm not gonna live forever.

933
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,803
What is it?

934
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,484
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

935
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,925
If you're gonna go for the title, we got moves to...

936
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,161
Hey, hey! Get the hell down.
You know how old I am.

937
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,639
Oh, thank you, boss. Thank you so much.

938
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,288
You're welcome, darling.

939
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,884
Now, just, here let me put this in...
in the machine.

940
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,562
What machine?

941
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,686
Don't have a TV, huh?

942
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,249
No.

943
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,002
Yeah!

944
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,122
All right. OK.

945
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,329
Ten minutes, love.

946
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:43,445
Thank you.

947
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,202
Man says he loves me.

948
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:48,168
Well, he's probably not the first one to say that.

949
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,002
First since my daddy.

950
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:52,684
I win, you think he'll propose?

951
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,079
You win, I'll propose.

952
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,602
Look, I've got you a gift here.

953
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,801
I- I think they gave you somebody else's.

954
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,404
No, no. This is it.

955
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:11,242
What's it mean?

956
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,729
I don't know.

957
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,880
Something in Gaelic.

958
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,523
It's beautiful.

959
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,282
Yeah. I thought so.

960
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,598
Yeah.

961
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,009
Real silk thread.

962
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:31,599
From the United States of
America the challenger Maggie Fitzgerald!

963
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:37,522
Hey! Yeah, yeah, "Mo cuishle. "

964
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,089
"Mo cuishle"!

965
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,839
She wasn't the main attraction.

966
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,559
She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.

967
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:53,849
But ask someone who was there
they couldn't tell you who else fought that night.

968
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,567
Box!

969
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,481
Come on, Mo cuishle!

970
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,083
Mo cuishle!

971
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:29,887
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

972
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,199
Mo cuishle!

973
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,841
She's tough.

974
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,879
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

975
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,528
- You know why that is?
- Why?

976
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,283
She's a better fighter than you are, that's why.

977
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:58,168
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced.

978
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,845
Now, what are you going to do about it?

979
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,848
Get in there.

980
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:13,403
Box!

981
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:30,008
Four, five,

982
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,046
six, seven,

983
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:35,008
eight, nine, ten!

984
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:40,560
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

985
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,762
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

986
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,008
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

987
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,648
Mo cuishle!

988
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:53,927
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

989
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,569
I could ask someone, you know?

990
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,083
Good.

991
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,525
You find out, you let me know.

992
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,928
Whatever it meant the name stuck.

993
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:17,288
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris
Brussels and Amsterdam.

994
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,089
It was always "Mo cuishle".

995
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:24,846
Seems there are Irish people everywhere
or people who want to be.

996
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:28,161
By the time they came back to the States.

997
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,242
- Maggie was in a whole new league.

998
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,763
...Mo cuishle!
Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle...

999
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:59,086
Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle!

1000
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:05,126
After that
they got another offer to fight for the title.

1001
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:10,724
- What's the split?
- 60-40.

1002
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:11,879
Good.

1003
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:16,043
We'll take 60, and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

1004
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,882
Ugh! That little girl?

1005
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,642
You think I'm wrong? Really?

1006
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:22,403
You think people are saying
that they want to see

1007
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:25,368
some scabby Kraut beat up
on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

1008
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,522
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

1009
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,646
Auf Wiedersehen.

1010
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:42,883
Well, they're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

1011
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,642
How's that girl doing?

1012
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:48,767
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

1013
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,841
She'll be all right?

1014
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,761
And if she isn't?

1015
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,681
Maybe I should send her something.

1016
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:58,763
Well, you could send her your cheque,
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

1017
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,763
Boss?

1018
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:07,762
That little house we talked about?

1019
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,522
I bought it.

1020
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:12,522
Well, smart girl.

1021
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,168
For my mama.

1022
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,718
It's only about a mile from where she lives now.

1023
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,960
No mortgage, just like you said.

1024
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,080
You're a good daughter.

1025
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,161
She don't know about it yet.

1026
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,323
I was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day,
drive over there?

1027
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,287
I know she wants to meet you.

1028
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,526
Yeah. We could do that.

1029
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:53,360
Oh, my God.

1030
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:56,920
Mama, come on out here. Mary M's here.

1031
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,040
This is the Johnson�s old house.

1032
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,007
Not anymore.

1033
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:25,119
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

1034
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,643
Mary M, you bought this for me?

1035
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:29,005
Yeah, all yours, free and clear!

1036
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,682
Darling.

1037
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,364
There's no fridge. No stove, neither.

1038
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,281
They'll be here before you move in.

1039
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,964
How much money did this cost you?

1040
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,119
You never mind that.

1041
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,963
- Oh, you shouldn't have done this.
- You need a decent place.

1042
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,406
You shouldn't have done it!
You should've asked me first!

1043
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:49,244
Darling, government's gonna find out about
this house, they'll stop my welfare.

1044
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:52,527
- Mama, no, they ain't.
- Yeah, they are. You're fine, you're working,

1045
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:55,443
but I can't live without my welfare.

1046
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,327
Mama, I-I send you money.

1047
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,607
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

1048
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,328
How am I supposed to get my medicine?

1049
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,401
I'll send you more money.

1050
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,765
I hope you don't expect JD
to move in here with us.

1051
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,363
He's getting out, you know.

1052
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:11,044
Why didn't you just
give me the money?

1053
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,882
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

1054
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,922
Didn't have to, Mama.

1055
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,205
But it's yours.

1056
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:22,565
You want the money, sell it.

1057
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,918
I don't...

1058
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,886
I know you didn't mean nothing hurtful by this,

1059
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,359
but sometimes
you just don't think things through.

1060
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,849
That's true, Mama.

1061
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:46,446
I'll try and keep the house.
I just worry about all those expenses.

1062
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:49,321
I'll send you some more money.

1063
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,926
That man hitting you?

1064
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,038
- It's from the fight.
- Oh.

1065
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:05,609
I'm a fighter, Mama.

1066
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,965
Find a man, Mary M.

1067
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,802
Live proper.

1068
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,688
People hear about what you're doing,
and they laugh.

1069
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:16,206
Hurts me to tell you, but they...
they laugh at you.

1070
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,044
Hi.

1071
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,325
You ever own a dog?

1072
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,048
Nope.

1073
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,805
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

1074
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,603
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1075
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,567
Axel's hindquarters were so bad,

1076
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:56,325
he had to drag himself room
to room by his front legs.

1077
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,208
Me... Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing,

1078
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:02,248
watching him scoot across the kitchen floor.

1079
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,800
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself,

1080
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:11,884
but one morning, he got up
and carried Axel to his rig,

1081
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:16,441
and the two of them went off into the woods,
singing and howling.

1082
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:19,169
But wasn't till he got home that night, alone,

1083
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:22,083
that I saw the...
the shovel in the back of the truck.

1084
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,641
Sure miss watching the two of them together.

1085
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,684
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1086
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,561
Well, you've got me.

1087
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,841
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1088
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,279
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1089
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:05,645
Yeah.

1090
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:09,568
This place has the best lemon pie around.

1091
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,606
None of that canned filling crap.

1092
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:17,928
Huh.

1093
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,841
Wow.

1094
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,646
Mmm.

1095
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,164
Mm.

1096
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,162
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1097
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:32,166
Mmm.

1098
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:35,725
I used to come here with Daddy.

1099
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:38,688
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1100
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,806
I got a little bit of savings.

1101
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,322
That's fine. Fine, thanks.

1102
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:57,604
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1103
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,204
Looks like another bottle of water.

1104
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,167
Want to come to Vegas with us?

1105
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,918
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots? Uh-uh.

1106
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,841
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1107
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,158
Well, she's got a title shot.

1108
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,842
The Blue Bear.

1109
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:13,239
Million dollars, split right down the centre.

1110
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,639
Oh, that's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1111
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,439
Well, I could use a good second.
Can't find one. I thought I'd ask you.

1112
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,202
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1113
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:25,203
Well, cos you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1114
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:29,363
I thought you might like to feel
what it's like to be in the ring on a title match.

1115
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,441
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1116
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:34,958
Nah, you...
you pick up somebody there in Vegas.

1117
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,048
Somebody with young hands.

1118
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:41,122
Well, you're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1119
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,642
I leave this place for one day,

1120
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:47,403
got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1121
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,446
Kind of like it looks right now.

1122
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,043
Oh, go to hell.

1123
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:55,681
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1124
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,681
Will do.

1125
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,165
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1126
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,319
Mm-hm?

1127
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:06,368
I got a question, but I feel real stupid asking it.

1128
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:09,044
No such thing as a stupid question there,
Danger.

1129
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,046
OK.

1130
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:16,525
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1131
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:19,124
I been thinking on it.

1132
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:20,723
Can't figure it out.

1133
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,323
Why don't I show you, Danger?

1134
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:24,287
Oh, you could do that? You could show me?

1135
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:25,723
I think so.

1136
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:29,962
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1137
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,483
Oh, you do, do you?

1138
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,964
- Well, I got the tickets. You ready?
- We're flying?

1139
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,086
Would you rather drive?

1140
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,161
You're asking me?

1141
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,367
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1142
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,169
So, I finally get to decide something?

1143
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,649
That's what I'm saying.

1144
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:52,049
Fine.

1145
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:54,166
Fly there, drive back.

1146
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,366
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1147
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:58,008
How the hell we gonna do that?

1148
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,921
You said it was up to me.

1149
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,640
Give 'em hell there, Danger.

1150
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,642
Hey, Old School, the toilet's overflowing.

1151
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,803
Hey Flippy Come here for a minute.

1152
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,080
Aw, Jesus.

1153
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,559
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1154
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:30,118
Aw...

1155
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,009
Dumb-ass.

1156
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:43,720
Could be sitting up at The Mirage...

1157
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,880
drinking mai-tais...

1158
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,926
looking at naked women.

1159
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,966
Come on. Put up your hands.

1160
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:55,806
Time to get out of there.

1161
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,481
Fight back. Come on!

1162
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,483
- Back with the left, man. Come on.
- Hey!

1163
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:21,324
Come on Flip.
What you doing? Let him go.

1164
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,082
All right, OK, I've gotcha now.

1165
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:24,444
Come on, come on, come on.

1166
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,245
- Don't need no corner training.
- How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1167
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,844
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1168
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:37,524
You my man. You a rock.

1169
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,807
Oh, come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.
You ain't even fight good yet.

1170
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,404
Anybody can lose one fight.
Anybody can lose one, son.

1171
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:47,084
You'll come back from this,
be champion of the world.

1172
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,002
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1173
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,087
I should've knowed.

1174
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:55,638
Come on Old School man.
We don't need to be taught.

1175
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,483
Oh, no, I can do her, just untie the Velcro for me.

1176
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,959
All right.

1177
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:05,963
Hey, come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1178
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,969
Mind if I... borrow this, Danger?

1179
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,803
Oh man! I thought your name was Danger.

1180
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,642
Come on now.

1181
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:19,008
Oh, oh, I see.
Now I get to fight a retard and a old man.

1182
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:22,287
Call ESPN cos you can't write this shit.

1183
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,961
Look out, Shawrelle.

1184
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:34,126
Easy, Shawrelle.

1185
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:48,519
One hundred and ten.

1186
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,566
Get a job, punk.

1187
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,809
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1188
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,762
I got you some pipers.

1189
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,761
Mo cuishle, mo cuishle,

1190
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,647
mo cuishle, mo cuishle!

1191
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:53,765
I want you to jab her right in the tits
until they turn blue and fall off.

1192
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,124
Ladies and gentlemen,

1193
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:14,566
this is the feature presentation of the evening.

1194
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:19,360
In this corner, the challenger, Maggie Fitzgerald,

1195
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,281
in the red corner.

1196
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,689
In the blue corner,

1197
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:30,882
the WBA Welterweight Champion
of the world, Billie "The Blue Bear. "

1198
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:35,567
Sweet Jesus.

1199
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,607
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1200
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:53,640
Fitzgerald is pushing the Blue Bear round
the ring She's coming out strong.

1201
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:59,288
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1202
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,520
Ooh and a right hook stuns the champ.

1203
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,729
Break it up.

1204
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,285
Break it!

1205
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:18,047
You do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1206
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,363
OK, go fight.

1207
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,888
Come on! What the fuck?

1208
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,689
All right, that's it.
I'm going to take away a point.

1209
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,000
One point deduction off the blue corner.

1210
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,609
Ref!

1211
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:11,604
Ladies and gentlemen the first round
is in the books in this championship match.

1212
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:15,078
OK.

1213
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:16,888
- Open it.
- Here you go.

1214
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:26,127
You pull that crap one more time,
you're disqualified.

1215
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:35,043
It's going to be all right.

1216
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,961
Got no doubt, boss.

1217
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,608
OK.

1218
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:42,078
OK, you just watch yourself.

1219
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:43,842
Stay away from this dame.

1220
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,329
Come on.

1221
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,525
Go to the neutral corner. Neutral corner.

1222
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,558
Stay down, bitch.

1223
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,960
Seven, eight, nine...

1224
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:22,884
Break it! Break it up. Break it! Break it!

1225
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:33,164
Fitzgerald continues to pummel the Blue Bear,
the East German champion.

1226
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:49,600
I got it, I got it.

1227
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:57,283
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1228
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:00,282
- How many eyes you need to finish this fight?
- One's enough.

1229
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,240
Now, what do I do about the Bear?

1230
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:09,766
All right, you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1231
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:13,923
- I been doing that. She's made of steel.
- But I don't want you to go to the liver this time.

1232
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:15,728
Hit her right up under her skinny ass.

1233
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:17,607
Understand? Right in the sciatic nerve.

1234
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:21,603
Just keep digging it in there, digging it in,
and keep sticking her. You hear that?

1235
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:22,805
What about the ref?

1236
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:26,439
Keep yourself between the ref and the Bear,
and everything'll just be fine.

1237
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:31,209
This is yours. You keep it going. You keep it up.

1238
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:32,200
OK.

1239
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,805
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1240
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,606
Get the doctor!

1241
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,684
Come on. Breathe.

1242
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:58,568
That's it. Breathe.

1243
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,881
Good Just look at me. Concentrate on me.

1244
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,325
Breathe.

1245
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:06,241
Good.

1246
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,798
That's it. That's it.

1247
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:11,529
Breathe. Good.

1248
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,764
How you feeling darling?

1249
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:08,808
Growing a beard, boss?

1250
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:12,360
Yeah, I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1251
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:16,318
Can't say it does.

1252
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,889
Does it... Does it hurt much?

1253
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:48,683
Don't hurt at all.

1254
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:52,408
Well, that's good.

1255
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:59,087
Where's Frankie?

1256
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,721
Well, he's, uh...

1257
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:04,801
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1258
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:08,405
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1259
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:13,320
They're telling him I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1260
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:22,048
Means that my spinal cord's so broke,
they'll never be able to fix it.

1261
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:28,519
Gonna be frozen like this the rest of my life.

1262
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:37,958
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's going to take it.

1263
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:47,443
Did you see the fight?

1264
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:52,004
Course I did.

1265
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,126
You had her cold, Maggie.

1266
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,923
Well, I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1267
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:05,163
I shouldn't have turned.

1268
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:13,278
Always protect myself.

1269
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:16,362
How many times he tell me that?

1270
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:21,888
Yeah, he... does like to repeat himself.

1271
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:28,043
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1272
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:34,241
No.

1273
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:36,844
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1274
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:57,965
Damnedest thing.

1275
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:03,368
So, what's the plan?

1276
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,726
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1277
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:09,165
It's your fault.

1278
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,481
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1279
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,447
You kept after me until I trained her.

1280
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:17,647
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1281
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:20,802
Everything kept telling me not to.

1282
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,926
Everything but you.

1283
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:34,202
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1284
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:36,406
These doctors around here don't know squat.

1285
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:39,562
Otherwise, why would they be living
out here in the desert?

1286
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:42,601
As soon as you're able to be moved,

1287
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:46,046
we'll find someplace
where they've actually studied medicine.

1288
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,320
You just rest there, I'll...

1289
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:54,321
I'm on it.

1290
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:05,480
Frankie must've called
every hospital in America,

1291
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:08,368
looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.

1292
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:12,159
He came close twice,
till they checked her over,

1293
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,559
said there was nothing to be done.

1294
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:17,642
Took two months
till she was stable enough to move.

1295
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:25,318
They got nurses for that you know.

1296
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,366
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1297
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:44,443
She developed skin
ulcers because she couldn't change positions.

1298
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,526
Thank you.

1299
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:09,645
They made the six-hour
trip by ambulance.

1300
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:23,368
Fly there, drive back.

1301
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:31,048
The rehab centre was a nice place.

1302
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,884
They took good care of Maggie.

1303
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:37,120
She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn't

1304
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:41,123
Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1305
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:42,245
Two, three. <i/>

1306
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:48,282
One, two, three.

1307
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:49,769
Ow...

1308
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:53,604
Since she couldn't
breathe on her own,

1309
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:56,045
her respirators were always on.

1310
01:35:57,330 --> 01:36:01,448
Oxygen was pumped into her 24 hours a day.

1311
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:29,639
Maggie's mama called
to say they were all coming for a visit.

1312
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:33,484
She waited by the window every day
for the next two weeks.

1313
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:34,969
You sure?

1314
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:38,042
Frankie finally tracked them down,

1315
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:41,566
learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.

1316
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:45,359
Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.

1317
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:52,004
You don't have to hang around all day.

1318
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:56,526
Oh... I like it here.

1319
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:58,362
I don't mind.

1320
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:02,921
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway, to read my books.

1321
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:08,960
Mama'll be here soon,
share some of the burden.

1322
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,325
Well, it's no burden.

1323
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:13,321
Here.

1324
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,249
Read this.

1325
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:19,447
"Ach gra fir oig...?"

1326
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,881
"E bhreoigh go... "

1327
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,926
OK, OK, that's enough.

1328
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:29,240
That's terrible.

1329
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:34,878
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1330
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:41,481
It says, "I will arise and go now,
and go to Innisfree,

1331
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:46,963
and a small cabin built there,
of clay and wattles made.

1332
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:51,407
And I shall have some peace there,
for peace comes dropping slow,

1333
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:56,883
dropping from the veils of the morning
to where the cricket sings. "

1334
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,362
Not bad, huh?

1335
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:07,248
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1336
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:08,285
Me?

1337
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:09,928
Yeah.

1338
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:13,446
You know, when you quit all this.

1339
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:17,681
You mean boxing?

1340
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:20,682
No. I'll never quit. I...

1341
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:23,443
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1342
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:34,439
You think? Cos I could see you there real easy,
with your books and lemon pie.

1343
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:39,327
How 'bout you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1344
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:43,924
I could learn how to bake.

1345
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:48,488
Eh, well, then, I'll...

1346
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,925
maybe I'll start looking, then.

1347
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:13,362
Yeah.

1348
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:24,364
Hi. I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1349
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:25,599
Where's my little girl?

1350
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:28,363
Don't you think you ought to go
back to the hotel and change?

1351
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:31,567
She doesn't know you've been here a week
visiting Woody and Mickey.

1352
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:34,847
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is?

1353
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:36,966
You must be JD and
you must be the business guy.

1354
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:39,166
Look, there's some rides you missed.

1355
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:41,844
You just go on back,
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1356
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:44,080
I drove all the way here to take care of my child,

1357
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:46,206
and you're suggesting I'm not a good mother?

1358
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:48,121
Mary M can't go nowhere.

1359
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:51,202
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1360
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,808
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1361
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,926
Right down here. 301.

1362
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:57,807
- Come on, Mama.
- Let's go.

1363
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:05,843
I saw myself breathing.

1364
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:07,886
Like my body was going up and down.

1365
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:10,643
I thought "Well why didn't somebody tell me?".

1366
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:16,965
Your hair needs washing, it's kind of greasy.

1367
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:32,126
It's uh... just a...

1368
01:40:32,210 --> 01:40:34,087
Just some kind of legal thing.

1369
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:35,762
What is it?

1370
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:37,681
How we all doing here?

1371
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:40,842
Sorry, darlin', but we ain't got a lot of time.

1372
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:44,764
Mr. Johnson�s charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1373
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,489
Why don't you just leave that?
I'll read it to her later.

1374
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:49,447
Hey, old man,

1375
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:51,361
you part of our family?

1376
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:53,520
Stay the hell out of this.

1377
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:56,044
Read it to me, Mama.

1378
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:59,566
Well, it's just something legal,
to protect your money.

1379
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:02,521
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1380
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:06,603
The Boxing Commission's paying for all this.
Everything.

1381
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:08,681
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1382
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,887
Mr. Johnson says they can take my house.

1383
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:14,962
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1384
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:17,006
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1385
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:18,569
Nothing.

1386
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:21,722
Look, why don't you just leave it,
and then I'll just read it to her...

1387
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:24,529
Mr. Dunn, with respect, this ain't your business.

1388
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:28,289
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1389
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:36,399
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1390
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:42,321
You sign that paper, it'll...
take care of your family, the...

1391
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:44,605
the way your daddy would've wanted you to.

1392
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:47,599
Uh...

1393
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,806
How do you make your mark?

1394
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:54,485
Can you hold a pen?

1395
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:56,561
She got to do it with her teeth, Mama.

1396
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:59,289
- Huh?
- You got to put it in her mouth.

1397
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:01,723
Here you go, honey.

1398
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:07,199
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1399
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:09,565
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1400
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,568
I did pretty good.

1401
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:14,766
You lost, Mary M.

1402
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:18,445
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it, but you lost.

1403
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:23,240
Don't want to lose the rest of what you got left.

1404
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:25,207
There you go.

1405
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,843
What happened to you?

1406
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:37,761
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1407
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:42,846
Mama, you take Mardell and JD and get home.

1408
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:47,680
'Fore I tell that lawyer there
that you were so worried about your welfare,

1409
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:51,080
you never signed
those house papers like you were supposed to.

1410
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:59,362
So anytime I feel like it, I can sell that house
from under your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.

1411
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:04,486
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1412
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:47,280
Well, maybe... someone ought to count to ten.

1413
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:03,124
Don't smell real pretty, does it, Doc?

1414
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:07,487
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1415
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:23,086
They took my leg, boss.

1416
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,563
Yeah.

1417
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:30,686
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1418
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:34,364
I always hear your voice, boss.

1419
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:07,127
You need anything?

1420
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:13,084
Need to know what "Mo cuishle" means.

1421
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:16,923
Oh. Well, you didn't win.

1422
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:19,285
I don't have to tell you.

1423
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,958
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1424
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:28,201
No wonder no-one loves you.

1425
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:33,165
You remind me of my daddy.

1426
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:37,964
Well, he must've been a...

1427
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:41,565
very intelligent, handsome man.

1428
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:48,240
You ain't gonna make me
talk no more Yeats, are you?

1429
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:51,526
No, I was...

1430
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:54,965
...looking at this catalogue from City College.

1431
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:00,247
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair, maybe the...

1432
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:04,084
the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1433
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:07,765
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1434
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:14,723
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1435
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:18,008
Sure.

1436
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:21,645
Anything you want.

1437
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:25,198
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1438
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:40,803
Don't even think about that.

1439
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:46,963
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1440
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:51,361
Not after what I done.

1441
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:54,089
I seen the world.

1442
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:58,281
People chanted my name.

1443
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,723
Well...

1444
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:05,926
...not my name, some damn name you gave me.

1445
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:11,289
But they were chanting for me.

1446
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,369
I was in magazines.

1447
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:23,088
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1448
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:30,879
I was born two pounds,
one-and-a-half ounces.

1449
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:38,202
Daddy used to tell me I fought
to get into this world...

1450
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:43,169
...and I'd fight my way out.

1451
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:50,408
That's all I want to do, Frankie.

1452
01:48:52,450 --> 01:48:55,044
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1453
01:48:57,090 --> 01:48:59,160
I got what I needed.

1454
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:05,080
I got it all.

1455
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:11,727
Don't let 'em keep taking it away from me.

1456
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:20,362
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1457
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:27,688
I can't.

1458
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:30,408
Please.

1459
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:34,886
Please don't ask me.

1460
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,888
I'm askin'.

1461
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:44,368
I can't.

1462
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:28,680
Hello?

1463
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:38,446
In the middle of the night
Maggie'd found her own solution.

1464
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:41,564
She'd bit her tongue.

1465
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:49,840
Stop. Stop.

1466
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,802
Look at me. Look at me.

1467
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:12,919
Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.

1468
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:17,764
She came round and ripped 'em out
before Frankie even got there.

1469
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:21,318
They stitched her up again,

1470
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:24,208
padded the tongue so she couldn't bite.

1471
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:44,158
You can't do it. You know that.

1472
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:47,166
I do, Father.

1473
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:53,241
But you don't know how thick she is,
how hard it was to train her.

1474
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:57,323
Other fighters'd do exactly
what you say to 'em and...

1475
01:51:57,410 --> 01:52:01,961
and she'd ask why this and why that
and then do it her own way, anyway.

1476
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:05,320
How she fought for the title, I...

1477
01:52:05,410 --> 01:52:06,889
It wasn't by anything...

1478
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:08,926
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1479
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:18,643
But that...

1480
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:20,925
But now she wants to die,

1481
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:23,444
and I just want to keep her with me.

1482
01:52:25,490 --> 01:52:28,084
Oh.

1483
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:31,406
And I swear to God, Father, it's...

1484
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:34,721
it's committing a sin by doing it.

1485
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:37,882
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1486
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:39,562
Know what I mean?

1487
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:41,606
How do I get around that?

1488
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:43,646
You don't.

1489
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:45,527
You step aside, Frankie.

1490
01:52:45,610 --> 01:52:47,601
You leave her with God.

1491
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:50,887
She's not asking for God's help;
she's asking for mine.

1492
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:55,168
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1493
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,047
The only person comes to church that much

1494
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:59,519
is the kind who can't forgive himself
for something.

1495
01:52:59,610 --> 01:53:01,407
Whatever sins you're carrying,

1496
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:04,799
they're nothing compared to this.

1497
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:06,801
Forget about God...

1498
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:09,165
or Heaven and Hell.

1499
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:12,287
If you do this thing, you'll be lost...

1500
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:17,846
...somewhere so deep...

1501
01:53:19,170 --> 01:53:21,809
...you'll never find yourself again.

1502
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:30,321
I think I did it already.

1503
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:54,359
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1504
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:58,924
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1505
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:03,004
You must've been somewhere else.

1506
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:05,887
Yeah.

1507
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:11,559
You got a fight I don't know about?

1508
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:19,129
It wasn't your fault.

1509
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:21,405
I was wrong to say that.

1510
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:23,401
You're damn right.

1511
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:26,128
I found you a fighter,

1512
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:28,804
and you made her the best fighter she could be.

1513
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:33,561
I killed her.

1514
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:35,481
Don't say that.

1515
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:38,368
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1516
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:41,169
No chance in the world of
being what she needed to be.

1517
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:44,845
A year and a half later,
she's fighting for the championship of the world.

1518
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:46,329
You did that.

1519
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:50,600
People die every day Frankie,

1520
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:52,840
mopping floors washing dishes.

1521
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:54,966
And you know what their last thought is?

1522
01:55:55,050 --> 01:55:56,768
"I never got my shot. "

1523
01:55:57,850 --> 01:56:00,239
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1524
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:04,084
If she dies today,
you know what her last thought will be?

1525
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:08,082
"I think I did all right. "

1526
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:18,083
I know I could rest with that.

1527
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:21,802
Yeah.

1528
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:23,403
Yeah.

1529
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:36,639
Yeah. Yeah.

1530
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,965
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1531
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:15,369
Yeah.

1532
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:43,007
All right.

1533
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:49,364
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine,

1534
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:51,406
then you're gonna go to sleep.

1535
01:57:56,690 --> 01:58:00,160
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'll...

1536
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:02,081
stay asleep.

1537
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:08,925
"Mo cuishle"...

1538
01:58:09,970 --> 01:58:13,804
...means "my darling, my blood. "

1539
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:22,002
He gave her a single shot.

1540
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:26,208
It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.

1541
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:28,645
He didn't want her going through this again.

1542
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:18,804
Then he walked out.

1543
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:21,484
I don't think he had anything left.

1544
02:00:39,530 --> 02:00:42,442
I went back to the gym

1545
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:45,249
and waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.

1546
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:07,483
And that's when a ghost
came through the door.

1547
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:14,118
I got to thinking what you said, Mr. Scrap.

1548
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:16,360
What was that, Danger?

1549
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:20,404
Anybody can lose one fight.

1550
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:23,243
That's the truth.

1551
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:24,809
Go on, put the gloves on.

1552
02:01:24,890 --> 02:01:26,608
You missed a lot of training.

1553
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:30,246
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1554
02:01:48,730 --> 02:01:51,881
Frankie never came back at all.

1555
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:10,083
Frankie didn't leave
a note and nobody knew where he went.

1556
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:12,638
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you

1557
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:15,722
and ask you one more time to forgive him,

1558
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:18,961
but maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.

1559
02:02:19,050 --> 02:02:22,804
I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.

1560
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:26,326
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1561
02:02:26,410 --> 02:02:29,447
Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

1562
02:02:29,530 --> 02:02:32,283
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1563
02:02:33,570 --> 02:02:39,679
No matter where he is I thought you should
know what kind of man your father really was.
