00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,958
<i>Previously, on Hannibal...</i>

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,809
You wanted me to embrace my nature, doctor.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,165
Are you going to try to hurt
Hannibal again? Is he safe?

4
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,100
From me? Or for you?

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,669
- I'd like to resume my therapy.
- Where shall we begin?

6
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:13,690
I'm gonna prove Hannibal Lecter
is the Chesapeake Ripper.

7
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:18,009
It's not him. I could hear his
voice. I could not see his face.

8
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,244
You will not see it until it is too late.

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,979
You can't trust her, Jack.

10
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,615
You can't trust any of this
to be what it seems.

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

12
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,927
I get it. The great outdoors.

13
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:38,963
I get the attraction.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,467
In summer.

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,171
Well... It's a lot harder to catch trout

16
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:49,674
when the water is really cold.

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,210
That's another argument for summer, Will.

18
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:54,812
But trout are supposed to be hunters.

19
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,336
Like, they should be
chewing on my hook here.

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,122
Yeah, when it's cold,

21
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,943
their metabolisms drop
and they're not as hungry.

22
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:04,956
Yeah, so how do you catch
a fish that isn't hungry?

23
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,326
Change your tactics. Use live bait

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,963
that moves and excites them to action.

25
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:15,500
You... You gotta make him bite
even though he's not hungry.

26
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,869
Make him act on instinct.

27
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,871
He's always a predator.

28
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:23,641
You have to create a reality
where only you and the fish exist.

29
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:26,544
Your lure is the one thing

30
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:30,682
- he wants, despite everything he knows.
- Make a wrong move,

31
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,485
- he swims away?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,989
I'm a good fisherman, Jack.

33
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:40,058
You hook him,

34
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:43,027
I'll land him.

35
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,480
Truite saumonï¿½e au bleu

36
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,982
with vegetables and broth,

37
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:43,021
served with a hollandaise
sauce on the side.

38
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,090
Beautiful fish, Will.

39
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,594
It was my turn to provide the meat.

40
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,565
More flavorful and firm

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,068
than farmed specimens.

42
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:00,104
I find the trout to be
a very Nietzscheian fish.

43
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,306
Trials of his wild existence

44
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,475
find their way into
the flavor of the flesh.

45
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,650
I hope "providing the meat" doesn't
mean you still harbor doubts

46
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,685
about what I serve at my table.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,321
No doubts, Dr. Lecter.

48
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:21,426
Only the, uh... Wounds we dealt each other

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,162
- until we got to the truth.
- Which is why

50
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:28,266
we need to move past
apologies and forgiveness.

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,702
Chilton has many victims besides the dead.

52
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:34,439
We will absorb this experience.

53
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:36,974
It will change us.

54
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,844
Well, we are all Nietzscheian
fish in that regard.

55
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,679
Makes us tastier.

56
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:44,482
None of our actions were personal.

57
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,484
I tried to have Hannibal killed.

58
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,654
- Isn't that personal?
- You thought I was a killer.

59
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,890
The greatest crime now
would be to walk away

60
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,927
from what we've shared and suffered.

61
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,162
In many ways, we need each
other. We are the only ones

62
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,798
who will know what this feels like.

63
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,335
This fish is delicious.

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,371
Isn't it?

65
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,314
I came in this morning and I found

66
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,316
all the horses with hoods on.

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,485
She was lying dead in her stall.

68
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,154
She had a foal two days ago?

69
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:25,523
Yeah, born dead. She hasn't eaten since,

70
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,558
pining I guess.

71
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,907
Feels like she's still pregnant.

72
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:45,910
Did they check for twins?

73
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,250
Who performed this c-section?

74
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:55,086
She didn't have a c-section.
Those weren't there yesterday.

75
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:26,117
Yeah, there's something
in here all right...

76
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,433
Sync and corrections by oykubuyuk

77
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:02,439
I agree with the pagans.

78
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:04,341
The horse is divine.

79
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:07,297
All beasts of burden are sacred animals.

80
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:12,869
This kind of mutilation
usually presents as cult activity.

81
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,839
When an animal is sacrificed,
it's presumed the power

82
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,841
of the beast will be
psychically transported

83
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,477
to whoever's offering up the goods.

84
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:23,613
Which is why sacrificial
animals should be healthy,

85
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,849
without any defects.

86
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:28,785
- This horse was sick.
- The womb was more or less

87
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,489
intact. The victim was deceased
before she was enwombed.

88
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:35,400
The ecchymosis of the subcutaneous
tissue is consistent with...

89
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:38,929
She was strangled. That's a little wordy.

90
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:42,299
Yeah...

91
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,202
She was scrappy. She put up a fight, Jack.

92
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,839
The horse is a chrysalis,

93
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,542
a cocoon meant to hold
the young woman until her death

94
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,711
- could be transformed.
- Transformed into what?

95
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,415
Life. A new life.

96
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,952
This is a birth.

97
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:05,489
Or it was intended to be.

98
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:09,059
This is every bit as much about
giving life as it is taking it.

99
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,475
What's the thinking here, doctor?

100
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,477
Conflicted.

101
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:15,645
I see what he's done. I don't understand

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,115
why he's done it.

103
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:21,651
This killer doesn't think
like anyone else, Jack.

104
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:24,187
You'll have to find someone who
doesn't think like anyone else

105
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:27,791
to catch him.

106
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:33,563
Ah!

107
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,801
You should have taken
the chocolate, Margot.

108
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:23,213
You are no more at fault
for what happened to you

109
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:26,950
than if you had been bitten by a mad dog.

110
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,019
Mad dogs are put down.

111
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:32,889
Is that what you hoped to accomplish
when you attacked your brother?

112
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,991
Well, apparently,

113
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:37,761
I went about "putting
him down" the wrong way.

114
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,564
He's still alive.

115
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:45,068
Doing bad things to bad
people makes us feel good.

116
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,070
What's your relationship with him now?

117
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:49,072
Has it changed?

118
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:52,809
I think he thinks I've calmed down.

119
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,845
Have you?

120
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,080
Oh, I'm calm.

121
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,218
Are you going to try again?

122
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,260
This is where therapy gets a little tricky.

123
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:12,295
It doesn't have to be tricky.

124
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,434
I could confess to a murder.

125
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,436
You can't say a word.

126
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,738
I could've murdered someone this morning

127
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,274
and you can't say a word.

128
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:26,810
But if I'm planning to commit a murder...

129
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:30,781
I am ethically obliged to take
action to prevent that murder.

130
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:34,584
But be that as it may, if there's no
one else to protect you, Margot,

131
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,787
you have to protect yourself.

132
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:40,323
It would actually have been more
therapeutic if you had killed him.

133
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:45,655
I'm not complaining, but part
of me suspects we ended up here

134
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,091
to avoid where our conversation was going.

135
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,629
As long as you're not complaining.

136
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:56,466
Too much has happened for us
not to talk about this.

137
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,770
However pleasant the distractions.
Well, I am recovering

138
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:03,106
from all that has happened. So is Will.

139
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,512
So are you.

140
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,617
I would change many things,

141
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,286
but not that we ended up here.

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,189
Or that will is back in therapy.

143
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:25,529
The only thing stranger
than finding a woman

144
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,531
inside a horse...

145
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,801
Is seeing you back in therapy
with Will Graham.

146
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,573
Is it really so strange?

147
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,608
He tried to murder you.

148
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,681
Do you know why Will tried to kill me?

149
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:49,352
It wasn't to avenge Beverly Katz's death.

150
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:53,423
It was to prevent yours.

151
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:59,069
He was protecting you in the only
way he felt he had left to him.

152
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:08,278
I'm afraid Will opened
a door inside himself

153
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,214
and no one knows if it closed again.

154
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,650
Especially not Will.

155
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:16,720
Then it's healthy he's back in therapy.

156
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,292
With a good psychiatrist.

157
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:35,906
Her name is Sarah Craber.

158
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,575
She was a horse groom at the
stables where her body was found.

159
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:42,112
- She was reported missing last week.
- Got a hand spread on her neck.

160
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:45,382
We didn't find anything else
on her, except horse uterus.

161
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:49,386
The uterus isn't always such
a safe, forgiving environment.

162
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,522
Shark fetuses cannibalize
each other in utero.

163
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:55,926
And chances are very good everybody
in this room absorbed a twin.

164
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,461
Mine survived.

165
00:12:57,495 --> 00:13:00,430
- Her throat's obstructed. Do you wanna...
- Yep.

166
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,734
It's soil... Someone packed it in there

167
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,769
real good too. It's not even on her teeth.

168
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:09,439
Oh!

169
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,241
- You dropped it.
- I'll get it.

170
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,210
- Thanks.
- I'll test the P.H. levels,

171
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,145
see what kind of organic matter

172
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,114
or trace elements we come up with.

173
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:19,282
Should be able to figure out
where it came from.

174
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,120
- She has a heartbeat.
- What?

175
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:26,790
- She's in rigor mortis...
- She doesn't have a pulse.

176
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,291
She has a heartbeat.

177
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,393
She doesn't...

178
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,829
she has a heartbeat.

179
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,439
Something's beating.

180
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,362
I don't want you to see me.

181
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:14,698
I don't want you to see what I do.

182
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,700
But I want to calm you,

183
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,702
comfort you.

184
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:21,405
There's so much comfort in darkness.

185
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:28,245
But not for one of you.

186
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:54,805
I took your life...

187
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,374
And tried to give it back to you.

188
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,380
I find the womb,

189
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,749
and place you inside.

190
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,161
I hope that the forces

191
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:21,398
of death and biology...

192
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:25,269
Will bring you... Rebirth.

193
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:34,411
It was a coffin birth.

194
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,250
Decomposition builds up gasses

195
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:43,320
inside the putrefying body

196
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:46,390
which force the dead fetus
out of its mother's corpse.

197
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,759
It's really more
of a prolapse than a birth.

198
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:52,196
But whoever did this knew the horse.

199
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,932
Knew she was dying because her foal

200
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:58,268
was born dead.

201
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:01,839
He knew Sarah Craber.

202
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:05,209
He was familiar with the stables. He
knew when he wouldn't get caught.

203
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:07,211
And he works here, or maybe...

204
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:09,213
maybe used to work here.

205
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,615
He has medical knowledge of animals,

206
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,851
but he's not a veterinarian.

207
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:16,754
He... He considers himself a healer.

208
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:19,890
How is this healing?

209
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,159
Sarah Craber was reborn.

210
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,397
This wasn't murder, Jack.

211
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:29,199
This was grief.

212
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:05,736
- Scare them when ya knock like that.
- Peter Bernardone?

213
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,479
Sir?

214
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,032
You don't seem to be curious
about who we are.

215
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:30,070
Who are you?

216
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,439
I'm Agent Jack Crawford

217
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,708
with the FBI. This is Will Graham.

218
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,811
We're here to ask you
some questions about someone

219
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:39,747
you may have had contact with
when you worked

220
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,350
at the Blackbriar Stables.
A woman named Sarah Craber.

221
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:46,053
Her body was recently found

222
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:49,390
- in, uh... Unusual circumstances.
- I know.

223
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,892
I know. I heard.

224
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:54,161
There was a bird in her chest.
Did you hear about that?

225
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:57,131
Was the bird alive?

226
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,201
Yes.

227
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,041
Who... who... who taking care of the bird?

228
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:11,045
- How well did you know Sarah Craber?
- I didn't know her.

229
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:15,949
Would you mind looking at a photograph?

230
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:18,652
I...

231
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:21,055
I... I know who she is.

232
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:23,724
I didn't... didn't know her.

233
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,597
Just...

234
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,633
Take a look to be sure.

235
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,400
Did you get your head injury when you
were working at the stables, Peter?

236
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:10,270
Yeah, okay. Kicked by a horse. Boom.

237
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,139
That's an atypical motor response.

238
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:16,110
Peter's abilities to look and touch

239
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:18,245
can only happen as separate events.

240
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,949
It's aggravated by stress, right?

241
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:26,654
Are you feeling under stress?

242
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:28,655
Yeah, I'm worried about the bird.

243
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,024
Worried about the bird.

244
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:34,294
I'm sad for her death,
sad for the horse, but I...

245
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,864
I can only...

246
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:39,366
only help the bird.

247
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,375
Well, he knew the victim.
He knew the animals involved.

248
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,311
We'll need a warrant.

249
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:54,314
I don't know if he's the killer, Jack.

250
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:57,684
If he is, he never meant
to be. And if he isn't,

251
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,521
he knows who is.

252
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,026
<i>You were able to reconstruct</i>

253
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:08,362
this killer's fantasies.

254
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:12,065
One dead creature giving birth to another.

255
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,469
The bird, his victim's new beating heart.

256
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:18,806
Her soul given wings.

257
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,810
Rebirths can only ever be symbolic.

258
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:25,679
You've been reborn.

259
00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:28,148
Wasn't that the goal of my therapy?

260
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:36,156
How does it feel consulting again
with Jack Crawford and the FBI?

261
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:38,959
Last time, it nearly destroyed you.

262
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,096
Last time, you nearly destroyed me.

263
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,367
After everything that has happened, Will,

264
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,368
- you still believe...
- stop right there.

265
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:51,739
You may have to pretend,

266
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,774
but I don't.

267
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:58,078
No, you don't.

268
00:21:58,113 --> 00:22:00,080
Not with me.

269
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:03,450
I don't expect you to
admit anything. You can't.

270
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:08,188
But I prefer sins of omission

271
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:10,557
to outright lies, Dr. Lecter.

272
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:16,396
Don't lie to me.

273
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,302
Will you return the courtesy?

274
00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:28,308
Why have you resumed your therapy?

275
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:30,277
Can't just talk to any psychiatrist

276
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,246
about what's kicking round my head.

277
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:36,683
Do you fantasize about killing me?

278
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,821
Yes.

279
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,492
Tell me. How would you do it?

280
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,631
With my hands.

281
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:56,236
Then we haven't moved past
apologies and forgiveness, have we?

282
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:59,139
We've moved past a lot of things.

283
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:04,111
I discovered a truth about myself

284
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,213
when I tried to have you killed.

285
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:11,885
That doing bad things to bad
people makes you feel good?

286
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,156
Yes.

287
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,727
I need to know if you're going
to try to kill me again, Will.

288
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:29,036
I don't want to kill you
anymore, Dr. Lecter.

289
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,542
Not now that I finally
find you interesting.

290
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:22,507
Will...

291
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,476
I owe you an apology.

292
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,545
You don't owe me anything.

293
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,500
I thought you were a killer.

294
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,170
I didn't want to hear anything else.

295
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,939
So, I wouldn't consider anything else.

296
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,777
The evidence was compelling.

297
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,347
That didn't stop Beverly
from questioning it.

298
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,316
Maybe if she thought we would've listened,

299
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,719
she would have come to us.

300
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,754
She didn't.

301
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,597
We traced the soil we found
in Sarah Craber's throat

302
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,101
to this vicinity. Methane
probes did the rest.

303
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,236
Found her empty grave...

304
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,405
And fifteen others that are not

305
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,907
- so empty.
- If Peter Bernardone

306
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,910
knew about Sarah Craber's grave,
then he knew about all the others.

307
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,988
Every human being is capable

308
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,190
of committing acts of great cruelty.

309
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,192
Your brother dis-humanized you,

310
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,229
and your family unfortunately
fosters that climate

311
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,765
of disrespect.

312
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,800
They think I'm weird.

313
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,405
I'm much weirder than
you will ever be, Margot.

314
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,440
It's fine to be weird.

315
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,446
They've already forgiven him.

316
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,151
Talk shows and self-help books,

317
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,253
they thrive on this sort of thing.

318
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,523
Everybody loves a sinner redeemed.

319
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,195
The prodigal son, set
about repairing his ways.

320
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,931
He may have made bad choices before,

321
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,934
but now he can make new, better choices.

322
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,604
Do you believe that?

323
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,873
Do you believe me?

324
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,873
Well, it's not my role to
believe you Margot,

325
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,977
it's my role to help you
understand what you believe.

326
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,181
I believe my brother won't stop.

327
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,484
How does it make you feel?

328
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,788
Angry.

329
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,857
Anger is an energizing emotion;

330
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:36,027
prompts action against threat.
If you're angry,

331
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,429
you're optimistic you can
stop this from happening again.

332
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,498
Oh, I know how to stop it.

333
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,403
If you really want
to kill your brother, Margot,

334
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,873
wait until you can get away with it.

335
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,476
Or find someone to do it for you.

336
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,948
You said you were worried about the bird.

337
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,983
Thought you might like to see it.

338
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,455
But isn't...

339
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,658
isn't it the evidence?

340
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:09,560
I'm not FBI.

341
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:12,764
I used to sort of be FBI.

342
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,400
But now I'm really not.

343
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,436
I... I didn't...

344
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,239
- didn't kill... kill anyone. I...
- I know that,

345
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:26,972
but... Yeah. It's not always relevant.

346
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,977
They found Sarah Craber's grave.

347
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,079
How'd you find it?

348
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:44,856
She... She's already speaking to me.

349
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,095
This one's spoken to you before.

350
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:56,902
At some point,

351
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,204
almost every society believed birds

352
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:02,574
carried our souls to the afterlife.

353
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,579
You... You think I think

354
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:10,816
this bird is... Is Sarah?

355
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,219
She's gone.

356
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,621
She's everywhere and nowhere.

357
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,724
She...

358
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:22,260
Tell me who killed her.

359
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,671
I just wanted something beautiful for her.

360
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:35,540
You were grieving her.

361
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:39,077
You couldn't save her,

362
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:41,613
but you could bring

363
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:43,615
poetry to her death.

364
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,351
I wanted you to find me.

365
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:49,354
I wanted you to find me 'cause if you
could find me, you could... Could...

366
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:52,557
You could find him.

367
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:57,062
Do you have a shadow, Peter?

368
00:28:57,096 --> 00:29:00,065
Someone only you can see.

369
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,435
Someone you considered a friend.

370
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:08,540
He made you feel less alone.

371
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:15,580
Until you saw what he really is.

372
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:18,650
No... No one

373
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:21,520
will believe me.

374
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:23,822
He'll make sure no one will believe me.

375
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:27,526
I'll make sure they do.

376
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,490
Every social worker enjoys
certain aspects of the job

377
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:41,094
more than others. There
are cases that you reach

378
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,964
and cases you don't reach.

379
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:47,500
Your notes on Peter Bernardone's file

380
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,502
are drastically different

381
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,472
- than the ones from his last case worker.
- The social services system

382
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:54,808
is far from perfect.

383
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:58,311
It's common to omit certain
information on difficult cases

384
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,780
in order to clear a path in the world

385
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:03,683
for those stuck in the weeds.

386
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,120
Peter's had persistent
cognitive problems. Confusion,

387
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:10,891
paranoia, rage.

388
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:13,660
Would have refused his
case if I had known.

389
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:17,130
You don't seem to feel
sorry for your client.

390
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:20,634
A surprising lack of empathy
in a social worker.

391
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:24,037
Peter Bernardone has accused
me of killing sixteen women.

392
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:28,041
How does that make you feel?

393
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:32,946
Right now I'm feeling inconvenienced.

394
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,449
I'm being detained on the word
of one very damaged individual.

395
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:38,685
You're not being detained,

396
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,687
you're being interviewed.

397
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:43,957
The FBI is just being thorough.

398
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,992
What are you writing down?

399
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:50,630
- An observation.
- About me?

400
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:56,369
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
make you feel uncomfortable.

401
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:58,371
<i>That's smart.</i>

402
00:30:58,406 --> 00:31:01,541
She keeps pushing him on his
feelings, not on the facts.

403
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,743
She's trying to gauge how
comfortable he is with emotion,

404
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,880
if he has any. He couldn't
bear being touched by her.

405
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:10,350
Yes, his responses are typical
of psychopaths during interviews,

406
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,485
but could also be resentment.

407
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,189
No, his eyes are dead.

408
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,592
He's a predator.

409
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,028
- Did you know Sarah Craber?
- No.

410
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:24,898
Peter talked about here extensively
though during our house visits.

411
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:26,900
I'd say he was obsessed with her.

412
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:31,805
Do you think Peter Bernardone
is capable of murder?

413
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,041
I'm not a psychiatrist, Dr. Bloom.

414
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,043
I'm curious,

415
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:39,045
Mr. Ingram.

416
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,248
Why did you become a social worker?

417
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:45,685
Society needs caring people.

418
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,788
It also needs a few psychopaths...

419
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,758
To keep the rest of us on our toes.

420
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,867
There is no evidence I did this.

421
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:03,270
And if you'd like to know how I feel...

422
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,841
I feel like I don't want
to be here anymore.

423
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,744
So, if you're not detaining me,

424
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:13,113
I'd like to be on my way now.

425
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,719
Let him go.

426
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,454
You're making a mistake, Jack.

427
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,057
I've got nothing to hold him on.

428
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:27,093
Peter Bernardone is
psychologically disadvantaged.

429
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,496
He's been manipulated.
As his social worker,

430
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,500
this man is in a position of trust,
and he has betrayed that trust.

431
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:39,272
I know what it's like to point
at a killer and have no one listen.

432
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:42,709
You pointed in the wrong direction.

433
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,342
What have you done, Peter?

434
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:53,013
I'm worried about you.

435
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:56,549
You've been expressing
a lot of rage recently.

436
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:03,824
So often in my line of work, I see
people take out their resentments

437
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,859
on those closest to them.

438
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:07,861
It's a sad fact

439
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:10,196
of human nature.

440
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:13,200
And you're prone to extremes of emotion.

441
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:16,336
The way you think is compromised.

442
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,906
You're destroying your life.

443
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:23,410
Sarah was a bitter reminder of
everything you'll never have. And this...

444
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:26,580
Is the very horse that
kicked you in the head.

445
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,716
Didn't mean to... She was just scared.

446
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,485
Some will say this was a long time coming.

447
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,588
I know I will. I already have.

448
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:38,792
Sixteen women, Peter.

449
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,094
You killed them because...

450
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:43,663
- You weren't worthy of them.
- You killed them.

451
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,932
You killed them!

452
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,237
If I had killed them,
it would be because...

453
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:54,808
They were worthy of me.

454
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:22,002
You look like a man who has
suffered an irrevocable loss.

455
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:26,506
I'm trying to prevent one.

456
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,043
Do you think if you save Peter Bernardone,

457
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:33,413
- you can save yourself?
- Save myself from what, Dr. Lecter?

458
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:36,583
From who you perceive me to be.

459
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:39,619
I'm afraid I need to be saved

460
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:42,989
- from who you perceive me to be.
- Many troublesome behaviors

461
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:46,760
strike when you are uncertain of yourself.

462
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:50,263
Peter Bernardone lies in the
same darkness that holds you.

463
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,266
No...

464
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:56,369
I'm alone in that darkness.
You're not alone, Will.

465
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,739
I'm standing right beside you.

466
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,241
Peter...

467
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:53,447
Is your social worker in that horse?

468
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,718
Yes.

469
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:02,489
I used to have... Used
to have a horrible fear

470
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:05,926
of... Of hurting anything.

471
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,829
But...

472
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:13,366
He helped me get over that.

473
00:37:16,304 --> 00:37:19,706
Feels so abnormal.

474
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,509
An abnormal reaction
to an abnormal situation

475
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,511
is normal behavior.

476
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:27,013
I think...

477
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:29,783
think he deserves to die.

478
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:33,220
But...

479
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:35,455
But you didn't deserve to kill him, Peter.

480
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,627
I want you to come with me.

481
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,938
What was done to you

482
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:29,209
was cruelty for cruelty's sake.

483
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,119
I think I hate him.

484
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,888
I envy you your hate.

485
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:47,294
It makes it easier when
you know how to feel.

486
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,466
What... Makes what easier?

487
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:58,905
Killing.

488
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:05,378
I... I didn't kill him...

489
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:10,550
I just wanted him to... To understand

490
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:13,587
what it's like to... To suffocate

491
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:17,023
and to... To... To experience

492
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:20,393
the destiny that he created.

493
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,210
Mr. Ingram.

494
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:13,713
Might want to crawl back in there
if you know what's good for you.

495
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:22,789
Officer...

496
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:30,130
I'm the victim here.

497
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,566
I'm not an officer.

498
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,568
I'm Peter's friend.

499
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:38,138
Peter's confused.

500
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:45,178
I'm not.

501
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:49,382
Pick up the hammer.

502
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,951
Will.

503
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,653
Pick it up.

504
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,492
It won't feel the same, Will.

505
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:01,294
- It won't feel like killing me.
- It doesn't have to.

506
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:05,899
You did the best anyone could do for Peter,

507
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,901
but don't do this for him.

508
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:10,804
If you're going to do this, Will...

509
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:14,007
You have to do it for yourself.

510
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,376
Please don't.

511
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,646
You would be wise to
remain silent, Mr. Ingram.

512
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:23,149
Will.

513
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:25,352
This is not the reckoning
you promised yourself.

514
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:58,885
With all my knowledge
and intrusion, I could never

515
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,488
entirely predict you.

516
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:04,291
I can feed the caterpillar,

517
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:06,293
and I can whisper

518
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:08,862
through the chrysalis, but...

519
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:10,797
What hatches,

520
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:15,535
follows its own nature and is beyond me.

521
