1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:02,086
Why are you helping him?

2
00:00:02,087 --> 00:00:03,791
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

3
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,396
<i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,799
You're lucky we found you.

5
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:08,937
<i>These woods aren't safe</i>
<i>for Ned Stark's daughter.</i>

6
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,911
Ride east.
Your sister's waiting for you.

7
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,782
Come on.
Come on.

8
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,453
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

9
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:17,391
that will take me far away
from the capital.

10
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:20,831
- I might be able to take you with me.
<i>- Watch out for her.</i>

11
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:22,568
Watch out for her
with him.

12
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:25,708
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

13
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:26,887
My lord.

14
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:29,104
<i>You'll leave for the Eyrie</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

15
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:32,423
I'm Jojen Reed.
This is my sister Meera.

16
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:34,627
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

17
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:36,565
And we have
much farther to go.

18
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:39,571
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

19
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:42,711
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

20
00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:44,381
That pig's got
value to me.

21
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:48,021
What is it?

22
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,231
Yah!

23
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:57,906
Come, my lord.

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,210
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

25
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:02,246
I want to buy them all.
8,000.

26
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,386
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

27
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:07,390
I have dragons.

28
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:09,226
<i>They want</i>
<i>the biggest one.</i>

29
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,495
Done.

30
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:12,800
I'll take you as well, now.

31
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:16,373
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

32
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:17,642
And if you get
in any trouble,

33
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,647
all you've got to do
is say "my father."

34
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,018
You're nothing
without your daddy.

35
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:24,487
Never forget that.

36
00:01:24,522 --> 00:01:27,593
Here, this should
help you remember.

Oh, Lord Tyrion.

62
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,534
I hope we might speak.

63
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,236
In confidence.

64
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,172
Oh, always in confidence.

65
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:24,941
About the events
of the Blackwater.

66
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,943
Perhaps this is
the wrong time?

67
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,846
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

68
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,548
I thought one
of your little birds

69
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,350
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

70
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:36,852
End your life?

71
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:39,721
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

72
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,289
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

73
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:43,357
Which is why
I'm coming to you.

74
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:45,626
- I need proof.
- Proof?

75
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,061
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

76
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:52,198
I have no proof,
only whispers.

77
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,804
Before all this nastiness,

78
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:02,407
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

79
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:04,143
Do you want
to hear it still?

80
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,578
I don't know.
Do I?

81
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:09,347
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

82
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,349
through the Free Cities.

83
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:13,151
One day in Myr,

84
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:16,020
a certain man
made my master an offer

85
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,122
too tempting to refuse.

86
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:20,724
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

87
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:22,759
some men used small boys.

88
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:25,495
But what he wanted
was far worse.

89
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,164
He gave me a potion

90
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,299
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

91
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,335
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

92
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,770
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

93
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,740
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

94
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:42,376
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

95
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,945
The flames turned blue

96
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,648
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

97
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:56,155
I still dream of that night.

98
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,624
Not of the sorcerer,

99
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,926
not of his blade.

100
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,395
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

101
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,631
Was it a god?
A demon?

102
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,333
A conjuror's trick?

103
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,501
I don't know.

104
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:13,005
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

105
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,440
And ever since that day,

106
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:19,244
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

107
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,680
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

108
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:25,082
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

109
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:28,819
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

110
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:32,889
Yes, ahem. I feel the
need for actual revenge

111
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:34,924
against the actual person

112
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,458
who tried
to have me killed.

113
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:40,828
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

114
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:43,196
You do not possess

115
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,932
at the moment.

116
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,268
But influence is largely

117
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:51,437
a matter of patience,
I have found.

118
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:54,840
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

119
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:57,442
he threw me out
of his house to die.

120
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:00,212
I resolved to live

121
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,679
to spite him.

122
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:03,247
<i>I begged.</i>

123
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:06,483
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

124
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,852
I became
an excellent thief

125
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:12,254
and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters

126
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:16,357
<i>are more valuable</i>
<i>than the contents of his purse.</i>

127
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,827
Step by step,

128
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,629
one distasteful task
after another,

129
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,132
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

130
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,402
to the small council chamber.

131
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:33,273
Influence grows like a weed.

132
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,043
I tended mine patiently

133
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,446
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

134
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,816
all the way across
to the far side of the world

135
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,786
where I managed to wrap
them around something

136
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,921
very special.

137
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:57,594
The sorcerer.

138
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:01,063
Hello, my old friend.

139
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:04,265
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

140
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,468
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

141
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,070
will be yours in time...

142
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:12,139
if you have
the stomach for it.

143
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:17,543
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

144
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:20,012
they never mention
the shoveling.

145
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,281
Or the shit.

146
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:25,016
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

147
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,450
and protecting the realm,

148
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:30,820
but shoveling
really is most of it.

149
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:34,557
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

150
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,059
And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

151
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,393
usually you're shoveling.

152
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:41,196
Oh, look.

153
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,964
More shit.

154
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,899
I was starting
to wonder what to do

155
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:47,701
with the rest of my day.

156
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:50,070
We need to get
out of here.

157
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,606
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

158
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,575
The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.

159
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,410
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

160
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:00,912
We do now.

161
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:02,647
We know what's out there.

162
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:05,716
Craster's been out here
surviving.

163
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,352
So he's your
new protector now?

164
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:09,886
Our good friend Craster?

165
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,621
We're like the sons
he never had.

166
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,224
<i>Mormont isn't</i>
<i>gonna save you.</i>

167
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,594
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

168
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:18,962
When the walkers
come calling,

169
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,664
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

170
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,033
If we want to live...

171
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,670
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

172
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,973
Shh, shh, shh.

173
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:46,650
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,120
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

175
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,693
He's beautiful.

176
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,761
<i>Does he have a name?</i>

177
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:03,397
- No.
- Are you going to give him one?

178
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,965
Why?

179
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,103
Here.

180
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:11,598
Gilly.

181
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:13,572
You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

182
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,107
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

183
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:17,108
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

184
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:20,411
I want to save my baby's life.
Can you do that?

185
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:22,480
Can you?

186
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:26,416
I don't have time
for you.

187
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,751
I don't have time
for anyone but him

188
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:31,988
because he doesn't
have much time.

189
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,411
You have to go
after him.

190
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,313
How?

191
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,414
<i>You know how.</i>

192
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,238
Brandon.

193
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:29,941
Mother.

194
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,422
How many times
have I told you?

195
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,110
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

196
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:36,878
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

197
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:38,846
No more climbing.
Promise me.

198
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,547
Promise me!
Promise me!

199
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:42,883
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

200
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,151
<i>Promise me!</i>

201
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:59,498
Is he very large?

202
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,300
No larger than usual,
apparently.

203
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,369
- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

204
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,005
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

205
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,472
And they've had
a lot of men.

206
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,507
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

207
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:13,076
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

208
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:14,678
Seems a bit simple?

209
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,714
What did he do to them?

210
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:19,014
I don't know, my lord.

211
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,417
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

212
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,385
So what did they say?

213
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,454
They said it was hard
to describe.

214
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,056
Huh.

215
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,827
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

216
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:37,064
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

217
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,166
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

218
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,501
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

219
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,035
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

220
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,670
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

221
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:49,207
of the Lady Arryn and the
title that comes with her.

222
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:51,342
Sad, really.

223
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:53,343
Is that all it takes

224
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:56,479
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

225
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,049
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

226
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:01,884
as far as I know.

227
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:04,553
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

228
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:06,688
What makes you say so?

229
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:11,092
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

230
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:14,395
You can read.

231
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,496
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

232
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:19,531
- Former profession.
- Of course.

233
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:23,134
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

234
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,069
<i>Two featherbeds.</i>

235
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,638
He's bringing two featherbeds
for the cabin.

236
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:31,976
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

237
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,812
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

238
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,081
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

239
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:39,416
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

240
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,185
How do you know?

241
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,620
Because I'm one
of his girls.

242
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:47,089
Prodigies in
odd places indeed.

243
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,627
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

244
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:54,129
or rather his dragon.

245
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,764
It ate her
while her son watched.

246
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,636
What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.

247
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:07,741
<i>The ceremony is traditionally</i>
<i>held in the main sanctum,</i>

248
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:11,011
which seats
700 comfortably.

249
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:13,713
There appears to be a good
deal of room elsewhere

250
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,348
on the premises
for everyone else.

251
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:19,551
There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.

252
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:22,720
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

253
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:24,788
upon the 700
to remind them

254
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,992
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

255
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:29,526
Over there in that urn,

256
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,895
the ashes
of Aerion Targaryen.

257
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,897
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

258
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:37,100
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

259
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:40,336
He was wrong.

260
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,405
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

261
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,173
killed by my uncle.

262
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,409
Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?

263
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:50,412
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?

264
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,180
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

265
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:54,782
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

266
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,118
It's like taking a walk
through history.

267
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,390
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

268
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,064
You were married here,
Your Grace?

269
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:08,260
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

270
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,061
Seems like a lifetime ago.

271
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,430
Your husband,
was he buried here as well?

272
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,566
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

273
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,169
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

274
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:20,737
Hunting and drinking
don't mix.

275
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:22,339
I should say not.

276
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,441
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

277
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:27,343
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

278
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:30,346
I seem to recall he laid
siege to Storm's End

279
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,914
for the better part
of a year.

280
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,682
All he laid siege to

281
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:36,018
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

282
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:39,287
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

283
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:42,824
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

284
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,293
We mothers
do what we can

285
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,495
to keep our sons
from the grave.

286
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,530
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

287
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:53,298
We shower them
with good sense,

288
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,835
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

289
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,838
And yet the world
belongs to them.

290
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,774
A ridiculous arrangement,
to my mind.

291
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:08,678
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

292
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:12,380
My father didn't
want them here.

293
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:14,048
He was going to have
their bodies burned

294
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,749
and thrown
in the Blackwater,

295
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:19,285
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

296
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,954
I'm glad he did.

297
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,356
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

298
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,124
I know they did
terrible things at the end,

299
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,061
but their ancestors
built this.

300
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:33,897
Sometimes severity

301
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:36,065
is the price we pay
for greatness.

302
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:40,403
I couldn't agree more.

303
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:52,447
Shall we go and see them?

304
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,916
If you give them
your love,

305
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:58,386
they will return it
a thousandfold.

306
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,922
I've spoken with them.

307
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:03,290
I know how they feel
about you.

308
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:06,760
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

309
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:10,497
They adore you.

310
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,040
Open the doors.

311
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,381
Joffrey.

312
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,217
Wait.

313
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:36,153
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

314
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,955
Bless you,
Lady Margaery!

315
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:41,424
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

316
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:44,494
- <i>Margaery!</i>
- <i>Long live Lady Margaery!</i>

317
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,029
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

318
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:52,300
<i>King Joffrey!</i>
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

319
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:54,435
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

320
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:56,737
<i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

321
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,476
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

322
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,077
Not far, my lord.

323
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:08,079
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

324
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:09,914
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

325
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:13,784
I served them, the men
who were torturing you.

326
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,387
I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.

327
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:18,789
Why would you risk
your life for me?

328
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:21,825
I grew up
on Saltcliffe, my lord.

329
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,994
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

330
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,996
My father brought me and my
brothers up to the bluffs

331
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,032
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

332
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:33,101
I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,

333
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,937
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

334
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:39,673
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

335
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:42,008
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

336
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,043
Those men,

337
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,079
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

338
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,982
Did he?

339
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,952
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

340
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,455
They-- they never
told me much.

341
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:08,064
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

342
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,266
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>to hide from them.</i>

343
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,335
Not all those
are your sister's men.

344
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:15,070
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

345
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,407
What is it?

346
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:22,042
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

347
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:24,211
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

348
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:26,012
What did he tell
you to do?

349
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:28,247
Raid fishing villages.

350
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,116
He didn't trust me.

351
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,917
Thought I was a Stark.

352
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:34,887
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

353
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:37,389
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

354
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:39,925
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

355
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:43,127
All he had to do was be.

356
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,165
Be who he was born to be.

357
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,667
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

358
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:52,203
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

359
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:54,505
<i>He's the King</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

360
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,839
<i>And me...</i>

361
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:58,541
my father gave me
a choice

362
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,476
and I made it.

363
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,813
I could never
be a Stark.

364
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:07,316
But ironborn,

365
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:09,986
that's what
I was born to be.

366
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:17,426
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

367
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,034
I murdered those boys.

368
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,938
The Stark boys?

369
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:34,041
Never found them.

370
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:37,711
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

371
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:43,915
I let Dagmer
slit their throats

372
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,118
and I let him
burn the bodies...

373
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:50,555
so I could keep
Winterfell...

374
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:55,093
and make my father proud.

375
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:58,596
Maybe it's not too late.

376
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,767
It is.

377
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:14,809
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

378
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,880
I made a choice...

379
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,450
and I chose wrong.

380
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:28,621
And now I've burned
everything down.

381
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:32,658
Not everything,
my lord.

382
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,794
She's up here.

383
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,706
- Yara.
- <i>Shh.</i>

384
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:53,275
Wait.

385
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,385
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

386
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,253
What?
No, I didn't.

387
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,455
You can't!

388
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,191
No, please stop!

389
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,528
No!

390
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:18,329
Put him back
where he belongs.

391
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,285
Eat.

392
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,823
What are you doing?

393
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,459
I'm dying.

394
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:55,461
You can't die.

395
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,797
You need to live

396
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,299
to take revenge.

397
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,800
I don't care
about revenge.

398
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,802
You coward.

399
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,738
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

400
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,341
Misfor--

401
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:13,943
misfortune?

402
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:15,744
You lost your hand.

403
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,513
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

404
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,084
You have a taste--

405
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:25,819
one taste
of the real world

406
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:28,956
where people have important
things taken from them

407
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,758
and you whine
and cry and quit.

408
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,260
You sound like
a bloody woman.

409
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,284
I know what
you did for me.

410
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,555
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

411
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,526
It's called
the Sapphire Isle

412
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,729
because of the blue
of its water.

413
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:19,832
You knew that.

414
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:29,307
Why did you help me?

415
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:57,096
You wanted to speak to me?

416
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,498
Yes, about Jaime.

417
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,167
What about him?

418
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,601
I wanted to make sure

419
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:06,070
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

420
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:12,275
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

421
00:27:13,878 --> 00:27:15,612
what did I do
in response?

422
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:18,681
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

423
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:21,083
for that lecherous
little stump,

424
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:24,286
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

425
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,988
Whatever you can.

426
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:29,791
Whatever I can.

427
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,904
- You're still here.
- Yes.

428
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,075
Why?

429
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,509
Did it ever occur to you

430
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,544
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

431
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:55,046
and your trust,
not your sons?

432
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,949
Not Jaime or Tyrion,
but me.

433
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:00,184
Years and years
of lectures on family

434
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:02,286
and legacy--

435
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,820
the same lecture,
really,

436
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:07,157
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

437
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,925
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

438
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,689
might be the only one
listening to them?

439
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,242
Living by them?

440
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:16,231
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

441
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:19,167
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

442
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,309
All right.
Contribute.

443
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,080
The Tyrells are a problem.

444
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,684
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

445
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:41,987
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

446
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,723
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

447
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,726
She knows how
to manipulate him.

448
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,128
Good.

449
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,263
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

450
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:57,233
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

451
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,770
I distrust you because you're not
as smart as you think you are.

452
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,573
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

453
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,576
and everyone else
in this city.

454
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,950
Perhaps...

455
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:17,453
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

456
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,926
I will.

457
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,162
<i>Do you like it, Nana?</i>

458
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:30,064
Another golden rose.
How original.

459
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,500
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

460
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,735
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

461
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,638
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

462
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:40,073
as if that makes it
smell any better.

463
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:41,775
Roses are boring, dear.

464
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:44,344
"Growing strong."

465
00:29:44,378 --> 00:29:47,479
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

466
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:49,414
"Winter is coming!"

467
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:51,483
Now that's memorable.

468
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:54,585
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

469
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,654
Those are houses
you watch out for.

470
00:29:56,688 --> 00:30:00,824
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

471
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,859
But a golden rose
growing strong--

472
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:06,262
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

473
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:10,732
Look, little loves.

474
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,667
A spider in the garden.

475
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:15,503
Run along now.

476
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:17,472
Grow strong.

477
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:21,041
My lady.

478
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:24,411
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

479
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,913
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

480
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:30,016
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

481
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,418
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

482
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:34,019
Are you here
to seduce me?

483
00:30:34,054 --> 00:30:35,721
A little obvious,
perhaps.

484
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:37,656
Oh, no, please.

485
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,059
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

486
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:43,461
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

487
00:30:43,495 --> 00:30:47,131
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

488
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,434
A question for
the philosophers.

489
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:53,503
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

490
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:55,671
- So?
- Might I sit?

491
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:57,606
No.

492
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,808
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

493
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:03,544
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

494
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,314
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

495
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:08,481
Have I?

496
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,383
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

497
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:13,319
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

498
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:14,654
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

499
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,455
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

500
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,290
No, not particularly.

501
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:20,359
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

502
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:23,161
She has, sadly.

503
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,496
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

504
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,865
I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.

505
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,366
Come, come.

506
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,968
You surrender
rather easily.

507
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:35,838
Walk with me.

508
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:37,606
I know the walls
have ears,

509
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,975
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

510
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:42,811
I choose my allies
carefully

511
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:45,813
and my enemies
more carefully still.

512
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:47,748
Which is Sansa Stark?

513
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:50,584
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

514
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,819
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

515
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:54,954
Ned Stark
had many admirers,

516
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,422
and how many
stepped forward

517
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,024
when the executioner
came for his head?

518
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,625
I could not help
Lord Stark.

519
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,895
- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?

520
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,398
You're not the only one who has
taken an interest in her.

521
00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:09,199
That's hardly surprising.

522
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:11,568
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

523
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:15,138
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

524
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:18,040
It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.

525
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:20,709
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

526
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,744
A confidant of mine
has told me

527
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:25,679
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

528
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:28,015
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

529
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:31,852
Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.

530
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,620
He has acquired
the first two.

531
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,388
How long before
he has the army?

532
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:37,523
Perhaps you'll laugh,

533
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:39,591
but I know him
better than most

534
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,827
and this is the truth.

535
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:46,465
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

536
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,867
If Robb Stark falls,

537
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,302
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

538
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,304
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

539
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,106
Which seems such a shame.

540
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,241
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

541
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,243
steal away
such a lovely bride?

542
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:02,344
You must despise him.

543
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:04,512
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

544
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:07,481
Actually,
I rather enjoy him.

545
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:09,616
But he would see
this country burn

546
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:12,051
if he could be
king of the ashes.

547
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:14,120
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

548
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:15,688
You are too kind.

549
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:18,657
I believe I have
a possible solution.

550
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:20,459
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

551
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:22,060
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

552
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:35,237
Ahem.

553
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:37,305
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

554
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,073
You haven't.

555
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:40,875
We'd like
some privacy, please.

556
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:43,110
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

557
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,547
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

558
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:50,483
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

559
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:56,188
What did you pray for?

560
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,857
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

561
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:01,592
I'll tell you what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

562
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:05,429
Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,

563
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:08,698
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

564
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:11,367
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

565
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:15,203
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

566
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,805
My cousin Alanna

567
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:19,374
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

568
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:21,542
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

569
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:24,044
and Alanna looked like a
goddess sent to torture me.

570
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,879
Pig-face, she called me.

571
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,781
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

572
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,050
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

573
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:32,485
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

574
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,357
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

575
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:40,826
A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.

576
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,461
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

577
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:45,897
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

578
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:48,732
and eventually your face
slides off and you diein agony.

579
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,667
But that's awful.

580
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,405
You're--

581
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:57,407
I believed you!

582
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,342
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

583
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:01,577
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

584
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:04,212
So what happened
to Alanna?

585
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:06,347
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

586
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:09,316
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

587
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:11,151
and live in a castle
by the sea.

588
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:13,787
It's all terribly
frustrating.

589
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,523
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

590
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:18,824
You'll be married
here in the capital

591
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:22,527
and she'll have to come watch and
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

592
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:29,100
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

593
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:31,335
That would make me
very happy.

594
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,804
You must see Highgarden.

595
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,873
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

596
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,808
We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.

597
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:41,276
You should see
the costumes.

598
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,012
People work on them
for months.

599
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,481
I-- I don't think
the queen

600
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:48,016
would let me leave
King's Landing.

601
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,850
The Queen Regent,
you mean.

602
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:52,252
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

603
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:58,358
And if you were
to marry Loras...

604
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:04,563
Oh, your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

605
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,966
We would be sisters,
you and I.

606
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,934
Would you like that?

607
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,415
His name was Bannen.

608
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,150
He was a good man,

609
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:30,119
a good ranger.

610
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:32,287
He came to us from--

611
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:35,924
where did he come from?

612
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:38,693
Down White Harbor way.

613
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:40,861
He came to us
from White Harbor.

614
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:43,930
Never failed
in his duty.

615
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:47,066
He kept his vows
the best he could.

616
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,003
He rode far,
fought fiercely.

617
00:36:53,106 --> 00:36:55,540
We shall never see
his like again.

618
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:59,010
And now his watch
has ended.

619
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:02,813
And now his watch
has ended.

620
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:10,419
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

621
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:13,321
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

622
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,024
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

623
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:17,859
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

624
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,293
<i>You on his side?</i>

625
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:22,396
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

626
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,065
We're brothers
of the Night's Watch, not thieves.

627
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,900
The day we leave,

628
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:30,536
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

629
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:33,707
<i>and sit down to a feast</i>
<i>of ham and potatoes</i>

630
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:35,709
<i>and laugh at us</i>

631
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:37,978
starving in the snow.

632
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,682
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

633
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:48,720
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

634
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:02,866
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

635
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,635
I had my 99th.

636
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:10,806
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

637
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:16,077
And more daughters
than I can count.

638
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:18,512
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

639
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:22,216
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

640
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,318
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

641
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,286
Ah.

642
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,421
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

643
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:31,724
Them that's dying,

644
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,859
why don't you cut their throats
and be done with it?

645
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:35,861
<i>Hmm?</i>

646
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:39,096
<i>Or leave them</i>
<i>if you've not the stomach</i>

647
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:40,664
and I'll sort them myself.

648
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,868
<i>Whose throat you</i>
<i>gonna cut, old man?</i>

649
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,639
Wait outside.

650
00:38:49,673 --> 00:38:53,075
It's cold outside
and there's nothing to eat.

651
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,610
My wives gave you bread.

652
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:57,880
There's sawdust
in the bread.

653
00:38:57,914 --> 00:38:59,448
You don't like it,

654
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:01,850
you go out there
and eat the snow.

655
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:10,590
I'd rather eat what
you've got hidden away.

656
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:15,660
I told you
to wait outside.

657
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:17,528
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

658
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,263
eating his fill
while we die.

659
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:22,933
I gave you crows enough.

660
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,234
I've got to feed
my women!

661
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:26,168
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

662
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:27,683
How else'd you make it
through winter?

663
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:30,707
Enough!
Out!

664
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:32,609
I am a godly man.

665
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:34,143
You're a stingy bastard!

666
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:35,544
Bastard?

667
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,081
Out with you,
you little thief.

668
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:42,484
And you!
And you!

669
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,754
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

670
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:50,891
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

671
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:53,260
who calls me bastard.

672
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,974
You are a bastard.

673
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,145
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

674
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,954
The gods will
curse us for this.

675
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,310
By all the laws--

676
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,210
There are no laws
beyond the Wall.

677
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:30,891
Now show us where
he hides the food

678
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:33,026
or you'll get
the same as he did.

679
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:35,462
Unhand her.

680
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,363
I shall have your head for this.

681
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:31,177
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

682
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:34,779
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

683
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,485
Follow me.
I know the best way.

684
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:46,222
Come on.

685
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:53,795
Run fast, Piggy,

686
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:56,130
and sleep well!

687
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:59,100
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

688
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,938
Can I take
this hood off yet?

689
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:07,706
I do apologize,
little lady,

690
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:10,442
but it's better for you if you
don't see where we're going.

691
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:14,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

692
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:17,948
Halt!

693
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:25,854
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

694
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:28,390
Ugh!

695
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:30,692
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

696
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:32,593
I'd have some.

697
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:37,597
Let's go home.

698
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:56,379
<i>What is this place?</i>

699
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:59,515
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

700
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,292
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

701
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:13,361
<i>Some of us</i>
<i>were swineherds.</i>

702
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:16,063
And some of us tanners
and masons.

703
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:17,464
That was before.

704
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:19,433
You're still swineherds

705
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:22,369
and tanners
and masons.

706
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:25,405
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

707
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,641
No.

708
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:31,977
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

709
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:34,045
Beric Dondarrion?

710
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,780
<i>You've seen better days.</i>

711
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,349
And I won't see them again.

712
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,752
Stark deserters.

713
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,387
Baratheon deserters.

714
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:45,989
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

715
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,523
You're running from it.

716
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,859
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

717
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,762
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

718
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:55,497
Which of us is running?

719
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,599
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

720
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:01,336
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

721
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,171
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

722
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:05,505
<i>in King Robert's name.</i>

723
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,008
Ned Stark is dead.

724
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:10,276
King Robert is dead.

725
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:12,512
My brother's alive.

726
00:44:14,848 --> 00:44:16,715
You're fighting
for ghosts.

727
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,617
That's what we are--

728
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:22,488
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

729
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:24,889
You can't see us,

730
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:26,858
but we see you.

731
00:44:26,892 --> 00:44:29,160
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

732
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:31,829
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

733
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:33,864
you prey on the weak,

734
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:36,734
the Brotherhood without
Banners will hunt you down.

735
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:38,802
You found god?
Is that it?

736
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:41,471
Aye.
I've been reborn

737
00:44:41,505 --> 00:44:43,472
in the light
of the one true god.

738
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,008
<i>As have we all.</i>

739
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:48,543
<i>As would any man who's seen</i>
<i>the things we've seen.</i>

740
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:51,279
If you mean to murder me, then
bloody well get on with it.

741
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,482
You'll die
soon enough, dog.

742
00:44:54,516 --> 00:44:58,052
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

743
00:44:58,086 --> 00:45:00,020
<i>And a kinder fate</i>
<i>than you deserve.</i>

744
00:45:00,054 --> 00:45:01,554
<i>Lions you call</i>
<i>yourselves.</i>

745
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:04,790
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped

746
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:07,058
<i>and babes</i>
<i>still on the breast</i>

747
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:08,760
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

748
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:11,062
I wasn't at
the Mummer's Ford.

749
00:45:11,097 --> 00:45:13,597
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

750
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:15,999
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

751
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,568
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

752
00:45:18,602 --> 00:45:20,136
before the Iron Throne.

753
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,903
Do you take me
for my brother?

754
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:24,406
Is being born
Clegane a crime?

755
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,475
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched the Targaryen babes.

756
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:30,311
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

757
00:45:30,346 --> 00:45:32,213
never heard them bawling.

758
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:35,917
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

759
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:37,985
But don't call me murderer

760
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,854
and pretend that you're not.

761
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:41,923
You murdered Mycah.

762
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:43,457
The butcher's boy.

763
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:45,426
My friend.

764
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,695
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

765
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:50,096
<i>And you rode him down.</i>

766
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,832
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

767
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:55,434
Aye, he was a bleeder.

768
00:45:56,603 --> 00:45:58,169
You don't deny
killing this boy?

769
00:45:58,204 --> 00:45:59,837
I was Joffrey's
sworn shield.

770
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,873
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

771
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:05,310
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

772
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:06,978
Then I should have
killed you.

773
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:10,213
Not my place
to question princes.

774
00:46:11,716 --> 00:46:13,717
You stand accused of murder.

775
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:16,086
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

776
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,455
so it is not for us
to judge you.

777
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:21,291
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

778
00:46:23,293 --> 00:46:25,961
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

779
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:30,432
So, who will it be?

780
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:33,368
Should we find out
if your fire god

781
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:35,703
really loves you, priest?

782
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:37,237
Or you, archer?

783
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:39,489
What are you worth
with a sword in your hand?

784
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:43,309
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

785
00:46:45,446 --> 00:46:47,413
Aye.

786
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:49,515
She might be.

787
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:53,686
But it's me you'll fight.

788
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:19,910
The master says
they are untested.

789
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:26,115
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

790
00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:28,750
There are many small cities
between here and there,

791
00:47:28,785 --> 00:47:30,886
cities ripe for sacking.

792
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:34,856
<i>Should you take captives,</i>

793
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,058
the masters will buy the healthy ones
and for a good price.

794
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:44,130
<i>And who knows?</i>

795
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:48,267
In 10 years, some of the boys
you send them

796
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:50,502
may be Unsullied
in their turn.

797
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:52,671
Thus all shall prosper.

798
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:49,418
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?

799
00:48:52,355 --> 00:48:56,024
<i>It is done.</i>

800
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,759
You hold the whip.

801
00:50:29,138 --> 00:50:30,839
Dracarys.

00:53:35,848 --> 00:53:40,848
