2
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:50,922
Fiona.

3
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,571
Fiona!

4
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:56,785
I thought you had gone
with the other girls

5
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,334
down to Jackson Square

6
00:00:58,454 --> 00:00:59,454
to burn your bra.

7
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:00,627
Why?

8
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:03,041
So I can gag
on the toxic fumes coming off

9
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,709
all that burning Playtex?

10
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,127
No, thanks.

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,581
Fiona, you're wicked.

12
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:12,417
When did you first know
you were destined

13
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:14,385
to become the next Supreme?

14
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,083
I was just 29 years old

15
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,807
when the reigning
Supreme at the time,

16
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:21,152
MiMi DeLongpre,

17
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,616
called a Council and I
performed the Seven Wonders

18
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:26,503
and was unanimously proclaimed
to be the true born heir

19
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,971
of the Supremacy.

20
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,255
I wasn't talking
about the Council.

21
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,474
When did you know?
In your bones?

22
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,226
Well, I will tell you.

23
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,811
By the time I was your age,

24
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:35,845
I had already been

25
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,181
manifesting multiple powers.

26
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,350
It's not unusual
for a talented witch

27
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,402
to manifest four,

28
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,571
even five innate gifts

29
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,305
once she starts to flower.

30
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:50,143
But that does not
make you the Supreme.

31
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,298
Only the mastery of the Seven
Wonders could prove that.

32
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,549
So let me prove it.

33
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:57,167
Don't be a fool.
You're still a child.

34
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,119
Even if you are next in line.

35
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,037
I am ready.

36
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,172
And I say you're not.

37
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,790
Because you don't want

38
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,792
to be replaced...
by me.

39
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,961
Careful, girl.

40
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,130
Don't test my wrath.

41
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:13,099
They say when a new Supreme
starts to flower,

42
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,685
the old Supreme begins to fade.

43
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:18,972
You've been fading Anna Leigh.

44
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,009
Shall I show you my power?

45
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,894
You're weak, Anna Leigh.

46
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,846
We both know why.

47
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,400
Diabetes, heart trouble,
liver failure.

48
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,134
God knows what else.

49
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:36,156
As I get stronger,
you get weaker.

50
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,627
You vicious little gash.

51
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,995
I've seen the ruin
you will bring this coven

52
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,582
if you are allowed
to take power now.

53
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,302
You're a selfish,
craven little child, Fiona.

54
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,005
And I will make it my mission

55
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,874
to ensure that you will
never take the throne.

56
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,811
I'll see you burn
in hell first.

57
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,979
Fine, save me a spot.

58
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,292
What's the matter?

59
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,594
Cat got your tongue?

<i>It's a dance, a dance</i>
<i>no one ever had to teach me.</i>

62
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,096
<i>A dance I've known</i>
<i>since I first saw</i>

63
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,265
<i>my reflection</i>
<i>in my father's eyes.</i>

64
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,860
<i>My partners have been princes</i>

65
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,078
<i>and starving artists,</i>

66
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,281
<i>Greek gods and clowns.</i>

67
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:19,284
<i>And everyone of them</i>
<i>certain they lead.</i>

68
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,336
<i>But it's always my dance.</i>

69
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,787
<i>I make the first move,</i>

70
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:24,322
<i>which is no move at all.</i>

71
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,958
<i>I've always just understood</i>

72
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,993
<i>that they will eventually</i>
<i>find themselves</i>

73
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:30,845
<i>in front of me.</i>

74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,831
<i>Primitive, beautiful animals.</i>

75
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,433
<i>Their bodies responding</i>

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,937
<i>to the inevitability of it all.</i>

77
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,972
<i>It's my dance</i>

78
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:43,007
<i>and I have performed it</i>

79
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:46,010
<i>with finesse and abandon</i>

80
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,979
<i>with countless partners.</i>

81
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,348
<i>Only the faces change.</i>

82
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,233
<i>And all this time,</i>

83
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,819
<i>I never suspected</i>

84
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,789
<i>the night would come</i>
<i>when the dance would end.</i>

85
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,334
I always respect
a good hard slap.

86
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,136
Just don't make me look
like a goddamn trout

87
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,372
when I walk out of here.

88
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:15,924
Is that the video?

89
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,393
Yes, as we discussed.

90
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,894
But please let me underline

91
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,729
that this is
an instructional video

92
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,431
shot for surgeons.

93
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:26,067
If I am going to commit
to butchery,

94
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,219
I want to see exactly

95
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,239
how the sausage is made.

96
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:37,278
As you can see,

97
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,248
the human face isn't attached
to the skull at all.

98
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,284
After I make the initial
incision... here,

99
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,787
then I'll have the freedom

100
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:48,039
to stretch and
tighten the skin.

101
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,591
Then fat cells harvested
through liposuction

102
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,910
are packed in the cheekbones

103
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,712
to create fullness.

104
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:57,265
So, what made you
come to see me?

105
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,801
No one else has bothered.

106
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,586
I've been feeling so haunted.

107
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,023
It all seemed
so unfair, so random.

108
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,893
You know, a truly
decent person like him.

109
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:11,029
I can't even imagine
what it must be like for you.

110
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,864
Losing your son.

111
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,576
He had a stash in his room.

112
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,445
I've been sleeping in there.

113
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,631
I'm driving.

114
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:37,121
They didn't tell
me he had a girl.

115
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,223
It wasn't romantic,

116
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,641
Mrs. Spencer.

117
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,809
I see.

118
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,847
Well, you're a good friend.

119
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,149
That's what matters.

120
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,402
God bless him.

121
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,970
When his father left,

122
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,490
he became the man of this house.

123
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,108
He worked part-time

124
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,494
as an SAT tutor.

125
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:01,812
He did repairs.

126
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:04,665
People said that's a lot
of pressure to put on a boy.

127
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,952
He was just a...

128
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:10,154
he was a natural gentleman
in his bones.

129
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,376
Yeah.

130
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,845
Yeah.

131
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,265
He was like that.

132
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,852
Can I share something with you?

133
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,105
I don't want to burden you.

134
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,691
Of course.

135
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,393
That's why I came.

136
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:48,409
<i>I almost didn't answer.</i>

137
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,879
<i>But something told me I should.</i>

138
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:57,535
You were a saint to make
that call, you sweet girl.

139
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,722
I wish I was as sweet
as you think.

140
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,481
I wish I
could hold him again.

141
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,733
And kiss him.

142
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:18,072
If only to say good-bye.

143
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,408
You'll see him again.

144
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,366
I envy you believers.

145
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,202
I don't know
how it works either.

146
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:33,371
But I'm telling you,
Mrs. Spencer.

147

00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:44,475
on the progress we've made.

168
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:45,993
Oh, no...
And continue to fight

169
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,029
for new jobs, new opportunity,

170
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,031
a new security
for the middle class...

171
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,916
Why, oh, Lord,

172
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,252
my God have you forsaken

173
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,287
this once proud country?

174
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,505
Oh, God.

175
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,090
Are you blubbering again?

176
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,125
Eternal life...

177
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:04,845
and all you can do with it
is stuff your face and cry.

178
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,830
That magic box lies.

179
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,633
Somebody...

180
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,719
somebody in there...

181
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,304
they just said that...

182
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:17,174
that-that Negro...

183
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:20,444
is the President
of the United States.

184
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,446
I voted for him.
Twice.

185
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:25,116
We've also had black
secretaries of states,

186
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,317
Supreme Court justices,

187
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:29,203
and even the poet laureate.

188
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,206
Lies.

189
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,708
You know, you've got
a lot to learn.

190
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,459
And you're gonna learn it
right here

191
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,694
inside the walls of this school.

192
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,079
Oh, God...

193
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:39,463
help me.

194
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,915
Congratulations, kiddo.

195
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,669
You... are the new maid.

196
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,921
Maid.

197
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,589
Have you any idea

198
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,558
with whom you are speaking?

199
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,093
Yes.

200
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:55,846
The maid unless you want
to go back in the box.

201
00:11:55,897 --> 00:11:57,398
Can't stop thinking about
our new neighbor.

202
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,233
He's nice.

203
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,884
He's waiting for someone.

204
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,903
Maybe he likes
a little chocolate.

205
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,822
It's hilarious to listen

206
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:06,824
to you virgins get
all hot and bothered.

207
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,492
I'm not a virgin.

208
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,861
I'm not.

209
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,413
I get it on all the time.

210
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,081
And guys find me hot.

211
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,783
Look at you.

212
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:17,401
Who'd have thought we'd
have so much in common?

213
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,669
So what's your story, Queenie?

214
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,237
Who popped
your chocolate-covered cherry?

215
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,756
No one yet.
She's a virgin.

216
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,424
Shut up, Nan.

217
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:24,542
I'm saving myself.

218
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:32,266
You the bitch that blindsided
me with that candlestick.

219
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,970
How dare you open
your foul mouth to me, Negress.

220
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,805
Excuse me?

221
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,640
I may be a maid,

222
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:44,061
but there are limits
to my servitude.

223
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,446
You best put that food
down in front of me

224
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,131
before I Frisbee this
plate at your head.

225
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,247
Cracker bitch!

226
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,249
Hey!

227
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,802
What the hell is going on here?

228
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:10,838
Miss Aryan Sisterhood came

229
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,223
between Queenie and her food.

230
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,642
I will not stoop
to serve her kind.

231
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:16,510
You know, Delphine,

232
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:21,982
from now on you are gonna
be Queenie's personal slave.

233
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,602
And, Queenie, you ask her

234
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:25,803
to do whatever you need done:

235
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:27,655
make your bed,
scrub your toilet.

236

We'll take the cake to share.

Sunday.
Bible study.

334
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:51,855
It's how we maintain
our personal relationship

335
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:54,607
with our Lord Jesus Christ.

336
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,010
You know that's all a crock
of shit, right?

337
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,022
I mean, why wait for some

338
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:00,480
phony
happily-ever-after

339
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,899
when you can have
your piece now, I say.

340
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,701
What about you, Luke?

341
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:14,828
I forbid you to talk to my son

342
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,496
or to set foot
in this house again.

343
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:17,547
I didn't say anything.
Both of you!

344
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,049
Get out of my house!

345
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,000
We'll pray for you.

346
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:28,141
I didn't know
you could do that.

347
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,559
Neither did I until now.

348
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:40,603
Hank doesn't know I'm here.

349
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:44,691
He's out of town bidding
on a construction project.

350
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:47,861
We tried alternative methods,
but...

351
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:49,529
they didn't take.

352
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,948
So here I am.

353
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,783
I'm glad you came.

354
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,618
I was actually gonna call you.

355
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:59,706
Oh?
Your, uh, blood work came back.

356
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:03,543
Ms. Foxx, we have a problem.

357
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:05,678
What kind of problem?

358
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,514
The kind that rules out
you having any sort

359
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,848
of elective surgery.

360
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,718
Now or for
the foreseeable future.

361
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,971
I'll find another doctor.

362
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:18,257
I can assure you no reputable
surgeon's gonna take you on.

363
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,311
Your blood work is alarming,
and your immune system seems

364
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:24,430
to be in some kind of...
free fall.

365
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,784
You simply can't have a baby.

366
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:33,990
There's got to be something
you can do.

367
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:36,626
I know how disappointing
this must be.

368
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,381
Times like these I wish I had
a magic wand I could wave.

369
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,217
But I don't.

370
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,719
That's right.

371
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,972
You don't.

372
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,594
♪ La-la-la-da-la-da

373
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,400
♪ La-la-la-da-la-da

374
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,235
♪ La-da, la-da...

375
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,136
I know this is
the right thing, Kyle.

376
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:07,824
She's the one person in
the world that you'll remember.

377
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:10,660
Everything will make
sense when you see her.

378
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:48,281
Oh! Oh!

379
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:38,114
Well, who do we have here?

380
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:39,749
Joan Ramsey.

381
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,868
My... son Luke and I

382
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,237
moved into the old colonial
next door.

383
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,459
I'd like you to have this.

384
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:51,461
Hmm.

385
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,713
I always bring a copy
of the Good Book

386
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:57,050
whenever I come into someone's
house for the first time.

387
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,885
How devout of you.

388
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:00,937
May I offer you a drink?

389
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:02,639
No, I don't imbibe.

390
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:05,725
I don't know
if this is a school or...

391
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:09,112
a rehab facility or what it is,

392
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:11,898
but two of your girls
invaded my property.

393
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:14,200
One of them was dressed
so scandalously

394
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,785
I'm-I'm worried
about the long-term effect

395
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,904
it might have on Luke.
You know, I've never

396
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:22,575
understood you Bible-thumpers
and your hypocrisy towards sex.

397
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:25,962
I know, behind closed doors,

398
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:30,049
you are the biggest perverts
of all.

399
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,635
Your student threw a knife
at me.

400
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,471
It missed my head
by three inches.

401
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:37,974
Yeah. She has to
work on her aim.

402
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:41,394
I didn't come here to listen
to your drunken mocking.

403
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,629
Those girls had better not come
around my placain.

404
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,648
I will call the police
and I will

405
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,934
press charges.

406
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,069
Assault
with a deadly weapon, arson.

407
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:53,940
Arson?

408
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,475
The trashy one
lit my curtains on fire.

409
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,247
I don't know how she did it,
but she did it.

410
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,696
I conjured the Devil.

411
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,480
That's her.

412
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:03,116
You stay away from my boy.

413
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,668
Hmm, good luck
keeping him away from me.

414
00:24:05,753 --> 00:24:07,503
He's so backed up all
I'd have to say is "panties"

415
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:09,255
and he'd jizz his jeans.

416
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,090
Stay away from my family.

417
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,460
In Jesus' name.

418
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,330
Madison.

419
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:25,138
Have you got a light?

420
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:35,514
Well done.

421
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:36,816
Right?
Who knew

422
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,451
I could do that?

423
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:41,871
Come here.

424
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:46,042
Sit down.

425
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:50,830
Let's talk.

426
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,870
Are you asleep?

427
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:11,234
I can't believe
you're really here.

428
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:15,521
I nearly died from
missing you, baby.

429
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:25,498
I was just thinking something.

430
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,034
It's keeping me awake.

431
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:31,904
Before, when you went
to go take a shower...

432
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,994
You're a different person.

433
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,297
Your body.

434
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:17,834
You look like someone else.

435
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:20,419
I don't understand
what's happening.

436
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:23,639
But that-that doesn't matter.

437
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,975
Doesn't it?

438
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:30,396
You're still my beautiful boy.

439
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,984
We're together again.

440
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,965
Let it all go.

441
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:08,334
I'm here now.

442
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:32,196
I said if you want breakfast,

443
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:34,148
you better carry your ass
downstairs and make it yourself.

444
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:36,450
Ain't nobody frying no eggs.

445
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:40,071
I'm looking for Marie.

446
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:42,873
I'm here to consult with her?

447
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,459
About a fertility problem?

448
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,795
Chinwe, Mambo here?

449
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:12,319
You want a Coca-Cola?

450
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,856
No, thank you.

451
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:19,276
Thank you for seeing me
right away.

452
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:22,329
I've heard about you
since I was a child.

453
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,666
Full disclosure...

454
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,868
I'm from...
Darling.

455
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:30,838
I know who you are.

456
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:36,293
Okay.

457
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:38,679
So tell me
about your fertility spell.

458
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:41,682
Oh, don't know nothing
about that.

459
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:43,017
Marie?

460
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,185
If you know who I am,

461
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:45,429
then you know I am well-aware

462
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,971
of the <i>Pochaut Medecine.</i>

463
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,143
Hmm.

464
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,478
Then you know
that spell ain't no picnic

465
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,014
for anyone involved.

466
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:10,294
<i>On the day of,</i>
<i>you bring us two ounces</i>

467
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:13,998
<i>of your husband's baby gravy</i>
<i>in a mason jar.</i>

468
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,682
<i>We use a Guinea pepper...</i>

469
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:34,818
<i>hotter than Hades.</i>

470
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:39,490
<i>When the gods see this</i>
<i>willingness to suffer...</i>

471
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,025
<i>to sacrifice,</i>

472
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:44,361
<i>they pay attention.</i>

473
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:58,986
<i>When it's over,</i>

474
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,804
<i>I sleep for four days</i>

475
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:02,072
<i>and four nights.</i>

476
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,810
How soon can we do it?

477
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:08,779
Got to be a new moon.

478
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,082
And $50,000 in cash up front.

479
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,751
Jesus.

480
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,753
We have a 100% success rate.

481
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,154
I'll find it somehow.

482
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,623
Borrow it, rob a bank.

483
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:21,091
When's the new moon?

484
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,973
Ain't gonna do
no <i>Pochaut Medecine</i> on you.

485
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,642
Not for $50,000.

486
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:41,678
Not for $100,000.

487
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,847
You were born
into the wrong tribe.

488
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:46,817
You the daughter
of my sworn enemy.

489
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,739
Fiona has got nothing
to do with me.

490
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,407
She has no idea I came to see you.
Ooh.

491
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:55,292
Hmm.

492
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,829
You are my one real shot
at this point.

493
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,080
Too late for tears.

494
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:01,498
Damage is done.

495
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:03,751
Waltzing in here

496
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,086
like she the Queen of England.

497
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:08,705
Talking about hammer and nails,

498
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:11,225
looking to start a war.

499
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:14,895
Fiona was here?

500
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:17,314
She done messed
with the wrong witch.

501
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,767
And she knows it.

502
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:23,404
And now you know it.

503
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,000
You like him.

504
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:41,505
Excuse me?

505
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:45,575
You're thinking about a boy.
I can tell.

506
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,577
You know it's rude to get
in people's heads like that.

507
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:49,579
You think I like having to hear

508
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:50,764
other people's thoughts
all the time?

509
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:51,849
I don't.

510
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,267
So stop.

511
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:54,268
Wish I could.

512
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:56,053
These help.

513
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,063
Hello?

514
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:09,149
Zoe, it happened.

515
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:10,600
Oh, hey, Alicia.

516
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,286
Kyle's come back to me.

517
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,789
Except...

518
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:18,275
it's not Kyle.

519
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,828
I'll be right over.

520
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:22,963
<i>I'm not gonna apologize.</i>

521
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,716
Whatever for?

522
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,551
For whatever it is
you want me to.

523
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:31,288
That's why we're here,
isn't it?

524
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,291
People in our position have
no need to apologize.

525
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:37,261
Our actions speak
for themselves.

526
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:39,847
I'm curious.

527
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:41,648
Have you always known

528
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,517
you were special?

529
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:44,818
Child actor,

530
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,770
poised beyond your years?

531
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:49,323
My mother put me to work
ever since I could talk.

532
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:50,908
I hated it.

533
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:52,642
It's hard to stop
when you're the only one

534
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,361
in your family making money,
you know.

535
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,496
You didn't have a good
relationship with her?

536
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,581
The last time I saw her,

537
00:33:57,648 --> 00:33:59,316
she snorted half my coke,

538
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,834
and then let
the cops bust me for it.

539
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,120
She's a selfish bitch.

540
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,955
Hmm.

541
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:06,290
So was I.

542
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:07,708
Ask Cordelia.

543
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,510
I was a horrible mother.

544
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:11,845
And I regret it.

545
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,013
She's not dead.

546
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:14,548
You can change.

547
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,967
I've tried.

548
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,503
But I think it's too late.

549
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:21,838
I have so much to give.

550
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:27,444
So much to teach.

551
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,481
Teach me.

552
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,657
Self-preservation,
it's the most

553
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,626
primal instinct
of the human psyche.

554
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:44,361
So, what would it take...

555
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:47,881
to make a person disregard
their will to survive?

556
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:48,999
I don't get it.

557
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:51,802
Use your imagination.

558
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:54,371
Make what you want him to do

559
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:57,758
so much more attractive
than what he's actually doing.

560
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,226
Make him believe

561
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,844
he's safer

562
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:02,229
in the middle of the street.

563
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,329
Did I do that or did you?

564
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:31,258
I sure do love chicken potpie.

565
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:33,544
For dessert you can make me
a peach cobbler.

566
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:37,747
You never gonna catch
a man that way.

567
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:39,749
Let alone find one to love you.

568
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:42,686
You were my daughter,
I'd padlock that icebox

569
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:45,088
and throw away the key.

570
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:48,225
Peach cobbler won't keep
you warm at night.

571
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,610
My problem ain't food,

572
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:52,062
you dumb bitch.
It's love.

573
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,948
Dr. Phil says that kids
from broken homes

574
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,100
use food to replace love.
It's comforting.

575
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:01,455
Well, I think you best look
for a new physician.

576
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,212
What was that?

577
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,664
What was what?

578
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:13,783
Something is out there.

579
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:16,053
Ain't nothing out there.
Get back to work

580
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,170
before I smack you, slave.

581
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,394
No, it can't be.

582
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:26,346
God help me.

583
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,182
What the hell are you doing?
He's out there!

584
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,101
We have to hide.
What are you talking about? Who's out there?

585
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:32,853
My houseboy.

586
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,571
Your what?

587
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,607
No, don't unlock that!

588
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:38,241
He'll ravage both of us.

589
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:40,027
Bitch, you don't make
a bit of sense.

590
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,004
What the hell is that thing?

591
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,457
It's Bastien.

592
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:54,758
My houseboy.

593
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:57,511
He was a beast in life.

594
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,513
Now evermore so.

595
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:02,382
Enchanted no doubt

596
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,469
by the same dark magic
which has kept me alive.

597
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,270
Who are you?

598
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:10,023
I am Madame Delphine LaLaurie.

599
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:12,476
Mistress of the house

600
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,361
LaLaurie.

601
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,448
The Code Noir was replaced

602
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,033
by the Madame's
own code of terror.

603
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:22,152
Who brought you back-- Fiona?

604
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:25,205
The witch freed me only
to make me a slave.

605
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,375
You deserve worse if half of
what they say about you is true.

606
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,210
You unhand me.

607
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:31,712
Did you do that to him?

608
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:33,029
He violated my daughter.

609
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:36,083
Please, we have to hide.

610
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,868
I beg you... have mercy.

611
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,205
Please, don't...
don't let him take me.

612
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,142
Get up.

613
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,209
Get up!

614
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,261
Oh, wait...
Get out of here.

615
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,680
You go hide,
I'll take care of this.

616
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,014
Slave, wait.

617
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:55,686
Get out of here.

618
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:04,494
Oh, God, God...

619
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:29,720
Come on.

620
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:33,607
Come on.

621
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,059
Come on.

622
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:46,531
I won't hurt you.

623
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:55,206
Come on.

624
00:38:58,043 --> 00:38:59,761
Over here.

625
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:09,253
She told me what you did
to her daughter.

626
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,806
You just wanted love.

627
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,142
And that makes you a beast?

628
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:21,933
They call me that, too.

629
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:30,575
But that's not who we are.

630
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,999
We both deserve love
like everybody else.

631
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:09,497
Don't you want to love me?

632
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,016
Kyle, honey?

633
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,485
I have a little
surprise for you.

634
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:49,370
I invited your friend Zoe

635
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:51,406
to come join us
for dinner tonight.

636
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,825
What do you think
of that? Hmm?

637
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,745
She's a sweet girl.

638
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,632
I don't know why you didn't
tell me about her before.

639
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,001
Did you think I'd not approve?

640
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:05,219
I certainly hope

641
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:08,089
you don't feel like you have
to keep secrets from me.

642
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,012
I've been possessive.
I do know that.

643
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,933
I never meant
for it to go so far,

644
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,152
or go on for so long.

645
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,055
But I think maybe you
needed it as much as I did.

646
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,107
But now it's time
for you to move on

647
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:28,943
with your life, and I understand
that, and I want that.

648
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,895
Jesus, Kyle!

649
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,397
Why won't you talk to me?!

650
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,917
What's happened to you?

651
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,169
They were so sure you
were dead. They said

652
00:41:38,236 --> 00:41:39,754
they identified your body.

653
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,255
Your body.

654
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,341
I know your body,
Kyle. I know it.

655
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:46,127
And this...
it's different!

656
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,579
You're different!

657
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,882
Who are you, if
you're not my son?!

658
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:55,086
My son. My son.

659
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:00,058
My sweet baby boy.

660
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,261
No one knows you like I do.

661
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,780
Not even that girl.

662
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,949
She doesn't know
how to please you.

663
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:09,784
Not like I can.

664
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:12,120
Mama knows how
to please you, baby.

665
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:15,873
It's okay.

666
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:18,242

Hello?

699
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:37,368
Hello?

700
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,641
Alicia?

701
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:42,976
Oh. Ooh.

702
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:45,061
Ladies.

703
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:47,430
Oh, you're looking well tonight.

704
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:53,737
Let me give you some advice.

705
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:59,409
Get your portrait painted
when you're young.

706
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:02,195
Just look at these old bats.

707
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:09,336
Mine is gonna go over here.

708
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,907
And yours'll go...

709
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,042
over there.

710
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:20,680
Doubt I'm even graduating
this shit show.

711
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:22,716
No way they're gonna
commemorate me.

712
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,018
Well, they'll have to...

713
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:31,585
...because you're
the next Supreme.

714
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,895
Wait.

715
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,698
Are you serious?

716
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:41,601
How do you know
I'm the next Supreme?

717
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:45,872
Because I am the old one.

718
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,158
And I'm dying.

719
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:51,411
My time is up,

720
00:46:51,462 --> 00:46:55,980
and you're...
killing me.

721
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,251
Your powers--

722
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:01,307
you've been feeling
them growing?

723
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:02,929
Yeah, l-like crazy.

724
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:06,509
Have you ever wondered why?

725
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:08,795
Uh, apart from
my being awesome?

726
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:10,263
<i>I'm</i> the source.

727
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:18,154
My life force is literally
pouring out of my body

728
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,657
and into yours.

729
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:25,161
This is no mystical
mumbo-jumbo.

730
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:26,830
This is real.

731
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:34,120
I have cancer.

732
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:37,290
I won't last the year.

733
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:38,436
I have connections.

734
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,377
My agent can get
the best oncologist

735
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:41,857
in the country here in a flash.

736
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:42,984
Chemo?

737
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:45,131
Oh.

738
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:46,766
Oh, no, no.

739
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,685
No, no, no, I'm not going out

740
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:51,004
bald and shriveled and...

741
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:55,775
...begging for morphine.

742
00:47:58,512 --> 00:48:02,198
No. I've lived a disreputable
life, but I've done it in style,

743
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:04,534
and I'll die likewise.

744
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:19,082
I don't belong on these walls.

745
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:22,886
I took my inheritance
too soon and

746
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,704
squandered it.

747
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:28,558
All that... power,
all those gifts.

748
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:36,232
I just took it
and poured it back into myself

749
00:48:36,317 --> 00:48:38,902
and dressed it up in Chanel.

750
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,660
I was a shitty Supreme.

751
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:56,369
But, now, my mentor,

752
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,077
Anna Leigh Leighton--

753
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:01,708
now there was a Supreme.

754
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:08,214
She was majestic

755
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:10,550
and powerful.

756
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:16,439
She taught me everything I know.

757
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:25,932
You know how I thanked her?

758
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:32,122
By cutting her throat.

759
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:34,040
Right where I'm standing.

760
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:37,627
With this.

761
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:40,130
I've kept it all these years.

762
00:49:47,189 --> 00:49:48,722
And now, I give it to you.

763
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,379
Why? I don't want that.
Yeah.

764
00:49:50,499 --> 00:49:52,291
Come on, here.
No.

765
00:49:52,343 --> 00:49:53,476
Don't be afraid.
Use it.

766
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,762
Kill me
for the sake of the coven.

767
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,964
No. No.
Yes. Come on.

768
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,432
Don't be afraid. Do it!

769
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:01,968
Come on, now, do it!
I can't!

770
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:04,270
No!
Yes, you can, you stupid girl!

771
00:50:04,321 --> 00:50:05,805
No!
Do it!

772
00:50:05,856 --> 00:50:07,163
And feel my power flow into you!

773
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:10,777
I know, because I was standing
where you're standing!

774
00:50:10,828 --> 00:50:12,245
Stop yelling at me!

775
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:14,147
Do it! Do it!
No!

776
00:50:14,198 --> 00:50:16,199
Do it!

777
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:03,196
Bury her deep.

778
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:05,770
God knows what all that shit

779
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,270
in her body will do to the lawn
when it comes up in the spring.

780
00:51:31,408 --> 00:51:35,445
This coven doesn't need
a new Supreme.

781
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,363
It needs a new rug.

782
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:52,714
