1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:04,509
Oh, I hope Tad likes salmon.

2
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,356
It's a bit of a risk serving fish

3
00:00:06,357 --> 00:00:07,968
to a first-time diner at Dunphy's.

4
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,011
Maybe I should marinate
a steak for backup.

5
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:11,943
I think someone has a man crush.

6
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:14,507
First of all, I would never date
a potential client.

7
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,634
That's "first of all"?

8
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:17,195
Secondly, I really need this to go well

9
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:19,506
so he makes me his realtor.
This guy's flipping properties

10
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:21,580
like they're extras in a kung fu movie.

11
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:23,522
So you're just kissing up
to this guy for his money?

12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,960
Not just. I really like him.

13
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,799
He travels the world
doing charity work,

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,027
rock climbs, flies planes...

15
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,946
How does he have time
to do all that?

16
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,883
Got divorced, and
his whole life opened up.

17
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,219
Guy's living the dream.

18
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,229
His dream.

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,175
Not my dream.
I'm living my dream.

20
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,285
You're my dream.

21
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,388
You can stop.

22
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:44,548
I so don't want to do this.

23
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,689
Recently, Haley got a little creative

24
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,994
on one of her college applications

25
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:50,933
and listed herself as a "big sister."

26
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:53,076
Technically, I am a big sister.

27
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:54,703
She capitalized the "b" and the "s."

28
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,937
Which makes sense, 'cause it was.

29
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,711
So Claire and I suggested--

30
00:00:58,712 --> 00:00:59,900
Forced.

31
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,974
That she volunteer
for the organization.

32
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:04,640
We couldn't be prouder.

33
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,575
We could.

34
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,766
Little bit.

35
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,165
Hey, dad?

36
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,290
Did you accidentally leave
this hilarious book

37
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,840
of lawyer jokes in the guest room?

38
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,723
I'll tell you if you can answer
the following question--

39
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:15,826
What's the difference between

40
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,821
- a catfish and a lawyer?
- I don't know. What?

41
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,999
Well, one's a bottom-feeding
mud-dweller.

42
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:22,461
The other's a fish.

43
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:23,821
Zing!

44
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:24,777
Honk!

45
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:27,039
Okay, everyone, dinner is served!

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,704
Let's get it!

47
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,588
Our house is being fumigated,
so Jay and Gloria

48
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,672
invited us to stay here
for a few days.

49
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,677
I am very excited to have
72 hours with this one.

50
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,340
We don't get to spend
much time together,

51
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,985
so I know that
we're gonna be like, um...

52
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:41,487
Fred and Ginger?

53
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:42,694
Who?

54
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,671
Movie night!

55
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,522
It's nosier than usual around here.

56
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,223
Oh, gosh!

57
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:58,564

58
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,317
Tad, this wine is fantastic.

59
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:10,567
Spend a week in Mendoza,

60
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:13,088
and you'll find a dozen
or so malbec producers

61
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:15,738
that'll give most Bordeaux a
real run for their money.

62
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:17,491
- Mm.
- I'm sorry.

63
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:18,724
This should come with a warning--

64
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,343
"may cause pretentiousness."

65
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,004
You should come with a warning--
"may be fascinating."

66
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,357
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Ohoh, gosh!

67
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:26,553
- Oh. Ow.
- Oh, that's, like, the ninth time

68
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:27,604
this screw has popped out.

69
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,615
Oh, you know what?
I need the angled screwdriver.

70
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,812
- I left it at the office.
- Mm.

71
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:34,427
I, um, I keep it there
because of--of all my signs.

72
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,645
I'll, uh, put up a "for sale" sign,

73
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:37,970
and next day, of course,

74
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,785
- I gotta put up the "sold" banner.
- Yeah.

75
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,575
Then the next day,
same deal--"for sale

76
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:42,443
- "sold."
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:44,515
"For sale." "Sold." "For sale." "Sold."

78
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:45,360
You're a great-- great salesman.

79
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,720
- I'm getting that.
- "For sale." "Sold."

80
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,592
Right. Listen, I-I-I gotta
go relieve the babysitter.

81
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:52,106
My ex-wife took 50% of my stuff

82
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,395
and left me 100% of my kids.

83
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:56,731
- They're great.
- Hey, listen, um,

84
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:57,894
- thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah, yeah.

85
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,182
Oh, no, thank you, Phil, so much

86
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:02,439
for the salmon and the steak

87
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,044
- and the chicken and the shrimp.
- Oh...

88
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:05,735
I mean, it was all just delicious.

89
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,587
- Oh, great.
- This guy is very lucky to have you.

90
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:10,660
Okay. Thanks.

91
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,807
Yeah.

92
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:14,403
All right.

93
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,287
- Let me grab that.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:17,313
Yeah. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.

95
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:18,398
Bye-bye.

96
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:22,563
Did you see that?

97
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:24,288
A handshake that
almost became a hug?

98
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,969
Yeah, I saw it. I lived it.
I think I'm in.

99
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,844
No, honey.
He kissed me on the lips.

100
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:31,256
- Another good sign!
- It's not a good sign.

101
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,981
Sweetie, you don't think
that's weird?

102
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:34,565
Well, the guy's a world traveler.

103
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:35,947
He has a time share
in Costa Rica.

104
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:37,321
That's probably
how they do it there.

105
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:40,088
I don't know, honey.
It felt like he lingered.

106
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,607
It's a progressive culture.

107
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:43,747
Most of them travel by zip line.

108
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,963
Biscuits and gravy?

109
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:50,221
Yep, my grandma Bitsy's
secret recipe,

110
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:53,002
given to her by
her housekeeper Delilah,

111
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,402
who raised her
and was her best friend--

112
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,377
kind of like "The Help,"
except Delilah was white,

113
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,767
and was actually herself
quite the racist.

114
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,805
Eat up.

115
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,381
Good morning!

116
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:03,781
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

117
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,898
Ah, where did those come from?

118
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:07,647
Yeah, I thought amaryllis
were out of season.

119
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,430
Oh, I got a guy.
You know, I just thought

120
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,859
they'd brighten up
the house a little bit.

121
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,296
Oh, that was so thoughtful of you.

122
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:16,521
I didn't realize that my
house needed brightening up.

123
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,028
There she is!

124
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,983
Gloria! Gloria!

125
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:21,686
Ay! Let me fix your hair!

126
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,608
Oh. Well, isn't that sweet?

127
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,149
I didn't realize her hair was broken.

128
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,642
Ah! That smells delicious,

129
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,732
but nothing for me.
I've got an early work lunch.

130
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,535
Really? I didn't hear an ambulance.

131
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:37,537
Yeah, it's funny because it's
what I've dedicated my life to.

132
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,102
Oh, is this that meeting
with the deejay

133
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,707
- with the funny name?
- Booker Bell.

134
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,078
- Booker Bell.
- Booker Bell?

135
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,189
Everybody now!

136
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,321
Booker Bell was only
the greatest deejay

137
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,947
in the history of Drive Time Radio.

138
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:49,117
Yeah, well, now he has some
wetlands that developers want,

139
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:51,124
and we're trying to get him
to donate for preservation.

140
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,281
When I was on the road selling,

141
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:53,634
I used to listen to
Booker all the time.

142
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,736
He practically invented
the prank phone call.

143
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:58,085
Okay. Wish me luck.

144
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,018
Good luck, sweetie!

145
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,517
Booker would play a prank,

146
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:02,193
the sucker would be
twisting in the wind,

147
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:03,814
and just when you couldn't
stand it anymore,

148
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,541
he'd say, "guess who just
got their bell rung!"

149
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:07,919
God, I'd love to meet him.

150
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,574
Oh, they're just
going down to Rae's.

151
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,332
You should pop down.

152
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,363
- I'm sure he'd love to meet a fan.
- I don't know.

153
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:14,598
I met Boz Scaggs once,
got all tongue-tied.

154
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,617
Oh, you'll be fine.

155
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,768
Oh! Oh, Lily, it's time
for school, sweetie.

156
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,188
Oh, I can take her.

157
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,780
Yay! Yay!

158
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,416
Oh. That'd be great.

159
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,544
Yeah, it'd give me some more
time to clean the kitchen.

160
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,696
Maybe do a little dusting.

161
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:29,966
- Delicious, Cam.
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:37,004
Annie was amazing, so
funny and cute and sweet.

163
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,634
- Yeah, you've said.
- She made this for me last night.

164
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,948
Look how she signs her name
with that big loopy "a."

165
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,095
I'm totally going to frame this.

166
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,871
I made this for Haley four years ago.

167
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,356
You think this got framed?

168
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:53,183
She tossed it in the garbage...

169
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,875
Right after she wrote
"Mrs. Haley Jonas Brothers"

170
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,700
on it, like, 30 times.

171
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,389
The tax write-off alone
makes financial sense.

172
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,146
You know, even if you take
the environment out of it.

173
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,703
Well, don't take
the environment out of it.

174
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:06,396
Without the wetlands,
there's no ducks,

175
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,224
and without the ducks, there's
nothing for me to shoot at.

176
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,239
Okay. Well, we're shooting
from two different angles,

177
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,375
but, uh, hopefully we'll
end up at the same place.

178
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:14,886
- Mitch.
- Dad?

179
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,610
I just had to stop down
and meet this guy.

180
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,417
Booker Bell, I'm Boz Scaggs--

181
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:22,553
No! I mean Jay Pritchett. Damn it.

182
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,438
- It's nice to meet you.
- This is such an honor.

183
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,220
You are hands down my favorite
radio personality of all time.

184
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,142
That's kind of you to say.

185
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:29,610
Okay. Well, thanks for
stopping by, dad.

186
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:31,755
- You know, I gotta tell you one thing.
- I'll see you back at the house.

187
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:34,656
One time when I was driving
from Youngstown to Sugar Creek,

188
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,973
you called this guy at
a Kitty Litter Company

189
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:39,162
and you asked him to bring
over 900 pounds of litter,

190
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:42,519
and in the background, you hear
all these lions roaring, and...

191
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,167
I-I-I laughed so hard,
I almost had an accident.

192
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,527
The car or you?

193
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:52,737
Funny as ever!

194
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,827
- Anyway... - Hey, are you still
in touch with the old gang?

195
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:57,931
Grandma Groovy? Spaceman Clyde?

196
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,261
- Are you kidding? I am the old gang.
- No way.

197
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,882
I may be old, but I still
know how to boggie.

198
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,696
My God, it's like she's here!

199
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:05,851
She is here!

200
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,493
How are you still not getting this?

201
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,745
That's her.

202
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:09,941
Excuse me for a sec.

203
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:13,052
What are you doing?

204
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,293
What? I'm a fan.
I came down to say hi.

205
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:16,552
This is a business meeting.

206
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:19,074
Do you have any idea how
inappropiate this is?

207
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,497
No. No, of course you don't,

208
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,233
because as far as you're
concerned, all a lawyer does

209
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,306
is walk into a bar with
a rabbi and polar bear.

210
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:27,691
Grizzly, 'cause otherwise,
with the bartender--

211
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,743
Dad! I'm working!

212
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:30,935
You're embarrasing both of us!

213
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:32,395
Please, you gotta go!

214
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,894
Okay, I didn't realize that.

215
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,571
Yeah. Yeah. You didn't.

216
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,679
I'm sorry, go!

217
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,180
Hey. Where's my stalker?

218
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,405
Oh, he's gone. I've got rid of him.

219
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,072
I'm sorry that
he attacked you like that.

220
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,594
Attacked?

221
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,240
No, I don't mind a little smoke
of my bloomers.

222
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,721
Well, just I thought since
this was a business meeting,

223
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:51,534
- we should--
- And you thought

224
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:53,323
that maybe hanging with
somebody would make me feel good

225
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:54,278
with racket?

226
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,200
There's been a lot of tension
between me and my dad.

227
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,899
I'm actually staying at his house...

228
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:01,510
Oh, so you chased away a man
who's opening his home to you.

229
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:04,107
I get the sense that I'm losing you.

230
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,619
Could I talk to Grandma Groovy?

231
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:08,171
Honey, I'm home.

232
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,267
Hell, I didn't expect you
so early dear..

233
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,207
What? You?

234
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,860
Yeah, look who came by
to fix the table.

235
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,088
Well, I had some time to kill,

236
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,379
so I thought I'd drop by with
that tool your wife needed.

237
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,191
Wow. What a guy. Yeah.

238
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:22,012
Mm-hmm. He also brought some wine.

239
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:23,459
Well, you said you liked it last night,

240
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,659
so I had a couple extra
bottles lying around.

241
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,789
Boy, do you know the way
to this gal's heart.

242
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,708
Okay.

243
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,462
I didn't just come here
to fix your table

244
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,558
and get your wife drunk.

245
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,953
I actually decided
to give you that listing

246
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:35,019
on the sycamore property.

247
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,072
Really? That's great.

248
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:39,426
Yeah. Why don't you, uh, come
over for dinner tonight?

249
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:42,111
And, uh, we'll work out all the details.
One entree.

250
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,437
Okay. Claire, you should come, too.

251
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:44,882
Oh, no, no. No, no, if it's business--

252
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:46,234
- I insist.
- He insists.

253
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,137
- We'll be there. We're coming.
- Okay.

254
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:48,651
Yeah, shall we say, uh, 7:00?

255
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,060
- 7:00 sounds great.
- Okay.

256
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,067
All right.

257
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,512
- I'll let myself out.
- Okay.

258
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,055
Wow.

259
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,718
"Wow" is right.

260
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,382
- Mm-hmm.
- I just got sycamore--

261
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:05,295
a house that sells itself and
gives me the commission.

262
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,462
How does that not bother you?

263
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:08,895
Claire, it's an expression.

264
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,329
There's work.
Inspections, appraisals--

265
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,156
He brought me wine,

266
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:14,687
he took his shirt off
when you weren't here!

267
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:15,890
Um, he brought us wine,

268
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,572
and it doesn't look super
vacuumed down there.

269
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:18,956
I'm surprised
he kept his pants on.

270
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,505
Okay. Okay, I can see what's going on.

271
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:22,807
You--you're just so focused
on getting his business,

272
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:24,751
that you don't see what's
going on in front of you.

273
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:27,253
Okay. Now I do see
what's going on.

274
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:28,949
- What?
- Come here, pretty girl.

275
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,875
- What? Mm? - You are, you know.
You don't hear it enough.

276
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,797
The other night,
when you put on makeup,

277
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:37,271
I was like, "there she is."

278
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:38,392
Oh, my God.

279
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:41,283
You think I'm making this up as
some part of a-an ego boost?

280
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,828
Do you realize
how insulting that is?

281
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,098
What are you doing?

282
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,332
Helping my little sister
with her homework.

283
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,493
That seems... mean.

284
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,134
Annie, this is Alex.

285
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,665
That other sister
I was telling you about.

286
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:57,886
Hi. So nice to meet you.

287
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,481
Um, if you're going to study there,

288
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,493
you might need to correct
numbers 7 through 10.

289
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,502
This bed has higher
standards than that bed.

290
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,972
I'm going to get
some more lemonade.

291
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:13,384
I think your sister's mad
at our sister.

292
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:20,449
We're back!

293
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:22,318
Oh, well, there you are.
I guess "lunch then home"

294
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:23,787
means different things
to different people.

295
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,988
We had a girls' day.
Lily, Lily, come!

296
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,209
Show your papa what we bought!

297
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,192
Matchy jackets!

298
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,696
It's like she's the baby leopard,

299
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,028
and I'm the mama.

300
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:34,329
Or they just happened
to have two jackets,

301
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:35,630
one large, one small.

302
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,533
What happened here?
Where is my tea?

303
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,035
Oh, it's in this drawer over here.

304
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,737
As a thank-you, I took some
time to rearrange your kitchen

305
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,638
so it makes sense.

306
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,240
To who?

307
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,176
To everyone.
There's a flow now. Watch--

308
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:51,312
Tea. Mug. Kettle. You're welcome.

309
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,667
I didn't thank you.

310
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:54,789
You don't have to.

311
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,317
I won't.

312
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:09,780
Cam, our shared bathroom
is not the place

313
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:11,682
to work out
whatever's going on here.

314
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,183
I'm a child of divorce.

315
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,720
Conflict resolution is
something of a specialty.

316
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:17,622
The key is, tell a personal story

317
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,266
that applies to their situation,

318
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,057
even if you have to make one up.

319
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,025
That way, they really hear
what they need to hear.

320
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:26,329
I'm sorry. You're right.

321
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:29,462
No. I'm sorry I snapped.

322
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:30,833
I'm just going through some stuff

323
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,435
with this girl I like, Danielle.

324
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:35,771
She came over the other day,
and Stella was all over her,

325
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,034
and--and I got jealous.
Which is crazy, right?

326
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,257
I mean, Stella was only playing
with her because she was new.

327
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:44,163
Manny, sounds like Danielle was trying

328
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:45,414
to get between you and your puppy,

329
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:46,848
and that ain't cool.

330
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,752
She seems immature,
and you can do better.

331
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,218
I'm sorry to be blunt,

332
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,484
but I'm going through
something myself right now.

333
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,923
So, chin up. Okay.

334
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:57,558
It may not work every time,

335
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,594
but you only need one fish to bite.

336
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,301
Who is this Danielle?

337
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,637
She's my study partner
in my history class,

338
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:04,387
and we share a notebook.

339
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:05,841
But her notes were really confusing,

340
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,110
so I put them in order.

341
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,514
Instead of thanking me for
making our lives easier,

342
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,949
she got all mad because she
thought I was judging her.

343
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,612
This girl is very bad news, Manny.

344
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:18,308
You stay away from her.

345
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:23,456
- Hey.
- Hi.

346
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:24,536
We're Phil and Claire.

347
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,395
Hey, I'm Tony. Come on in.
I'll go get my dad.

348
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,929
- Okay.
- Great, thanks.

349
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,633
- Wow. - I don't like the way
that kid was looking at you.

350
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:31,968
We are not friends right now.

351
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:34,036
I am only here to help
pump up the college fund.

352
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:36,038
Claire, if Tad even makes
a move towards you,

353
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:37,574
his ass is... grass.

354
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,908
Really? I thought
that was just my ego.

355
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,142
So far, yeah, but just know,

356
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,678
I'm ready to grass his ass.

357
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:43,779
Hey, hey, hey, guys.

358
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,980
- Hey!
- How are you!

359
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,715
- Good.
- Good to see you.

360
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:49,084
- Yeah.
- Hi. That's good.

361
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,919
Well, I love the place.
Did you remodel this?

362
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,320
Uh, actually, my ex-wife.

363
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,722
She had a, uh, passion
for modern architecture

364
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,557
and at least one modern architect.

365
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,959
May have to sell this one next.

366
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,294
Really? Wow.

367
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,234
I love how open it is.

368
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,097
- Do you mind if I, uh, poke around?
- Please, yeah.

369
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,331
Beautiful.

370
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,833
Tad, if you don't need my
help anymore with the kids,

371
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,602
- I'll be going.
- Thank you so much, Ellen.

372
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:08,636
You're welcome.

373
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,270
Okay. We'll see you later. Bye.

374
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,646
I saw this house eight years ago.

375
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,160
There used to be a wall here, right?

376
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,105
That's right. That's right.
That was all covered.

377
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:16,973
Yeah. I'm a detail guy.
Hard to get much past me.

378
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,436
Hello, hello!

379
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:19,449
- Hi, Aunt Kara!
- Hey! How are you?

380
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,417
Good, Tad, how you doing?

381
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:21,972
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

382
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,829
- Bye, dad.
- Have fun.

383
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,922
- Okay. See you later.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

384
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,696
These stairs used to be teak, am I right?

385
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:30,851
This guy's good.

386
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,786
Yeah, he's good.

387
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,855
- He's sharp.
- I forgot my bag.

388
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:36,857
You do that every time.

389
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:38,792
Yep.

390
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:40,758
I don't miss much.

391
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,995
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you trying to read?

392
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,515
You're the one who tries to read.

393
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:52,484
Oh, my gosh! I am not that stupid!

394
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:53,445
Seriously, Haley, you think you

395
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:54,886
- are the coolest person ever!
- Would you please stop

396
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:55,811
just judging me and everything that I do?

397
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:56,355
"Look at me! I'm so cool!"

398
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:58,022
Enough! Enough!

399
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,491
I am so sick of you two
fighting all the time!

400
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,792
You're a bad big sister,

401
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,927
and you're a bad little sister!

402
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:06,764
And you're both
bad big sisters to me.

403
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,679
Be normaler.

404
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:13,738
Wow.

405
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:16,839
I've never seen him like that.

406
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:19,270
Well, we do kind of neglect him.

407
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,339
And if you think about it,

408
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,809
he is kind of... our little sister.

409
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,478
Remember how we used
to dress him up?

410
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,113
I miss her.

411
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:31,281
I hear you, and I don't
like where this is going!

412
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,670
You get the lipstick,

413
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,530
I'll get the bra and tennis balls.

414
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,166
Betty Luke!

415
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,534
I will burn this house down!

416
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,857
Where is the cheese grater?

417
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:07,594
Where is the cutting board?

418
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:09,830
Where would you want it to be?

419
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:16,370
Yes, right here next
to the cheese grater.

420
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,251
I know it's hard to tell
by looking at me,

421
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,645
but I am not a natural homemaker.

422
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,609
So when Cam came
and organized my kitchen,

423
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:27,013
I felt insecure and lashed out.

424
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,481
In a way, I'm no better

425
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:30,608
than Manny's crazy friend Danielle.

426
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,787
Please, can we just focus
on the cooking?

427
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:42,594
Daddy, we forgot to give you this.

428
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,263
It's like our jackets.

429
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:47,621
I love it.

430
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:51,224
I guess I've always been
a little sensitive

431
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:53,039
about Lily not having a mother,

432
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,206
and Gloria's so good at it.

433
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:56,846
I got jealous.

434
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,373
Maybe I should tell Manny this story.

435
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,774
It might help him with
that train wreck Danielle.

436
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,680
You know what?
Why don't you turn that music back on.

437
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:05,949
Was kind of nice.

438
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:31,868
Hey, dad...

439
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:33,048
No need to talk about it.

440
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,467
I was out of line
coming down there,

441
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:36,276
won't happen again.
Scotch is at the bar.

442
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:37,917
No, I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

443
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:38,985
I guess we're gonna talk about it.

444
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:40,419
I was rude to you.

445
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,884
I think I was just annoyed
by all the lawyer jokes.

446
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,048
I mean, let's be honest,
you don't exactly

447
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:47,121
beam with pride over
what I do for a living.

448
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,625
Mockery is the sincerest
form of flattery.

449
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:50,897
Pretty sure that's--
that's not the saying,

450
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:53,199
but, um, you know,
Manny told me a story

451
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,623
about his friend Danielle.

452
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,635
She sounds like a real
piece of work, by the way.

453
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,603
But, uh, it made me realize that

454
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,514
I take myself a little too seriously.

455
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:05,243
Listen, it goes without saying
I've always been proud of you,

456
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:07,204
and I brag about you all the time.

457
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,523
So if I say, "what do lawyers
use as birth control?"

458
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:12,441
And the answer is, "their personalities,"

459
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,852
I want you to know I'm
not referring to you.

460
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,392
You don't need any birth control.

461
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,768
Hello?

462
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:23,681
Yeah, this is Jay Pritchett.

463
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,181
What? When?

464
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,059
What happened?

465
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,822
It's the police. My car got stolen.

466
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,105
Yeah, 2012. Gray.

467
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,337
No, not pewter. More like a light...

468
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,205
Like a--no, not slate.

469
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,527
I don't even know
what "coastal fog" is.

470
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,193
Just put down "gray."

471
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:41,735
Kilo?

472
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:42,937
It's not my car.

473
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:44,537
Yes, she's columbian.

474
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,606
What does that have to do
with--no, I'm coming down there.

475
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,442
Hang on. Grab your keys.

476
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,476
I think I might need a lawyer.

477
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,481
Guess who just got his bell rung?

478
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:01,478
That's good.

479
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,684
That's good.

480
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,091
Here we go. Have a seat.

481
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:07,369
I got a bottle of port from 1899.

482
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,753
- Whoa.
- Wow!

483
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,912
Okay, I got it for $18.99...

484
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,531
But it's a good one.

485
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,236
Fun night, right? Great dinner?

486
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,405
Yes. Yes, and...

487
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,673
Tad is... great,

488
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,576
- and I know I was giving
you a hard time... - Hey.

489
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:27,445
But I feel like I should
say that I am sorry.

490
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:29,170
Hey, hey, hey, Claire, you
don't need to explain.

491
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:31,460
Your apology is apology enough.

492
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,959
Oh, I forgot the best part
of the Costa Rica story.

493
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,746
So we get home, and they've
taken over the living room,

494
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,030
they've taken over the kitchen,

495
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,098
I mean, they're in the
food, they're on the bed.

496
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:45,341
And finally, after two years of
complaining to Diego about this,

497
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,292
he finally stops and says,

498
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,833
"okay, now I see it.
You do have a monkey problem."

499
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,265
A monkey problem!

500
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:00,617
Yeah, I heard him the first time.

501
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,791
You can kiss my wife,
you can take her to bed,

502
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,919
but you cannot make her laugh.

503
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,754
I wanna go back.

504
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:10,192
You can kiss my wife,

505
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,399
but only I can take her to
bed and make her laugh.

506
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,645
I wanna go back.

507
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,918
Only I can take my wife to bed,

508
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,024
comma,

509
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,813
and make her laugh.

510
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,908
I mean, they're in everything.

511
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,462
The only thing they didn't touch--

512
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,617
the bananas.

513
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,927
The monkeys love bananas!

514
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,795
You would think they
would love the bananas.

515
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:36,986
Yeah, we should go.

516
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:39,197
- Come on. The bananas--
- Yeah, we need to go.

517
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,174
- We gotta get going.
- Oh, no, no, no.

518
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,647
- Yeah, yeah, we're late.
- But he just opened the--

519
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,656
- we're late for getting home.
- Thanks for everything. Just--

520
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,339
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

521
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:46,906
What is wrong with you?

522
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:48,675
You laughed like
it was "who's on first?"

523
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:49,366
What?

524
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,342
He's on second.
Don't try to cheer me up.

525
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,011
I know what's going on here.
You're jealous.

526
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:54,887
Of him?

527
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:56,784
He's not even funny!

528
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:58,850
What's he got?
Like, a soft ten minutes?

529
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,251
And he goes to the Costa Rican well

530
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,920
a little too much for my taste.

531
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:03,789
Oh, God.

532
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:05,203
Really? This is still about the monkey?

533
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,457
No! No, no, no!

534
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:09,426
It's you. You are making
me so happy right now.

535
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:12,529
You stormed out of there, and
you're acting like an idiot.

536
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,666
You like this?
Because I am really uncomfortable.

537
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:18,836
Honey, I love it.
Makes me feel special.

538
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,172
Sometimes,
I really don't understand you.

539
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:22,948
I know. It's stupid,

540
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:25,862
but it's nice to know that
sometimes you'll fight for me,

541
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:28,651
and all I have to do is laugh
at some other guy's story.

542
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:32,816
But no one makes me
laugh like you do.

543
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,118
- As long as it's always genuine.
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:36,319
You can fake anything
you want with me,

545
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,721
but not your laugh.

546
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,178
- I'd like to go back.
- Yeah.

547
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,808
Stop it! Leave me alone!

548
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:47,865
- Hold still!
- Stop moving!

549
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,374
I hate you! Get off of me!

550
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,339
What... is going on?

551
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:54,469
You guys are in a lot of trouble.

552
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,437
Haley, I told you
to clean this mess up,

553
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,106
and, Alex, your books are everywhere.

554
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,032
Betty Luke, sit down while
your dad gets the camera.

555
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:01,885
Got it.

556
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:03,962
Last time, you made a funny face

557
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,941
and we didn't really get
a good shot,

558
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,634
so let's work on our smile.

559
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:10,356
Okay. Good to see you,
Betty Luke.

560
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:15,860
