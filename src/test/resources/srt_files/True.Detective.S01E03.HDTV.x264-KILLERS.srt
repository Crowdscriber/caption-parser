were getting better.

4

Got away from Charlie.

5
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:09,273
She called up here
for you not too long ago.

she's going to become a nun.

my two detectives are stalling,

00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,915
and I got a task force
wants to take it off our hands.

15
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:31,943
So Cohle didn't want
to give it to the task force.

- Did you?
- No.

17
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,680

Kind of trailer park.

18

Called "The Ranch."

19
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:39,029
Something happened to a girl.

You got any idea where she might have
been staying the last few weeks?

23
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:47,227
She'd been going to church.

just turned things around.

About 6 months.

He was hunched forward
talking to her,

979
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,728
Ledoux did two years
at Avoyelles,

980
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:45,431
and guess who his cellmate was

981
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:46,831
the last 4 months.

982
00:53:46,864 --> 00:53:48,798
Charlie Lange.

983
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:51,205
I got to give you this one.

984
00:53:51,238 --> 00:53:53,774
I started to believe
you were going

985
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:55,640
a little off your nut.

986
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:58,371
I mean, you're bonkers,
just not on this.

987
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:00,137
All right.
Where was Ledoux?

988
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,305
Getting a list
of relatives, KAs.

989
00:54:02,346 --> 00:54:05,045
Been out of pocket
since jumping parole.

990
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:06,416
We'll find him.

991
00:54:06,457 --> 00:54:07,583
This makes sense.

992
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:08,719
Looks good, baby.

993
00:54:08,752 --> 00:54:10,222
All right.
We are on our way.

994
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:11,255
To Avoyelles.

995
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:12,626
Fuck, yeah, Martin.
Let's go.

996
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:13,994
I'm calling the interstate APB

997
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:15,764
and the US Marshals on this.

998
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:17,435
I-23 to dispatch.

999
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:19,267
WOMAN ON POLICE RADIO:
Come in, I-23.

1000
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,404
What can I say?

1001
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:21,676
I thought for a minute,
you just liked looking

1002
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:23,171
at pictures of dead people.

1003
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:26,077
I need an all-state APB
on one Reginald Ledoux.

1004
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,781
R&I came back with info.

1005
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:29,316
All US Marshals
and Highway Patrol,

1006
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,818
be advised, detain
on sight, over.

1007
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,019
WOMAN ON POLICE RADIO:
Roger that, Detective.

1008
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,286
We've got that sent now.

1009
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:37,160
COHLE: Mm, mm, mm.

♪

1011
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:45,060
And finally, we arrive
at Reginald Ledoux. Heh.

1012
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:50,974
HART: Come on, man.

1013
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:54,606
You want to ask me,
ask, goddamn it.

1014
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,344
You ever been in a gunfight?

1015
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,312
No.

1016
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:00,646
♪

1017
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:01,845
Well, then how the fuck
you gonna know

1018
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:04,015
what I'm talking about?

1019
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:09,933
COHLE: Man, that place--
I never--

1020
00:55:11,271 --> 00:55:16,412
That day, it reminded me
of my pop talking about 'Nam

1021
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:18,277
and the jungle thing.

1022
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:23,115
Look. Me talking about
what happened back then,

1023
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:26,251
that ain't gonna do you
any good now.

1024
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,323
This--

1025
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:35,229
This is what I'm talking about.

1026
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,399
This is what I mean

1027
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,441
when I'm talking
about time and death

1028
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,777
and futility.

1029
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,850
There are broader ideas
at work,

1030
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:49,652
mainly what is owed
between us as a society

1031
00:55:49,685 --> 00:55:51,922
for our mutual illusions.

1032
00:55:51,955 --> 00:55:54,958
14 straight hours
of staring at DBs,

1033
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:59,500
these are the things
you think of.

1034
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:03,766
You ever done that? Hmm?

1035
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:07,638
You look in their eyes,
even in a picture.

1036
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:09,744
Doesn't matter
if they're dead or alive.

1037
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:12,882
You can still read them,
and you know what you see?

1038
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:18,730
They welcomed it,

1039
00:56:18,763 --> 00:56:21,496
mm-hmm, not at first,

1040
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:24,402
but right there
in the last instant.

1041
00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:29,607
It an unmistakable relief,
see, because they were afraid

1042
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,313
and now they saw
for the very first time

1043
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:37,687
how easy it was to just let go,
and they saw--

1044
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,760
In that last nanosecond,
they saw what they were,

1045
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:46,431
that you, yourself,
this whole big drama,

1046
00:56:46,464 --> 00:56:48,998
it was never anything
but a jerry-rig

1047
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:54,069
of presumption and dumb will
and you could just let go

1048
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:57,008
finally now that you didn't have
to hold on so tight...

1049
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:04,082
to realize that
all your life--

1050
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:05,692
you know, all your love,
all your hate,

1051
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:09,658
all your memory, all your pain--
it was all the same thing.

1052
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:12,729
It was all the same dream,
a dream that you had

1053
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,830
inside a locked room,

1054
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:21,534
a dream about being a person...

1055
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:31,875
and like a lot of dreams...

1056
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:40,249
there's a monster
at the end of it.
