Find Walker.

6
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:24,348
Walker's not even
critical.

7
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:26,452
He's just a part,
a piece, a pixel.

8
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:27,953
There is a bigger,
pernicious,

9
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,124
Abu Nazir-worthy plot
out there,

10
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,559
and we have
little time.

Carrie...
you're not yourself.

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,629
She's bipolar.

13
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:39,565
This explosion must have
sent her into a flight.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,566
Carrie said something
interesting.

15
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,606
Sniper attack-- that doesn't
make sense for Abu Nazir.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,210
It's not his methodology.

17
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,411
Well, maybe it
is when he has

18
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:49,979
a military sniper
working for him.

19
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,381

something bigger.

24
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:06,604
Hello.

25
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,906
I'm calling about Abu Nazir.

26
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:11,111
Something happened to him,
a tragedy.

27
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,513
You were with him then.

28
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:14,182
Y-You have insight.

29
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,517
Would it help if we met?

30
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,419
I'm home.
Stay there.

31
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:21,592
Sergeant Brody
called me.

32
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:22,961
He told me everything.

33
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,097
Your office at Langley's
being cleared as we speak.

34
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,767
I am about to solve
this fucking thing!

35
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:28,768
Strip it.

36
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:29,970
SAUL:
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

37
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,639
<i>I feel responsible in a way.</i>

38
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:35,510
'Cause when you came back
from Baghdad, I knew.

39
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,713
You were damaged.

40
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,615
There's no time, Saul.

41
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:44,487
It's high purple.

42
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:53,030
My name is Nicholas Brody...

43
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:56,400
and I'm a sergeant in
the United States Marine Corps.

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,072
I have a wife...

45
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:05,075
and two kids...

46
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,145
who I love.

47
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,254
By the time you watch this,

48
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:18,358
you'll have read
a lot of things about me,

49
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,261
about what I've done,

50
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,496
and so I wanted
to explain myself.

51
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:27,267
So that you'll know the truth.

52
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:33,273
On May 19, 2003,

53
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:35,375
as part of a two-man sniper team

54
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,611
serving
in Operation Iraqi Freedom,

55
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:43,583
I was taken prisoner by forces
loyal to Saddam Hussein.

56
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:48,556
Those forces then sold me to an
al-Qaeda commander-- Abu Nazir,

57
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,257
who was operating
a terrorist cell

58
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,694
from across the Syrian border

59
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:56,999
where I was held captive
for more than eight years.

60
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,637
I was beaten...

61
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:05,374
I was tortured...

62
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:10,980
and I was subjected to
long periods of total isolation.

63
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,121
People will say I was broken,

64
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,324
I was brainwashed.

65
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:25,495
People will say that
I was turned into a terrorist,

66
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,897
taught to hate my country.

67
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:36,006
I love my country.

68
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,777
What I am is a marine,

69
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,780
like my father before me

70
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:46,351
and his father before him,
and as a marine,

71
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:50,756
I swore an oath to defend
the United States of America

72
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,460
against enemies
both foreign and domestic.

73
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:59,533
My action this day

74
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:03,170
is against
such domestic enemies--

75
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:07,808
the vice president and members
of his national security team,

76
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:11,979
who I know to be liars
and war criminals

77
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:15,950
responsible for atrocities they
were never held accountable for.

78
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,991
This is about justice
for 82 children...

79
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:27,861
whose deaths
were never acknowledged

80
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:32,465
and whose murder is a stain
on the soul of this nation.

81
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,469
Hi.

82
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:40,173
Any change?

83
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,508
Afraid not.

84
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,184
How worried
should we be?

85
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:53,986
Worried.

86
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,322
I haven't seen her like
this in a long time.

87
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:57,923
She's not eating,

88
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,492
she hasn't left her
room in three days.

89
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:08,100
What about the lithium?

90
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,168
I thought you said
that'd be kicking in by now.

91
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,070
It has kicked in.

92
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,507
<i>This is the depression that</i>
<i>comes in the wake of the mania.</i>

93
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,743
<i>It's actually</i>
<i>much harder to treat.</i>

94
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,446
Think some chicken soup
would help?

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,381
It might.

96
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:27,551
Elixir of the gods.

97
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:28,786
Can I go see her?

98
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,187
Of course.

99
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,455
Saul.

100
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,091
What does being on
administrative leave

101
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,425
mean exactly?

102
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:42,798
Well...

103
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,800
she's not going to face
any criminal charges,

104
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,302
thank God,

105
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,271
but we shouldn't kid
ourselves.

106
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:52,675
She's never going
to set foot in Langley again.

107
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:06,724
Hey, you.

108
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,727
Hey, Mr. Berenson.

109
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:11,629
(sniffs)

110
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,132
Remember when I used
to call you that?

111
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,333
What?

112
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:20,405
Mr. Berenson.

113
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,409
Yeah... a long-ass time ago.

114
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:28,447
Back when I could still piss
in a straight line.

115
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,950
How are you,
Carrie?

116
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,024
I've been better.

117
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,027
Don't worry,
I can't stay long.

118
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,962
(grunts)

119
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:54,874
Why don't you tell me
a story?

120
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,977
What kind of a story?

121
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,982
About a bad man
named Nazir

122
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,718
who took a break
from doing bad things,

123
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:06,320
only nobody
could figure out why.

124
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:07,988
You know I can't
talk about that.

125
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,523
(sighs)

126
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,559
I know, until my security
clearance is restored.

127
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,128
I know.

128
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:16,197
(sighs)

129
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:18,733
You need to concentrate
on getting better.

130
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:24,205
At least tell me that you're
still looking into it,

131
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:28,075
that you won't
give up.

132
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,077
You promise me that.

133
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:33,012
(whispering):
Promise.

134
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:44,523
(sighs deeply)

135
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,936
No, don't go.

136
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:06,245
Why did he do it?

137
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,847
Who?

138
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:11,183
Brody.

139
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,754
Why?

140
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,793
Do what?

141
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:27,565
Call Estes and...
rat me out like that.

142
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:33,072
Honestly, I can think
of a hundred reasons.

143
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:37,577
The man's running for
congress in case you forgot.

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,448
Think about it.

145
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:45,419
You're the last person he
needs in his life right now,

This man has poisoned
your thoughts.

149

He has cost you
almost everything.

150
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,570
Forget him.

151
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,575
I can't, Saul, I can't.

152

of distinguished
faces here tonight.

168
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,957
Yours,
Elizabeth.

169
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:13,360
The only reason
I'm here at all.

170
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:16,096
Thank you for convincing me
three years ago

171
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:18,665
to accept the nomination
for Vice President.

172
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:24,137
And yours, Richard.

173
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,039
You are the core

174
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,508
of what I'm confident will
be our next administration.

175
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,612
We've all been on a long,
difficult journey.

176
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:34,381
But tomorrow morning,
when I announce my candidacy,

177
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,515
we will throw down a gauntlet--

178
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,318
all of us here
in this room--

179
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:41,621
promising to put
America first again.

180
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:44,891
ALL:
"Hear! Hear!

181
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,226
(crowd chatter)

182
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:53,399
Good to see you, Walt.

183
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:56,802
(indistinct chatter)

184
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:59,171
Very nice.

185
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:00,906
You know, you're right.

186
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,341
It's a distinguished group.

187
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,976
Includes you, David.

188
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,311
It's a group worth protecting,
that's my point.

189
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:09,547
If you're asking me to call off
tomorrow, you know the answer.

190
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,183
I'm only suggesting
that we change the venue.

191
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,886
So I can announce a candidacy
from some hiding place?

192
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,822
(sighs)

193
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,057
You give them too much
credit, you know that?

194
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,525
Who's that, sir?

195
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,993
The enemy.
Guys like Walker.

196
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:25,663
He can do a lot
of damage.

197
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:28,033
To both of us.

198
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,369
Yes, he can.

199
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,341
But he's only one guy,

200
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,412
and you have the entire
Homeland Security apparatus

201
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:42,248
at your disposal.

202
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:46,119
For both our sakes,
take care of it.

203
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,087
And for God's sakes,
drink your champagne.

204
00:13:48,122 --> 00:13:50,523
It's Billecart-Salmon.

205
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:52,858
Yes, sir.
(chuckles)

206
00:13:57,763 --> 00:14:00,698
Oh, not again.

207
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:04,402
(sighing)

208
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:11,910
I'm sorry,
ma'am, but...

209
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:13,378
I know, I know.

210
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,081
Residents only.

211
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,649
What's it this time?

212
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,651
It's a major policy
address in the morning.

213
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:20,053
Vice President,
I think.

214
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,454
Oh, fucker.

215
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,223
Ma'am?

216
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:24,992
Serves me right

217
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,694
for buying two blocks
from the State Department.

218
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:32,132
Well, I'm sorry for
the inconvenience, Mrs. Sammler.

219
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,999
You have a
nice night.

220
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,868
Officers?

221
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,985
(gun clicks)
(gasps)

222
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,221
Okay, Mrs. Sammler.

223
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:00,960
Knock, knock.

224
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:03,262
Your night nurse is here.

225
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:07,334
I made spaghetti amatriciana.

226
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:09,302
You know, Carrie,

227
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:12,707
you're gonna to have
to eat sooner or later.

228
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,849
Damn it, Carrie.

229
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:22,452
You are starting to scare me.

230
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:25,721
Go... away.

231
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:28,224
I'm sorry, I
can't do that.

232
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:31,527
Your sister gave me
very strict orders.

233
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,730
So I'm going to sit here
with you until you fall asleep.

234
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,232
Okay?

235
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,968
Hmm. Smells good.

236
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,339
You sure you
don't want a bite?

237
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:53,180
JESSICA: <i>Chris, can you get the
butter</i> <i>out of the fridge?</i>

238
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,715
CHRIS:
<i>Yeah.</i>

239
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:56,483
So you're not coming
to my karate match?

240
00:15:56,518 --> 00:15:58,051
BRODY:
Buddy,

241
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:00,987
I told you, I got this event
with the Vice President.

242
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,422
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:04,390
JESSICA: Chris, we talked
about this, right?

244
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:06,092
Your dad'll go
to the next one.

245
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,427
Right?
Right.

246
00:16:08,462 --> 00:16:10,696
All right, dinner's ready.
Everybody, sit down.

247
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:18,105
(Jessica sighs)

248
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:19,873
(sighs) Whose turn
is it to say grace?

249
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:21,341
Mine.

250
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:24,611
Dad, do you know
how to do it?

251
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,380
I think I can fake it.

252
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,715
(laughs)

253
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:39,025
Dear God, bless
this food to thy use

254
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:41,727
and our lives to thy service.

255
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:45,730
And may you shine the light
of your love on this family...

256
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,202
hold them close...

257
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:55,373
and protect them always.

258
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:57,576
Amen.

259
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,978
CHRIS:
Amen.

260
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:02,648
Amen.

261
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,484
How did I do?
Not bad.

262
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,022

So, purify your soul.

268
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,433

Dad?

279
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:01,595
What are you doing?

280
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,365
What's going on?

281
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:09,269
How long have you been
standing there?

Dana?

283
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,779
Dad, you're scaring me.

284
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:22,014
Don't be scared.

285
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:24,984
Was that Arabic?

286
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,286
Yeah.

287
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,792
What does it mean?

288
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:37,265
It means, um...

289
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:46,274
I converted to Islam.

290
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:02,021
I didn't say anything to anyone,

291
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,557
because I didn't want
to upset you guys.

292
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:07,526
Well, then, it's a good thing

293
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,396
you didn't shoot a deer,
or step out on mom,

294
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:11,864
or beat the shit
out of Mike.

295
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,933
Okay, I deserved that.

296
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:23,008
Why do you wash your hands
and feet like that?

297
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,410
It's a ritual.

298
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:27,646
It's about purifying
your mind and body

299
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:30,449
before presenting yourself
to God.

300
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,894
Does Mom know anything
about any of this?

301
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:42,330
No.

302
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:44,566
She wouldn't get it...

303
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,935
at all.

304
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:52,773
Our little secret then?

305
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:58,680
Yeah.

306
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:11,292
MAN (over radio): These are the kind
of issues facing Vice President Walden

307
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:13,961
this morning as he prepares
to give his remarks.

308
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:17,130
The vice president will be
joined by staunch supporters

309
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,900
from virtually every corner
of the defense establishment,

310
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:22,736
including the Secretaries
of Defense and State

311
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,404
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

312
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,606
longtime advisor
Elizabeth Gaines.

313
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:30,277
The speech comes just days after
a bombing in downtown Washington

314
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:33,881
left five people dead
and it's clearly time to show...

315
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,417
in the next phase
of the war on terror.

316
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:40,055
Yet, the exact nature of
those measures remain unclear.

317
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,457
At the CIA,
Walden was widely credited

318
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:45,393
with developing closer ties
with the armed forces,

319
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:47,595
taking
a more militarized approach

320
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,097
to intelligence gathering,

321
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:51,165
and the elimination
of insurgents.

322
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,801
Under Walden's leadership,
the use of drone strikes...

323
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:54,569
Virgil?

324
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,906
became a key strategy
in the CIA's fight...

325
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,675
Virgil, where are my pills?
I need them!

326
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,979
Vice President Walden has met
with political resistance...

327
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:06,415
Virgil? Is anyone there?

328
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,417
VIRGIL: Carrie? (Gasps)

329
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,486
I'm right here.

330
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,587
Here. Here.

331
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:15,990
(panting)

332
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,126
(newscaster continues
indistinctly)

333
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:30,940
I need to get out of here.

334
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,875
Good. Uh, great.

335
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,245
We'll go for a walk, huh?

336
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,715
I want to go for a drive.

337
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:53,196
What are you doing here?

338
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,197
You're supposed to be
at the State Department.

339
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,200
I need your help
with something first.

340
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:59,335
(sighs)
What is that?

341
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,171
There's an 11-month gap
in Abu Nazir's activities.

342
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,874
Started around
two years ago.

343
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:08,511
He goes silent

344
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:12,015
like he fell off the
face of the earth.

345
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,517
Theory is,
there might have been some event

346
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,652
that precipitated this,

347
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,087
something that hit him
personally,

348
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,756
took him out of action
for a while.

349
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,624
And whose theory is that?

350
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,361
Just look at this.

351
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,366
It's all redacted.

352
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,834
What the hell
am I looking at?

353
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,703
I think it's a drone strike.

354
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,173
Why's that?

355
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,474
This reference
number here.

356
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,080
How'd you find this?

357
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,715
Grid search.

358
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:48,184
Cross-referenced with
Abu Nazir's likely locations

359
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:51,121
around the time
in question...

360
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,457
and I got
hundreds of hits.

361
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,394
None like this.

362
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,730
Can I ask
why you were even doing that?

363
00:24:58,764 --> 00:24:59,964
I told you,

364
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,567
there's a gap.

365
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,571
This gap-- is it related
to that wall of garbage

366
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,439
we found in Carrie's apartment?

367
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:09,807
It was a time line, David.

368
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,309
It was classified
material, Saul,

369
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,910
improperly removed
from this office,

370
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,045
assembled by a crazy woman
into a crazy collage,

371
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,447
and I don't even want to know
about your involvement in it.

372
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,450
Well, ask me.

373
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,451
I'll tell you.

374
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,485
I said

375
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,287
I don't even want to know.

376
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:27,958
I need you too much right now
to have you land in custody.

377
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,093
I, I need you to do your job.

378
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,329
I think I am.

379
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,098
You're not.

380
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,299
The vice president is hosting a
highly visible conference today.

381
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,935
I asked you to be our man
on the ground there.

382
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,837
Go do it.

383
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,983
This is good.

384
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,084
Excellent--
I can't feel my hands.

385
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,154
We ought to sic him
on Tom Walker.

386
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,256
Okay, let's go.
This is good.

387
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,359
We're going
to be late.

388
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,660
Sure you don't
want to come?

389
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,861
Well, I want to.

390
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,963
Then do.
Come on, guys, we settled

391
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,866
this already.

392
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,138
(panting)

393
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,840
Next time.

394
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,308
Sure.

395
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,112
Hey, come on.

396
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,114
(laughter)

397
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:22,715
(exclaims)

398
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,985
Come on, Bruce Lee, you're
going to miss your bout.

399
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,486
You got everything?
Yeah.

400
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:28,487
Jess.

401
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:29,555
We're gonna be late.

402
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,390
I'll see you later.

403
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,596
(panting)

404
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,803
The turn's right up here.

405
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,807
Just going
for a little drive, huh?

406
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,742
We're driving, aren't we?

407
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,978
Yeah.

408
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,884
Great.

409
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,986
You want to tell me what
the hell we're doing here?

410
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,254
Getting some fresh air.

411
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,589
No, I'm serious,

412
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,490
Carrie, I have
a van full of equipment,

413
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,759
a lot of it not exactly legal.

414
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,494
So why are we here?

415
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:13,065
Carrie.
In a few hours,

416
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,233
the vice president
is expected to announce

417
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:16,001
he's a candidate for President.

418
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,036
Okay.

419
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,738
Up ahead in that building

420
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:22,274
he'll be surrounded
by his entire team.

421
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,875
I said why are <i>we</i> here?

422
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,211
Half the government
is going to be in one spot

423
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,413
and we've got a terrorist
on the loose.

424
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,948
And you think
this is the target.

425
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,184
I think it's worth considering.

426
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,186
(sighs)

427
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,289
Okay, Carrie, look,
first of all,

428
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,957
we don't have a terrorist
on the loose.

429
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:39,958
We don't have anything.

430
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,393
You see these guys?

431
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,128
<i>They</i> have a terrorist
on the loose

432
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,896
and it's their job
to do something about it.

433
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:45,931
It's my job.

434
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,366
Not anymore it's not.

435
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,634
It'll always be my job.

436
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:49,869
Don't you get that?

437
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,740
Look around,
Carrie.

438
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,608
There is security
up the wazoo here.

439
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:57,709
They are on it.

440
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,044
We are not needed.

441
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,947
No, all those guys?

442
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,949
They're thinking
it's a single sniper.

443
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,217
Because that's what it is.

444
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,218
No, it's not.

445
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,519
It doesn't make sense.

446
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,727
Virgil, I...

447
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,133
I know I'm not wanted.

448
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,435
I know it's just us
in this stupid van,

449
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,939
but I'm the same person
I've always been

450
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:31,009
and I need you
to be on my side now.

451
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,544
I need you to say yes.

452
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,919
Okay.

453
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,689
OFFICER: Come on, you got
to back it out. Let's go.

454
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,257
Sorry.

455
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,759
Made a wrong turn.

456
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:49,860
Find a place
to park

457
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,462
this thing.

458
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,759
(rustling)

459
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:33,438
(sighs deeply)

460
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,651
(breathing heavily)

461
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,831
(door rattling)

462
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,338
Just a minute.

463
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,607
The door's locked.

464
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,543
I'm getting dressed.

465
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,858
Dad, I really don't think you
should go to this thing today.

466
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,863
This thing...

467
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,635
is being hosted
by the vice president.

468
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,637
So?

469
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,573
So...

470
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,145
he's counting on me.

471
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,380
Ah.

472
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:50,315
To be there.

473
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:56,387
Well, all they're saying on TV
is how intense the security is.

474
00:30:56,422 --> 00:31:00,824
Most since the inauguration--
that's what they're saying.

475
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,260
Well, that's all taken care of.

476
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,229
We have nothing to worry about.

477
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,934
I guess.

478
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,105
Dad.

479
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,108
What?

480
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:17,509
Have you noticed
how awkward it is,

481
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,678
having this conversation
through the door?

482
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,133
(vehicle stops)

483
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,601
I think I heard
my car arrive.

484
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,103
(clears throat)

485
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,871
You let 'em know I'll be
a couple minutes?

486
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,377
Seeing you praying
like that last night,

487
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,179
I think it kind of
freaked me out.

488
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,815
Apparently.
As if it's not enough that Tom Walker

489
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,452
is running around
out there with a gun.

490
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:03,055
You're safe.

491
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,490
Don't worry.

492
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,525
It's not me that
I'm worried about.

493
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,329
I'll be fine.

494
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,898
Two minutes.

495
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:06,386
I still think
that you should stay here.

496
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,724
Be good.

497
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:15,128
Sergeant Brody.

498
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,129
(door closes)

499
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,130
Who are you?

500
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,932
Kandarian.

501
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,400
Secret Service.

502
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:21,802
I've been assigned
to you for the day.

503
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:24,605
(car door closes)

504
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,107
Let's go.

505
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:28,009
(engine starts)

506
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:42,490
(siren wailing)

507
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:56,303
Saul Berenson found
a redacted document

508
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:58,372
that points to the mission.

509
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,511
I thought
that paper trail was burned.

510
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,847
You and me both.

511
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,782
What was he even looking for?

512
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,484
He was just fishing

513
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:12,352
for some action
that might have caused Abu Nazir

514
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,354
to drop out of sight
around that time.

515
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:15,488
Based on what?

516
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:16,856
Some theory
he has

517
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,324
that the current situation
is blowback.

518
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:19,591
You tell him
it doesn't matter

519
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:20,959
why terrorists do what they do.

520
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:22,761
I have.

521
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:25,630
He's a security expert, he's not
a fucking social worker.

522
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:26,998
I know, I told him to drop it.

523
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,700
Don't tell him;
Make it happen.

524
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,636
This cannot get out.

525
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,772
Right?

526
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,344
Operation wasn't
above my security clearance;

527
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,179
It was off the books,

528
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,281
or it was taken off
after the fact.

529
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:43,783
Yeah, well, you're right.

530
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:46,286
The reference number implies
a drone strike.

531
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,620
So there's got to be all kinds

532
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:50,056
of supporting
documentation, yes?

533
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,026
That's the weird thing--
there's not.

534
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,460
You check flight plans?

535
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:54,628
Yeah.

536
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:55,997
What about ops tapes?

537
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:57,632
I went down and checked
the vault myself.

538
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,501
The only thing that exists is

539
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:02,237
this redacted document you found
on the grid search.

540
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,905
It probably wasn't even supposed
to be there.

541
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,507
Obviously.

542
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,908
I'm stuck here

543
00:35:06,942 --> 00:35:08,376
like some school
crossing guard

544
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,678
just so Estes can feel
like his ass is covered.

545
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:11,912
You want me to initiate

546
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:13,313
an official request
for information?

547
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,215
I have a feeling
that's the last thing

548
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,650
we want to do.

549
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:18,318
I could reach out
to some drone pilots.

550
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:19,319
(metal detector
beeping) OFFICER: Sir.

551
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:20,754
Sorry.

552
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,589
No, let's not raise flags.

553
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,524
I'll follow up on it myself.

554
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,796
(sighs)

555
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:35,770
So what are we
looking for exactly?

556
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:38,173
Exactly I don't know.

557
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:41,576
It's not one thing,
Virgil, it's everything.

558
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,945
All the Defense
leaders will be here--

559
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,513
at least two dozen
high-value targets.

560
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,448
Yeah, so?

561
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:49,884
So a single sniper is not
gonna take them all out.

562
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,919
So you focus on the
highest value target.

563
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:54,521
But why here
with all the security?

564
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:56,056
That's exactly
what I've been saying.

565
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,228
You attack here if you're
planning to take them all out.

566
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:03,896
A group of people
who are almost never

567
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,798
in the same place
at the same time.

568
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:20,314
GAINES: I'd really rather
talk about this conference

569
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,716
and our need to rededicate

570
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,318
our efforts to the war
on terror.

571
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,153
REPORTER:
Is that a course

572
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:27,422
that the vice president would
pursue as commander in chief?

573
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:29,591
GAINES: He'll be here shortly;
you can ask him yourself.

574
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:32,160
But the fact is, we are not
comfortable with a war...

575
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:28,514
(indistinct radio transmission)

576
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:31,784
We're on the wrong side
of the barrier, Virgil.

577
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:33,653
I agree.
Now, come on.

578
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:35,122
Let's go home.

579
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:36,690
Carrie, you are working
yourself up for nothing.

580
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:37,892
I wouldn't call a possible

581
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:39,493
terrorist attack nothing.
Shh!

582
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:41,062
You can't say
stuff like that.

583
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:42,531
Not here.

584
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:44,200
Don't worry,
everything's fine.

585
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,634
Is that what you want to hear?

586
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:48,470
(helicopter flying nearby)

587
00:37:56,946 --> 00:37:59,448
It's a bit excessive, isn't it,
all this security?

588
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:03,486
(knocking on window)

589
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,488
Windows open, please.

590
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:07,224
IDs?

591
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:24,209
Sergeant Brody.

592
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:25,577
Sure.

593
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:28,046
Sorry about the
inconvenience.

594
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:30,382
(bangs on car)

595
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,484
Good to go!

596
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:01,911
Brody?

597
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:03,112
What's he doing here?

598
00:39:03,147 --> 00:39:04,747
Uh, do me a favor;
Don't ask him.

599
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:08,418
I'm standing here
because of him.

600
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:09,953
I lost my job because of him.

601
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:12,222
Carrie, we really
should go now.

602
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:14,824
Carrie!

603
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:17,160
Goddamn it, Carrie.

604
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:36,879
Nervous?
Well...

605
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:39,983
I'll be standing
in there with...

606
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:43,252
two cabinet secretaries,
couple of joint chiefs,

607
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:46,423
head of Defense Intelligence.

608
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:50,127
I'm just a platoon sergeant.

609
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,596
GAINES:
You'll get used to it.

610
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,432
He's here.

611
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:28,832
Sergeant Brody.
Sir.

612
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:30,066
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.

613
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,034
Ms. Gaines,
nice to see you again.

614
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:34,136
GAINES:
And you.

615
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,474
Mr. Vice President.

616
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:40,742
Thanks for coming out.

617
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:42,144
Thank you
for having me, sir.

618
00:40:54,024 --> 00:40:55,691
(crowd screaming)

619
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:58,461
(clamoring)

620
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:02,832
(gunshot)

621
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:05,335
(frantic shouting)

622
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:10,340
Shit.

623
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,546
(gunshot)

624
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:21,018
(metal detectors beeping)

625
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:28,558
VIRGIL: We have to
get out of here.

626
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:29,759
Come on! Come on!

627
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:32,095
(beeping continue)

628
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:37,999
(whimpering)

629
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:57,918
Oh!

630
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,221
Oh, ah...

631
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:03,257
Thank you.
You're welcome.

632
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,059
(exhales)
Nicholas Brody.

633
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:06,727
Richard Halstead,
I'm...

634
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:07,928
Secretary of Defense.

635
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:09,730
Believe me,
I know who you are.

636
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:12,198
(sighs)
What a fuck up.

637
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:31,118
(breathes heavily)

638
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:33,120
Where's the vice president?

639
00:42:33,155 --> 00:42:34,588
Who knows?

640
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,658
Where's the
vice president?!

641
00:42:36,692 --> 00:42:39,027
He's all right.
He's just right behind us.

642
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:44,266
(phone rings)

643
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,867
Berenson.

644
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:47,435
It's me, Saul.

645
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,370
Uh, I-I got to call you back.
No!

646
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:51,172
Carrie, we've got a situation.

647
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:52,507
I-I-I know, I'm here.

648
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,475
Saul, you have to listen to me.

649
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,676
What do you mean, you're here?

650
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:57,711
I saw the whole thing;
The woman that was hit,

651
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:59,513
Elizabeth Gaines,
she is not the target.

652
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:01,515
Vice president was the target.

653
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:02,983
Walker missed.

654
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:05,718
Walker would not have missed
once, never mind three times!

655
00:43:05,753 --> 00:43:07,654
This is...
this is just stage one.

656
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,189
The real attack
has not come yet.

657
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:10,557
What real attack?
What are you talking about?

658
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:11,692
Following an

659
00:43:11,726 --> 00:43:13,127
assassination attempt,
they'll sequester

660
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:15,062
the high value targets,
that's protocol.

661
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:17,665
Right now, they're putting
the vice president and his team

662
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,968
out of sight,
in a single, small space.

663
00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:21,971
They're supposed to be safe
there, but they're not.

664
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:23,372
They're vulnerable.

665
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:24,573
How?

666
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:26,041
Brody.

667
00:43:26,075 --> 00:43:27,642
Brody?

668
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:30,412
For Christ's sake,
Carrie, not this again.

669
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:33,315
Forget about before;
This is now.

670
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,217
I saw him-- Brody.

671
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:37,052
They hustled him right through
the metal detectors

672
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:38,386
along with the vice president.

673
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:39,855
You even realize
what you're saying?

674
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,089
Yes!

675
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:43,258
He's planning on taking
them all out.

676
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:45,360
That is what's coming!

677
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:48,263
We've been hearing chatter
for days now,

678
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:49,564
Marine One, Marine Two.

679
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,833
I-I-It's not the
President's helicopter.

680
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:54,904
It's actual marines--
Brody and Walker.

681
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:56,772
They are Marine One
and Marine Two.

682
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:58,374
They're working together,
they must be.

683
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:01,244
Saul, you hear me?
Yeah, I do.

684
00:44:01,278 --> 00:44:04,214
That's why Brody ratted me out,
'cause I was getting too close.

685
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:05,849
God, it finally all makes sense.

686
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:08,853
Yeah, sure.

687
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,922
Saul, you got
to get me in there.

688
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:14,425
There's a CT Officer
named Benton.

689
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,526
I-I-I know him.

690
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:16,961
I'll send him out for you.

691
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:19,063
Thanks. Hurry.

692
00:44:19,098 --> 00:44:20,899
Yeah, bye.

693
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:22,768
There's a woman outside
the building, one of ours.

694
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:25,270
She's unstable, and you
need to contain her.

695
00:44:25,304 --> 00:44:27,539
Her name's
Carrie Mathison.

696
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,652
WALDEN: I'm not getting stuck
down here for a day and a half.

697
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:42,120
SANDERS:
That won't happen, sir.

698
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:43,655
WALDEN: I won't run and
hide, you understand?

699
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:45,391
SANDERS: No one's asking
that, just a little caution.

700
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:46,592
WALDEN:
Get your hands off me.

701
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:47,626
SANDERS:
My apologies.

702
00:44:47,661 --> 00:44:49,261
WALDEN:
Fuck your caution.

703
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:50,663
One of my closest
friends just got shot.

704
00:44:50,697 --> 00:44:51,730
All right, I understand.

705
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:59,104
May I have your
attention please.

706
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:02,775
SANDERS: We've initiated a full
lockdown protocol for your protection.

707
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:05,111
That means this door
will now remain closed

708
00:45:05,145 --> 00:45:06,612
until one of two things happen.

709
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:10,182
One, the sniper's
apprehended, or, two,

710
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:12,952
we establish to our satisfaction
that he's left the vicinity,

711
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,687
and it's safe to leave the room.

712
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:16,322
WALDEN:
And you believe this?

713
00:45:16,356 --> 00:45:18,624
You fucking believe this?

714
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:20,626
SANDERS: You're safe, sir.
That's the priority.

715
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,161
Safe from what?!

716
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:24,630
We look like a
bunch of idiots.

717
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:26,565
Well, you're
my advisers.

718
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:32,139
How about some advice?
How about some fucking advice?

719
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:34,308
How do we spin this?

720
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:38,112
NAZIR: <i>There is nothing
left</i> <i>to think about.</i>

721
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:40,048
Clench your teeth.

722
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:42,017
Say the holy words.

723
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:44,720
<i>Remember Issa.</i>

724
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:47,289
WALDEN:
Well?

725
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,257
(click)

726
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,295
(breathes heavily)

727
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,732
(click, click)

728
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,468
HALSTED: I advise we
wait, like the man said.

729
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:00,370
There a men's room here?

730
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:01,804
There better be.

731
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,873
SANDERS:
This way.

732
00:46:04,908 --> 00:46:06,676
Where is he?
There's no time.

733
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,311
VIRGIL:
Wait.

734
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:09,712
Oh, there he is.

735
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:12,649
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I said wait.

736
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:15,652
VIRGIL:
What's with all the backup?

737
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,126
Damn you, Saul.

738
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:25,896
Virgil, am I crazy?

739
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:27,231
Look, you know you are.

740
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,032
No, I mean about Brody.

741
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:31,868
Just tell me if I am.
(sighs)

742
00:46:31,903 --> 00:46:33,203
Virgil, I need to know!

743
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:36,239
I don't know, okay?
But I trust you.

744
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:38,207
I need your keys.

745
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:39,508
Where are you going?

746
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,210
You don't want to know.
All right, go.

747
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:42,745
I'll run interference.

748
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:43,846
Ben!

749
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:48,785
Hey which one
of you guys is Benton?

750
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:51,054
Are you Benton?

751
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:53,557
Which one of you is Benton?

752
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:59,096
(panting)

753
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:01,899
(engine starts)

754
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:05,470
(panting)

755
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:12,209
(low, indistinct conversations)

756
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:20,048
(speaks indistinctly)

757
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:30,058
(clears throat)

758
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:32,427
Any word out there?

759
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:34,063
No.

760
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:36,166
Well, they said
this could happen.

761
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,602
You okay? You look
a little peaked.

762
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:42,006
Well, not a fan of being
locked up, I guess.

763
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,176
You've reenergized him,
you know.

764
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,912
Sir?

765
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:49,113
Walden.

766
00:47:49,147 --> 00:47:52,149
He sees you as a living,
breathing vindication

767
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:55,185
of everything
he's ever done.

768
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,854
He's got big plans for you.

769
00:47:57,888 --> 00:48:01,758
Wouldn't you know it,
no paper towels.

770
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,025
Another fuck up.

771
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:28,483
(panting)

772
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:30,618
(whispers):
Oh, come on.

773
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,958
(panting)

774
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:47,804
(music playing quietly)

775
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:52,809
massive search for the sniper
is now underway

776
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:54,211
in the area between E Street
(vehicle approaching)

777
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:55,879
and Independence Avenue

778
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,181
all the way from
the Potomac to 17th...

779
00:48:58,215 --> 00:48:59,382
(knocking)

780
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:00,816
I'm coming!

781
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,085
No one is going in or out.

782
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,021
Eyewitnesses say the vice
president and his supporters...

783
00:49:06,055 --> 00:49:07,489
My God.

784
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,391
(loud knocking)
Oh, my God. Yeah?

785
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:11,093
What?

786
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,498
What are you doing here?

787
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:19,367
You're Dana, right?
Yeah.

788
00:49:19,402 --> 00:49:21,202
I'm Carrie Mathison.
I know who you are.

789
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:22,337
It's about your dad.

790
00:49:23,472 --> 00:49:25,173
Was he hit?

791
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:26,674
No.

792
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:28,843
I saw on the TV... No.
I-I know. I was there.

793
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:30,111
I saw it happen.
He wasn't shot.

794
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:32,346
But, Dana, I need your help.
Can I come inside?

795
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,918
(Carrie panting)

796
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:41,021
You heard about
Tom Walker?

797
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:42,889
Yeah.
How he was turned against us?

798
00:49:42,924 --> 00:49:45,726
Yeah. Did he shoot those people?

799
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,926
Yes.

800
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:49,195
Dana, listen to me.

801
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,798
Your dad told me that you are
the one who understands him,

802
00:49:51,832 --> 00:49:54,867
who he listens to.

803
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,903
And this is very hard to say,

804
00:49:56,937 --> 00:49:59,539
but your dad
is working with Tom Walker.

805
00:49:59,573 --> 00:50:03,577
They're working together.
They are carrying out an attack right now.

806
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:05,813
What are you talking about?

807
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:07,882
He is with the vice president
and other innocent people.

808
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,050
He is going to kill them

809
00:50:09,084 --> 00:50:11,018
if we don't
stop them.

810
00:50:12,754 --> 00:50:16,257
Okay, you have to call him
and just talk him down.

811
00:50:18,027 --> 00:50:19,995
All right?

812
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:21,930
This will get you to
the Secret Service.

813
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:24,299
That'll connect you.

814
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,301
(soft gasp)

815
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:28,903
We don't have much time.

816
00:50:31,474 --> 00:50:33,741
You can do
this, Dana.

817
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:39,314
(dialing)

818
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:41,382
Okay.

819
00:50:45,988 --> 00:50:49,023
Hi. Um, I'm at 3319 Chapman,
and it's... it's emergency.

820
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,825
There's...
there's an insane woman...

821
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,526
No! No! Dana!

822
00:50:52,561 --> 00:50:54,195
Get out!
Dana, please.

823
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,530
Get back inside!

824
00:50:55,564 --> 00:50:56,931
Get out of my house!
Dana, please,

825
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,099
get back inside.
Get out! Please!

826
00:50:58,134 --> 00:50:59,601
DANA:
Get out of my house!

827
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:00,936
Dana!

828
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,770
You must have noticed.

829
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:04,439
Leave me alone!
Something strange, him acting off.

830
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:06,708
No, you're off!
Just call him and make sure.

831
00:51:06,743 --> 00:51:08,310
Something is
wrong with you!

832
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:10,479
God! Why are you even here?!
I told you!

833
00:51:10,513 --> 00:51:11,647
So that we can stop him.

834
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:13,949
Who's that with Dana?

835
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:17,052
Stay in the car.
Leave me alone.

836
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:18,454
Mom...

837
00:51:18,488 --> 00:51:19,522
Mom...
What's going on?

838
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:20,723
She-she came here

839
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,858
and she says that Dad
is working with Tom Walker!

840
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:24,827
Get in the house.
Call the police, right now.

841
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:26,062
I already did.
Dana? Dana, please.

842
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:27,563
Please call him.
Get away from her!

843
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:29,132
Jessica, listen...
What are you doing

844
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,134
telling some crazy story to my daughter?
No, it's not crazy.

845
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:35,571
(panting)

846
00:51:39,275 --> 00:51:41,309
He has intentions to kill the
vice president and his staff.

847
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:44,479
You have to believe me.
It's not too late to stop him. Believe you?

848
00:51:44,513 --> 00:51:46,080
I told Dana she
needs to call him...

849
00:51:46,114 --> 00:51:48,583
You fucked my husband.
And now you need to call him.

850
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:49,884
He tells you
to get lost,

851
00:51:49,918 --> 00:51:51,653
(siren wailing)
and-and now you're...

852
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:53,054
making up all
those crazy shit.

853
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:54,255
No, you're not
listening to me.

854
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,757
Of course I'm not
listening to you.

855
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:58,026
Please, just call him.
You really don't want this happening.

856
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,028
Are we okay here?
No, we're not okay.

857
00:52:00,063 --> 00:52:01,697
Okay, please.

858
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:04,066
You don't understand
what's going on, any of you!

859
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:04,900
Ma'am...

860
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,268
Okay, the world is about to end,

861
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:08,170
and we're
standing around talking!

862
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:10,906
Ma'am, come with us. No!
Get... get off of me!

863
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,008
Come with us! Come on!
Get off of me!

864
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,177
Do not move!

865
00:52:15,211 --> 00:52:16,345
Stay down!

866
00:52:18,481 --> 00:52:20,382
Stay... stay there.

867
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:21,483
(handcuffs clicking)

868
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,167
(Jessica speaking indistinctly)

869
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:49,578
(panting)

870
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,051
(quietly):
Ow!

871
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:58,353
Shit.

872
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,326
(continues panting)

873
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:17,909
(door opens)

874
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,813
You okay in there?

875
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:26,485
Yeah, fine.

876
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:28,186
We found the shooter's weapon

877
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:30,422
abandoned in an apartment
a block away.

878
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:31,756
It shouldn't be
too much longer,

879
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,991
we'll have you all out of there.
Great.

880
00:53:34,025 --> 00:53:36,260
(toilet flushing)

881
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:41,332
(panting)

882
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:43,334
You sure you're okay?

883
00:53:43,368 --> 00:53:45,636
I'm feeling a little
sick, actually.

884
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,139
If you need a doctor or anything?
No. No, thanks.

885
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:50,073
That won't be necessary.

886
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:57,715
(chuckles)

887
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:07,557
(low, indistinct conversations)

888
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,935
(panting quietly)

889
00:54:25,006 --> 00:54:26,740
Sergeant Brody.

890
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:29,644
I got a call for you,
from your daughter.

891
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:33,649
She says
it's an emergency.

892
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:37,754
Dana?

893
00:54:37,788 --> 00:54:40,057
(crying):
Dad... where are you?

894
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:41,659
Dana, I got to call you back.

895
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:42,994
No, Dad, no.

896
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:45,430
There was... there was
this crazy woman at our house,

897
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:47,665
the one that... that,
you know, you were with,

898
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,767
and... she was saying
all these things about you,

899
00:54:49,802 --> 00:54:52,170
and I just...
I had to hear your voice.

900
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:56,508
Dad?

901
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,643
(panting)

902
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,414
(sniffles)

903
00:55:02,448 --> 00:55:03,949
Dad?

904
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:06,918
Yeah.

905
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:08,854
Yeah, but, Dana, I...

906
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,923
Dad, she said that you were
working with Tom Walker,

907
00:55:10,957 --> 00:55:12,859
that-that you're a terrorist.

908
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:16,763
I'm not.

909
00:55:16,797 --> 00:55:18,599
I know, Dad, I know.
Of course you're not.

910
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:19,700
I-I wouldn't have believed her,

911
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,101
because you would never do

912
00:55:21,136 --> 00:55:22,302
anything like that, ever. Ever.

913
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:24,305
I didn't believe her at all.

914
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:27,975
Dana, I'm here
with a group of people.

915
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:29,944
Look, I've got to go.

916
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:32,479
No, Dad, don't.

917
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:34,415
We're just, uh,
we're in a holding area,

918
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:36,650
and, um, you know,
they're about to let us out.

919
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,054
So you're coming home?

920
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:42,056
Sure.

921
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,058
Tell me that.

922
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,229
(panting):
Yeah, I'm coming home.

923
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:50,965
No, Dad, don't say it like that.

924
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:52,633
Dad...

925
00:55:52,668 --> 00:55:54,168
promise me.

926
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:57,872
You have to promise me
that you're coming home, Dad.

927
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:01,976
(sniffles)

928
00:56:03,145 --> 00:56:04,612
Dad?

929
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:07,081
(inhales)

930
00:56:07,116 --> 00:56:10,117
Dad, you have to promise me.

931
00:56:10,152 --> 00:56:12,353
I need you.

932
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:14,956
You know that.

933
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,861
(crying quietly)

934
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:32,707
I'm coming home, Dana.

935
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,180
I promise.

936
00:56:38,214 --> 00:56:40,315
(exhale)

937
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:43,552
Okay.

938
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:45,520
Thank you.

939
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:05,973
SANDERS:
Copy.

940
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,675
All right,
we're clear.

941
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,445
We're clear.

942
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,254
Nick...

943
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:24,323
you look like shit.

944
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,491
Come on.

945
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,427
What a
fuckin' day.

946
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:49,350
Our thoughts and prayers
go out to her family...

947
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:52,753
as does this pledge:

948
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:56,156
Her murder will
not go unpunished.

949
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,226
For this reason...

950
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:03,462
I stand before you today
to officially announce

951
00:58:03,497 --> 00:58:07,734
my intention to run for
President of the United States,

952
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:09,803
and to rededicate myself
and this nation...

953
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,773
JESSICA:
Yes, of course. Yes. Anytime.

954
00:58:12,808 --> 00:58:15,476
That was the police.

955
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:18,747
They want to know if
we want to press charges.

956
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:20,649
WALDEN:
...fear.

957
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,751
Brody, are you
listening to me?

958
00:58:22,786 --> 00:58:24,754
What did you tell them?

959
00:58:24,788 --> 00:58:26,722
That I would talk to you.

960
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:29,791
I'll take care of it.

961
00:58:29,825 --> 00:58:32,493
This woman is sick.

962
00:58:32,528 --> 00:58:35,062
There's something
seriously wrong

963
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:37,398
with this woman.

964
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:40,833
So whatever you decide...

965
00:58:40,868 --> 00:58:43,136
I don't want to ever hear
her name in this house again.

966
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,437
I said I'll take care of it!

967
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:46,439
(Walden continues)
Good.

968
00:58:47,975 --> 00:58:50,643
I'm gonna go see if
Dana's doing better.

969
00:58:50,678 --> 00:58:53,013
(applause over TV)

970
00:59:06,894 --> 00:59:08,494
Saul.

971
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:10,830
Mr. Vice President.

972
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,434
Give us, uh,
five minutes?

973
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,970
Let's make it ten,
be on the safe side.

974
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:20,539
Ten.

975
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:22,640
How's Mira? Oh, great. Thanks.

976
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:53,170
No doubt you and David Estes
have already huddled about this mess?

977
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:56,375
What are you playing at, Saul?

978
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:58,790
I called it fuck the terrorists.

979
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,242
I remember where you are.

980
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:04,025
I know exactly where I am, sir.

981
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:06,628
Are we on the same side?

982
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:10,618
Because your tone suggests otherwise.

983
01:00:12,473 --> 01:00:14,196
Trying to find out about
what happened yesterday,

984
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:15,245
why.

985
01:00:15,391 --> 01:00:17,801
Trying to stop it from happening again.

986
01:00:18,307 --> 01:00:20,448
And you think this redacted
file will help you to do that?

987
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,220
I can't let anyone see that until
I see what's under all those black lines.

988
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:27,798
Trust me Saul, this is nothing but a turd

989
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:29,307
let it lie.

990
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:35,388
You're my boss for 3 and a half years,

991
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:38,557
did I ever once let anything lie?

992
01:00:41,532 --> 01:00:43,295
I'm saying this would
be a good time to start.

993
01:00:43,728 --> 01:00:45,004
I don't agree.

994
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,121
Here's another thing you
might remember about me,

995
01:00:50,325 --> 01:00:52,423
I'm a sentimentalist,

996
01:00:55,229 --> 01:00:57,309
I like to hold on to things.

997
01:00:58,469 --> 01:00:59,906
For old time sake.

998
01:01:02,502 --> 01:01:03,380
If I ever told the american people

999
01:01:03,476 --> 01:01:05,259
these interrogation tapes
had been destroyed

1000
01:01:05,389 --> 01:01:06,851
I was mistaken.

1001
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,747
Coercion, cruelty,

1002
01:01:10,391 --> 01:01:11,760
all right, torture.

1003
01:01:12,197 --> 01:01:14,188
Makes for a very unhappy viewing.

1004
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,211
You gave the orders William,

1005
01:01:18,412 --> 01:01:19,788
I gave the orders.

1006
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:22,987
You're blackmailing me.

1007
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:35,039
You'll stay with us.

1008
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:37,143
The girls have fixed up the room for you,

1009
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:39,401
They'll have you on the flowers.
They are very excited.

1010
01:01:39,506 --> 01:01:41,302
Thank you, Maggie.

1011
01:01:41,459 --> 01:01:44,574
I told them that you need to
rest but not, you know, why exactly.

1012
01:01:48,234 --> 01:01:49,531
Carrie?

1013
01:01:52,715 --> 01:01:54,339
Did you know he was here?

1014
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:58,785
Carrie, what are you doing?

1015
01:01:58,894 --> 01:02:01,639
There are criminal charges pending,
you shouldn't talk to him.

1016
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,838
I have to.

1017
01:02:12,718 --> 01:02:14,004
Brody, I am...

1018
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,572
You broke into my house.

1019
01:02:17,244 --> 01:02:18,447
You terrified my daughter.

1020
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:20,857
She's 16 years old, by the way, sixteen.

1021
01:02:22,251 --> 01:02:23,738
I'm sorry.

1022
01:02:25,627 --> 01:02:28,138
They asked me what I wanted
to do about it, the police did.

1023
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,555
What did you tell them?

1024
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:34,108
Nothing yet.

1025
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:36,628
That'll depend on you.

1026
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:42,631
For the last time, Carrie,

1027
01:02:44,147 --> 01:02:46,007
I am not what you think I am.

1028
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:49,653
I'm sorry.

1029
01:02:49,773 --> 01:02:51,586
You keep saying that, it is not enough.

1030
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:57,747
I know about your condition,

1031
01:02:58,102 --> 01:02:59,751
David Estes told me.

1032
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:05,285
Carrie, you need to get some help.

1033
01:03:06,593 --> 01:03:07,864
I am.

1034
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:10,404
And you need to stay away from me.

1035
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:12,704
And from my family.

1036
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,798
You set up surveillance,

1037
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:18,934
you watched me,

1038
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:20,374
you pushed your way into my life,

1039
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,909
- and for what?
- Okay.

1040
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,500
Fun?

1041
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:27,086
It's crazy what you did.

1042
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:29,598
- You understand...
- I said okay.

1043
01:03:29,717 --> 01:03:31,360
What does that mean?

1044
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,165
I understand.

1045
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,769
I'll stay away from you,
you have my word.

1046
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,049
Goodbye Brody.

1047
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,183
Goodbye Carrie.

1048
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:28,555
Home now?

1049
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:33,805
To the hospital.

1050
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,563
Oh, fuck.

1051
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,205
It's Abu Nazir in the target area.

1052
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:49,343
- We believe...
- You sure wanna see this?

1053
01:04:49,615 --> 01:04:51,362
What you've been hiding from me?

1054
01:04:51,613 --> 01:04:52,743
Yeah, I do.

1055
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:54,287
80% certain he was here.

1056
01:04:54,322 --> 01:04:57,371
A ground assault is preferable
in terms of collateral damage.

1057
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:59,121
But impossible in the time frame.

1058
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:00,945
That's a school sir.

1059
01:05:01,162 --> 01:05:02,595
Don't cloud the issue.

1060
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:05,822
If Abu Nazir is taking
refuge among children

1061
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:08,507
he is putting them at risk, not us.

1062
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:12,921
So, we agree?

1063
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,161
Good to go.

1064
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:27,953
It's our joint opinion the
potential collateral damage

1065
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,193
falls within current *matrix* parameters.

1066
01:05:30,744 --> 01:05:32,110
And, uh...

1067
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:35,784
Someone actually came up
with that language.

1068
01:05:49,857 --> 01:05:52,023
That was 2 years ago,

1069
01:05:52,738 --> 01:05:53,933
you reported to me at that time

1070
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,433
and you said nothing.

1071
01:05:55,543 --> 01:05:56,641
Because you would have stopped it.

1072
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:59,074
Yeah, none of this would have happened.

1073
01:05:59,412 --> 01:06:00,588
No dead children,

1074
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,653
no cover up, no Carrie Mathison
drawn out of the agency...

1075
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,267
Keep her out of this.

1076
01:06:08,078 --> 01:06:09,489
You know what I think,

1077
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,206
when she got a lead on Nazir,

1078
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:14,217
first one in over seven years,

1079
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:18,229
wasn't it worth mentioning
this strong string?

1080
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:20,876
Even in private to me.

1081
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:27,319
Or is your career on the
coat tails of the vice president?

1082
01:06:27,803 --> 01:06:29,595
Trump national security.

1083
01:06:31,498 --> 01:06:34,262
Really, I'm fascinated to know.

1084
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,933
The world changed, Saul.

1085
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,166
Right under your nose.

1086
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,410
Answer the damn question.

1087
01:06:43,512 --> 01:06:44,688
I am.

1088
01:06:44,893 --> 01:06:47,572
We're about projecting
American power now,

1089
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,351
degrading Al-Qaeda militarily.

1090
01:06:50,515 --> 01:06:52,938
You wanna play soft ball spy games,
go join the germans or the french.

1091
01:06:53,752 --> 01:06:56,261
I am this fucking close

1092
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,516
to picking up the phone,

1093
01:06:58,885 --> 01:07:01,269
and calling the New York Times.

1094
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,868
No, you're not.

1095
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,644
You know why?

1096
01:07:10,563 --> 01:07:13,273
Because telling the world
we killed 82 kids on purpose,

1097
01:07:13,371 --> 01:07:16,485
would endanger every one of your
case officers in the field.

1098
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,077
Not to mention every American
soldier on the ground.

1099
01:07:19,913 --> 01:07:22,218
You would, essentially,
be handling the enemy

1100
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:25,020
the biggest recruitment
tool since Abu Ghraib.

1101
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,846
I gotta say I am impressed.

1102
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:51,696
You've got the balls to show up.

1103
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:54,255
I'm impressed you're alive.

1104
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:56,236
Care to explain?

1105
01:09:57,449 --> 01:09:59,070
We all went to the same place, Nick,

1106
01:09:59,771 --> 01:10:01,249
I just got out of there a lot quicker.

1107
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,880
Now, you wanna tell me
what happened yesterday?

1108
01:10:04,115 --> 01:10:07,361
I don't answer to you, Tom!
And I didn't come in here to make excuses.

1109
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,679
What the fuck happened?

1110
01:10:08,734 --> 01:10:10,953
I came here because you
got a direct line to Nazir.

1111
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:12,249
Fuck Nazir!

1112
01:10:12,553 --> 01:10:14,463
My vest malfunctioned, okay?

1113
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,025
Bullshit!

1114
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:18,248
You fucking panicked!

1115
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,264
Tom?

1116
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:28,995
Maybe what happened yesterday
was a good thing.

1117
01:10:29,463 --> 01:10:31,500
What if I had detonated that vest?

1118
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,433
What would be different?

1119
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:35,803
Ask yourself that.

1120
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:40,260
Today, they would've just replaced
Walden with somebody else.

1121
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:42,356
So the fuck what?

1122
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,338
So, that means I'm close

1123
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:46,754
to the next president of
the United States, Tom.

1124
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:49,906
That puts me in a unique position.

1125
01:10:50,728 --> 01:10:55,285
Nazir? You listened to
this garbage, Nazir?

1126
01:10:56,483 --> 01:10:58,228
I'm listening.

1127
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,541
What do you want me to do?

1128
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,141
Put Nicholas on the phone.

1129
01:11:14,663 --> 01:11:16,050
Nazir?

1130
01:11:16,182 --> 01:11:18,141
Is it true what you say?

1131
01:11:18,313 --> 01:11:19,360
Yes,

1132
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:21,571
I hit the switch but nothing happened.

1133
01:11:22,301 --> 01:11:24,888
I meant about the vice-president.

1134
01:11:25,326 --> 01:11:26,926
Yes, it's true.

1135
01:11:27,134 --> 01:11:28,945
At the very least,

1136
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,494
I'd be able to influence
policy at the highest levels.

1137
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:40,526
Why kill a man when you can kill an idea?

1138
01:11:43,318 --> 01:11:45,246
That's what I'm thinking.

1139
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:51,928
Nazir, are you still there?

1140
01:11:54,683 --> 01:11:56,868
I want to believe what you say,

1141
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:58,696
but to help me believe

1142
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:04,134
I need a demonstration
of your commitment.

1143
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,810
Name it.

1144
01:12:08,035 --> 01:12:10,958
You did it once or at least
you were told you did, uh?

1145
01:12:12,154 --> 01:12:14,528
There is a wild card in this new play.

1146
01:12:16,428 --> 01:12:18,436
You understand what I'm saying?

1147
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:20,543
Nicholas?

1148
01:12:20,687 --> 01:12:22,303
Yeah, I understand.

1149
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:25,999
Then say goodbye.

1150
01:12:26,196 --> 01:12:28,392
Tell Walker I need to
speak to him privately.

1151
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:34,447
(arab speaking)

1152
01:12:42,644 --> 01:12:44,254
Wants to talk to you.

1153
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:09,969
It's done.

1154
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,541
(arab speaking)

1155
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,961
(arab speaking)

1156
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,826
You got a million calls
while you were out.

1157
01:13:58,315 --> 01:14:00,773
Presidency office and
vice president's office, too.

1158
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:14,360
You okay?

1159
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,278
Yeah, better.

1160
01:14:23,318 --> 01:14:24,752
And, Jess, I'm sorry

1161
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:26,869
that I shouted at you before.

1162
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:28,672
It's okay.

1163
01:14:29,502 --> 01:14:31,433
I'm surprised you're
keeping it together at all.

1164
01:14:40,134 --> 01:14:41,689
Thank you.

1165
01:14:42,343 --> 01:14:44,804
- For what?
- Everything.

1166
01:15:03,023 --> 01:15:04,112
Excuse me, sir?

1167
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:05,580
Excuse me, sir!

1168
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:07,396
I'm sorry sir, this is locked ward.

1169
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:09,837
I've got my pass here somewhere.

1170
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,491
Here, for preop.

1171
01:15:13,888 --> 01:15:15,466
It's across the hall on the right.

1172
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,221
- What did you say? Thank you.
- On the right, second door.

1173
01:15:24,718 --> 01:15:26,192
Just a little sting.

1174
01:15:26,703 --> 01:15:28,778
- How are you feeling, honey?
- Fine.

1175
01:15:31,066 --> 01:15:32,299
Take that thing out of her arm.

1176
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:34,353
- Saul. - Sir...
- Out of my way.

1177
01:15:34,454 --> 01:15:35,733
This is fucking barbaric.
I won't allow it.

1178
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:37,416
- Jim!
- I'm getting you out of here.

1179
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:39,145
Saul, stop.

1180
01:15:40,022 --> 01:15:41,716
Just listen to me.
This was...

1181
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,692
I wanna do this thing.

1182
01:15:44,682 --> 01:15:47,277
- What? - It was my decision,
I told them to go ahead.

1183
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,655
Your decision?

1184
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:49,862
Have a shock treatment?

1185
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:53,025
It's not cuckoo's nest, Saul.
They use ultra brief impulses now.

1186
01:15:53,123 --> 01:15:54,816
It's called electrocomplusive therapy.

1187
01:15:54,923 --> 01:15:56,206
I don't care what is called.

1188
01:15:56,294 --> 01:15:58,555
They still attached electrodes
to your skull, don't they?

1189
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:00,813
Still jilting into a seizure?

1190
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:04,590
I need to do something.
I can't take this anymore.

1191
01:16:04,743 --> 01:16:06,507
Yes, you can.

1192
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,290
You're the strongest person I know.

1193
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,238
So pass.

1194
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:14,981
No, it won't pass.

1195
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:17,472
It's only getting worse...

1196
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:21,441
Carrie, please, there's
alternatives to this.

1197
01:16:22,118 --> 01:16:24,142
You don't have to let them
fuck with your brain.

1198
01:16:24,245 --> 01:16:25,875
My brain's already fucked.

1199
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:28,096
Yeah? It is a brain
I happen to love.

1200
01:16:29,556 --> 01:16:31,089
Is everything okay,
Ms. Mathison?

1201
01:16:31,574 --> 01:16:33,862
- Everything's fine, thanks, yes, really.
- You sure?

1202
01:16:42,586 --> 01:16:44,347
What about the side effects?

1203
01:16:44,497 --> 01:16:46,481
Memory loss...

1204
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:48,286
That is only short time.

1205
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:51,256
It's usually temporary.

1206
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:56,751
A lot was happening that I
kinda like to forget anyway.

1207
01:16:57,284 --> 01:16:59,676
That's not even remotely funny.

1208
01:17:08,275 --> 01:17:10,266
Saul, I made up my mind.

1209
01:17:11,532 --> 01:17:14,121
I'm grateful for the
concern but I just...

1210
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,386
I can't live like this any more.
It needs to stop.

1211
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,714
Yeah.

1212
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:33,565
Well...

1213
01:17:36,037 --> 01:17:38,361
You shouldn't feel all bad.

1214
01:17:39,415 --> 01:17:40,809
I mean...

1215
01:17:42,072 --> 01:17:44,613
It hasn't been an
unmitigated disaster.

1216
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,052
You were wrong about Brody.

1217
01:17:47,507 --> 01:17:49,721
And you were right about Nazir.

1218
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:53,195
You're telling me the yellow,
his period of dormancy?

1219
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:54,694
Yes.

1220
01:17:55,216 --> 01:17:56,518
He was in mourning.

1221
01:17:56,623 --> 01:17:59,333
His son died in a drone
strike in northern Iraq.

1222
01:17:59,437 --> 01:18:00,586
Which son?

1223
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:02,574
Youngest, 10 years old.

1224
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:06,423
Along with 82 of his
Madrasi classmates.

1225
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,227
Apparently the vice
president gave the order.

1226
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:14,545
How on Earth did I miss that?

1227
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:16,191
You didn't.

1228
01:18:17,286 --> 01:18:19,155
Record's been wiped white clean.

1229
01:18:19,952 --> 01:18:21,393
Expunged.

1230
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:24,124
Like it never happened.

1231
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,338
Wow.

1232
01:18:32,886 --> 01:18:34,548
Thanks for telling me.

1233
01:18:35,437 --> 01:18:37,377
You deserved to know.

1234
01:18:45,927 --> 01:18:49,153
So, Saul, is there any change that
I can appeal on my termination?

1235
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,175
No.

1236
01:19:16,946 --> 01:19:18,873
Dad!

1237
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,637
What you're doing up here?

1238
01:19:26,768 --> 01:19:28,823
Came up to fix the leak in the skyline.

1239
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:30,998
Is it beer?

1240
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:33,741
That came later.

1241
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:38,088
Never knew it had views.

1242
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,374
The *** back yard, nice.

1243
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:49,475
Do you mind if I join you?

1244
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,395
No, of course not.

1245
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:23,400
You're ready?

1246
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:33,252
This is the anesthetic
I was telling you about.

1247
01:20:33,972 --> 01:20:36,041
I want you to start counting
backwards from 100.

1248
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:40,343
100...

1249
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:41,754
99...

1250
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:43,752
98...

1251
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,567
97...

1252
01:20:47,892 --> 01:20:49,670
96...

1253
01:20:51,154 --> 01:20:52,925
95...

1254
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:17,784
Issa.

1255
01:21:23,698 --> 01:21:24,717
Issa, no!

1256
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:25,934
Issa...

1257
01:21:27,733 --> 01:21:28,909
Issa...

1258
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:30,137
Issa...

1259
01:21:30,225 --> 01:21:31,892
Issa, Nazir's son
Brody knew him.

1260
01:21:34,037 --> 01:21:35,806
Saul, don't let me
fucking forget...

1261
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:39,416
What did she say?

1262
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:42,781
Nothing, it's the anesthetic,
everyone does it.

1263
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,239
She's asleep.

1264
01:22:02,358 --> 01:22:03,740
OK, we're ready.

1265
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:09,714
Paddles on...

1266
01:22:35,643 --> 01:22:45,414
