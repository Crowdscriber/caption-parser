1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:01,517
So how's the family?
visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com

2
00:00:01,518 --> 00:00:05,306
Great. Kids are getting so big.
Haley's about to go off...

3
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:06,593
You can stop
holding your stomach in.

4
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:09,584
- to college.
- You still exercising?

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:10,783
Clearly.

6
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:13,642
I look at Clint Eastwood or Chuck Norris
and I think,

7
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,235
there's no reason
I can't stay tough like..

8
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,720
Oh, tickles!

9
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:19,668
But...
Aw!

10
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:21,556
That hurt?

11
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,163
No. Not r--ow.

12
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:26,406
What?

13
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:28,882
It's probably nothing.
You feeling okay?

14
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,543
- Yeah. - Maybe we'll just run
a couple of tests, just to be safe.

15
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:32,335
What kind of tests?

16
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,709
If there's anything wrong,
I'll give you a call.

17
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:36,769
Okay.

18
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:38,851
So how's the real estate market doing?

19
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,382
Well, interest rates are low,
so it's a great time to be a buyer,

20
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,290
But if you're a seller,
you really have to...

21
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,141
Bend over?

22
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:46,878
True, but a quality property
is still a quality--

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,243
No, no, no.
I need you to bend over.

24
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,354
Oh. Right.

25
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:54,277
Well, let's dim the lights,
crank up the Norah Jones,

26
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,035
and get this over with.

27
00:00:58,087 --> 00:00:59,786
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

28
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:02,037
Amazing. I was so proud of him.

29
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:03,261
Oh, thanks, honey.

30
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,592
I'm kind of proud of me, too.

31
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:07,150
Look at what they gave me.

32
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,361
"California State Bar Association Award,

33
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:12,643
"For Distinguished Service in The
Field of Environmental Law."

34
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:14,113
You should have seen it.
They called his name,

35
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:16,300
he went up on stage,
he gave a great speech.

36
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,093
It was humble, inspirational,

37
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,429
with a touch of dry humor at the end.

38
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:20,317
It was very Colin Firth.

39
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:22,181
Oh, Cam, thank you,

40
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,010
But... it's hardly an Oscar.

41
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,893
In the environmental law community,

42
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,523
it kinda is an Oscar.

43
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,404
So how was Lily?
I hope you weren't too bored.

44
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:31,909
Oh, please, are you kidding me?

45
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,235
I love talking to her.
She knows more words than Haley.

46
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:36,712
Oh, that looks great up there!

47
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:39,295
How impressed are you with
your uncle right now?

48
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,326
So impressed.

49
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,611
I didn't wanna ruin their moment

50
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,520
by telling them how many
awards I've gotten,

51
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,460
but let's just say

52
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:48,097
I don't get out of bed
for a trophy that size.

53
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:51,619
Darn it!

54
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,776
I'm trying to send an e-mail.

55
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:54,678
This mouse keeps sticking.

56
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,039
Pretty big reaction. It's 10 bucks, tops.

57
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,745
You just reminded me about
my dream last night.

58
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,616
I was in the middle of a meadow,
coming down a staircase,

59
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:09,020
then suddenly a black mouse showed up.

60
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:12,288
He stopped, stared at me in the eyes,

61
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,332
and opened his little mouth.

62
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,245
What did it say?

63
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:18,980
What did he say, Jay?

64
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,901
He was a mouse.
They don't know how to talk.

65
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:22,307
Now you're playing logic police?

66
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,517
You're standing on a staircase
in a meadow?

67
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:28,537
In my country, when somebody
dreams about a black mouse,

68
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,664
it means that something
bad is going to happen!

69
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:31,551
Ah, don't worry about it.

70
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,284
I dreamt about a lucky blue cow.

71
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,736
- We're good to go.
- Hey, Jay,

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,544
this is what I'm wearing
for golfing tomorrow.

73
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,720
Wanted to give you a heads up
in case there's some overlap.

74
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:39,791
What are you going for here?

75
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,060
Matt Damon in "Bagger Vance."
You didn't get that?

76
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,712
I did. I think
you look just like him.

77
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,883
It's the whole reason I asked
you to teach me to golf.

78
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:49,148
Any sport where you can
wear this, I'm in.

79
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:52,992
Who is that? It's 10:00 at night.

80
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:55,278
- I'll get it.
- Hold on, Gatsby.

81
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:58,072
Hola! It's Javier! Open up!

82
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,158
Dad!

83
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,204
There's my <i>campeón!</i>

84
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,727
There's your black mouse.

85
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,660
Hola, Javier,
what are you doing in town?

86
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,866
Well, I missed Manny's birthday,
plus I have a free week.

87
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:11,075
You're staying a week?

88
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:12,035
Make that go away.

89
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,099
So, Manny, tomorrow,

90
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,515
in honor of you becoming a man,

91
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,693
I am taking you to the racetrack

92
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:18,313
to enjoy the sport of kings, hmm?

93
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:19,443
That's so cool!

94
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:21,913
Actually, Manny and I have
plans to play golf tomorrow.

95
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:23,536
Golfing? Pfft! That is for old men

96
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,072
and for women who like women.

97
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,521
Come on. Your dad is in town.
Let's go to the races.

98
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:28,727
Yeah, can we all go?

99
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:29,672
Ay, no, baby, I can't.

100
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:32,472
I promised Haley that I was gonna
help her with her Spanish.

101
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:34,774
- But Jay's going to go with you.
- What?

102
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:39,011
I'm not gonna let Manny take off
with Javier by himself.

103
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,136
Once, when Manny was 6,

104
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,324
Javier took him to the petting zoo,

105
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:43,892
which later, I found out

106
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:46,948
that was the name of the stripper club.

107
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,712
A real petting zoo
would have been cleaner.

108
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:52,384
- But I was looking forward to playing--
- You're going.

109
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:54,240
That I don't miss.

112
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,684
Would you look at that?

113
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,799
Oh, yeah, you know,

114
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,584
I never saw us as trophy
on the mantle people,

115
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:18,026
but yours looked so gosh
darned good up there,

116
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,900
I figured, why not be
proud of what we've done?

117
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,647
Uh, "First Place,
Bass Catchers Spring Fish-Off,

118
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,680
Missouri North Division."

119
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,520
2-day total of 10 smallmouth bass

120
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,203
weighing 34.24 pounds

121
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,196
with a 4 1/2-pound kicker.

122
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:36,380
So you beat all the other
boys aged 12 through 17?

123
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,400
Sure did.

124
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:40,238
Look at our trophies up there.

125
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:42,289
We're a couple of winners, aren't we?

126
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:44,240
Are we?

127
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,600
Claire?

128
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,196
Where are all my razor blades?

129
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,507
- They're not in that box?
- No.

130
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,647
Well, I guess they're gone.

131
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:50,908
They can't be gone.

132
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:53,019
In my 20s,
I went on a game show

133
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,865
and won a lifetime supply
of razor blades.

134
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:59,108
Okay, Phil, time is up.
What is your answer?

135
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:03,568
3.14159.

136
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh! I'm sorry, Phil.

137
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:08,804
The correct answer is banana cream.

138
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:09,524
Banana cream.

139
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,868
Banana cream.
Well, you got me there, Chip.

140
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,644
But you're not leaving
empty-handed, no.

141
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:16,057
You're going home
with a lifetime supply

142
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,604
of Genesis twin-blade razors.

143
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:21,247
What?! Two blades in one razor?

144
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:23,965
Man, it'll never get better than that!

145
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:26,635
You must have used them all up.

146
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,361
They said "a lifetime supply."

147
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,159
Honey, you got 15 years
of free razor blades.

148
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,317
Put that in the "Win" column
and move on.

149
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,426
Mom, is it okay if my
friend Walt comes over

150
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:37,623
to play "Rebel Fighters 3"?

151
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,558
Honey, don't you think
it is a little weird

152
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,492
that one of your best friends
is an eighty-year-old man?

153
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:44,544
No, it makes it more fun,
because he was in a real war.

154
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,759
He says cool things like

155
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,188
"See you in hell, Klaus."

156
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,749
I don't even know what that means.

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,076
Oh, hey, dad,
some doctor called for you.

158
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,820
Dr. Sendroff?

159
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,459
Yeah, that's it.
You were in the shower.

160
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,608
What did he say?

161
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,530
He wants you
to call him right away.

162
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,552
Oh, well.
See you in hell, Klaus.

163
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,192
What's wrong?

164
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:06,245
I don't know.

165
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:07,569
He ran a few tests on me yesterday.

166
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,801
He said he'll call
if something was wrong.

167
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,046
And now he's calling.

168
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,463
Hi, this is Phil Dunphy.

169
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,746
I'm returning Dr. Sendroff's call.

170
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:15,857
Are you serious?

171
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,358
- What?
- He's on a flight to London.

172
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,941
Um, is there any way I can reach him,

173
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:22,058
or--uh, uh,
someone else I can talk to?

174
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,281
Okay. Fine.

175
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:26,260
Please just tell him it's urgent.

176
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,283
Thank you.

177
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:29,400
Oh, boy.

178
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,084
Honey, I am sure it's nothing.

179
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,911
Claire, I'm tender under my arm.

180
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,692
Maybe Luke hit you
with his broomstick

181
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:35,768
when you guys were playing Quidditch.

182
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,961
I'm way too fast,
he never touched me.

183
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,877
I can assure you
you are perfectly fine.

184
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,140
That's very comforting,

185
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:43,648
coming from a marketing
major at a party school.

186
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:51,903
I like the number 4 horse.

187
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:52,641
He loves this track,

188
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:54,433
his dad won the Preakness,

189
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,540
last three finishes were in the money.

190
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:57,847
I like Miranda's Miracle.

191
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:58,574
Why?

192
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:00,415
There's this girl Miranda in my class,

193
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,532
and she is really pretty.

194
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,609
If she likes me back,
it will be a miracle.

195
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,243
Would you bet $2
on that one for me, Jay?

196
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:07,721
Sure, but you are throwing
your money away.

197
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,046
You both are.

198
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,606
The winner of the race will be number 7--

199
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,239
my hometown.

200
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:14,345
Number 7...

201
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,813
Well, he's carrying 3 extra pounds,

202
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:18,058
and he hates the distance.

203
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,945
Those are just words on a page.

204
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,493
I look the horse in the eye,

205
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,972
and he tells me...
he is the winner.

206
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,041
Tells ya?

207
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,540
- Perhaps this will sound crazy.
- No need for the qualifier.

208
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:31,619
But I have always been able to
see into the soul of a horse.

209
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,945
It is a gift,
and I do not question it.

210
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:37,516
Just like I always end up
on the shortest line at the bank.

211
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:38,571
Maybe I should bet on your horse.

212
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:41,309
Are you kidding me?
These aren't just words.

213
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,225
They give you all this information,

214
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,182
so you can make an informed decision

215
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,573
- and beat the odds.
- Yes, of course,

216
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:49,594
and this is why everybody
with a racing form is rich.

217
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,216
Now come on.
It's time to place our bets.

218
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,784
What's it gonna be, Manny?

219
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,472
$2 on my hometown.

220
00:07:58,473 --> 00:07:59,748
You really think he's going to win?

221
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:02,376
Well, I only know what
he tells me with his eyes.

222
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:06,258
Don't ask me why, but maybe in
some previous life, I was a horse.

223
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:07,762
Or part of a horse.

224
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,615
Oh, hey, Alex called.

225
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,652
She left her cell phone here.

226
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:16,759
She's gonna come back and get it.

227
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,831
Cam, did you do something
to your fish trophy?

228
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,027
Oh, yeah, I forgot about
this fun middle part.

229
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,231
You see, now it looks like a
fish jumping out of the water.

230
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:25,101
Yeah, right over mine.

231
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:27,646
Do I sense something, Mitch?

232
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,054
You know, just because mine's
a little taller than yours,

233
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,793
doesn't make yours any less important.

234
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,789
Oh, no. That's not what I was feeling,

235
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,598
not even a little bit.

236
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,832
Oh, my god. You don't like
that I put my trophy up.

237
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,938
I just think it's a little weird

238
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,832
that immediately after I win a trophy,

239
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,629
You feel the need
to dig this thing up

240
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,632
and plop it down next to mine.

241
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:46,701
I'll have you know

242
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,992
that I want to display
this for quite some time.

243
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,858
But I put it in box in the garage

244
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,002
with all my other awards--

245
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,190
Yes, award-z--

246
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,339
Out of courtesy
to a sadly award-less you.

247
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,097
It looks ridiculous.

248
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:02,208
Mine is a distinguished
professional award

249
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,871
given to me by my peers,

250
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,700
and yours was given to you on a pier.

251
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:07,648
Okay, well, for your information,

252
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,254
when I won this,
it was a very big deal.

253
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:13,535
I cut a ribbon at the grocery
store and signed autographs.

254
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,724
"Best fishes, Cameron Tucker"

255
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:19,097
Oh, you know what?
I just remembered!

256
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:22,271
Mine comes with
a really fun pedestal, too!

257
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,352
Oh! Look at that!

258
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:27,564
- Oh, and proper hierarchy is restored.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:28,359
Unless you suddenly remember

260
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,757
that your fish came with a top hat.

261
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,775
Okay. Well, you know what?

262
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,836
I'm gonna go get Lily from her
party and go to the park.

263
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:35,873
OK.

264
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,371
This award has changed you, Mitchell.

265
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:39,726
You may be flying high now,

266
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:42,435
but pretty soon, you're gonna
be free falling, Tom Petty...

267
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,696
Because you're petty.

268
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,713
Tom Petty.

269
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,608
Hmm? Get it?

270
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,885
About three sentences ago.

271
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,568
Hola, Haley.

272
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,128
Hi, Gloria. Thanks for coming over.

273
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,035
En español, por favor.

274
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:58,737
Uh, hola, Gloria.

275
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,161
Gracias for coming over.

276
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,388
No, the whole thing.

277
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,860
I don't know the whole thing.

278
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:05,620
Why do I even need to learn Spanish?

279
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,472
I live in california.
I'm never gonna use it.

280
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,746
That's the problem with Americans.

281
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:12,905
They expect all of us
to know their language,

282
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:15,267
but they don't even make
the effort to learn ours.

283
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,105
Win a war sometime.

284
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,898
Then we'll start talking like you.

285
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,697
Ha. So wrong.

286
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:22,501
Oh, hey, Gloria.

287
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,820
Hi, Phil. How are you?

288
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:24,498
I wish I knew.

289
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,685
Why? What's wrong?

290
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:27,423
Uh, I don't wanna bum you out.

291
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:28,501
My doctor did some tests

292
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,546
and said he'd call
if something was wrong,

293
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,144
and he called this morning.

294
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:32,912
And what did he say?

295
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:33,866
I don't know. I missed the call.

296
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,277
Now I can't reach him.

297
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,335
The black mouse.

298
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,670
- What?
- In my dream.

299
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,504
It was a bad omen.

300
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,340
But probably not for you.

301
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,444
The staircase.

302
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,172
No, no, no. You're fine. You're fine.

303
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,216
Am I? Get this --

304
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,055
15 years ago, I won a lifetime
supply of razor blades.

305
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,349
They ran out...

306
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,757
today.

307
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,900
What's with the spitting?
Are you warding off death?

308
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,344
No. When I did

309
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,740
I think I suck in a little bug.

310
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:07,461
$16 for the first race,
$10 from the second race,

311
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:09,583
plus $34--$60?

312
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,467
You're a genius, dad.

313
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:12,272
Well, I cannot take all the credit.

314
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,781
It is a particularly chatty
group of horses today.

315
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:16,756
I love gambling! It's so easy!

316
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:17,480
It's not easy.

317
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:19,808
Well, not for you.
You've lost, what, three in a row?

318
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,740
Oh, burn, Jay!

319
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,023
I'm sorry. That was uncalled for.

320
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,444
This is all so heady.

321
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:27,463
$50 on little bacon to win.

322
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:28,353
Ooh-ee.

323
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,327
- Yeah, ooh-ee.
- What? What ooh-ee?

324
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,296
There is something not
right about that horse.

325
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:34,033
- I think I saw it, too.
- You didn't see anything.

326
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:35,295
This horse is a heavy favorite.

327
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:36,972
The rest of the pack couldn't
beat a merry-go-round.

328
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,347
I'm sticking with Little Bacon.

329
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:39,688
It's your funeral.

330
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:40,999
Who are we going with, dad?

331
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,945
Nobody in this race, papito.

332
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:45,624
It was quiet down there
in the paddock just now--

333
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,239
too quiet.

334
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,308
Oh, gee. You know what? Make it $300.

335
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:49,243
Oh, my.

336
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:51,561
I'm telling you, kid, this is the one.

337
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:53,305
And you know how I know?

338
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:56,074
'Cause it said, "pfft."

339
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:58,154
They don't talk like that.

340
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:04,842
"Maria bought a beautiful
white dress for her wedding."

341
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:09,432
Um, Maria compró

342
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:13,929
un hermoso vestido blanco

343
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,041
para su-- I-I'm sorry.

344
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,912
I cannot concentrate with him here.

345
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:19,526
What are you doing?

346
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,215
Just taking it all in.

347
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:29,494
You're a beautiful, intelligent woman...

348
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,366
And don't you ever forget it.

349
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,794
Wow, he is so weird sometimes.

350
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:39,491
No, he's not weird! He's a saint!

351
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,712
And you will miss him
when he's gone...

352
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:43,088
One day.

353
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,176
Hey, Uncle Mitchell.

354
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,012
Your, uh, phone's on the table.

355
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:51,603
What's that?

356
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,564
Oh, Cam's old fishing trophy.

357
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,883
Yeah, when I woke up this morning,

358
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,296
that's where I found it.

359
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,580
Right after you got yours?

360
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,308
Thank you!

361
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,285
Oh, my god. Welcome to my world.

362
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:02,545
Last week,
I got this beautiful plaque

363
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:03,755
from the debate team for
outstanding achievement,

364
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:04,815
and what did my mom do?

365
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,693
She found one of Luke's
"participant" ribbons

366
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:09,088
and a certificate Haley got for
showing up somewhere on time,

367
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,187
and put all three of them
together on the same shelf!

368
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,108
It's, like, so unfair!

369
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,685
I was so glad I talked to Alex,

370
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:17,295
because she agreed with every
single thing I was feeling--

371
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,660
which made me realize

372
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:22,945
that I was acting
like a 14-year-old girl.

373
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:29,900
Ah, come on, kid.

374
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,008
I just lost an arm 'cause of you.

375
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,189
Now get your head in the game.

376
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,418
Sorry. I can't concentrate
with my dad staring at me.

377
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,605
I just love you so much.

378
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:40,362
I hope he's talking to you.

379
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,300
Ugh. Oh, great, now I'm dead.

380
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:46,801
I'm going to the bathroom.

381
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,801
You know, they say that happens.

382
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:53,978
Hey, Walt.

383
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,489
You ever think about death?

384
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,930
I'm 85. Death is my roommate.

385
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:03,752
I got a call from the doctor.

386
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,108
There's a 60% chance I'm gonna die.

387
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,576
Ha! Doctors--

388
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:08,829
said I'd be dead ten years ago.

389
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,379
Look at me.

390
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:10,979
I'm healthy as a--

391
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,794
I gotta go change my tank.

392
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,847
Phil, you've gotta let this go.

393
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:20,716
I'm sorry, Claire.

394
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:21,760
I don't know how to react

395
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,804
when I find out there's a
70% chance I'm gonna die.

396
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,431
Honey, listen to me.

397
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,061
You're gonna be fine.

398
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:32,032
- You really think so?
- I know so.

399
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:34,337
Claire's my rock.

400
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,385
You know when you're on a
plane and there's turbulence,

401
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:37,355
you look at the flight attendants,

402
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:38,884
and if they're still smiling
and serving drinks,

403
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,184
you know everything's gonna be okay?

404
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:41,316
That's Claire.

405
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,414
I could also picture her as a cop.

406
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,828
And into the final furlong
it's Little Bacon

407
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,347
followed by Bradswaxjacket.

408
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,169
Go Little Bacon. Go Little Bacon.

409
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:51,779
You got this! You got this!

410
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,708
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

411
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,300
And the winner is number 9
Little Bacon by 3 lengths.

412
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,290
Yes! I knew it!

413
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,049
You see that, Manny?
Dumb luck always runs out.

414
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,212
But if you live in the real world,

415
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:03,579
and you use your head,

416
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,969
not have it in the clouds
like Dr. Dolittle there,

417
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,198
you'll do okay.

418
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:08,996
Guess we should have listened
to Jay on this one, dad.

419
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:10,516
You got that right.
You should have listened to Jay.

420
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,839
And I'll tell you something else.

421
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,419
You can't look in a horse's eyes

422
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,702
and tell there's something wrong.

423
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,542
You can't even look in their
eyes at the same time --

424
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:18,203
One's here and one's here!

425
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:20,175
Come on. Let's go to the window, kid.

426
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:22,160
I may need some help
carrying my winnings.

427
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,340
Oh. Wait.

428
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:25,263
Jay, look.

429
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:28,183
Inquiry.

430
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,412
What's that?

431
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,853
It is when a horse has
committed an infraction.

432
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:33,601
Possible infraction.
Usually it's nothing.

433
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:34,641
I'm sure...

434
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,083
The number 9 horse Little Bacon

435
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,656
has been disqualified for interference.

436
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:38,257
What?!

437
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:41,445
The winner is number 6,
Bradswaxjacket.

438
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:42,549
You see?

439
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,066
The eyes...

440
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:46,316
They do not lie.

441
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,654
Tough break, Jay.

442
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,734
Here...

443
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,550
Little something for gas.

444
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:03,628
Cam was right.
I-I was being petty.

445
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,064
So I found his box of old trophies

446
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,516
and I decided to surprise him

447
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,903
by having them on the
mantle when he got home.

448
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,156
Well, I was the one who was surprised.

449
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,872
I had no idea
how many trophies he had--

450
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,128
First place, and all of
them for different things.

451
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,664
Music, football,
art show, science fair,

452
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:22,975
a chili cook-off.

453
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,851
A lifetime of accolades hidden away

454
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,800
just so I wouldn't feel bad.

455
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,940
Aah! That's a mouse! That's a mou--oh! Ew!

456
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,381
Oh! Disgusting!

457
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,309
Oh, no! No, cam, I-I was
gonna make a big display!

458
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,616
I believe you have.

459
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:42,721
No, no, Cam! There was a--

460
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,304
Oh! Gross!

461
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,513
Listen, Manny, do me a favor

462
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:54,071
and get me a cappuccino from
right over there, okay?

463
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,390
No, it's okay. I got it.

464
00:16:58,826 --> 00:16:59,927
So...

465
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,710
You wanna talk about what
happened back there?

466
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,125
- Not at all.
- You know...

467
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:07,376
it is not just the horses whose souls
I can read through their eyes.

468
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,132
You really wanna know?
I'll tell you.

469
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,365
Okay. I'll leave you alone.

470
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,335
All right, listen, hang on.

471
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,388
I'm sorry I went after you
like that in front of Manny.

472
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:16,537
That was wrong.

473
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:20,533
No, I get it.
Nobody likes to lose at the races.

474
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:23,325
I don't owe this guy anything.

475
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:26,156
He stops by a couple of times
a year to see his kid.

476
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,189
It used to be a relief,
gave me a nice break.

477
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,557
But now Manny and I,
we got our own thing.

478
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:33,588
Look, I know I'm not his dad...

479
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,604
Maybe I don't like the reminder.

480
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,752
- Oh! Oh, my gosh!
- Hey, what's up?

481
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,475
- What?
- We came as soon as we heard.

482
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,311
Heard what?

483
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:48,043
We heard Phil got bad news
from the doctor.

484
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,207
Who told you that?

485
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,399
Gloria!

486
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,914
No, I didn't say
that he got bad news...

487
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:55,944
I said that
he was getting bad news.

488
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:58,600
You don't know
that he's getting bad news.

489
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:00,424
I saw a black mouse.

490
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:02,048
I saw a black mouse.

491
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,152
So he says.

492
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,585
- Okay. You guys...
- Oh, this is worse than I thought!

493
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,560
No, it's not. Listen to me. Listen.

494
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,663
Phil is fine. As a matter of fact,

495
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:09,804
you should go before
he even knows you're here.

496
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,200
No, no. We're staying.
We're staying.

497
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,136
We got here as soon as we could.

498
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,841
Did you bring the coffee cake?

499
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:17,272
Yes, I have it right here.

500
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,133
He carried it in from the car.
I paid for it.

501
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,872
Listen. Listen to me.

502
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,528
I am very sorry for what
you are going through.

503
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,628
Thank you.

504
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:25,623
Who is this?

505
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:26,853
Who, indeed?

506
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:28,863
I am Javier Delgado, Manny's father

507
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:31,548
and Gloria's former husband and lover.

508
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,580
I hope you do not think
this is insensitive,

509
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,833
but you are a beautiful woman,

510
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,393
and you will have no
trouble to find a man--...

511
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,961
Javier!
The body is not even cold yet!

512
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,429
The body is upstairs
watching basketball.

513
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,740
He is fine.

514
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:45,375
- Gloria said he was sick.
- No.

515
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:47,299
He went to the doctor,
he had some tests.

516
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,431
The doctor called. That's it.

517
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:53,036
Plus today he run out of his
lifetime supply of razors.

518
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:54,169
That's a sign.

519
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,563
This is a lot of hocus-pocus!

520
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:57,724
I can't believe I bought
a coffee cake over this!

521
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,323
Wait, wait, wait, no, no.
I'm confused.

522
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:00,795
What did the doctor say exactly?

523
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:03,715
I don't know.
We missed his call this morning.

524
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:04,813
The doctor called on Saturday?

525
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:06,891
- Yeah. So?
- Nothing.

526
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,514
Not nothing. Not nothing. What?

527
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,168
Well, it's just that, uh,

528
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:14,348
Doctors don't usually call
on Saturday with good news.

529
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:15,704
But they could call--

530
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:16,713
I mean, he could call with anything.

531
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:18,597
Do you think he's sick...

532
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,352
What's... what's going on?

533
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:24,904
Nothing. Nothing.
Everybody just came by

534
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,264
for absolutely no reason at all.

535
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,223
You look worried.

536
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:28,709
I'm not worried.

537
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,860
Oh, god. The plane's in trouble.

538
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,020
You put away the drink cart
and you're strapping in.

539
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:37,040
- You're gonna be fine, kid!
- You are gonna be great!

540
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:38,713
I wish I looked this good.

541
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:40,908
Stop, please!
You're freaking me out.

542
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:41,936
Are you gonna die?

543
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:44,861
I don't know!
There's stil a 5% chance I'll make it!

544
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,695
- It's Dr. Sendroff.
- Okay. Okay.

545
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:51,519
Guys, I don't know what's on

546
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,745
the other end of this phone call...

547
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:55,360
But whatever happens,
I just want you to know,

548
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,253
you've already given me
a lifetime supply of happiness.

549
00:19:58,512 --> 00:19:59,237
I remember once as a child--

550
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,568
- Answer it!
- Do it!

551
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:03,520
Dr. Sendroff?

552
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:05,425
What's the word?

553
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,849
- Are you serious?
- What?

554
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:12,687
That's it?

555
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:13,949
What is it?!

556
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,661
H-hold on one second.

557
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,316
He's calling about a real
estate listing. I'm fine.

558
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:19,188
Ay, no.

559
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:22,008
Yesterday, you said you'd
call if something was wrong.

560
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,709
Then you called,
then you disappeared.

561
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:26,992
That is the most irresponsible,
unprofessional thing

562
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,177
I've ever heard of in my entire life!

563
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:30,676
And do you have anyone to represent you

564
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:32,758
in the sale of your current house?

565
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:33,654
Look into his eyes.

566
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't care what the doctor says.

567
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,614
I give him six months.

568
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:40,279
Stop staring.

569
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:50,359
So, Phil Dunphy, tell us
a little bit about yourself.

570
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,023
Well, Chip, I'm married to
a great lady-- Hi, Claire!

571
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:54,314
And I have a baby girl.

572
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:57,186
Um, I'm a real estate agent,
and I enjoy playing checkers.

573
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:59,555
- Okay.
- Both Chinese and American.

574
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:01,887
And, uh, I am a fan of hip-hop.

575
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,075
Well, good for you.

576
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:06,144
Though I try to stay neutral in the
whole east coast/west coast thang.

577
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,663
- Next up we have a--
- One quick thing--

578
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:09,840
Shout out to my, uh, college buddy Ling,

579
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:13,027
who built his own helicopter and
is taking his first flight today,

580
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:15,235
and, uh, I also wanna
wish a happy anniversary

581
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:17,187
to my in-laws
Jay and Dede Pritchett.

582
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:19,848
Your eternal love is an
inspiration to us all.

583
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,525
Okay. That's enough.

584
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:24,914
Next up, we have a homemaker
from West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.

585
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:25,764
