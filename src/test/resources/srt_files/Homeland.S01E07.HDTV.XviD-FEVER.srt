11
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,001
This was an act of terrorism.

12
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:30,506
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

13

<i>The next song</i>

Find this man, Raqim Faisel.

He followed me to this house.
No one knows

we're living here.
I still think we should leave.

We should turn ourselves in.
No!

Three days ago you were

Ticket to Mexico.

62

Lot of cities in Mexico.

Tampico? Leon?

So, why am I here?

70
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:36,417
I don't know.

71
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,453
You just got in my car.

72
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,757
Well, I couldn't have gotten in
if you didn't stop for me.

True.

74

So, did I pass?

75
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,999
The polygraph? Yeah.

76
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,901
Flying colors.

77
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,938
So you won't be hauling
me in again next week?

78
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,639
Not that I know of.

79
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,513
I'm taking some time...

80
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,215
from home.

81
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,083

I'm sorry.

So what exactly are we doing?

86
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,602
Well, I'd like a drink.

87
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:29,636
Or three.

88
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,606
All right, swanky
or hole-in-the-wall?

89
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,474
I don't like the word
"hole" anymore.

90
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,076
Right.

91
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,545
But I do like a good dive.

92
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,717
The more I drink,
the worse I play.

93
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,053
That's not happening to you.
I know.

94
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,255
Pissed off all my college
boyfriends, too.

95
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,923
All of them?

96
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,825
Both of them.

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,294
Fuck me.

98
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,462
Two out of three?

99
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,964
Buy me another, you're on.

100
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:00,931
Cuervo?

101
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,833
Tequila Revolucion, silver,

102
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,034
no lime.

103
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,671
You like your clear liquors.

104
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,487
What's up, chief?

105
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,956
You want a ride?

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,092
I got one.

107
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,561
What, Opie over there?

108
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,464
"88," huh?

109
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,698
Yeah, it's my jersey number

110
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,167
from high school.

111
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,301
Or code for HH.

112
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,836
Eighth letter of the alphabet.

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,204
"Heil Hitler."

114
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:39,806
You're not just a pretty face,
are you?

115
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,775
You guys are White Nation, huh?

116
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,143
That's cool.

117
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,344
It's Aryan pride, baby.

118
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,345
So what's the plan?

119
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,614
Like, world domination?

120
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,283
Yeah, that's right.
Any time soon?

121
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,320
You wanna hear about it?
You can come outside.

122
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,288
We got a van.
Hell, yeah.

123
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:58,025
I love sucking Nazi dick.

124
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,860
You know, I don't like people
fucking with me.

125
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:01,362
Well, who does?

126
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:03,564
Who <i>does</i> like people
fucking with them?

127
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,165
Hey, is there a problem?

128
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,734
Yeah, the problem is
this mouthy bitch.

129
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:10,871
Hey, look, are we okay here?

130
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,974
Huh?

131
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,710
So is there, like,
a supremacist fist bump?

132
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,012
What are you, a fucking moron?

133
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,047
Bitch!

134
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:23,250
Oh, God! Get those fuckers!

135
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,585
Oh, shit!

136
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,154
You fucking lunatic!
(Carrie laughs)

137
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:32,027
I gotta unlock it.

138
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:35,130
Open it! Okay, get in.
It's open.

139
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:40,403
Fuck you, bitch!
Here they come. Go!

140
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,608
(men yelling indistinctly)

141
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,112
(laughs)

142
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,781
You are a dangerous
fucking drunk.

143
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:51,949
Thanks.

144
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:53,685
It's not a compliment!

145
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,620
My hand!
(laughing)

146
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,460
Okay, okay, where now?

147
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:05,930
I have a cabin...
or my family does.

148
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:08,432
I've been meaning to get there.

149
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,267
Sounds like the stars
have aligned.

150
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:12,770
I-95. Hit it!

151
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:14,338
(Brody laughing)

152
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,973
Final touches, hon.

153
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:21,043
All smooth. There.

154
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:23,746
You're done.

155
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,247
Dana, you're up.

156
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:36,224
So, I'm thinking layers.

157
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,227
Like, maybe really cut it
to my shoulders or something.

158
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,261
Okay.

159
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:45,834
Where's Dad?

160
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:49,304
He's taking the weekend away.

161
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,141
Why?

162
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,110
Dana...

163
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:55,679
He knows about you and Mike.

164
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:56,914
Yeah.

165
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:58,449
Jesus, Ma.

166
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:01,152
Dana, I thought I was a widow.

167
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:03,288
Our situation was very unusual.
Yeah, so you

168
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,524
gave up on him and went whoring
out with his best friend.

169
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,326
You cannot talk
to me like that!

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,261
And now, Mom,
it's royally fucked up!

171
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:10,996
Enough with the language
and the attitude!

172
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,298
Or what?
Or you're grounded.

173
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,201
Yeah, right.

174
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,036
Starting right now!

175
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,005
The whole weekend, you're home.

176
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,782
I got a line on
our runaway terrorist.

177
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,184
The one whose boyfriend
got iced in the motel?

178
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,188
She stole a car outside
of Columbus last night.

179
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:37,656
Just turned up
in Beaumont, Texas.

180
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,458
Woman fitting
her description bought

181
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,460
a one-way bus ticket, cash.

182
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:43,396
Due to cross the border
late tonight.

183
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,631
We believe Nazir's people
killed her boyfriend Faisel,

184
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,501
and I think she'll
give them up.

185
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,203
Texas agents can
intercept the bus.

186
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,704
I want to go.

187
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,140
You want to go to Mexico?

188
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,475
Bring her back myself.

189
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,044
One-on-one.
You can talk to her here.

190
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,847
Put her in a room with a bunch
of suits, she'll go silent.

191
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:03,850
David, I get this girl.

192
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:05,485
I've spent the last three days
figuring her out.

193
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,455
I can get her to talk.

194
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,093
FBI's gotta escort you.

195
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,596
Fine, as long as they keep
their fucking distance.

196
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,867
David...

197
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,605
trust me.

198
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,550
Wow, I like it.

199
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,218
Yeah, it's old school.

200
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,253
No A.C.,

201
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,555
build your own fire, like that.

202
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:41,958
(grunts)

203
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:44,761
Yeah, it's perfect.

204
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:49,331
Where is the fucking key?

205
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:54,236
(phone rings)

206
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,442
Hello.

207
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,211
Maggie, it's me.
Hi.

208
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:02,645
Um, hey, just curious,

209
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,249
which rock do we keep
the cabin key under?

210
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:07,450
You're at the cabin?

211
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:09,719
Uh, no, I'm home.

212
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,788
Just wondering about the key.

213
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:15,058
Carrie, what's going on?

214
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:17,627
Uh, nothing. Nothing at all.

215
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:21,464
You were supposed to come over
tonight and get your meds.

216
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:23,566
Uh, Monday.
Gonna do that Monday.

217
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,268
You don't have a pill
for tomorrow or Sunday.

218
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,971
No, I have one left.
I'm fine.

219
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:30,939
You sound drunk.

220
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:34,342
(snorts) Drunk?

221
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,278
(laughs)

222
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:38,012
I am, actually, at the cabin

223
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:38,980
With who?

224
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,815
Uh, no, I'm all alone.

225
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,083
I'm meditating.

226
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,819
Okay, well, look,
take your pill tomorrow

227
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,621
and then come over Sunday night.
No skipping.

228
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,756
Okay, promise.

229
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,591
Okay.

230
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,526
Uh, so, the key?

231
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,463
It's in the old stove.

232
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:58,432
(gasps) Right! Stupid.
I remember.

233
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,700
Okay, um, thanks.

234
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,203
Hey, look, I'm at the open house
at the girls' school, but...

235
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,171
Oh, great. Have fun.

236
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,107
I'll drop everything and
leave if you're in trouble.

237
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,009
Okay, I'll see you Sunday.

238
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,645
Okay.

239
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,880
Everything okay?

240
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:14,348
Yeah. Wait.

241
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,716
Wait here.

242
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,192
(key jingles)

243
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:11,537
(keys jangling)

244
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,846
(sighs)

245
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:32,356
What you looking at?

246
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,125
A star.

247
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,294
Wait an hour.
You'll see thousands.

248
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,530
I just need one.

249
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:41,566
I'd ask you what you
were wishing for, but...

250
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,969
What?

251
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:47,106
How would I know if you
were telling the truth?

252
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,477
Oh, the polygraph.

253
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,747
"Have you been faithful
to your wife, Sergeant Brody?"

254
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,815
(chuckling)

255
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,817
"Yes, I have."

256
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:00,220
(both laugh)

257
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:04,625
And hours before,
I was climbing all over you.

258
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,326
Did you learn that over there?

259
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:07,595
The climbing?

260
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,396
No.

261
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,599
How to beat the box.

262
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:16,771
Well, I had to lie
sometimes to save my life.

263
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:19,640
Maybe I became an expert.

264
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:25,813
How'd you resist cooperating?

265
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,916
I mean, you're in a hole.

266
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,317
They're beating you.

267
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,953
Carrie, I don't want
to talk about it.

268
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,489
Sorry.

269
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:45,563
(clears throat)

270
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:51,636
You're a pretty good
drinking buddy.

271
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,472
(laughing): I got a little
carried away with the Nazis.

272
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:55,706
(chuckles)

273
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,375
Well, I figure we're safe here.

274
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,779
Yeah, unless my sister
sends in the dogs.

275
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,518
I've been thinking about you.

276
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,788
Yeah?

277
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:11,023
And last night.

278
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,792
Mmm.

279
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:15,861
Parking lot sex.

280
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:18,163
Classy.

281
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,701
Can we graduate to cabin sex?

282
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:31,675
Ow.

283
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,246
BRODY:
Okay.

284
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,353
(grunts, laughs)

285
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,806

00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,643
Who are you?

294
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:40,746
Your ride.

295
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,415
(Speaking Spanish)
How did you get out of the truck?

296
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,286
Unless you prefer
the Federales.

297
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:51,924
(Speaking Spanish)
Let's go, <i>gringuita</i>.

298
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,768
Yes, we have company.

299
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:06,470
In case you try to bolt,
the Feds are there.

300
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:08,105
Of course, I told them

301
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,807
you weren't dumb
enough to do that.

302
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:18,516
So we're headed to
McLean, Virginia.

303
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,819
Should take us 30 hours.

304
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:24,089
I got what they call a
heavy foot, so maybe 25.

305
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,292
And then I turn you over.

306
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:28,027
To the FBI.

307
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:31,931
Who, frankly, are
chomping on the bit

308
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:34,499
to put you away, Aileen.

309
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,302
See, they frown on terrorists.

310
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,504
And, in particular, privileged

311
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,173
wealthy American terrorists.

312
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:48,578
I'm looking forward
to the drive, actually.

313
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:53,616
I've had some upheaval at home.

314
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,386
Could use some peace, quiet.

315
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:04,126
You're obliging me with
that, so thank you.

316
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,298
I'll just say this.

317
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:13,034
We could talk things
out, you and I.

318
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,237
Come to an understanding.

319
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:18,539
But once we
get to D.C.,

320
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:21,408
the Feds step in and I move on.

321
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,043
And how you're treated

322
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,712
and what you're
charged with--

323
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:28,748
All that--

324
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,584
It's quite out of my hands.

325
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:36,223
So... food
for thought.

326
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:48,370

00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:09,926
God, it's so nice down here.

333
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,293
Yeah.

334
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:13,329
(sighs)

335
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,267
I overdid it last night.

336
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:18,535
Me, too.

337
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,437
No more booze today. No.

338
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,439
(grunts)

339
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,575
(sighs)

340
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,815
Look...

341
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,051
I know.
This was crazy.

342
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,919
I should call home.

343
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,154
Yeah.

344
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,922
I should go home, actually.

345
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:38,157
Sure. Okay.

346
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,425
We can head back.

347
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:50,970
I love the water.
Mm.

348
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:55,842
There's actually a really
beautiful waterfall out there.

349
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,510
My sister and I
would hike to it

350
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:58,845
every day in the summer,

351
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,746
take our compasses
and notebooks,

352
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:02,615
play Lewis and Clark.

353
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,694
(sighs)

354
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:27,140
SAUL: <i>Not only did your
cohorts</i> <i>turn on you</i>

355
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,609
<i>and blow away your boyfriend...</i>

356
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:31,077
Faisel was your
boyfriend, right?

357
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,314
Not only that.

358
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:36,616
Now they're after you.

359
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,985
You're as safe as
you've been in two days

360
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,554
riding with me.

361
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:52,566
What was the plan, Aileen?

362
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,537
Why'd you buy that house
under the flight path?

363
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,973
Tell me that.

364
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:02,811
And tell me who's out
there working on Plan B.

365
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,179
Then I can help you.

366
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,415
Bullshit.

367
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:08,718
Huh.

368
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:10,753
She speaks.

369
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,090
(speaks Arabic)

370
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:19,595
Must have learned
Arabic growing up.

371
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,563
Riyadh, right?

372
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,499
I know those compounds.

373
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,501
Rich oilmen and their families,

374
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,035
blocking out the world

375
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,039
with those great walls,
living like desert kings.

376
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,074
The pools, the gardens.

377
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,914
Never mind the desperate
people outside the walls.

378
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,884
The guest workers...

379
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,553
limping along the road.

380
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:49,758
Kids with no shoes, shirts.

381
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,561
Kids like Faisel.

382
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:57,066
You met there, right?

383
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,569
As kids?

384
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:08,911
He was 13; you were 15?

385
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,086
Somehow, between
you being shuttled

386
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,255
to that fancy American school

387
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,127
and him laboring each
day for $1.10 a week,

388
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:26,797
you and Faisel
found each other.

389
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,433
He had a horse.

390
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:32,136
We'd ride.

391
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,574
Did you love him then,

392
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,609
or did that come later?

393
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:46,785
You don't know me.

394
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:56,360
BRODY: So were you
Lewis or Clark?

395
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:57,695
CARRIE:
Oh, had to be Lewis.

396
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,129
Why?

397
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,997
I like the name Meriwether.

398
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:02,499
(laughs)

399
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,535
So you were an adventurer
even as a kid?

400
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:06,802
Yeah, I never really fantasized

401
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:09,472
about New York or
a corner office.

402
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:13,842
It was always, like,
Nepal or Uganda.

403
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,011
How long were you in Baghdad?

404
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:17,980
A couple
three-year stints.

405
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:19,882
What happened out there?

406
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,684
What didn't happen?

407
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:24,520
What sent you
to that support group?

408
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,291
I lost someone.

409
00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:31,327
My translator.

410
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,865
Were you with him?

411
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,835
Uh, he was protecting me.

412
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,971
Trying.

413
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:47,444
But this mob just got crazy.

414
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:51,515
And they hung him from a bridge.

415
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,983
I was...

416
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:54,819
pinned down.

417
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,154
I couldn't...

418
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,156
Yeah.

419
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:10,536
It's hard to find people
to talk to about it.

420
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:13,539
How about your wife?

421
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,875
It's like she doesn't know
who I actually am now.

422
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,711
Well, maybe it just takes time.

423
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:24,048
I...

424
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:26,082
I can't be with her.

425
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:28,618
No?

426
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,221
No, I just...
(clears throat)

427
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:34,624
I just can't.

428
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,460
But I can with you.

429
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:41,464
(chuckling):
Well, we were drinking heavily.

430
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,465
No, but it's
different with you.

431
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,634
It's, uh...
(clears throat)

432
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,803
I don't know. It's free.

433
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,873
As in, I don't charge?

434
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,808
(laughs)

435
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:56,445
As in, it's the first time
since I've been back

436
00:23:56,479 --> 00:24:01,817
that... well, I found
some fucking peace.

437
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:05,321
Yeah.

438
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:07,990
Me, too, actually.

439
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:14,830
And that's pretty rare for me.

440
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,536
So...

441
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,277
Are we gonna try this sober?

442
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:34,285
Uh, waterfall's just up here.

443
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:43,627
MADDIE:
Concentration.

444
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:45,295
Okay, so your word must begin

445
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,198
with the last letter
of the word before it.

446
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:48,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.

447
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,301
Okay.

448
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:53,271
(chanting): Concentration,
concentration is the game.

449
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,774
Keep the rhythm,
keep the rhythm just the same.

450
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,875
Subject.

451
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,109
Boys' names.

452
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,444
Xander.

453
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:00,445
Raphael.

454
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,513
Liam.

455
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,181
Mike.
(coughs)

456
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,316
Drink!

457
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:06,718
For the tenth time.

458
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,552
You suck at this game.

459
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:09,553
(chuckles)

460
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,891
All right!
Come on, come on.

461
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,493
(chanting): Concentration,
concentration is the game...

462
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,294
All right, forget
this, forget this.

463
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:19,663
Let's go out. Yeah?

464
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,665
No, I'm grounded.
Your mom's working all day.

465
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
She'll never know.

466
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:23,701
No!

467
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,569
Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

468
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,004
Wild thing, slow down.

469
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:28,472
JEFF:
Let's go to the quarry.

470
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:29,507
Yeah.
Yes.

471
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,507
No, guys, just let me...

472
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,342
Get some more beer.

473
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,677
(gasps)

474
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:34,578
Oh, my God.

475
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:35,846
You okay? Fuck.

476
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,881
I didn't feel anything.

477
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,750
Come here.

478
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:41,685
One of you get a towel for her
right fucking now.

479
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,221
MADDIE:
Oh, my God.

480
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:00,004
30 miles to Memphis.

481
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,706
You been to Graceland?

482
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,443
No?

483
00:26:05,478 --> 00:26:07,345
You got to go
once in your life.

484
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:10,548
See the Jungle Room.

485
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,350
Stay at the Heartbreak Hotel.

486
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,289
My dad thought Elvis
was the devil.

487
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:21,325
Hoover thought he was
a national security threat.

488
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,296
Like minds.

489
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,966
SAUL: We've been
in touch with him.

490
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:32,803
Your dad.

491
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:38,208
I haven't.

492
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:40,277
I know.

493
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,312
Six long years.

494
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,086
Thank you.

495
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,087
Fries?

496
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:53,723
No.

497
00:26:53,757 --> 00:26:55,425
He's worried about you.

498
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:03,600
He's worried about
what their friends will think.

499
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:05,802
That their good little
Princeton girl was shacked up

500
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:08,839
with a poor brown Saudi,
and planning to give

501
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,875
their beloved U.S.
the "fuck you" it deserves.

502
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,184
Do you realize
how serious this is?

503
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:25,690
You could end up
with the death penalty.

504
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,462
What do you care?

505
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,463
Why are you here, anyway?

506
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:34,465
The FBI could've delivered me.

507
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:37,469
That would have been
standard, right?

508
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:41,707
I thought
we'd understand each other.

509
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,375
Why?

510
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,482
You were isolated growing up.

511
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:51,084
Right?

512
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:56,155
Well, there was
the compound community.

513
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:58,123
If you like immoral businessmen.

514
00:27:58,158 --> 00:27:59,792
So you went outside the walls.

515
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,660
Found Faisel.

516
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:08,699
And then it was okay.

517
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,836
There was something good there.

518
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:16,807
But then my father
saw us one day.

519
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,043
Riding that horse.

520
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:22,079
His princess cavorting
with a local brown boy.

521
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,253
Aileen?

522
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:33,258
Is Faisel the reason you were
shipped off to boarding school?

523
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:40,298
What do you know about it?

524
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,737
More than nothing.

525
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,908
I married a brown girl.

526
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:55,847
You should eat.

527
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:59,216
ETA: 12 hours.

528
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:05,589
Think about
what you want, Aileen.

529
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:21,405
(door closes)

530
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,241
(keys jingling)

531
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,210
Hey.

532
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:26,244
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,479
We were there forever.

534
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,248
Is everything okay?

535
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:30,783
19 stitches.

536
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:32,218
Jesus.

537
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:33,586
Good night, guys.

538
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,887
Do you need help, hon?

539
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,022
No.

540
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,260
You okay?

541
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:45,429
I don't know.

542
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:48,632
(sighs)

543
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,834
Everything's just so...

544
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:51,902
Fucked up?

545
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:53,002
Complicated.

546
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:54,404
Yeah.

547
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:57,107
Dana's like a surly stranger
in my house.

548
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:58,742
I don't even know
where she went.

549
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:01,412
How did she go from my adorable,
loving baby to that?

550
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,948
Were you adorable and loving
when you were 16, Jess?

551
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,084
You and Brody having it out.

552
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:08,787
And now he's gone,
I have no idea where.

553
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:10,923
Chris is still aces.

554
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,892
(chuckles softly)

555
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:17,630
I just want things
to be simple again.

556
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:19,665
Hey.

557
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:28,974
I miss you.

558
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:47,692
CHRIS (in distance):
Mom?

559
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:49,360
Coming, sweetie.

560
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:54,665
Chris wants you.

561
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,334
I heard.

562
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:59,004
Thanks for watching him, and
thanks for fixing the door.

563
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:00,038
No problem.

564
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:05,611
Does it hurt?

565
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,048
Yeah.

566
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:11,350
How about... you?

567
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:14,186
Yeah.

568
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,723
I think we all need to give
peace a chance around here.

569
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:22,495
You know what would
help with that?

570
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,897
If you stayed away from us.

571
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:31,105
There's no place for my dad
when you're here, Mike.

572
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:38,445
(quiet jazz music playing)

573
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:10,977
Hungry?

574
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:12,378
Thirsty.

575
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,112
Me, too.

576
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:17,951
We're not doing that.

577
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:20,954
No. No.

578
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,622
(clears throat)

579
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:24,257
Sorry.
(laughs)

580
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,725
No, I am, I am.

581
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,993
Jesus.

582
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:28,928
I feel like
a terrified teenager.

583
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:30,830
I know, I know.

584
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:37,570
Well, shit, I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna ask.

585
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,808
Will you go to the prom with me?

586
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,478
Do I get a corsage?

587
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:47,280
Wrist or pin-on?

588
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:49,982
Actually, I'll take a nosegay.

589
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,617
I-I don't even know
what that is.

590
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,919
It's a kind of bouquet

591
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,287
from medieval times.

592
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,356
Is that right?
Yeah.

593
00:32:57,391 --> 00:32:58,524
Pre-shower, pre-soap,

594
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,993
they would carry them around

595
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:02,162
to mask the unpleasant smells
of the time.

596
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:04,498
To keep their,

597
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,734
their "nose gay."

598
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,672
I know these things.

599
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:12,674
(both laugh)

600
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:23,052
Are you still thirsty?

601
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,657
Not at all.

602
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,769
(thunder rumbles)

603
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:39,232
(both panting)

604
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:58,317
Do you want to stop?

605
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:01,353
No, I want to just live here.

606
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:05,958
For a second.

607
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:41,659
(moaning)

608
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:55,473
Issa?

609
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:58,476
Issa?

610
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:04,216
(gasps)

611
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,984
Issa, where are you,
goddamn it?!

612
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,986
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

613
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,621
It's okay.

614
00:36:09,656 --> 00:36:13,224
(gasping)

615
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:15,560
It's okay, you're with me.

616
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,895
Issa, no!

617
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:18,997
You're with me.
You're with me.

618
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:20,666
You're with me.

619
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:25,671
What happened?
You're safe.

620
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:29,341
You're not there.
Everything's fine.

621
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:31,477
Everything's fine.

622
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:06,314
♪ ♪

623
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:38,411
(sighs)

624
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:45,418
Where are we?

625
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:48,487
Calliope, Indiana.

626
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:51,257
I grew up here.

627
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,660
There were four
Jewish families.

628
00:37:54,695 --> 00:37:56,829
My dad was the local druggist.

629
00:37:56,863 --> 00:38:00,432
The nearest synagogue
was three hours away.

630
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:02,067
So we'd come here.

631
00:38:02,102 --> 00:38:03,769
You're religious?

632
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,004
My parents were.

633
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:08,073
Commerce brought 'em here,

634
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:10,741
even though the community
didn't want us.

635
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:15,946
And they gave me strict orders
not to assimilate.

636
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,683
You can't be on
the baseball team.

637
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:21,085
They start the game
with a Christian prayer.

638
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:24,888
You can't sing Christmas carols.

639
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:29,494
When the other kids
stand to sing,

640
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:32,630
you sit at your desk
with your hands folded.

641
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,968
Respectful.

642
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,107
But silent.

643
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:46,679
Being a dutiful son, I did
precisely as they asked.

644
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:48,381
Happily?

645
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:52,852
What do you think?

646
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,120
I was a kid.

647
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,789
I just wanted to play ball,

648
00:38:56,823 --> 00:39:00,193
I wanted to be in the pageant.

649
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:03,162
I'd gladly say their prayers,
sing the songs.

650
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,740
I just wanted to not be alone.

651
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,910
Man, I hated this place.

652
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:20,179
It was the reason
I was different...

653
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:23,784
strange...

654
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:29,023
isolated.

655
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:34,930
They fuck you up.

656
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:38,100
Yeah.

657
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:47,375
We got to get going.

658
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,110
The agents await.

659
00:39:56,652 --> 00:40:00,422
I don't know what
happened to you, Aileen.

660
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:03,792
I don't know how you went
from one more angry teenage girl

661
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:06,695
to joining
the fucking jihadists.

662
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:08,630
And if your issues are
truly geopolitical--

663
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,233
Then I can't help you.

664
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:13,602
I think you wound up here

665
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,937
because you fell
in love with a boy.

666
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:19,741
And he's gone now.

667
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,747
Oh, that's a heartbreaker.

668
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:27,749
I want to get you
through this as best I can.

669
00:40:40,962 --> 00:40:43,731
You okay?

670
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:45,499
Yeah, I'm good.

671
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:10,789
So, I know I have oatmeal--
Maybe frozen O.J.,

672
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:13,858
but no Yorkshire Gold out
here in the sticks, sorry.

673
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:15,827
BRODY:
What?

674
00:41:15,862 --> 00:41:17,695
Ugh-- Knowing my dad, we're
probably looking at Folgers.

675
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,165
And I'm not kidding.

676
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:23,302
How do you know the tea I drink?

677
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:29,709
I don't know.

678
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:31,745
You probably had it at Langley.

679
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:37,284
I'm gonna go get some wood.

680
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,485
I'll be right back.

681
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:58,870
So what's the trouble at home?

682
00:41:58,905 --> 00:42:01,040
Nothing much.

683
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:04,510
Just the love of my life
walking out my door.

684
00:42:07,014 --> 00:42:09,816
For good?

685
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,885
I hope not.

686
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:17,524
'Cause I can't imagine
being that lost.

687
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,401
What happened to his body?

688
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:29,571
Raqim?

689
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:32,875
It's probably in
an Ohio morgue.

690
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:40,449
He'd want a Muslim burial.

691
00:42:44,554 --> 00:42:48,191
Well, if no one claims him,

692
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:51,261
he'll be buried
in a potter's field.

693
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:03,806
(phone ringing)

694
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,308
Estes.
David, it's me.

695
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:07,142
We have a deal with Aileen.

696
00:43:07,177 --> 00:43:08,577
She talked?

697
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:10,079
We need someone
up on the roof of that house

698
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:11,480
under the flight path now.

699
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:12,581
What did she tell you?

700
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:14,150
She doesn't have the full story.

701
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:16,051
They were just told
to buy the house,

702
00:43:16,086 --> 00:43:18,320
go about their business
till a visitor arrived.

703
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:19,622
Which he did on Monday.

704
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:21,090
She get a name?

705
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:22,324
No.

706
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:23,793
But he was American.

707
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:26,128
She's sitting with
a sketch artist right now.

708
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:27,429
Guy didn't say a word,

709
00:43:27,464 --> 00:43:28,797
went right to the roof.

710
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:30,232
He spent over an hour up there.

711
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:31,600
Doing what?

712
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:32,968
That's what we got
to figure out.

713
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:34,469
All right,

714
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:36,438
we'll get Galvez up on the roof
right away.

715
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:51,185
Hi.

716
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:56,190
I didn't drink tea at Langley.

717
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,459
What?

718
00:43:58,493 --> 00:44:00,662
Yorkshire Gold.

719
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:04,032
That wasn't just a lucky guess.

720
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:07,636
Well, why does that matter?

721
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,805
Were you watching me?

722
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,141
I don't know what you mean.

723
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:13,676
I mean did you spy on me?

724
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:15,912
You are a spy, right?

725
00:44:16,981 --> 00:44:19,149
Brody...

726
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:21,117
That's why we ran
into each other

727
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:23,519
at the support group, isn't it?

728
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:25,120
Why you slipped me your number

729
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:27,222
in case I ever
need to ask anything?

730
00:44:27,256 --> 00:44:28,623
No, you're wrong, Brody...

731
00:44:28,658 --> 00:44:31,860
Don't fucking lie
to me, Carrie!

732
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:35,297
It was my job.

733
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:37,232
It is my job.

734
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:39,167
Oh, so you're still spying.
I'm working.

735
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:43,238
I'm always working.
On what suspicion?

736
00:44:43,272 --> 00:44:45,840
Tell me, goddamn it!

737
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,242
Shit.

738
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:51,178
You looking for this?

739
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,161
Abu Nazir's bomb maker told me

740
00:45:06,195 --> 00:45:08,830
an American prisoner
of war had been turned.

741
00:45:08,865 --> 00:45:14,269
And he was coming home,
to carry out an attack.

742
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:15,738
And you believed this?

743
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:18,240
He told me minutes
before he was executed.

744
00:45:18,274 --> 00:45:19,842
So?
So he was my prisoner.

745
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:22,544
I interrogated him for months.

746
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:24,246
He was cooperating at the end.

747
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,882
There was no reason
for him to lie.

748
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:29,217
You think I'm that P.O.W.?

749
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,288
There's no one else
it could be.

750
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:35,356
You're telling me
the fucking CIA

751
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:37,592
thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda?

752
00:45:41,664 --> 00:45:44,933
I think you're working
of al-Qaeda.

753
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:54,709
(scoffs)

754
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:57,579
(exhales sharply)

755
00:45:57,613 --> 00:46:01,549
What about the gun, Carrie?

756
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:03,686
Bears? Intruders?

757
00:46:05,622 --> 00:46:07,389
We just keep it in the cabin.

758
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:10,626
Mm. Plus, you never know
when a terrorist

759
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,261
might darken your door.

760
00:46:12,296 --> 00:46:14,930
I never said terrorist--
I said turned.

761
00:46:14,965 --> 00:46:16,899
If that were true,

762
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:19,134
if any of this were true,

763
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:21,436
wouldn't I just kill
you right now?

764
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,605
Not if you're playing
the long game.

765
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:38,952
(clearing throat)

766
00:46:40,154 --> 00:46:42,522
Ask me anything.

767
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:46,359
What?

768
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,427
There's the gun.
Hold it to my fucking head

769
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:50,162
and ask me anything
you want to know.

770
00:46:50,196 --> 00:46:53,632
I'll show you how wrong you are.

771
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,657
Afzal Hamid.

772
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:18,726
What about him?

773
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,694
Did you slip him a razor
blade at the safe house?

774
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:23,129
How could I do that?
Answer the question.

775
00:47:23,164 --> 00:47:24,731
No. But I wish I had.

776
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:27,199
And I hope he bled slowly,

777
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:29,902
and died in a lot of pain.

778
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,739
Who's Issa?

779
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:36,475
Where did you hear that name?

780
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,710
Who is he?

781
00:47:37,744 --> 00:47:41,348
He was my guard.
He was nice to me.

782
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:45,686
What goes on in your garage?
My garage?

783
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,188
You said ask anything.

784
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:51,693
I take the trash bins
in and out.

785
00:47:51,727 --> 00:47:54,262
Fix a bicycle sometimes.

786
00:47:54,297 --> 00:47:55,830
Why do you go there
so late at night,

787
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:56,931
so early in the morning?

788
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:01,569
To pray.

789
00:48:04,606 --> 00:48:06,073
What is that?

790
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:08,542
What? Nothing.
No, it's not nothing.

791
00:48:08,576 --> 00:48:09,776
It's a habit.

792
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,744
When I don't have
my prayer beads.

793
00:48:14,748 --> 00:48:17,216
You're a Muslim?

794
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:19,652
Yeah.

795
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,725
You live in despair
for eight years,

796
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:26,727
you might turn to religion, too.

797
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:30,398
And the King James Bible
was not available.

798
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:42,110
Why did they kill
Walker and not you?

799
00:48:42,144 --> 00:48:44,145
You asked me that in the debrief.
Yeah, and you were evasive.

800
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:46,247
It doesn't matter.
I'll decide that.

801
00:48:46,282 --> 00:48:49,851
You don't need to know.
I need to know everything.

802
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:02,298
I killed him.

803
00:49:05,835 --> 00:49:08,771
Okay?

804
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:11,206
<i>I</i> killed him.

805
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,613
They told me to
beat him to death

806
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:20,015
or be killed myself.

807
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:23,619
(sighs)

808
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:26,022
And so I did it.

809
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:31,428
And I vowed to never tell
another living soul.

810
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,141
Who told you to kill him?

811
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:44,710
Abu Nazir.

812
00:49:44,744 --> 00:49:46,945
So you did meet him.

813
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,216
Yes.

814
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,654
You lied to us about meeting
one of the leaders of al-Qaeda?

815
00:49:54,688 --> 00:49:56,856
That's right.
You want to explain that?

816
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:01,560
I was embarrassed.

817
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,762
Ashamed.
Why?

818
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:08,666
Because he offered me comfort,

819
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,068
and I took it.

820
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:20,211
And became his follower?

821
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:22,480
A soldier in his jihad?

822
00:50:22,514 --> 00:50:24,682
No.

823
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:28,452
No. Jesus, don't you understand
anything I'm telling you?

824
00:50:29,888 --> 00:50:32,857
I'm not made of that stuff.

825
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:36,261
I'm no hero.

826
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:38,696
I had nothing to give.

827
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:42,266
I was broken, living
in the dark, for years,

828
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:45,903
and a man walked in...

829
00:50:48,908 --> 00:50:51,276
and he was kind to me.

830
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,711
(breathing tightly)

831
00:50:57,316 --> 00:50:59,717
And I loved him.

832
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:18,903
(cell phone ringing)
GALVEZ: Hello?

833
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:20,272
SAUL (on phone):
Galvez, you up there?

834
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:22,107
Affirmative.

835
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:24,443
I've searched every square inch.
No weapons, no tools, nothing.

836
00:51:24,478 --> 00:51:26,246
Okay, so what's this guy
doing up there for an hour?

837
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,781
GALVEZ: Well, it's pristine,
I'll tell you that.

838
00:51:27,815 --> 00:51:29,917
Would have expected some
bird shit and whatnot.

839
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:31,485
SAUL:
He cleaned his workspace.

840
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:32,720
GALVEZ:
I guess.

841
00:51:32,754 --> 00:51:34,555
Okay.

842
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:35,956
Face the airport, Galvez.

843
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:37,891
We're looking for direct

844
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:40,460
line of sight targets.

845
00:51:40,495 --> 00:51:42,329
Now, what do you see?

846
00:51:42,363 --> 00:51:44,331
GALVEZ: There's a bunch
of airport hotels.

847
00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:47,968
Uh... a control tower
maybe half a mile out.

848
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:50,404
And how about further?

849
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:51,772
You got binoculars?

850
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:54,174
Yeah.

851
00:51:55,977 --> 00:51:58,945
Okay, Terminal B
is about a mile away.

852
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:02,148
Air France, hanger 30.
And what is that?

853
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:04,150
It's small.
Has a helipad out front.

854
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:05,218
Any signage?

855
00:52:06,554 --> 00:52:09,022
Uh... "Reserve M-1."

856
00:52:10,992 --> 00:52:12,626
Marine One.

857
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,794
That's a landing pad
for Marine One.

858
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:16,329
Oh, shit.

859
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:18,931
A mile is well within
a sniper's range.

860
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:20,266
An expert sniper.

861
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,934
SAUL:
An American military sniper.

862
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,373
David.

863
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:34,212
Send me
Sergeant Brody's picture.

864
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:36,181
Brody? Why?

865
00:52:36,216 --> 00:52:38,750
So Aileen can look at it.

866
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,394
So we done here?

867
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:51,665
Well, you have an
answer for everything.

868
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:53,834
But you still don't believe me.

869
00:52:53,868 --> 00:52:56,402
I know an American
P.O.W. was turned.

870
00:52:56,437 --> 00:52:58,004
It has to be you.

871
00:52:58,038 --> 00:53:01,140
(sighs) (phone vibrating)

872
00:53:06,946 --> 00:53:08,713
I'm leaving.
No.

873
00:53:08,748 --> 00:53:10,582
We're not finished.
Yeah, we're finished.

874
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:11,850
If you want to arrest me,

875
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,051
you can come to my house.
No! Brody!

876
00:53:13,085 --> 00:53:18,689
Or maybe you want
to shoot me, now.

877
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:20,425
(vibrating)

878
00:53:24,463 --> 00:53:27,065
Brody!

879
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,438
Saul...

880
00:53:33,472 --> 00:53:35,406
We were wrong about Brody.

881
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,376
What... what do you mean?

882
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,044
SAUL:
<i>A P.O.W. was turned.</i>

883
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,713
<i>But it wasn't him.</i>

884
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:44,448
I, I... I don't understand.

885
00:53:44,483 --> 00:53:46,884
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.

886
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:49,587
The other soldier
captured with Brody.

887
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:54,458
Tom Walker died.

888
00:53:54,492 --> 00:53:56,460
No.

889
00:53:56,495 --> 00:53:57,895
He's alive.

890
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,465
He's the terrorist.

891
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:02,501
Shit.

892
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:04,536
Brody!

893
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:06,438
Wait!

894
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:08,074
I, I was wrong.

895
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:10,943
I made a terrible mistake.

896
00:54:10,978 --> 00:54:12,946
Don't you think I
don't already know that?

897
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,483
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

898
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:18,218
This weekend, this time

899
00:54:18,252 --> 00:54:21,321
that we spent together,
it was real.

900
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:24,089
The parts that...

901
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:26,792
that we both...

902
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,097
The important parts.

903
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:33,131
Hey, Carrie.

904
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,167
Fuck you.

905
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:59,359
