00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:09,462
<i>You took one of me best whores</i>
<i>for your private use.</i>

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,131
Every day she's not
under my roof costs me money.

4
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:18,771
Wait, listen to me!

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,309
Good men will die
for some hidden agenda,

6
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:25,345
<i>the Barlow woman's agenda.</i>

7
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:28,081
Things will get better here.
I promise you they will.

8
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,649
We'll need some
additional items.

9
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:31,584
New guns,
12-pounders.

10
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:33,186
You'll have it.

11
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:35,955
You want the guns from my ship
to hand over to a pirate?

12
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:37,123
That is correct.

13
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,491
<i>Help me, Mr. Scott.</i>

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,193
Please, help me save her.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,461
Why don't I take over?

16
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:44,631
<i>The Andromache, it can't be.</i>

17
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,332
<i>Captain Bryson</i>
<i>hasn't had time to unload.</i>

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,001
He didn't.
She's riding low.

19
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:49,535
<i>Those guns are still on board.</i>

20
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,838
- What are we going to do?
- Get them back.

21

22
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,167
<i>Captain?</i>

23
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:49,205
We're steady at six knots,
north by northeast.

24
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,209
You don't trust me, do you?

25
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,481
<i>With any luck, we'll sight</i>
<i>the Andromache soon.</i>

26
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:03,986
The battle will begin.

27
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:07,590
You and I will have
our roles to play.

28
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:13,062
We have the chance for
a few minutes' honesty first.

29
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:16,832
Honesty?

30
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,505
Men died yesterday

31
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:26,275
careening our ship
faster than was safe.

32
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,110
Men are going to die today

33
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,879
attacking that
merchant ship out there,

34
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:33,449
and they'll die not knowing
it was all based on a lie.

35
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,417
A lie?

36
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:37,453
We don't even know if
the Urca's schedule is accurate.

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,388
We're completely relying
on the cook.

38
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:42,291
How can you just pretend you
have no doubts about any of this?

39
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,893
Years of practice.

40
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,962
There's always doubt, Billy.

41
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,430
No sane man would deny that.

42
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:52,001
No good captain
would acknowledge it.

43
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,203
Take our present route,
for instance.

44
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:56,605
We tacked north by northeast,

45
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:59,141
along Andromache's
best point of sail.

46
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,977
If you're Bryson,
that's the smart course.

47
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,212
Yeah...

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,147
Well, he knows that I know that.

49
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,883
So wouldn't he have at least
considered heading northwest

50
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:11,453
to follow the coast,
lose us in the dark?

51
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:15,557
Or due east on the chance that
we might sail right past him?

52
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,261
There must be at least
one chance in three

53
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,130
that that horizon
will remain bare

54
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:24,366
and we'll never see
the Andromache again.

55
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:27,436
That's the truth.

56
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,705
But what good would
that knowledge do

57
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:34,243
for any man on this crew
trying to focus on doing his job?

58
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:39,515
This crew needs certainty,

59
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,784
and I need their support
to achieve an end

60
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:45,387
which is in all
our best interests.

61
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,356
So we dance the dance.

62
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:55,297
Never was there a Caesar
that couldn't sing the tune.

63
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,933
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

64
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,037
Ah.

65
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,810
You've heard the stories,
haven't you?

66
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:11,380
She's a witch who pledged
my soul to the devil,

67
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:13,415
and anoints me
with the blood of infants

68
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:14,883
to keep me safe in battle.

69
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,254
- Come on, I'm not stupid.
- No, you're not.

70
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:23,058
So you can probably guess
it isn't as much fun

71
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,561
to tell stories about how
your captain makes a home,

72
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:28,864
with a nice Puritan woman
who shares his love of books.

73
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:34,770
Is that the truth?

74
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,773
<i>Sails!</i>

75
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:39,641
<i>Man your posts!</i>

76
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,677
<i>Posts!</i>

77
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,245
<i>Have a look.</i>

78
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:45,114
<i>It's the Andromache!</i>

79
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,204
Well, this is
a stupid fucking idea.

80
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,207
Given the straits we're in, I would
suggest there is no such thing.

81
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,476
If we don't find a way
to earn an income and soon,

82
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,413
we will lose what little
we have left of a crew.

83
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,314
Or worse yet, we will be eaten

84
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,984
<i>by what little</i>
<i>we have left of a crew.</i>

85
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:24,219
Wish me luck.

86
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,921
You gave him permission, dear.

87
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,456
We must stand by our word.

88
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:30,893
But I said he could put one
finger in my bum, not three.

89
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,896
Then next time,
charge him by the digit.

90
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,231
Mrs. Mapleton,
a word, please.

91
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,267
What the fuck
are you doing here?

92
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,536
Mr. Noonan expressly
forbade it, did he not?

93
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:44,073
It turns out Mr. Noonan
has had a change of heart.

94
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,013
A transfer?
What is this?

95
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,948
It means, madam,
that the dispute

96
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:55,484
over the whore with Mr. Noonan
has been settled

97
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:58,053
through an agreement
to purchase this establishment

98
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,589
from him... by us.

99
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:04,293
- Noonan sold you the inn?
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

100
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,994
And where is he now?

101
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,731
From the tone in his voice,
it sounded as if Mr. Noonan

102
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,633
couldn't wait to be
rid of this place

103
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,103
and of its screeching
pig of a bawd.

104
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,306
His words, not mine.

105
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,775
The last I saw him, he was
seeking passage to Port Royal,

106
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:21,643
and then to who knows where.

107
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,179
You're telling me
that Mr. Noonan,

108
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:28,383
who just a few hours ago had the intent
of seeing your captain beaten to a pulp,

109
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:32,621
that Mr. Noonan decided instead
to sell you his life's work?

110
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,123
Yes.

111
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,724
And you expect me to accept it

112
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,060
based on a piece of paper
and your word?

113
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,795
And to keep
my mouth shut about it

114
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:43,232
<i>when any half-wit can see
that there's foul play at hand?</i>

115
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes.

116
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:47,536
I want a raise.

117
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:50,038
- What did you make before?
- Three percent of gross.

118
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,907
I'll give you 40.

119
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,610
Welcome aboard, sonny.

120
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,653
We are the proud new owners
of a brothel.

121
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,258
Let's hope no one notices.

122
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:13,795
No one has seen or heard
from Scott all morning.

123
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,765
He must have left with Bryson.

124
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,268
You're certain he said nothing to you
about why he would do this?

125
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,036
Nothing, ma'am.

126
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,071
- Before I knew what was happening...
- Get my horse ready.

127
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,019
I'm going to see my father. I want
to know what the fuck's going on here.

128
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:35,684
Hello.

129
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:37,719
What the fuck are you
doing in my office?

130
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:39,821
Flint stashed me here.

131
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,523
Presumably to stop
what's in my head

132
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,759
from spilling onto the deck
of the Andromache.

133
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,030
Oh, that's Randall.

134
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,199
Why is Randall lying on my sofa?

135
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,969
Well, he's not exactly going to be
leading the charge

136
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:55,537
after the day he had yesterday.

137
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:58,006
Why are you chained to him?

138
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,841
So I don't try to run.

139
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:02,778
Thank you.

140
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:12,187
Sorry, have I done
something to you?

141
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:13,755
Excuse me?

142
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,325
Well, you seem to harbor quite a bit
of anger towards me,

143
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,393
<i>and considering we hardly</i>
<i>even know each other,</i>

144
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,162
I'm wondering if there's
something I'm missing.

145
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,098
Flint and his crew offer you
a life of freedom and prosperity

146
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,267
for which you repay them
by stealing the product

147
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:26,935
of months of their
labor and sacrifice.

148
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:29,271
But you're not finished. Then you
lure Max into your selfish scheme.

149
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,539
Hold on.

150
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,608
I specifically tried
to talk her out

151
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,710
of getting wrapped up
in my selfish scheme.

152
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:38,213
I know all I need to know
about the kind of man you are.

153
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:41,984
Ma'am, you should
come outside right away.

154
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:45,887
<i>For years, we've all</i>
<i>profited in this place,</i>

155
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:49,258
trading on the stability
of my family's name.

156
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:52,928
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>our circumstances have changed.</i>

157
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:57,633
A fortnight ago, His Majesty's Navy
attempted to place me under arrest.

158
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:02,271
I am, since that day, a fugitive

159
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:04,806
marked for execution
by the Crown.

160
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,211
Unbeknownst to me,
my family in Boston

161
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,481
learned of this
and ordered Captain Bryson

162
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:14,383
to liquidate our holdings here.

163
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,051
<i>What about our goods?</i>

164
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:19,588
I convinced him to leave behind
the contents of our warehouse,

165
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,923
but that is all.

166
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,558
<i>To those of you owed credit</i>

167
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,495
or for whom we held goods
on consignment,

168
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:31,400
I leave it to my daughter to see
you made whole as best we can.

169
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:34,436
But once that is settled,
our business with you

170
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,171
must be considered complete.

171
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,009
I'm very sorry.
Godspeed to you all.

172
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:43,512
<i>I want my money back!</i>

173
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:58,026
We aren't closing on her!

174
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:04,366
I said to raise all the canvas!

175
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:08,203
- <i>What's our speed?</i>
- Sails are all raised!

176
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,738
No, they're not.

177
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:12,007
Where are my t'gallants
on the main and mizzen?

178
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:13,542
<i>Captain, we're fully loaded.</i>

179
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,777
If we raise the t'gallants,
the mast won't hold.

180
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,347
<i>Stand by to stretch that</i>
<i>starboard!</i>

181
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,756
Time.

182
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:33,362
Present speed: six knots.

183
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,331
We need at least another knot
if we're to catch up by dark.

184
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:44,306
- Raise the t'gallants.
- Captain...

185
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,575
Shift aft the back stays
if you're worried about the masts.

186
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,276
Shift 'em to the stern
if you have to.

187
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,104
Even if the back stays
hold at such an angle,

188
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:52,013
and I wager they won't,
the load on the sails

189
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,082
will exceed capacity and she'll dig in
hard at the bow.

190
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,317
She'll hold.

191
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,619
Hard enough to shake loose
the rigging entirely.

192
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:02,157
Captain, Mr. De Groot
makes a good point.

193
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,726
The speed we'll pick up will come
with dire risks for the ship.

194
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:10,232
But I think she can take it.

195
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:17,105
<i>Mr. De Groot,</i>
<i>quickly, please.</i>

196
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:20,142
- Raise the t'gallants!
<i>- Raise the t'gallants!</i>

197
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:26,948
<i>Out of the way!</i>

198
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,085
Brace up another five degrees!

199
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:33,054
- Five degrees!
- Five degrees!

200
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,428
Bring her up into it.

201
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,344
More!

202
00:12:57,747 --> 00:13:00,348
Brace up a little more!

203
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,516
More!

204
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,654
That's well!

205
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:07,823
- That's well.
<i>- Hold on!</i>

206
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:21,903
Now bring her up into it.

207
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:28,243
More, damn it.

208
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:31,746
Like this!

209
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,027
Aye, Captain!

210
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:48,663
There.

211
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,432
Hold it there.
Hold her tight.

212
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:56,671
Speed!
Again, please!

213
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,874
Time!

214
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:03,278
Seven and a half knots!

215
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:15,790
All right, ladies,
get some rest.

216
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:19,461
In a few hours, things are gonna get
awfully interesting.

217
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,645
Good morning, dear.

218
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,483
"Orders from Boston,

219
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,819
unbeknownst to me."

220
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:47,255
You sent Bryson away.

221
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:48,490
Yes.

222
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,259
You lied to my face, you shit.

223
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:54,195
And what choice
did you leave me?

224
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:56,965
You let Flint seduce you

225
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,868
into his madness
about the Spanish galleon

226
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:02,237
all in furtherance
of the fantasy

227
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,539
that you can resist
English rule,

228
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:09,044
that your authority in this place
is yours to do with as you please.

229
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,646
I am more to this place
than you ever were.

230
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:12,981
You are a child.

231
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:17,018
I'm fully aware
that Captain Flint

232
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:20,455
left in pursuit
of the Andromache last night.

233
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:21,957
But you should know

234
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,159
Captain Bryson sailed
the Velasco route

235
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:26,261
for 10 years
and was never boarded.

236
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,762
Not once.

237
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:33,435
Flint will be returning either
empty-handed or not at all.

238
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:35,870
This treasure galleon
business is over.

239
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,206
As for our future here,

240
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,675
I am working on a deal
that'll make a safe place

241
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,711
for us among the farmers
in the interior.

242
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,646
When the pirates are gone,

243
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:46,982
<i>the landowners</i>
<i>will drive commerce here.</i>

244
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,584
<i>They'll be indispensable</i>
<i>to the lords and to Whitehall,</i>

245
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:52,120
<i>and so we will</i>
<i>make allies of them.</i>

246
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:55,557
We will adapt
and we will survive.

247
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,527
<i>I won't ask you to walk out</i>
<i>with me right now.</i>

248
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:01,630
I know your pride
would never permit it.

249
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,266
The Barlow cunt who was supposed to
watch over you,

250
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:08,036
that's Flint's problem.

251
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:10,538
But Scott...

252
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,447
what the fuck did you
have to threaten him with

253
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,009
to get him to betray me?

254
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,714
We talked like men
and he saw reason.

255
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,951
Fuck you.

256
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:36,297
I been sayin' it.
You ain't been listening.

257
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:37,766
And now it's come to pass.

258
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,035
<i>The day that gentleman</i>
<i>and his daughter</i>

259
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:42,037
<i>tell you that the money</i>
<i>they took</i>

260
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:44,039
<i>ain't never coming back.</i>

261
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,610
<i>Yeah, that were</i>
<i>just fucking theft!</i>

262
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,446
<i>Right now, that little girl</i>

263
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:53,581
<i>is sitting in there</i>
<i>counting your money</i>

264
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,617
<i>and laughing her scrawny ass off</i>

265
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:58,553
on how much she has lifted
out of your pockets.

266
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,088
This is fucking nuts!

267
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:03,525
- We're not working!
- Good riddance, yeah!

268
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,567
I thought my men could help
keep tempers from boiling over,

269
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:14,402
for a while at least.

270
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,072
But for those
owed money out there,

271
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:19,340
<i>it's only a matter of time</i>
<i>before their tempers</i>

272
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:21,476
<i>can no longer be held in check.</i>

273
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:25,613
Now, if I may, I suggest an announcement
of payments to settle debts.

274
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,115
The longer it takes
them to hear it,

275
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:29,084
the more fuel Lilywhite
can throw on the fire.

276
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:30,752
I can't pay them all.

277
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:34,189
You're short?

278
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,257
How short?

279
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:39,494
Well, get out your books, then.

280
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:42,530
Certain crews may defer
their debts if I ask them.

281
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:46,334
<i>Any leads you have on future
scores would soften the blow.</i>

282
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,436
<i>Troublemakers we need</i>
<i>to pay off first...</i>

283
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:49,571
No.

284
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,007
I'm not winding things up here.

285
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,776
My business continues.

286
00:17:56,445 --> 00:18:00,181
Captain Naft of the Intrepid.
Mr. Walker, her quartermaster.

287
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:03,151
Captain Lawrence of the Black Hind
and Mr. Harrison.

288
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:05,920
And our friend Mr. Frasier.
Get them all here now.

289
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,323
Miss Guthrie?

290
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:13,027
I'm not sure you recognize
the gravity of this situation.

291
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:17,031
Have a drink.
Relax.

292
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,033
Everything's under control.

293
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,439
<i>She's fucking done!</i>

294
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:27,041
That Guthrie cunt is done.

295
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,147
Have you not heard?

296
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,948
We've heard.

297
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,217
Well, then what the fuck
are we doing in here?

298
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,986
At the moment, I'm remembering
what it feels like

299
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,354
to have food in my belly.

300
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:41,923
- Care to join us?
- Jesus, Jack.

301
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:44,926
We're free of her.
Free to hunt again.

302
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:47,662
So get off your ass
and find us a ship.

303
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,498
To assume that we've seen
the last of Eleanor Guthrie

304
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,867
is, well, not to know her.

305
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,870
The fact that she appears to have Captain
Hornigold and his men propping her up

306
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,305
only adds to my conviction.

307
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,141
Right now, we'd do well
to keep our mouths shut,

308
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,577
be thankful we have
some income from this place,

309
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:04,813
for the moment,
and bide our time.

310
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,147
Fuck that.

311
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:09,017
She's got no ships.
She's got no business.

312
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:10,752
That means she's out.

313
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,089
And I'm going over there
to make sure she knows it.

314
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:16,658
Captain?

315
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:23,131
I'll be upstairs.

316
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:30,839
Well, then, fuck you both.

317
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,707
Who's with me?

318
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,812
Nothing can ever be simple.

319
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,915
I can make it simple.

320
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:44,485
Darling, this is
a lovely stopgap,

321
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:46,921
but if we are to ever hunt
as a proper crew again,

322
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:50,191
we will need, well, a crew.

323
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,927
Right now, those men
are all we have.

324
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,362
It's unfortunate, perhaps,

325
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,864
but no less a reality.

326
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,078
Why don't we take advantage
of Mr. Hamund's momentary distraction

327
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,223
and have Mrs. Mapleton tend
to the whore on the beach?

328
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:21,022
<i>- Two six!</i>
- Heave!

329
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,757
- <i>Two six!</i>
- Heave!

330
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:24,492
- <i>Two six!</i>
- Heave!

331
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,896
<i>Stand by!</i>
<i>Stand by!</i>

332
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,487
Ahem.

333
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:54,422
Yes, Mr. Hayes?

334
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,457
<i>The Walrus will be upon us</i>
<i>in roughly four hours,</i>

335
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:57,959
<i>present speed.</i>

336
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,928
I assume preparations
have been made.

337
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:01,629
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

338
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:03,698
And the shipment of china plate?

339
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,501
I beg your pardon?

340
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:09,804
We have 70 plates of Chinese porcelain
in the hold,

341
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:13,341
which I have undertaken
to deliver to Boston unharmed.

342
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:18,613
May I suggest more straw
in the chest?

343
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:20,848
Yes, sir.

344
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,887
He's certain
this is all we have?

345
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:27,755
We emptied the girl
before we careened her.

346
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,958
This is the best I could do
before we set sail.

347
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,693
Same for food and water,
I assume?

348
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,096
Food, water, powder, all of it.

349
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:37,565
Right.
Take it all up top.

350
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,133
No reserves on this one.

351
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:42,236
Either we take
Bryson's ship or we're...

352
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:45,673
I believe the word you're looking for
is "fucked."

353
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,009
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah.

354
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:51,679
Dufresne?

355
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:55,650
You can't be serious.

356
00:21:57,753 --> 00:21:59,954
Andromache's manned
like a warship.

357
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:02,757
60 men at least,
and they're fighters.

358
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,360
So we'll need every body we can
muster on this one, yours included.

359
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:06,928
Come on.

360
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:27,115
Come on, everything's
at sixes and sevens

361
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:28,850
back at the house

362
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,718
and I have to come
and tend to this.

363
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,124
All right.
Come on, love.

364
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,126
Here we go.

365
00:22:39,862 --> 00:22:41,562
Open your legs.

366
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,834
Oh, hush, unless you
want to find yourself

367
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,904
carrying one of
those fools' brats.

368
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,913
Ow!

369
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,648
Get out.

370
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:14,662
She wasn't using enough lotion.

371
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:35,416
You could've left.

372
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,222
When that cunt beat Hamund off of you,
you could've left.

373
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,024
You didn't.

374
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:47,462
Thought you could
sweet-talk them all, did ya?

375
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:50,331
What do you care?

376
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,567
Once, one of them
came and put his balls

377
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,236
on my shoulder
whilst I was asleep.

378
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:57,705
Thought it was funny.

379
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:00,274
Last time he put them anywhere.

380
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:10,251
If you take it, they'll give it.

381
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:14,188
Why do you say these things?

382
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,960
You were the one who threw me to them
in the first place.

383
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,464
I only thought they'd kill you.

384
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:35,576
<i>Do you feel that soreness</i>
<i>between your haunches?</i>

385
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:37,311
Yeah, well, that's what you get

386
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,947
when you let some cunt
who's never raised a sail,

387
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:42,617
set foot on a deck
tell you your business!

388
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,419
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

389
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:46,954
<i>she'll have her boot</i>
<i>on your throat</i>

390
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:49,223
<i>and her hand</i>
<i>in your fucking pocket.</i>

391
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,526
I think he's talking about you.

392
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:54,128
<i>That's what you get when you're</i>
<i>letting a wench tell you...</i>

393
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,097
If you're pretending
to remain unconcerned

394
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:58,466
for my peace of mind,
please don't.

395
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,668
It amuses me that you think
I would even give a shit

396
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:03,371
- about your peace of mind.
<i>- Of course.</i>

397
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:06,941
Still, I don't think you're giving that
problem cut there its due attention.

398
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:10,411
Naft and Walker just arrived.
That's everyone.

399
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,351
You've never seen
a mob turn, have you?

400
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,020
<i>Funny thing.</i>

401
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:21,455
The people most surprised
when it happens,

402
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:23,891
usually the ones that gave rise to it
in the first place.

403
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,106
Can you join me, please, Captain?
I want you to hear this, too.

404
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,098
<i>Is the cunt still here?</i>

405
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,434
- Out on the street, friend.
- Where is she?

406
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,475
It's a rough world
out there, isn't it?

407
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,348
Someone opens their mouth,

408
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,083
you can lose everything.

409
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:55,056
Tell me, lass...

410
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:56,557
how's it feel?

411
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,428
Out now.

412
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:04,465
Well, if we're
not welcome in here,

413
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,634
I suppose we can go
spend more time

414
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:08,636
with our friend on the beach.

415
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:13,741
Oh, wonderful lass she is.

416
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,777
So, um...

417
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:18,312
resilient.

418
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:24,118
So appreciative
of what she's given.

419
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:28,689
We'll send her your love.

420
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:37,598
Come on, boys.

421
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:49,543
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

422
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:54,148
I think we all know
what we're up against today,

423
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:55,683
so let's just get to it.

424
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,021
As we close the distance
to the Andromache,

425
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:04,292
the captain believes
Bryson will attack port

426
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,161
and set himself
for a clean broadside volley.

427
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,664
He'll loose his guns,
pay off downwind,

428
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:10,831
and continue running.

429
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,366
Now, ordinarily,

430
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:14,635
we would either match him
and return fire

431
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:17,872
or slip into his wake
and make a run at his stern.

432
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:20,574
<i>Unfortunately, we're too outgunned</i>
<i>for the former,</i>

433
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,843
and Bryson is too skilled
a captain for the latter.

434
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:24,412
<i>He'll just keep shooting</i>
<i>and delaying</i>

435
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,147
and shooting and delaying
until nightfall,

436
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:28,115
at which point
he'll just slip away.

437
00:27:28,183 --> 00:27:29,283
So...

438
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,852
So, if we can't shoot at her

439
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,387
and we can't get close to her,

440
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:34,822
how the hell do we board her?

441
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,228
We go straight at her.

442
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,731
Without the bow chasers,
we'll be sitting ducks for her guns.

443
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,433
She'll rake us bow to stern.

444
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,202
<i>Not to mention we'd</i>
<i>be boarding bow to midship.</i>

445
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,870
For all you virgins in the room,

446
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,839
that's also known
as fucking suicide.

447
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:54,709
<i>Of course we'd need</i>
<i>to board alongside her.</i>

448
00:27:54,776 --> 00:27:57,912
We just need Captain Bryson
to cooperate

449
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:01,082
and bring the Andromache about
for us to do so.

450
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,951
And how the hell
do we get him to do that?

451
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,088
Mr. Beauclerc
is going to convince him.

452
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,375
You're a natural, son.

453
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:29,683
When this is all over, I'll be
lucky to still have a job.

454
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:35,049
- What...
- I keep accounts.

455
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:36,684
That's what I'm good at.

456
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:40,121
Do you see this number here?

457
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:43,023
That's how much I've saved this crew
this last year alone.

458
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,792
Can you say
of any other man here

459
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,394
that they've earned as much?

460
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,397
Every man on this crew
had a first time.

461
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:50,798
You're overdue.

462
00:28:50,866 --> 00:28:52,666
But I've never even
shot a pistol.

463
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,602
Well, that's all right.

464
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,138
Half the time
they don't even fire.

465
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,845
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:11,786
Time has come for us
to tell those who aim

467
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:14,121
<i>to make us slaves.</i>

468
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:16,624
<i>Mr. Rackham asked me</i>
<i>to tend to you.</i>

469
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:20,461
<i>Yeah, well, that's what you get.</i>

470
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,268
He said I wasn't
to take no for an answer.

471
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:36,043
They're saying
she may be finished.

472
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:37,478
She's finally got her due.

473
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,250
All I meant is that...

474
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:46,754
that it should please you
after what she did.

475
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:51,325
You hate her.
I hate her.

476
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:53,127
They all hate her.

477
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,198
Look what's good it's done us.

478
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:03,003
No captain on this island's
ever known that kind of power.

479
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:06,540
Power that doesn't care
how many votes you can tally,

480
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:09,477
who loves you, who hates you,

481
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:12,480
who fears you.

482
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:14,748
Power that just is.

483
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,917
Truth is,

484
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:20,287
none of us have any right
to hate her for it.

485
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:25,459
She's strong and we're weak.

486
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,461
That's the reality
of things here.

487
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:35,069
And no one down there is
strong enough to change anything.

488
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:37,938
<i>Not you?</i>

489
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,281
You're not strong enough?

490
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:49,116
I don't know.

491
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,786
But I think it's time
I probably found out.

492
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,308
What if he's wrong?

493
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:16,977
There's a chance Bryson
just keeps running, isn't there?

494
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:21,148
- That's it, steady.
- Right?

495
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:24,752
<i>Bryson could still gain speed.</i>

496
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,099
I mean, there has to be a chance

497
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:28,055
this fight will
never materialize.

498
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,957
Come on.

499
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:32,526
Come on, you bitch.

500
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,495
Come on.

501
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:45,139
There she goes!

502
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:52,880
Why isn't he attacking?

503
00:31:52,948 --> 00:31:56,283
Because he knows he'll never board us
if he does.

504
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,086
I will say this for him.
He's no coward.

505
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,890
200 yards, you may fire at will.

506
00:32:16,004 --> 00:32:18,005
I don't think I can do this.

507
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,373
Yes, you can.

508
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:24,244
Listen.
Listen to me.

509
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:26,313
You will make it through this.

510
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:29,116
No one eats it their first time
over the side.

511
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,251
I'm telling you, it's never happened.
Not on this crew.

512
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,387
Don't ask me why, it just is.

513
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:35,222
Men die all the time.
It can't be true.

514
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,591
No, not first-timers.

515
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,526
Name one.

516
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,263
You're gonna be all right.

517
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,533
Come on.

518
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,168
Damn it.

519
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,675
I hope you know
what you're doing.

520
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:56,310
So do I.

521
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:02,983
Mr. Beauclerc?
Range?

522
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,453
Almost there!

523
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:08,255
50 more yards, Captain!

524
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,298
Fire!

525
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,067
- Let her go.
- Fire!

526
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:23,270
Incoming!

527
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:24,571
Fire!

528
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:33,681
Get 'em back into the cookroom!

529
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,016
<i>Get 'em back!</i>

530
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,252
We can't take much more of this.

531
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,088
Aye.
Mr. Beauclerc!

532
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,097
- Two six!
- Heave!

533
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:51,465
- Two six!
- Heave!

534
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,667
Hayes, another volley
right away!

535
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,436
Right cannon round!

536
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:58,105
Mr. Burnett, prepare to bear away
and bring us into the wind.

537
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:01,775
Man the braces!

538
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:03,577
Fire!

539
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:13,153
Beauclerc, do it!

540
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:24,598
Stay where you are!

541
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:27,067
Bring us to starboard
before we lose the wind!

542
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,879
- Mr. Harris, take the helm!
- Aye, sir!

543
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:45,185
Fire.

544
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,867
<i>We've lost the wind, Captain.</i>

545
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:06,874
Prepare to repel boarders!

546
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:12,880
Bring us around
to the port side!

547
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:15,149
On the rails!

548
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,740
Now!

549
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,678
20 yards!
At the ready.

550
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:21,181
Get across the gap,
choose your targets!

551
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:23,550
<i>Pistols at zero range.</i>

552
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:26,186
Don't waste a shot.

553
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:27,387
Nets in!

554
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:33,427
Nets up, nets up, nets up!

555
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,264
<i>Get it!</i>

556
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:40,033
10 yards!
Go, go, go!

557
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:41,702
Over!
Get it over!

558
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:44,238
Hold, get down!
Hold, hold!

559
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:46,273
Hold!

560
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:02,422
Go, go, go!

561
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:50,764
Dufresne?

562
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,671
Jesus.

563
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:02,109
Come on.

564
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:05,946
No fucking longer!

565
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:13,053
Gentlemen, you all heard
my father this morning,

566
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:16,089
that the Guthrie trading operation
here in Nassau is dead.

567
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:19,393
<i>To that, I just</i>
<i>have this to add...</i>

568
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,895
fuck him and fuck that.

569
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,334
Mr. Frasier, you hold a charter from
the Massachusetts Bay Provincial Authority

570
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:29,636
to ship rare items abroad,
is that correct?

571
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:31,905
That's correct, yes.

572
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:34,341
And, theoretically, that charter
should pass muster

573
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,476
at any customshouse
in the colonies, yes?

574
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:40,180
Well, I suppose so, but...

575
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:43,383
Gentlemen, by my count,

576
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:45,285
the Black Hind and the Intrepid

577
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:47,954
have accumulated prizes
totaling approximately

578
00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:51,291
1,600 pieces of eight
since the new year.

579
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,195
That's gross.
That's both ships.

580
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:57,397
That barely exceeds your
operating costs over the same time.

581
00:39:57,465 --> 00:39:59,066
If you brought us here
to insult us...

582
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,101
It's not an insult, it's a fact.

583
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:03,937
You command the two least
profitable ships on the island

584
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,705
as a function
of basic arithmetic.

585
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:10,277
But they are ships,
and large ones at that.

586
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:13,346
At this table,
we have a legitimate front.

587
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:16,883
We have ships and crews
that can ferry heavy cargo.

588
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:19,653
We have relationships with
the merchants and customs men

589
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,421
that kept my father's
trade moving.

590
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:23,256
Your father said he'll take no part
in any further...

591
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:25,459
They're my relationships now.

592
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:32,099
We're going to recreate
my father's system here...

593
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,768
without my father.

594
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:37,771
A consortium, with all of you
sharing in the profits.

595
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:44,077
- You're mad.
- How so?

596
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:46,346
My men aren't merchant sailors.

597
00:40:46,414 --> 00:40:47,547
They're hunters.

598
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:50,317
Yes, but they're
bad at it, Geoffrey.

599
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:51,651
What good is that doing anyone?

600
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,453
I put this to them,
they'll vote me out

601
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:54,855
before I stop to take a breath.

602
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,723
I'm amazed they haven't
voted you out already,

603
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:59,292
given the shit prizes
you've been chasing.

604
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,995
Your men will earn three times
as much in half the time...

605
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:05,765
not facing a single sword
or pistol in the process.

606
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,534
You're telling me
that you can't sell that?

607
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:09,503
I can sell that.

608
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,377
And you're supporting this?

609
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,517
I don't know.
Am I?

610
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:24,885
None of this matters

611
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:27,220
unless we can get people
to agree to sell through us.

612
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:30,757
We need a respected captain
to stand up and bless it.

613
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:34,561
And we need a strong captain to
ensure that no one dares fuck with us.

614
00:41:34,629 --> 00:41:36,062
You're both.

615
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,933
You know that I want
nothing more

616
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,036
than to make this place
strong and stable.

617
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:46,606
I think you want
the same things.

618
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:49,042
Bless this endeavor
and we can have them.

619
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:52,012
I'll do that...

620
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:56,183
the moment you lift the ban
on Captain Vane.

621
00:41:57,418 --> 00:42:00,120
- Excuse me?
- Listen to that mob outside.

622
00:42:00,188 --> 00:42:02,556
They're tired of your edicts,
your rule by fear.

623
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,625
They believe you to be
a tyrant in a petticoat.

624
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:09,196
Your action against Captain Vane is,
to them, the most egregious case.

625
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,430
You want me to lift
the ban on Charles Vane

626
00:42:10,498 --> 00:42:12,458
to appease a handful
of malcontents on the street?

627
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:14,747
Those malcontents will be a problem
to anyone in this room

628
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,736
who stands behind you today.

629
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:19,139
<i>Provocation, even sabotage.</i>

630
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:21,274
And then you'll ask
my men to assume

631
00:42:21,342 --> 00:42:23,577
the responsibility
of defending all of you from it.

632
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:26,179
Charles Vane is an animal,
as are the men that remain with him.

633
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,127
Because they saw fit
to punish a thieving whore.

634
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:30,417
I'm not about to say otherwise
for the benefit of Captain Lilywhite

635
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,285
or any of the other idiots
out there listening to him.

636
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,254
I'm listening to him.

637
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,093
Your commitment
to this place is admirable,

638
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:43,496
but you're young
and you're rash.

639
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:46,066
<i>Show everyone your motive here</i>
<i>is for the common good.</i>

640
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,301
Show them that you
can be trusted

641
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:51,571
to keep petty animosity
separate from business.

642
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:55,508
Rescind the ban on Captain Vane
and show me that.

643
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,245
Do it and I'll back you
as your father's successor here,

644
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:00,680
the boss behind all trade.

645
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:03,750
<i>Until then, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I can't help you.</i>

646
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:06,119
I won't do it.

647
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:10,257
You have until dark
to come to your senses.

648
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:12,959
At that point,
I will withdraw my men

649
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:16,229
<i>and the business of the street</i>
<i>becomes your business alone.</i>

650
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:20,367
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

651
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:36,016
Ah!

652
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:38,985
<i>Oh, no! Get down!</i>

653
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:10,083
<i>Take this.</i>

654
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:11,751
Checked all
the dead and injured.

655
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,820
None of them are Bryson.

656
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:16,523
He only left three men
to defend the quarterdeck bunker.

657
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,558
How does that make sense?

658
00:44:18,626 --> 00:44:21,695
<i>The vanguard are on their way</i>
<i>to clear the cargo hold.</i>

659
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:24,798
<i>Maybe Bryson</i>
<i>is hiding down there.</i>

660
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:26,599
Something's not right.

661
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,569
Captain, the rudder's
not responding.

662
00:44:29,637 --> 00:44:32,238
Someone must've cut the mechanism
below decks.

663
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,343
Call back the vanguard.

664
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,804
Three men dead
on their end, Captain.

665
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,274
<i>Perhaps it's time</i>
<i>we sent them our terms.</i>

666
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,421
I do apologize for this.

667
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:59,826
<i>Mr. Guthrie's orders</i>
<i>were explicit.</i>

668
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:03,763
No matter what, I was to make sure
that you were on this ship.

669
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,865
This was not the deal.

670
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:11,638
Assist the Andromache
to depart unmolested

671
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:13,206
<i>and you can remain with the girl</i>

672
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:15,875
<i>and pick up the pieces</i>
<i>and explain yourself.</i>

673
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:21,347
<i>Mr. Scott, you sided with</i>
<i>his daughter against him.</i>

674
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:23,650
You forgot your duty.

675
00:46:23,717 --> 00:46:26,052
You must have known
there would be consequences.

676
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:32,192
But we men of duty must often
put our feelings aside...

677
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,361
as you're about to witness.

678
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:51,744
Do it.

679
00:46:57,618 --> 00:47:02,288
- And this one?
-

680
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:33,786
At the risk of overstepping
my bounds,

681
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:36,456
<i>I think you should agree</i>
<i>to Captain Hornigold's terms.</i>

682
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,828
Lift the ban.
What do you care about...

683
00:47:41,896 --> 00:47:43,530
They're beating her.

684
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,299
She chose it.

685
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:49,903
"She chose it"?

686
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:53,239
"She chose it."

687
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,174
I've been repeating
those words to myself

688
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:58,678
for well over a week now
and I find them wanting.

689
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:01,781
Now he asks me
to back off Charles,

690
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:04,951
to proclaim to the world that
what happened to Max is acceptable,

691
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,087
to apologize to those animals
for having ever said otherwise,

692
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:10,156
and smile while
they lord it over me.

693
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:13,927
To make a dangerous situation
a lot less dangerous.

694
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,298
Then convince me.

695
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:23,303
Convince me that I should betray her
a second time...

696
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:27,907
because that's what it feels like
I would be doing.

697
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,979
Max chose.

698
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:36,583
Why? I don't know.

699
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,820
Maybe it was spite,
maybe it was strength,

700
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:43,356
maybe it was
who the fuck knows what.

701
00:48:43,424 --> 00:48:45,858
To be perfectly honest,
I don't care

702
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:47,860
because the moment
I start making choices

703
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:49,762
based on her decisions,

704
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,332
I've given her a hell of a lot
more power over my life

705
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:55,068
than I am quite comfortable
ceding to a perfect stranger.

706
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:00,306
Guilt is natural.

707
00:49:01,508 --> 00:49:05,845
It also goes away if you let it.

708
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:10,183
<i>Losing your life's work...</i>

709
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,719
<i>that doesn't go away.</i>

710
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:16,823
No fucking longer!

711
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:20,059
Captain?

712
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,762
Charles?

713
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:27,266
Do I understand correctly
that you've requested a skiff?

714
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:29,435
I suppose that's
none of my business,

715
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:33,606
but you do realize that we may be able
to hunt again soon.

716
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:36,009
What I'm hearing
is all second and thirdhand,

717
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:39,746
but something is happening
in that tavern.

718
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,216
Our problem isn't in there.

719
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:44,984
Never was.

720
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:51,424
What the hell
are you talking about?

721
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:53,593
Chaz?

722
00:49:58,966 --> 00:50:00,933
Where are you going?

723
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:07,507
Where is he?

724
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:09,075
<i>He's in a reinforced hold</i>

725
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:10,576
<i>directly beneath us here.</i>

726
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:12,512
<i>Forward end</i>
<i>of the lower gundeck.</i>

727
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:16,215
Doors as thick as the outer hull,
as is the roof.

728
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:18,217
Impossible to breach from here.

729
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:21,187
<i>He's also sitting right in front of</i>
<i>a powder magazine,</i>

730
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:23,256
<i>so if we try to blow</i>
<i>our way through,</i>

731
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:25,758
<i>this whole ship</i>
<i>is going down fast.</i>

732
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,326
Unless we can find a way in,

733
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:29,429
there's no way to get the guns
off the boat.

734
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:32,598
<i>Anybody we send down there is just</i>
<i>gonna get cut to shreds.</i>

735
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:35,702
And we cannot sail.

736
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:37,303
And we cannot sail.

737
00:50:39,006 --> 00:50:40,606
It doesn't make sense.

738
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,278
If Bryson wants
to force us to withdraw,

739
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:48,247
what's to stop me from burning the ship
once we leave?

740
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:53,519
We're missing something.

741
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,501
There you are.

742
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:12,572
Been looking all over for you.

743
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:15,241
Thought I'd get a head start
going through Bryson's papers.

744
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:21,447
Jameson.

745
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:24,117
Beg your pardon?

746
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:27,386
You said no man ever died
his first time over the side,

747
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:30,256
but you forgot
about Tom Jameson,

748
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:33,292
boatswain's mate,
about two years back.

749
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,128
That's right.

750
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:39,699
Also Christian Thoms,
Will Robbins, Jean DuBois,

751
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,768
that Portuguese guy
with the lisp...

752
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:44,370
what was his name?

753
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,606
That is funny.

754
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:49,142
Thank you...

755
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,643
for doing that.

756
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,347
It helped.

757
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:06,859
Miranda Barlow?

758
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,168
<i>Away from the hatch!</i>

759
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:16,969
<i>Everyone!</i>

760
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:38,191
Captain Flint.

761
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,775
He says, "I'm secure
in the hold below."

762
00:53:02,216 --> 00:53:07,019
"With 20 of my men.
I can wait, but you cannot."

763
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:16,262
"Before departing,

764
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:19,532
I sent a message to the captain
of the Scarborough.

765
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,767
I told him where I was headed,

766
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:24,837
and I told him
where he would find you."

767
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:27,773
<i>Sail to the east!</i>

768
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:33,813
Good God.

769
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,781
<i>The Scarborough!</i>

770
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:40,386
<i>Look out!</i>
