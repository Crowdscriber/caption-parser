00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:38,581
between 10 and 1 AM, out back?

489
00:32:38,614 --> 00:32:41,517
No, no, but, uh,

490
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,085
sometimes they, uh,
dove-hunt out there.

491
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:46,588
They found a woman?

492
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,723
MAN: Is it the Fontenot girl?

493
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,154
Who?

494
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,924
- And why would you ask that?
- Don't know.

495
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:56,460
Went missing
around here years back.

496
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,565
Last time something happened.

497
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,564
Just thought maybe it's her.

498
00:33:00,597 --> 00:33:02,563
How old was she, this girl?

499
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,740
I don't know.
Little.

500
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,076
You know where
the family lives?

501
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,243
[Distant train whistle blowing]

502
00:33:18,652 --> 00:33:22,249
Had a place
couple streets down.

503
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,628
They moved out, though.

504
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:29,194
COHLE: Do you know the Fontenot
girl, one went missing?

505
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:31,160
MAN: Her?

506
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:33,663
Her family come to our service

507
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,167
once or twice,
5 or 6 years back.

508
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,031
Is that the girl?
Oh, Lord.

509
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:41,601
HART: No, sir,
it's not.

510
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:44,073
Excuse me.

511
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,946
I want to ask y'all
something. Y'all think

512
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:49,177
maybe this have something
to do with those cats?

513
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,650
What cats?

514
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,651
Two of 'em-- one,
and a couple

515
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:54,156
of weeks later, another.

516
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,653
Somebody cut 'em up,

517
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:57,661
turned their insides out,
then nailed them

518
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:59,360
to the front door, twice.

519
00:33:59,393 --> 00:34:01,799
MINISTER: Now, I called
and told the police,

520
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,831
but we're predominantly African
American congregation.

521
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:07,602
I asked for it
to be investigated.

522
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:11,212
We're not those type
of police, sir.

523
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:14,116
Well, who is, then?

524
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,617
Can I ask you something?

525
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,289
Any of these look
familiar to you?

526
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:28,287
- Seen them anywheres?
- No.

527
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,292
No, they look like
something that might be

528
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:32,292
carved into a tree
or something.

529
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:34,365
Mm-hmm.
How about these?

530
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,364
Now, that look like
something my old auntie

531
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:39,531
taught us how to make
when I was a tyke.

532
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:41,698
COHLE:
What are they?

533
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,203
Some folks call them
bird traps.

534
00:34:44,236 --> 00:34:47,003
Old Auntie told us that
they were devil nets.

535
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:50,339
You put them around the bed, catch
the devil before he get too close.

536
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,306
That's interesting.

537
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:54,744
- Hmm.
- She was a wonderful woman.

538
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:57,814
Loved her some Jesus,
but had a bit

539
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,811
of that Santeria
in her, you know?

540
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:02,809
I always just thought
it was something

541
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:05,051
for children to do,
keep 'em busy,

542
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:09,520
tell them stories why
they're tying sticks together.

543
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,292
SHERIFF TATE: Then that's all
we got on the Fontenot girl.

544
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:14,292
COHLE: There was
nothing in there.

545
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:16,828
Says, "Possible
report made in error."

546
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,230
Now, that was 5 years ago.

547
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:20,198
Ted Childress was
sheriff back then.

548
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,699
He's set up in Gulf Shores
now, I think.

549
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:25,169
HART: Ten-year-old girl goes missing
and that doesn't go state-wide?

550
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,170
TATE: Now, hold on now.
My understanding,

551
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:29,173
the little girl went off
with her birth daddy.

552
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,212
Now, did you check
her mom's record?

553
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,644
Possession, solicitation.

554
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:36,284
I believe Ted knew the family,
and the feeling was

555
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,284
the little girl was
better off with her daddy.

556
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,083
Mom seemed to agree;
she filed a complaint,

557
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:43,089
then never bothered
with it again,

558
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:44,921
took off with her boyfriend.

559
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:47,423
R&I said you had
a complaint these parts

560
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:49,424
around December--
little girl

561
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,424
getting chased
through the woods.

562
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:54,598
TATE: Oh, yeah, I pulled
that one for you, too.

563

Little girl said
a green-eared spaghetti monster

566
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:09,313
chased her through some woods.

567
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:12,185
Now, we had her work
with a sketch artist,

568
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,283
and she told us
that looked exactly right.

569
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:18,460
Now, you want to call an APB
on that, you go right ahead.

off on that for a while?

why don't you get it, then?

574

We really don't want
to do that.

575
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:36,642
Well, is this supposed
to be admissible? Huh?

If you want to pick
my brain, work a room,

you buy me a cheeseburger
and a Coke, don't you?

578
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:47,682
I'll take a sixer
of Old Milwaukee

579
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:49,722
or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

580
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,089
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

581
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:55,655
'Cause it's Thursday
and it's past noon.

Thursday is one of my days off.

Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

She called up here
for you not too long ago.

00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,785
I don't need no
snitch jacket up in here.

645

[Scoffs]
Give me a break.

646
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:52,822
This is Avoyelles.

647
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,360
It's a goddamn day camp.

648
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,098
Spend some time in Angola.

649
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:01,029
Surprised you even got
Aryan Nation here.

650
00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:05,205
What'd Dori do?

651
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:10,575
Dori's dead.

652

COHLE VOICE-OVER:
Thank you, boys.

653
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,116
We almost had a moment there.

654
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,995
Mmm.

655
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:33,396
So you want to talk the whole
case through or just the end?

656
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,332
No, whole story

657
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:36,731
from your end, you don't mind.

658

Hurricane Rita.

660
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:47,977
What he didn't say is that this
is about something else.

661
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,481
Something new. That one
in Lake Charles, maybe?

662
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,153
Now, why you say that?

663
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:56,690
Get the details
out of the paper.

664
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:58,661
Yeah, we did.

665
00:40:58,694 --> 00:41:01,523
You know anything about that,
about Lake Charles?

666
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,092
[Inhales deeply]
Well, let me see

what you got, jog my memory.

668
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,767
Well, let's hear
your story first,

669
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:11,941

with what we got.

670
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:16,109
Well, your dime, boss.

671
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,541
Talking Cohle,
what about that dinner

672
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,075
you mentioned,
he turn up drunk?

673
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:23,082
HART: Oh. Yeah.

674
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,544
Well, ahem.

675
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:27,984
That dinner,
that was a bit later.

676
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:30,585
[Chuckles]
It was kind of funny.

677
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,089
The flowers, you know?

678
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:36,055
Like, he read somewhere that
if you get invited to dinner,

679
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:38,559
you're supposed
to bring flowers?

680

The hell?

00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,130
You can barely stand up.

682
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:45,095
What is it?

683
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,537
You don't drink
with me or the boys,

684
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,369
and you got to get a load on

685
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,209
before you visit my family?

686
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,776
No, Marty, it's not like that.

687
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,311
And I didn't mean to,

688
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:58,447
all right?

689
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:02,286
And I don't drink
'cause I've had trouble

690
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,453
with it before;
I didn't mean to.

691
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:10,297
I was checking on a CI.

692
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,465
I ended up hanging
around a bar.

693
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,801
I was sitting there.

694
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,967
I couldn't think
of a good reason not to.

695
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:24,100
Usually I can.

HART:
Have some more coffee

699
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:36,551
and just try to make 10
minutes of conversation.

700
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:38,288
You got it.

701
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:41,055
I'll call Chris or somebody,

702
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:43,190

I'm sorry, man.

Forget it.

706

so nice to finally meet you.

Sorry it took so long.

Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

I said that your life's

711
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,453
in this man's hands, right?

712
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:23,925
Of course you should
meet the family.

713
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,927
Well, not quite
as dramatic as that, hon.

I've never fired my gun.

Yes.

he ended it. I mean...
