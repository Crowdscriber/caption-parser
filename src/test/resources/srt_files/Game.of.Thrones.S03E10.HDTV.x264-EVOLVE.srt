1
00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:03,774
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

2
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:07,161
Reject this gift and I shall
show you no mercy.

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:10,014
- You are mad.
- It was just as you said.

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,567
Their slave soldiers threw down
their spears and surrendered.

5
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:17,126
<i>- The bitch stays.</i>
- I'm taking her to King's Landing.

6
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:19,778
Unless you kill me.

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,624
Well, we must be on our way.

8
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:24,736
- Please.
- I'm not killing you.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,187
Just making a few
alterations.

10
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:28,593
No! Don't!

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,738
The Nightfort's closest
to Castle Black.

12
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,988
It's got a secret
sally port,

13
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:35,200
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

14
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:38,316
It leads through the Wall
right down into the Nightfort.

15
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:41,033
- Stop.
- But your father--

16
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:44,383
I won't share your bed.
Not until you want me to.

17
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:46,227
What if I never
want you to?

18
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,605
And so my watch begins.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,631
He's a crow. He'll stab us in
the back first chance he gets.

20
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:55,908
Kill him.

21
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:58,489
The wolves are out there.
You're a warg, Bran.

22
00:00:58,524 --> 00:00:59,895
<i>Do it.</i>

23
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:13,729
I'm going beyond the Wall.
It won't be safe for Rickon.

24
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,104
I'm coming with you.

25
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,218
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

26
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:20,294
- She's going to kill him.
- Sacrifice him.

27
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,532
<i>The boy is your nephew.</i>

28
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,875
The usurper Robb Stark.

29
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,555
<i>She says there's power</i>
<i>in king's blood.</i>

30
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,263
Got salt pork
for the feast.

31
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,772
The feast is over.

32
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:31,910
Robb!

33
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,023
Mother.

34
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:37,735
The Lannisters send their regards.

35
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:41,185
It's too late.

<i>- Go, move out!</i>
<i>-  The King in the North!</i>

The King in the North!
The King in the North!

The King in the North!
The King in the North!

Here comes
the King in the North!

44
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,335
Here comes the King

<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!</i>

46

Here comes...

47
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,698
Hmm.

48
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,334
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

49
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:23,802
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

50
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,403
What are you doing?

51
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,305
I have a list.

52
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,373
A list of people
you mean to kill?

53
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:30,674
For laughing at me?

54
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,810
Do I look like
Joffrey to you?

55
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,778
No, death seems
a bit extreme.

56
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:36,879
Fear of death,
on the other hand...

57
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,481
You should learn
to ignore them.

58
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,650
My lady, people have
been laughing at me

59
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,485
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

60
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,453
I'm the Halfman,

61
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,522
the Demon Monkey,
the Imp.

62
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,090
You're a Lannister.

63
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:51,660
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

64
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:54,428
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

65
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:56,796
We're perfect for each other.

66
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,968
So how should
we punish them?

67
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,603
Who? Whom?

68
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:06,672
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

69
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,340
Ah.

70
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:11,810
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

71
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:15,313
Anyone named Desmond
Crakehall must be a pervert.

72
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,782
I hear that
you're a pervert.

73
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,083
I am the Imp.

74
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,851
I have certain standards
to maintain.

75
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:26,356
We could sheep shift
Lord Desmond's bed.

76
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,192
You cut a little hole
in his mattress

77
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:31,060
and you stuff
sheep dung inside.

78
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:33,962
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

79
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:36,898
His room will stink, but he won't
know where it's coming from.

80
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,433
Lady Sansa!

81
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,902
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

82
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,437
And she was always
angry with me.

83
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,539
Why sheep <i>shift?</i>

84
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:48,975
That's the vulgar word
for dung.

85
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,944
My lady...

86
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,279
Well, you asked me.

87
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,680
Oh!

88
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,282
That's him!

89
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,417
My lord, my lady.

90
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,753
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

91
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,163
Killed a few
puppies today?

92
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,131
Show him.

93
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,133
Come on, show him.

94
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,406
Oh, apologies, my lord.

95
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,375
Old fingers.

96
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,552
"Roslin caught
a fine fat trout.

97
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:39,589
<i>Her brothers gave her</i>
<i>a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.</i>

98
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:42,425
<i>Signed Walder Frey."</i>

99
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:46,161
Is that bad poetry

100
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,296
or is it supposed
to mean something?

101
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:50,131
Robb Stark is dead.

102
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,467
<i>And his bitch mother.</i>

103
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,336
Write back to Lord Frey.

104
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:59,039
<i>Thank him for his service</i>
<i>and command him</i>

105
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,775
to send Robb Stark's head.

106
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:05,011
I'm going to serve it to Sansa
at my wedding feast.

107
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:08,580
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

108
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,149
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.

109
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:12,784
Yes, I did.

110
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:15,653
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

111
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,221
<i>No.</i>

112
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:19,790
She is no longer
yours to torment.

113
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:23,593
Everyone is mine
to torment.

114
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,863
You'd do well to remember that,
you little monster.

115
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,731
Oh, I'm a monster.

116
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:33,300
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

117
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,636
<i>Monsters are dangerous</i>

118
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,672
and just now kings
are dying like flies.

119
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,214
I could have
your tongue out

120
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,748
<i>for saying that.</i>

121
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:53,684
Let him make his threats.

122
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:56,787
Hmm? He's a bitter
little man.

123
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:59,923
Lord Tyrion should
apologize immediately.

124
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,992
Unacceptable,
disrespectful,

125
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:05,160
<i>and in very bad taste.</i>

126
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,996
I am the king!

127
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,564
I will punish you.

128
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:12,099
Any man who must say,
"I am the king"

129
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,768
is no true king.

130
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,703
I'll make sure
you understand that

131
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,271
when I've won
your war for you.

132
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,974
My father won
the real war.

133
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:24,077
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown

134
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,880
while you hid
under Casterly Rock!

135
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,493
The king is tired.

136
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:43,695
See him to his chambers.

137
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,964
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

138
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,700
We have so much
to celebrate.

139
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,802
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.

140
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,674
Grand Maester, perhaps
some essence of nightshade

141
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,176
to help him sleep.

142
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,611
I'm not tired!

143
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,047
Come.

144
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,298
Not you.

145
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:37,872
You just sent the most
powerful man in Westeros

146
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:40,241
to bed without his supper.

147
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:43,944
You're a fool if you believe he's
the most powerful man in Westeros.

148
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,879
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is king.

149
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,849
You really think a crown
gives you power?

150
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,452
No.

151
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,287
I think armies
give you power.

152
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,123
- Mm-hmm.
- Robb Stark had one,

153
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,091
never lost a battle,

154
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:03,360
and you defeated him
all the same.

155
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:06,562
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.

156
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:09,531
Walder Frey
gets all the credit.

157
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,466
Or the blame,
I suppose,

158
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,367
depending on
your allegiance.

159
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,637
<i>Walder Frey</i>
<i>is many things,</i>

160
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,771
but a brave man?

161
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,173
No.

162
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:23,542
He never would have
risked such an action

163
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:26,078
if he didn't have
certain assurances.

164
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,847
Which he got from me.

165
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,782
Do you disapprove?

166
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,851
<i>I'm all for cheating.</i>
<i>This is war.</i>

167
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:35,053
But to slaughter them
at a wedding...

168
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:37,788
Explain to me
why it is more noble

169
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,890
to kill 10,000 men
in battle

170
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,225
than a dozen at dinner.

171
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,260
So that's why you did it?

172
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:44,962
To save lives?

173
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,998
To end the war.
To protect the family.

174
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,900
<i>Do you want to write a song</i>
<i>for the dead Starks?</i>

175
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:53,769
Go ahead, write one.

176
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:57,339
<i>I'm in this world</i>
<i>a little while longer</i>

177
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:01,143
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

178
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:03,779
The northerners
will never forget.

179
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,180
Good.

180
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:06,882
Let them remember
what happens

181
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,251
when they march
on the south.

182
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:13,989
All the Stark men
are dead.

183
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:16,858
Winterfell is a ruin.

184
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:20,761
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

185
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:25,765
until your son by Sansa
comes of age.

186
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:32,270
I believe you still have some
work to do on that score.

187
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,773
Do you think she'll open
her legs for me

188
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:40,210
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

189
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:43,579
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

190
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:46,115
I will not rape her.

191
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:50,552
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

192
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:53,688
Use small words.
I'm not as bright as you.

193
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:56,758
The house that puts family
first will always defeat

194
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,193
the house that puts
the whims and wishes

195
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:02,462
<i>of its sons</i>
<i>and daughters first.</i>

196
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,898
A good man does
everything in his power

197
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:08,100
to better
his family's position

198
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:11,670
regardless of his own
selfish desires.

199
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
Does that amuse you?

200
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,743
No, it's a very
good lesson.

201
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:23,079
Only it's easy for you to
preach utter devotion to family

202
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,714
when you're making
all the decisions.

203
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,616
Easy for me, is it?

204
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,919
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

205
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:33,287
but solely for the benefit
of the family?

206
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:36,156
The day
that you were born.

207
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,495
I wanted to carry you
into the sea

208
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,830
and let the waves
wash you away.

209
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,633
Instead, I let you live.

210
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:53,202
And I brought you up
as my son.

211
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,007
Because you're a Lannister.

212
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,324
Sansa.

213
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,951
It's empty.

214
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:48,619
Let's find
a place to sleep.

215
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,329
Hodor.

216
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,232
Hodor.

217
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,968
Don't, Hodor.

218
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,173
Maybe we shouldn't
stay here.

219
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,842
You'd rather
be out there?

220
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,811
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

221
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,546
Horrible stories.

222
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,715
I always quite liked
the horrible stories.

223
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,017
So did I.

224
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,885
Once.

225
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,156
You ever heard
about the Rat Cook?

226
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,424
No.
Who's he?

227
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,627
Just a cook
in the Night's Watch.

228
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:39,096
He was angry at the king
for something,

229
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,031
I don't remember.

230
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,833
When the king was visiting
the Nightfort,

231
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:46,368
the cook killed
the king's son,

232
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,303
cooked him
into a big pie

233
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:51,840
with onions, carrots,
mushrooms and bacon.

234
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:55,843
That night he served
the pie to the king.

235
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:58,579
He liked the taste
of his son so much,

236
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:01,014
he asked for
a second slice.

237
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:06,218
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

238
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,653
<i>who could only eat</i>
<i>his own young.</i>

239
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:11,956
<i>He's been roaming</i>
<i>the Nightfort ever since,</i>

240
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,292
<i>devouring his own babies.</i>

241
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,462
But no matter
what he does,

242
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:20,464
he's always hungry.

243
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,767
If the gods turned
every killer

244
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:25,135
into a giant white rat--

245
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,436
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

246
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,805
<i>or for serving</i>
<i>the king's son in a pie.</i>

247
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,174
He killed a guest
beneath his roof.

248
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:36,611
That's something
the gods can't forgive.

249
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:47,954
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

250
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:51,657
because I didn't get my men to
the Trident in time for battle.

251
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:53,993
<i>He thought he was witty.</i>

252
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:56,228
<i>Look at us now, Tully.</i>

253
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,265
<i>You're dead,</i>
<i>your daughter's dead,</i>

254
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:00,866
your grandson's dead,

255
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:04,069
your son spent his wedding
night in a dungeon

256
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,905
and I'm Lord
of Riverrun.

257
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,609
The Blackfish escaped.

258
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,312
An old man on the run

259
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,782
<i>with no allies.</i>

260
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,817
I have Tywin Lannister
backing me.

261
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:21,853
- Who does he have?
- As you say.

262
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,521
<i>They all laughed at me,</i>

263
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,489
all those high lords.

264
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,558
They all thought
they were better than me.

265
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:31,327
Ned Stark,
Hoster Tully.

266
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:34,897
People snigger
when I marry a young girl,

267
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:38,300
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

268
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,369
You'll be needing
a new young girl.

269
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:42,504
Yeah.

270
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:45,206
Got that
to look forward to.

271
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:48,042
<i>And you,</i>

272
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:50,244
the Warden
of the North.

273
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,580
<i>No more Starks</i>
<i>to bow and scrape to.</i>

274
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,282
Must have been torture

275
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,384
following that stupid boy
all over the country.

276
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:00,587
He ignored my advice
at every turn.

277
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,656
If he'd been a trifle
less arrogant...

278
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,191
Calling himself
the Young Wolf.

279
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,959
How's that for pomposity?

280
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,863
Well, here's to
the Young Wolf!

281
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:14,632
Forever young.

282
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:23,039
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

283
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,574
At some point perhaps.

284
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,776
But Winterfell's in ruins.

285
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,611
Yeah.

286
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,446
What happened up there?

287
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,515
I heard the Greyjoy boy
seized the place.

288
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,084
I heard he killed
all the ravens.

289
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,586
And after that, nothing.

290
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,589
I sent my bastard Ramsay
to root him out.

291
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,126
Robb Stark offered
amnesty for the ironborn

292
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,994
if they gave us Theon.

293
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,996
Oh. And?

294
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,597
<i>Ramsay delivered</i>
<i>the terms.</i>

295
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,767
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

296
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,970
<i>They handed him over</i>
<i>trussed and hooded.</i>

297
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:04,073
<i>But Ramsay-- well...</i>

298
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,709
<i>Ramsay has his own way</i>
<i>of doing things.</i>

299
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,645
Well, the girls
weren't lying.

300
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,580
You had
a good-sized cock.

301
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:21,721
What?

302
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:23,156
No.

303
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:27,894
Pork sausage.

304
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:30,262
You think I'm some
sort of savage?

305
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:45,308
People talk about
phantom limbs.

306
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:48,677
<i>An amputee might have an itch</i>
<i>where his foot used to be.</i>

307
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:51,046
<i>So I've always wondered...</i>

308
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:57,519
do eunuchs
have a phantom cock?

309
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:01,556
<i>Next time you think</i>
<i>about naked girls,</i>

310
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,125
would you feel an itch?

311
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:14,067
Sorry.

312
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,003
I shouldn't make jokes.

313
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:21,574
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

314
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:28,680
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

315
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,782
Kill me.

316
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:32,717
Sorry, what?

317
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:35,853
Kill me.

318
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:39,122
A little louder.

319
00:20:39,157 --> 00:20:42,192
Kill me!

320
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:46,128
You're no good
to me dead.

321
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,597
We need you.

322
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:12,052
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

323
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,620
That's a name
for a lord.

324
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,890
But you're not a lord,

325
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,158
are you?

326
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:24,061
You're just meat.

327
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:29,498
Stinking meat.

328
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:35,003
You reek.

329
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,806
Reek!

330
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,041
That's a good name
for you.

331
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,845
What's your name?

332
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,114
Theon Greyjoy.

333
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,287
What's your name?

334
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,157
Th--

335
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,659
Theon Greyjoy.

336
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:07,900
Please.

337
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:12,938
What is your name?!

338
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,940
Reek.

339
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:20,811
My name is...

340
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:24,747
Reek.

341
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,073
Hodor.

342
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,637
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

343
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,373
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

344
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,309
Gilly.
Don't hurt us.

345
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:34,110
Where are you going?

346
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:37,680
To Castle Black. I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

347
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:40,015
- My brother, he's in the Night's--
- Shush.

348
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:41,783
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

349
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,159
You're Jon's brother.

350
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,127
<i>The one who fell</i>
<i>from the window.</i>

351
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,295
No, I'm not.

352
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:01,866
I've been around Ghost enough to
know a direwolf when I see one.

353
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,034
And I've heard
all about Hodor.

354
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,936
Hodor.

355
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,041
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jon.

356
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,109
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

357
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:15,478
And anything I can do
to help you, I will.

358
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:17,881
Take us north
of the Wall.

359
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:24,521
What?

360
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:26,489
Why in the world
would you want to go--

361
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:28,858
I don't want to.
I have to.

362
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:30,660
How did you get
through the Wall?

363
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:33,596
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

364
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,065
Come with us.

365
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,969
There are steps carved into
the south side of the Wall.

366
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,570
Hodor can carry you
to the top.

367
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:43,671
We'll walk straight
to Castle Black.

368
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:47,141
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

369
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:49,543
<i>If Jon is alive,</i>

370
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:51,245
<i>then Castle Black's</i>
<i>where he'll be.</i>

371
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,213
It's the safest place
for you.

372
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,881
There's nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.

373
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:59,451
What I know
is what I saw.

374
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,486
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

375
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,956
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

376
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:07,424
How do you know
all that?

377
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,992
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

378
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:13,629
The kings of Westeros and all
their armies can't stop them.

379
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:24,839
But you're going
to stop them?

380
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:27,508
Please, Sam.

381
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:29,577
<i>I have to go north.</i>

382
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:33,013
I have to.

383
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,204
"Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands

384
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:06,506
and invader of the North.

385
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,507
I give you
until the full moon

386
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:11,810
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

387
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:14,880
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks</i>

388
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:17,082
<i>you call a home.</i>

389
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:19,984
<i>On the first night</i>
<i>of the full moon,</i>

390
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:22,487
<i>I will hunt down</i>
<i>every islander</i>

391
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:27,057
still in our lands
and flay them living

392
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:30,560
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

393
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,395
I found at Winterfell.

394
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,032
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

395
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,169
Theon's favorite toy.

396
00:26:40,203 --> 00:26:43,538
He cried when I took it
away from him.

397
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,893
Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

398
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,495
with more Theon.

399
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,830
Signed Ramsay Snow,

400
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,497
natural-born son
of Roose Bolton,

401
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,500
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

402
00:27:20,504 --> 00:27:22,705
Get that
out of my sight.

403
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,979
Theon disobeyed
my orders.

404
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,852
The boy is a fool.

405
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:43,524
He cannot further
the Greyjoy line.

406
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:48,228
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

407
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,430
the strongholds
I have taken.

408
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:52,232
Get this away from me.

409
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,668
He's your son.

410
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:57,537
Son?

411
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:00,339
He's not
a man anymore.

412
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,941
He's your son.

413
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:05,444
He's my brother.

414
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:06,711
He's a Greyjoy.

415
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:08,980
Watch yourself.

416
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:11,348
I've made
my decision.

417
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:18,420
And I've made mine.

418
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,592
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

419
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:30,196
<i>I'm going to choose</i>
<i>the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.</i>

420
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:32,832
Get those ropes!

421
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,733
<i>I'm going to sail</i>
<i>up the Narrow Sea</i>

422
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,101
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the Weeping Water.</i>

423
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:41,439
<i>I'm going to march</i>
<i>on the Dreadfort.</i>

424
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:44,207
<i>I'm going to find</i>
<i>my little brother</i>

425
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:47,144
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to bring him home.</i>

426
00:28:52,783 --> 00:28:54,417
What is it?

427
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,985
Dragonglass.

428
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,887
We found them
at the Fist.

429
00:28:57,921 --> 00:29:01,423
Someone buried them
a long time ago.

430
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,592
Someone wanted us
to find them.

431
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:07,462
Why?
What are they for?

432
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,668
Killing white walkers.

433
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:15,136
How do you know that?

434
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,805
<i>The walker came</i>
<i>for my baby.</i>

435
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:20,207
And Sam...

436
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:23,443
But no one's killed a white
walker in thousands of years.

437
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:27,446
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

438
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,648
Take it, Hodor.

439
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,222
And the archer.

440
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,297
I got lucky

441
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:48,566
with one of them.

442
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,234
There are more.

443
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,837
<i>Many more.</i>

444
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:56,372
And for every one of them,

445
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:58,908
the dead men,

446
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:00,843
more than you
could count.

447
00:30:04,347 --> 00:30:06,548
I wish you'd come
with us.

448
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:09,050
I wish I could.

449
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,754
I really do.

450
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:02,930
How are you keeping?

451
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,764
Great.

452
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,265
Never better.

453
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,868
It was just
a bit of blood.

454
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,704
I should have known.

455
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:14,306
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

456
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,141
We're not really people
to you, are we?

457
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,977
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

458
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,678
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

459
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,581
I heard it.

460
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,117
A recent state
of affairs.

461
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:35,123
I was born in Flea Bottom
just like you.

462
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,325
Sure, you were.

463
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,159
You're my friend.
You're here to help.

464
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,127
I lived below
the Street of Flour.

465
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:42,562
<i>How far below?</i>

466
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,763
How close to the
Red Keep were you?

467
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:48,633
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

468
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:52,403
<i>flowed down the side</i>
<i>of Aegon's Hill</i>

469
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:56,472
along Tanner's Row and right
in front of my front door

470
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:58,641
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

471
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,277
The Street of Steel,

472
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,614
with your armor and your knights?
Pfft.

473
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:09,082
You lived in the fancy
part of town.

474
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:15,922
And here we are now.

475
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:19,526
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

476
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,028
Yeah, we've come
a long way.

477
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:25,364
We're all
the same, really.

478
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:28,334
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

479
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:30,670
If you mistrust
fancy people so much,

480
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:33,840
why were you in such a
hurry to trust her?

481
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,610
You're me.

482
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:39,078
Never been with a woman.

483
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:41,848
<i>Never talked</i>
<i>to a woman, really.</i>

484
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:43,449
<i>And then she</i>
<i>comes at you--</i>

485
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:46,585
big words, no clothes.

486
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,387
What would you have done?

487
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:53,691
She does know her way around a
man's head, I'll give her that.

488
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,099
So how'd you
become a lord?

489
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:03,733
Oh, that's a long story.

490
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:06,869
Better not, then.
I'm a bit busy.

491
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:12,041
Many years ago
I helped King Stannis

492
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,577
out of a difficult
situation.

493
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:17,913
He rewarded me
with a lordship.

494
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:20,216
And this.

495
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:24,319
You see?

496
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:26,521
Highborns.

497
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:32,594
I didn't want
to be a lord.

498
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,429
I nearly didn't accept.

499
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:35,897
Why did you?

500
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,900
I did it for my son.

501
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,368
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

502
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:43,903
every time he stepped
through his front door.

503
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,640
I wanted him to have
a better life.

504
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:51,210
Does he?

505
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,180
He's dead.

506
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:01,219
How'd he die?

507
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:04,588
Following me.

508
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,865
When did you come
to this strange country?

509
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:22,102
When I was 13.

510
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,070
You were only a child.

511
00:34:25,238 --> 00:34:27,673
I stopped being a child
when I was nine.

512
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,442
My mother
made sure of that.

513
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:33,979
You've been
a good influence

514
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:36,314
on our mutual friend,
you know.

515
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,383
He used to drink
from sundown to sunup,

516
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,017
visit three brothels
a night,

517
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:42,586
gamble away
his father's money.

518
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:44,588
Now it's just
the drinking.

519
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:47,958
And now
I'm his wife's servant.

520
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:49,926
I brush her hair
and clip her nails

521
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,427
and empty
her chamber pot.

522
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,929
She is a sweet
young thing.

523
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:54,430
None of this
is her fault.

524
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:57,399
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.

525
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,367
Do you think that
makes it easier for me?

526
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:02,470
No, I expect not.

527
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:08,276
She's young and she's
beautiful and highborn.

528
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,077
We break bread
with them,

529
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:12,713
but that doesn't
make us family.

530
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:14,182
We've learned
their language,

531
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,751
but we'll never be
their countrymen.

532
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:21,488
If you let yourself believe

533
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,724
that a foreign girl
with no name

534
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:26,092
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister--

535
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:28,895
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

536
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,463
As do I.

537
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:33,499
Here only the family
name matters.

538
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,768
What do you want
from me, Lord Varys?

539
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,174
Diamonds.

540
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:44,143
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

541
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:46,545
but you know how
to protect yourself.

542
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:49,214
Get on one
of those ships.

543
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:52,017
Sail to Pentos
or Lys or Myr.

544
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:55,187
You can buy a house
with these diamonds,

545
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,189
a very large house.

546
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,057
Hire servants.

547
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:00,492
Start a new life,

548
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:03,028
a good life,
far from here.

549
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:06,130
The mysterious
foreign beauty.

550
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,166
You'll have suitors
lining up.

551
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,467
Why do you
want me to leave?

552
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,103
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

553
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,205
who could make this country
a better place.

554
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,940
He has the mind for it,
he has the will,

555
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,407
he has the right
last name.

556
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,542
And you--

557
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:23,712
you are a complication.

558
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,147
I know you love him.

559
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:31,117
And I know it's true love not
bought by gold and silver.

560
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:33,686
I'm not asking you
to leave him for money.

561
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,288
I'm asking you to leave

562
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,324
because your presence
in the capital

563
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:41,726
endangers him.

564
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:45,362
This will never
be your home, my lady.

565
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:49,232
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

566
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:52,768
while there's still time.

567
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:56,572
Lord Varys.

568
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:03,544
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

569
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:13,551
Keep up.

570
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:16,253
I don't think
I can, my lord.

571
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:20,756
It's not easy
being drunk all the time.

572
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:25,227
Everyone would do it
if it were easy.

573
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:29,697
Leave.

574
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,341
So, enjoying
married life?

575
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:49,847
An unhappy wife is a wine
merchant's best friend.

576
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,248
She doesn't
deserve this.

577
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:53,783
Deserve?

578
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:56,719
Be careful with that.

579
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:59,955
Start trying to work out
who deserves what

580
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,390
and before long you'll spend
the rest of your days

581
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:05,660
weeping for each and every
person in the world.

582
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:09,296
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.

583
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,966
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

584
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,135
with the same
philosophical spirit?

585
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,737
I won't be marrying
Ser Loras.

586
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:20,606
I seem to remember
saying something similar

587
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,607
about my own marriage.

588
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:24,910
You're not me.

589
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:28,045
You want to make things
better for Sansa?

590
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,814
Give her a child.

591
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,815
So you can tell Father
it was you

592
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,050
who finally
talked me into it?

593
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:37,186
So she can have
some happiness in her life.

594
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:38,922
You have children.

595
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:42,058
How happy would
you say you are?

596
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,662
Not very.

597
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,567
But if it weren't
for my children,

598
00:38:51,602 --> 00:38:54,470
I'd have thrown myself from the
highest window in the Red Keep.

599
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,874
They're the reason
I'm alive.

600
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,976
Even Joffrey?

601
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,878
Even Joffrey.

602
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,982
He was all I had once.

603
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,651
Before Myrcella was born.

604
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:18,757
I used to spend hours

605
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,225
looking at him.

606
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,360
His wisps of hair.

607
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,129
His tiny little
hands and feet.

608
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,700
He was such
a jolly little fellow.

609
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:36,938
You always hear the terrible
ones were terrible babies.

610
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:39,740
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

611
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:41,874
It's nonsense.

612
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:46,212
Whenever he was with me,
he was happy.

613
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:51,884
And no one can take that
away from me,

614
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:53,685
not even Joffrey--

615
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:56,320
how it feels
to have someone.

616
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,823
Someone of your own.

617
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:12,166
How long
does it go on?

618
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:17,238
Until we've dealt
with all our enemies.

619
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,541
Every time we deal
with an enemy,

620
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:23,643
we create two more.

621
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:28,547
Then I suppose it will go
on for quite a long time.

622
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:35,919
I'm telling you,
that's what she did.

623
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:41,222
<i>Sounded like</i>
<i>a cow in heat.</i>

624
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:43,691
- Aye, not for long.
- That's right.

625
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:45,893
Black Walder
shut her up right quick.

626
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:49,129
<i>None of the Starks had much to
say about the end of that meal.</i>

627
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,697
I'll tell you what,
though.

628
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:54,033
The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.

629
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,569
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

630
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:59,705
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

631
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:01,473
It was me.

632
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:04,443
And Malcolm
and Talbott.

633
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:07,212
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

634
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:08,813
Took the skin
right with it.

635
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:11,816
<i>What we ended up having to do</i>
<i>was hook the needle</i>

636
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:13,418
<i>right under</i>
<i>the collarbone.</i>

637
00:41:13,452 --> 00:41:16,254
Give it a nice
firm mooring and--

638
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:20,857
What do you want?

639
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:24,160
- Mind if I keep warm?
- Fuck off.

640
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:26,528
But I'm hungry.

641
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:29,964
Does fuck off mean something
different where you're from?

642
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:32,132
I've got money.

643
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:38,203
What kind of coin
is that?

644
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,072
It's worth a lot.

645
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,009
Sorry.

646
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,044
Little shit.

647
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,484
<i>Fool!</i>

648
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,934
Where did you
get the knife?

649
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:11,669
From you.

650
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:17,674
<i>Is that the first man</i>
<i>you've killed?</i>

651
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,809
The first man.

652
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:23,445
Next time you're going
to do something like that,

653
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:25,613
tell me first.

654
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,657
Valar morghulis.

655
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:11,486
Ygritte, you know
I didn't have a choice.

656
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:17,491
You always knew who I was,

657
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,359
what I am.

658
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:24,564
I have to go home now.

659
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,067
I know you won't hurt me.

660
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:32,671
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

661
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:38,776
I do know some things.

662
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:41,613
I know I love you.

663
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:46,616
<i>I know you love me.</i>

664
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:52,089
But I have
to go home now.

665
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:35,196
I know how
this must look.

666
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:41,035
- What I meant was--
- I swear to you, my lord--

667
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,504
I'm not a lord, my dear.

668
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:46,240
Not for many, many years.

669
00:44:46,274 --> 00:44:49,610
<i>Every man who joins</i>
<i>the Night's Watch</i>

670
00:44:49,644 --> 00:44:53,713
renounces
all former titles.

671
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:57,616
Among other things.

672
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,421
What is your name?

673
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:04,122
Gilly.

674
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:07,459
Ah, for the gillyflower.

675
00:45:07,493 --> 00:45:08,993
Lovely.

676
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:11,361
Yes, my--

677
00:45:13,431 --> 00:45:15,065
Maester.

678
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,301
Master.

679
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:19,803
Maester.

680
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:21,805
And the child?

681
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:25,442
She hasn't chosen
a name yet.

682
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:27,777
His name is Sam.

683
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:33,483
Tarly...

684
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:36,919
do you remember
the oath you swore

685
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:39,521
when you joined
this order?

686
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:42,691
He's not my child,
Maester Aemon.

687
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:45,927
She's one
of Craster's wives.

688
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:54,301
I remember every word
of the oath.

689
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:58,038
Night gathers
and my watch begins.

690
00:45:58,073 --> 00:46:01,908
<i>I am the shield that guards</i>
<i>the realms of men.</i>

691
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:06,579
The realms of men.

692
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,317
That means her
as well as us.

693
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,720
We didn't build
500 miles of ice walls

694
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:17,389
700 feet high
to keep out men.

695
00:46:19,492 --> 00:46:21,727
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon.

696
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:23,829
I've seen it.

697
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:26,364
It's coming
for all of us.

698
00:46:28,968 --> 00:46:32,236
Gilly, you and your son

699
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:35,239
will be our guests
for the time being.

700
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:40,176
We certainly cannot
send you back

701
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,177
beyond the Wall.

702
00:46:42,212 --> 00:46:44,713
Thank you...

703
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:47,115
Maester.

704
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:49,217
I can cook and clean
and I can--

705
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:50,918
Good.

706
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:55,488
Samwell, fetch a quill
and inkwell.

707
00:46:59,593 --> 00:47:03,195
I hope your penmanship is
better than your swordplay.

708
00:47:03,229 --> 00:47:05,330
Miles better.

709
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:10,901
We had 44 ravens
at last count.

710
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:14,404
Make sure
they're all fed.

711
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:17,707
Every one of them
flies tonight.

712
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:29,183
"To His Grace

713
00:47:29,218 --> 00:47:31,886
King Stannis Baratheon.

714
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:36,323
Invaded-- inv--
invit-- invited

715
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:40,126
to the name day
celebration

716
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,464
for Rylene Florent

717
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:47,732
on the first nigit--"

718
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:49,734
Night.

719
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:52,036
"First night
of the full moon."

720
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,504
Why is there
a G in night?

721
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,572
I don't know.
There just is.

722
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,842
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

723
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,778
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

724
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,813
You could read about
Balerion the Dread.

725
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:08,349
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

726
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:10,684
I'd like to see
that someday.

727
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:14,087
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

728
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:17,690
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

729
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:21,060
Aye, old Balerion's
definitely better

730
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:24,229
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

731
00:48:24,263 --> 00:48:26,631
But now that I'm your
father's Hand again,

732
00:48:26,665 --> 00:48:28,932
I have to keep
him informed.

733
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:32,501
The king does not have
time for this drudgery.

734
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,506
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros."

735
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,375
- Noblemen.
- <i>"Noblemen of Westeros,</i>

736
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:45,846
the Nig--
the Night's Watch...

737
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:50,984
implores..."

738
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:52,652
What is it?

739
00:48:57,057 --> 00:48:58,957
Why are they
ringing the bells?

740
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:00,859
<i>Are we being attacked?</i>

741
00:49:00,893 --> 00:49:03,327
Stay here.

742
00:49:03,362 --> 00:49:05,462
Bar the door.

743
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,246
The usurper
Robb Stark is dead.

744
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,715
Betrayed by his bannerman.

745
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:33,552
And you take credit because you
dropped a leech into the fire?

746
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:35,153
I take no credit.

747
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:38,223
<i>I have faith and my faith</i>
<i>has been rewarded.</i>

748
00:49:41,426 --> 00:49:45,729
Your Grace, the world
has got so far bent.

749
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:48,631
I've seen things
crawl out of nightmares,

750
00:49:48,665 --> 00:49:50,365
but my eyes were open.

751
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,234
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

752
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:55,469
or because at war
men die all the time,

753
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:58,671
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

754
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:00,373
with blood magic is wrong.

755
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:01,574
It is evil.

756
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:03,776
And you are not
an evil man.

757
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,512
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

758
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:08,814
Aegon Targaryen.

759
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:11,483
And do you know how Aegon
Targaryen conquered Westeros?

760
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:13,551
On the back of his dragon
Balerion the Dread.

761
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:17,420
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

762
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:20,156
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

763
00:50:20,223 --> 00:50:22,291
Dragons are magic,
Ser Davos.

764
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:25,761
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed.

765
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:29,731
<i>I will not forget that.</i>

766
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:32,401
I will not forgive that.

767
00:50:33,937 --> 00:50:36,738
I will punish them
with any arms

768
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,073
at my disposal.

769
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,976
You do not need
to burn the boy.

770
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,245
<i>If what you say is true,</i>

771
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,349
a drop of his blood
killed Robb Stark--

772
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:50,151
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

773
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:56,257
A great gift requires
a great sacrifice.

774
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,274
His name is Gendry.

775
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:16,942
He's a good lad.

776
00:51:18,077 --> 00:51:20,145
A poor lad
from Flea Bottom

777
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:22,847
who happens
to be your nephew.

778
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:31,655
What is the life of one bastard
boy against a kingdom?

779
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,191
Everything.

780
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,327
The boy must die.

781
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,634
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

782
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:50,503
Is this some kind
of trick?

783
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:53,205
Yes, but not on you.

784
00:51:57,142 --> 00:52:00,077
Aim for that star.
Don't stop.

785
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:02,346
There's bread and water.
Go slow with it.

786
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,114
If you finish it off,

787
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:07,417
no matter how
thirsty you get,

788
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:09,385
don't drink seawater.

789
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:11,420
I know not
to drink seawater.

790
00:52:11,454 --> 00:52:15,124
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

791
00:52:15,158 --> 00:52:17,893
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

792
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,261
Where should I go?

793
00:52:19,295 --> 00:52:20,696
You must keep the coast
on your left side

794
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,263
until you reach
King's Landing.

795
00:52:22,298 --> 00:52:24,165
The gold cloaks
are looking for me.

796
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,900
They were looking
for me for 20 years.

797
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,901
- Do they know your face?
- No.

798
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,670
I'd worry more
about the Red Woman.

799
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:38,344
The other way.

800
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:44,716
You ever been
in a boat before?

801
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,351
No.

802
00:52:46,385 --> 00:52:47,652
You know how to swim?

803
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:48,886
No.

804
00:52:48,954 --> 00:52:50,354
Don't fall out.

805
00:52:50,388 --> 00:52:52,890
Go on.

806
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:56,226
Why are you doing this?

807
00:52:56,261 --> 00:52:58,728
<i>Because it's right.</i>

808
00:52:58,763 --> 00:53:00,630
And because
I'm a slow learner.

809
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,836
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

810
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:13,342
<i>Horse approaching!</i>

811
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:16,545
Halt! Halt!

812
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:36,162
Jon! Jon!

813
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:37,863
<i>Jon, it's us.</i>

814
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:40,199
I don't think
he can see us.

815
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:47,205
Pyp?

816
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,474
Sam?

817
00:53:49,508 --> 00:53:52,844
Hush, now.
You're home.

818
00:53:54,513 --> 00:53:57,548
Carry him inside.
Gently.

819
00:54:22,871 --> 00:54:25,205
Out of the way.

820
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,874
Step aside,
country boy.

821
00:54:26,908 --> 00:54:28,776
People working here.

822
00:55:13,845 --> 00:55:15,979
Cersei.

823
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,663
You don't deny it?

824
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:38,698
No.

825
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:41,834
I let him go.

826
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:44,937
Your mercy
saved the boy's life.

827
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:46,772
You feel good
about that?

828
00:55:46,806 --> 00:55:48,173
Aye, I do.

829
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:50,775
<i>You saved one innocent.</i>

830
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:54,478
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

831
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:00,083
There has got
to be another way.

832
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:01,551
What other way?!

833
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:03,386
Tell us about
this other way.

834
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,088
I don't know,
Your Grace.

835
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:07,890
I can't see the future
in the fire.

836
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,228
Very well,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

837
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,165
I, Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

838
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:20,534
First of My Name, Rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

839
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,469
- sentence you to die.
- I understand.

840
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:24,771
But since you haven't yet
unnamed me Hand of the King,

841
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:27,306
it is my duty
to advise you against it.

842
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:29,942
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

843
00:56:31,378 --> 00:56:33,112
Why am I gonna need you?

844
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,850
My king.

845
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:45,288
<i>It's from Maester Aemon</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

846
00:56:45,323 --> 00:56:46,957
<i>Their Lord Commander</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

847
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:49,659
<i>Took a ranging party north</i>
<i>and never made it back.</i>

848
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:51,894
One lad did, though.

849
00:56:51,928 --> 00:56:54,563
What he saw
beyond the Wall--

850
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:57,032
it's coming
for all of us.

851
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,011
When did you
learn to read?

852
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:14,512
Matthos taught me
before he died

853
00:57:14,546 --> 00:57:16,614
so I could be
of better service to you.

854
00:57:24,122 --> 00:57:27,624
This War of Five Kings
means nothing.

855
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:32,161
<i>The true war lies</i>
<i>to the north, my king.</i>

856
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,597
Death marches on the Wall.

857
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:38,233
Only you can stop him.

858
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:40,335
You can't stop him alone.

859
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:43,070
You need someone to rebuild
your army for you,

860
00:57:43,105 --> 00:57:45,639
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

861
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:47,741
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

862
00:57:47,776 --> 00:57:50,144
I've made my decision.

863
00:57:51,546 --> 00:57:54,748
He's right.
You need him.

864
00:57:54,782 --> 00:57:57,418
He has a part to play
in the war to come.

865
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:08,859
You see, Ser Davos?

866
00:58:08,894 --> 00:58:12,262
You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.

867
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:18,033
You're in his army now.

868
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:43,421
They will come,
Your Grace.

869
00:58:43,455 --> 00:58:45,356
When they're ready.

870
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:47,158
Perhaps they didn't
want to be conquered.

871
00:58:47,192 --> 00:58:49,694
You didn't conquer them.

872
00:58:49,728 --> 00:58:51,863
You liberated them.

873
00:58:52,998 --> 00:58:55,333
People learn to love
their chains.

874
00:59:57,088 --> 00:59:59,089
No.

875
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:39,325
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

876
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,127
Mhysa! Mhysa!

877
01:00:42,162 --> 01:00:44,462
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

878
01:00:45,364 --> 01:00:47,432
What does it mean?

879
01:00:47,466 --> 01:00:50,367
It is old Ghiscari,
khaleesi.

880
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:52,803
It means "mother."

881
01:00:58,107 --> 01:01:00,842
It's all right.

882
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:02,577
These people
won't hurt me.

883
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,749
Mhysa! Mhysa!

884
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:59,693
Mhysa.

885
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:13,805
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

886
01:03:07,944 --> 01:03:12,944
