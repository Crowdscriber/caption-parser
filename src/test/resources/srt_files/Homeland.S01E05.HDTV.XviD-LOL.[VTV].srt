00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:09,541
PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval forces</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

2
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:12,373
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>

3
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,505
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the the town of Lockerbie.</i>

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,872
REAGAN:
<i>...savage acts of terror in</i>

5
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,509
<i>Africa, Europe,</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

6
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:21,348
GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand, this</i>
<i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

7
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:22,915
<i>REAGAN:</i>
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,682
<i>We will make no distinction.</i>

9
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,014
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

10
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,215
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

11
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,182
This was an act of terrorism.

12
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,682
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

13
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:34,150
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

14
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,353
is one of the good old
favorites.

15
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:37,823
Until something shocks him...

16
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:40,662
WOMAN: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

17
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:44,229
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

18
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:47,864
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

19
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:51,569
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

20
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:53,872
(speaking Arabic)

21
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,793
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

22
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,319
God!

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,440
CARRIE: <i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

24
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:06,209
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,019
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

26
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,347
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

27
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,348
CARRIE:
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

29
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,873
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland:

30
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:27,626
I got a mood disorder, okay?

31
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,094
I looked it up, Carrie.

32
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:30,095
Clozapine's an antipsychotic.

33
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,930
Only seven this time?

34
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:34,366
Raiding my samples cupboard
not only enables you,

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,803
it jeopardizes my license.

36
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,938
So... seven pills.

37
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:39,872
The terrorists are
still out there.

38
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:41,941
<i>We need Brody in the public eye</i>

39
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,478
<i>reminding America</i>
<i>that this is far from over.</i>

40
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:46,447
And smile for the cameras.

41
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,551
Look at him. He's been blogged
and tweeted about

42
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,421
and solicited by every
national talk show.

43
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,756
During the debrief, Carrie
mentions Abu Nazir's name

44
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,124
out of the blue.

45
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,159
Three days later,
one of her assets reports

46
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:01,094
the first Nazir sighting in over
seven years.

47
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:03,329
Maybe it's coincidence.
Or maybe there's something

48
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:04,630
she's just not telling us.

49
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:05,931
This intelligence

50
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:07,665
your asset gave up
her life to acquire,

51
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,500
do not squander it
by continuing to invade

52
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,136
the constitutionally protected
privacy of the Brody family.

53
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:14,772
You need to take down
that surveillance.

54
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,243
We're on to the next case.

55
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:19,645
Raqim Faisel.

56
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,682
FAISEL:
<i>He followed me to this house.</i>

57

AILEEN: <i>Darling, I promise no one</i>
<i>knows we're living here.</i>

58
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:26,986
I still think we should leave.

59
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,920
Our instructions were
to sit tight.

60
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,022
You knew this would not be easy.

61
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:33,324
I can't help but feel
I'm missing something.

62
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,493
You're missing him.

63
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,001
Oh, I'm sorry!
Hey, I know you.

64
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,970
I'm not supposed to be here.

65
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:49,372
Hey, look, I'm not going back
in if it means

66
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,941
you can't go back in.
That's not necessary.

67
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:53,877
Maybe we can hold our own
private meeting out here.

68
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:56,746
How's that sound?
It's tempting.

69
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,329
(grunts)

70
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:43,159
(chanting in Arabic)

71
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,070
(Brody's chanting continues)

72
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,443
(jet engine whining)

73
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,355
(whining gets louder)

74
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,727
(doorbell rings)

75
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,971
(baseball game playing on TV)

76
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:30,307
FRANK:
Run, you fat fuck, run!

77
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:36,146
Christ, you call
yourself a ball player?

78
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,281
He's safe, you fuckwit!

79
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,250
Geez, you freak.

80
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,620
COMMENTATOR:
A double and a single in the fourth.

81
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:44,289
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're wrong.

82
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:48,293
Why don't you just man up
and admit it, asshole!

83
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,495
That's right, you jerkoff,
I'm talking about you!

84
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,730
You're a goddamn disgrace!

85
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:54,598
Unfucking believable!

86
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,066
The only team in baseball has

87
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:59,336
to pinch run their leadoff man.

88
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,506
How long you been
standing there?

89
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,408
What? I can't hear you.

90
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:07,278
Oh, well, yeah. Oh, yeah.

91
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,149
There. Hey.

92
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:13,151
Hey. I rang the bell,
like five times, Dad.

93
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,287
Hey, is Maggie home?

94
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,989
No, she had to go deal

95
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,958
with some patient crisis
at the hospital

96
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,726
Hey, you hungry, huh?

97
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,729
She say how long she'd be?

98
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,532
I can make you a sandwich.
You want a sandwich?

99
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,703
I got, we got turkey,
lettuce...

100
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:30,137
(phone rings)

101
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,739
Shit, I gotta get this.

102
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:33,674
Uh, yeah, turkey's great.

103
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:36,977
Uh, hold on a second.

104
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:40,514
Hello.

105
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,150
Hey, Danny.

106
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,685
What?

107
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,087
The one surviving terrorist
from the compound in Afghanistan

108
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:49,522
where we rescued Brody.

109
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:52,359
Scooped him up in some
shitshack in IBD.

110
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,195
Clean lift. Nothing broken,
nothing spilt.

111
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,265
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

112
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,703
(sighs)

113
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,388
Oh! Sweetie!

114
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,590
(chuckles)

115
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,461
Welcome.

116
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,130
Hi. You okay?

117
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,032
No, happy to see you is all.

118
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,300
Yeah?

119
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,802
Over here.

120
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:07,835
(Frank sighs and
clears his throat)

121
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,436
Educated guess says you, uh...

122
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,971
you need this to go.

123
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,606
Sorry, Dad.

124
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,575
(steam hissing)

125
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,011
(sighs)

126
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:20,983
Oh. Oh, you must think I'm ready
for the glue factory, Carrie.

127
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,685
Unplugging the iron like that.

128
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:25,288
Come on.
I'm just trying to be safe.

129
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:31,327
Did you take your meds
this morning, Dad?

130
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:33,696
I did. Thank you for asking.

131
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,332
Bad enough I've got your sister
up my ass 24/7.

132
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,966
Now you, too?

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,269
And just so you know,
those pills are killing me.

134
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,338
No they're not, Dad.
Sometimes you just feel like

135
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:44,972
you're spinning out
of control a little

136
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,807
when they bring you
up instead of down.

137
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,642
That happens to you, too?

138
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,510
It's a good time

139
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,480
to avoid household appliances
in my experience.

140
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,150
I was distracted,
I was excited to see you is all.

141
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,985
(sighs)

142
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,487
Okay, message received
and understood.

143
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,158
I wish I could stay and help you
out with the chores.

144
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,559
Yeah, right.

145
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:09,227
Well, you enjoy.

146
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:10,963
Drive safe.

147
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:12,365
And...

148
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,333
Fuck the C.I.A.
Fuck the C.I.A.

149
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,569
SAUL:
So, how are your parents?

150
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,972
MIRA: Wonderful. They seem to
get busier and busier.

151
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:20,974
We need to get them
over here more.

152
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,744
Too much work in
Mumbai for that.

153
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,712
That's what they would say.

154
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,915
Maybe they ought to think

155
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,019
about handing the slums project
off to somebody else now.

156
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,021
What have you lost?

157
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,657
Ticket for the parking.

158
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,527
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Will standby passengers...

159
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:40,029
It'll be in the car,
where you always leave it.

160
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,497
(phone ringing)

161
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,233
Oh. That didn't take long.

162
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:46,235
I love you so.
I tell you that already?

163
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,271
Go on, answer it.
I know you have to.

164
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,039
Hello? Saul Berenson.

165
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:52,274
He wants everyone here ASAP.
No, no, no, on the secure link.

166
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:53,909
Get me Captain Mike Faber
at the Pentagon.

167
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:55,611
GALVEZ: Has been alerted
and is in-bound.

168
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,346
I'm gonna get a cab.

169
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,114
Oh, and Estes wants everyone
to clear their schedules...

170
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,849
Mira, wait. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

171
00:09:00,883 --> 00:09:02,751
Um... no.

172
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:05,519
I-I know what that look
means, Saul, and I'm not.

173
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:07,121
I'm not angry, I'm really not.

174
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:10,090
And I hope I see you later.

175
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,525
Saul?

176
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,926
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

177
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,294
All right,
before the briefing starts,

178
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:15,896
there's a report
you need to read

179
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,197
from the Pakistan phase
of the interrogation.

180
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,932
I'll be right over.

181
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:22,536
Afzal Hamid.

182
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,872
34 years old, Syrian.

183
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:27,775
According to our friends
in Pakistani Intelligence,

184
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,209
a mid-level member

185
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:30,578
of the Islamic People's
Liberation Army.

186
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,446
Abu Nazir's group.

187
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,415
Which means he most likely has
knowledge of Nazir's plans

188
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,051
to attack us here
in Fortress America.

189
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:40,088
Including money trail from the
Hawala shop-- where it went,

190
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,157
what it's being used for.
ESTES: Which is exactly why

191
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,293
you and Carrie
will interrogate him.

192
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,161
With the help of Sergeant Brody.

193
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:50,766
Excuse me. Sergeant Brody?

194
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,468
Yes, Carrie, Sergeant Brody,
who is in a unique position

195
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,970
to establish a baseline
on Hamid. Right or wrong?

196
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,305
Right.

197
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,906
Now, the interview
itself will take place

198
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,008
at a designated safe house,
yet to be determined.

199
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,443
Brody absolutely
can't be there.

200
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,511
He will be there, Carrie.
That ship has sailed.

201
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:07,646
Then we might as well
just hand our playbook

202
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,115
straight to Abu Nazir.

203
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,917
Well, the alternative
might be worse.

204
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,986
Nothing is worse than Brody
witnessing this interrogation.

205
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,688
The blowback will be profound.

206
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:16,757
Assuming we do what
you want then-- that is,

207
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,325
share your suspicions
about Sergeant Brody--

208
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,860
what do you think
will happen then?

209
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:21,829
Well, it might force David
into a decision.

210
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:23,330
A decision based on what?

211
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,867
How many times must we
have this discussion?

212
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,969
There's no evidence linking
Brody to Abu Nazir.

213
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,838
This is a different
discussion, Saul.

214
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,807
This is about
operational security.

215
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:34,176
(sighs)
Okay, Carrie.

216
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,546
March up to his
office right now.

217
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,180
Tell him he's been duped.

218
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,382
Tell him Sergeant Brody's
location in Afghanistan

219
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,184
was intentionally leaked
by Nazir.

220
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:44,651
Tell him the story

221
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,520
of his American hero
has a surprise twist.

222
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:48,021
See what he does then.

223
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:50,190
My guess-- you're
packing your cubicle,

224
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,158
looking for a job in
the private sector.

225
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,995
Don't we have a moral obligation
to say something?

226
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,065
Our obligation is to stop
the next attack on America.

227
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,002
Which you won't be a part of
if you keep pursuing this.

228
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,172
Has it occurred to you
at the very least

229
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,842
we'll be able to observe Brody
at close quarters

230
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,712
in a high stress environment
which we can control.

231
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,014
Yeah, it's occurred to me, Saul.

232
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,716
Has it occurred to you

233
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,350
if we do our jobs
and break Afzal Hamid,

234
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:16,819
he just might give up
the whole plot,

235
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,486
including Sergeant Brody?

236
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,155
Well, that's a big if, Saul.

237
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,490
You're screwing up my rug.

238
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:26,894
Either David Estes makes the
weather, Carrie, or we do.

239
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:28,796
Your choice.

240
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,440
(rhythmic breathing)

241
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:55,190
This can't be good.

242
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:57,258
Jess said I'd find you here.

243
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:58,993
It's urgent.

244
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,032
Langley needs to see you.

245
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,402
Langley?

246
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,937
So you better haul ass.

247
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,372
Shit, shower, shave, be ready
sometime in the next 40 minutes

248
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:13,941
when they come to get you.

249
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:16,977
What do they want?

250
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,880
Didn't say.
Eyes only classified.

251
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:22,449
You couldn't have
just called me?

252
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,217
They told me not to.

253
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,819
No open line phone calls.

254
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,855
Jesus.
Yeah, no shit.

255
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,291
You went by my house already?

256
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,560
Figured I'd stay out
of Jessica's hair.

257
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:35,661
You figured right.

258
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,667
Is that it?

259
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:44,070
Can't tell me anything else?

260
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:46,105
That's all I know
right now, Brody.

261
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,040
If I knew anything else,
I'd tell you.

262
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,845
Yeah.

263
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:59,152
What did Mike want?

264
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,857
The CIA wanted to see me.

265
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,326
About what?

266
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:09,195
I don't know.

267
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,801
(sighs, pants)

268
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,570
Going to take a shower.

269
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,205
They'll be here any second now.

270
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,675
Hey. Are you okay?

271
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,443
You know what, Jess?
Can you just stop

272
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:26,112
asking me that
every two minutes? I'm fine.

273
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:28,615
Okay. Okay.

274
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,650
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,151
I didn't mean to...

276
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,120
No, you're right. I get it.

277

CHRIS:
Hey, Dad.

278
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,656
Mom said you wanted to come
watch my karate tomorrow.

279
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,024
She did?
He's getting his blue belt.

280
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,793
If I pass the test.

281
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,294
So can you come?

282
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:46,030
Sure. Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

North. So not Langley.

No blindfold or anything?

287
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:42,425
We trust you.

Estes, we're up. We're online.

Carrie Mathison.

We met at the debrief
a few weeks ago.

Yes. Uh, good...
good to see you.

Thanks so much for coming.

How are you settling
back in with your family?

298
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:00,604
Yeah.

299
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:04,008
Um, can we get you
anything-- a coffee,

300
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,177
or soda or water--
before we get started?

301
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:08,213
Get started with what?

302
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,017
Have a seat.

303
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,502
Do you know this man?

00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,872
Yeah, I know him.

307
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,542
He was my guard.

308
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,777
Visual recognition confirmed.

309
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,613
Do you remember his name?

310
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,782
They called him Affie.

311
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,584
CARRIE: His full
name is Afzal Hamid.

312
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,286
He was the sole survivor
of the attack

313
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,754

where you were rescued.

He's waiting to see

324
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,040
if Hamid will say
something first.

325
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:54,677
This is the first stages
of an interrogation.

326
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,179
Not exactly.

327
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:57,814
Pakistani Intelligence
held him for three days

328
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,049
before they turned him over.

329
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,051
Did he talk?

330
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:03,454
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that.

331
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,023
In fact, I can't share
any operational details

332
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,025
with you at all.
Then why am I here?

333
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,527
CARRIE:
Two reasons: one, to confirm

334
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,896
his identity, which
you've just done,

335
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,131
and two, to provide
us with information

336
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,466
we can use to unsettle him.

337
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,468
To prove we have
complete control.

338
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,636
To demonstrate our omnipotence.

339
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,638
Are you comfortable with that?

340
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,140
Yeah, I think so.

341
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:23,841
Okay, good.

342
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,477
Are you ready to begin?

343
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,045
One question.

344
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,380
Go ahead.

345
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,083
Will he be tortured?

346
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,419
We don't do that here.

347
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:38,255
What is it you think
he knows about?

348
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,991
Like I said, I can't...

349
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,026
Divulge operational details.
Got it.

350
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,862
Mm-hmm.

351
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,931
Okay, I'm ready.

352
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,203
You can put this
on now, please.

353
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,841
Tap the mic twice so my
colleague knows we're ready.

354
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,183
Do you speak English?

355
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,352
Please.

356
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:06,620
Does he?

357
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,021
Did he ever speak
English to you?

358
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,525
They all spoke some English.

359
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,194
This is for my friends
in Guantanamo.

360
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,530
(screaming)

361
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,399
SAUL:
We know you speak English.

362
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
Therefore, I will continue

363
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,405
to address you in English.

364
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,407
Are you a religious man?

365
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,983
Okay, this part needs to move

366
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:36,785
a little faster.
Are you good with that?

367
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,554
They all prayed.
They're extremely devout.

368
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:42,657
Of course you are.

369
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,094
SAUL:
This soldier

370
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,062
was your prisoner.

371
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,466
When did you first meet him?

372
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,800
Damascus.

373
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,235
We know you didn't meet him

374
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:56,737
until Damascus--
that's when

375
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,205
the interrogations began,
didn't they?

376
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,942
And you were part
of those interrogations,

377
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:03,310
weren't you?

378
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,611
Yeah, he was.

379
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,246
For how long

380
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,881
was Sergeant Brody interrogated?

381
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,851
Days?

382
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,620
Months?

383
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:14,755
Years.

384
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,656
It went on for years,

385
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:17,891
didn't it?

386
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:23,063
What did you do
to Sergeant Brody, Afzal?

387
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,968
If you have a detail
we could use.

388
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,504
He beat me with a stick
wrapped in barbed wire,

389
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,805
and he pissed on me.

390
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,274
You beat him

391
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:37,143
with barbed wire

392
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:40,145
and urinated on him.

393
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:45,151
So you're a religious man
and a torturer.

394
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:47,587
What are you, Catholic?

395
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,628
You think your wife and sons
are still alive?

396
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:58,898
There, you see that?

397
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:00,533
That's exactly what
we were going for?

398
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,134
He was convinced
we already know

399
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:04,036
the answers to our questions.
Now he thinks

400
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,338
we know if his family is alive--
information <i>he</i> wants.

401
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,040
SAUL:
Let's back up, shall we?

402
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,977
Five days ago, you're safely
hidden away in Islamabad.

403
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:14,980
Or so you think.

404
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:18,316
I mean, why else have
your family with you.

405
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:20,519
Then suddenly
in the dead of night,

406
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,320
you disappear without a trace.

407
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,489
It's not just your
poor wife and children

408
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,358
who are wondering
where you are.

409
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:29,028
One man in particular

410
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:30,463
is beginning to worry.

411
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,067
Abu Nazir.

412
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:37,771
Who, as we all know,
is not your average

413
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,073
Islamist terrorist
bent on bringing down

414
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,509
Western civilization.

415
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,578
No, this man has
a certain style,

416
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,013
a certain...

417
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,383
...artistry.

418
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:52,887
Let's take the case of
Yasser Akram, for example.

419
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:55,756
Lifted by our British friends
from a villa in Lebanon

420
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,559
in August 2006.

421
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,895
Within days of his capture,
his only brother...

422
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:04,063
a good and holy man,

423
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:06,132
is killed in a car bomb.

424
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,268
The Yemeni police had
to ship what was left of him

425
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:11,938
in a small plastic bag
to a lab in Dubai

426
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:13,272
just to identify him.

427
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:17,277
Not to mention
what was done to...

428
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:19,780
his poor parents...

429
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,882
to his wives...

430
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,185
and most disturbingly,
to his children.

431
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,457
We can protect
your family, Afzal--

432
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,259
up to eight individuals.

433
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:34,463
But we don't have much time--
Abu Nazir is not a patient man.

434
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,332
You can come in now, Joelle.

435
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:39,568
(door opens)

436
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:49,945
When you're ready to talk to us,

437
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:53,181
write down their names
and addresses.

438
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,854
If you love your kids,
like I love mine...

439
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,956
I would hurry.

440
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:07,294
(door opens)

441
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:08,929
(door closes)

442
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,467
(Carrie sighs)

443
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:22,442
Now what?

444
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:25,845
Now we wait for him
to pick up that crayon.

445
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,182
When the interrogator said
that he could protect his...

446
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,786
We already have his wife and
children out of harm's way.

447
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,656
You can go home now;
thank you for your help.

448
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,191
We've got it from here.

449
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,060
Hey, guys?
Hey, would you just

450
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:41,463
let me in the room with him,
just for a couple of minutes?

451
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,532
I just want to look
the prick in the eye,

452
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,501
let him know that
the tables are turned.

453
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:47,203
You know I can't do that.

454
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,305
I wish I could, but I can't.

455
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,476
You do see that, don't you?
Sure.

456
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,244
Look, go home,
forget about today,

457
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:56,646
forget about all this--
and, of course,

458
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:58,181
it goes without saying...

459
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:00,050
Don't tell anybody.

460
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:03,353
Hey, but if you do find yourself
needing to talk to someone,

461
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:04,588
um...

462
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:07,358
Anytime,

463
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:09,993
24/7.

464
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:13,297
Good-bye, Sergeant Brody;
you've been a big help today.

465
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:20,705
ESTES:
Hey, Carrie?

466
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,340
Hey.

467
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,376
Excellent work,
both you and Saul.

468
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,677
Doesn't get
any better than that.

469
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:27,878
Let me know Thank you, David.

470
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:29,280
the minute Hamid makes a move,

471
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:30,381
one way or the other.

472
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,883
I will.

473
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:35,753
Well?

474
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:37,922
When you turned over
that picture of Abu Nazir,

475
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:38,923
he stopped breathing

476
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:40,725
for a few seconds.

477
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,294
I know he's hiding something from us,
I know it.

478
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,229
Shit!

479
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:46,363
What?
Well, now's the time

480
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:47,698
we really could use that

481
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:48,932
surveillance on his house.

482
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,767
Don't go there, Carrie.

483
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,803
Be patient.

484
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,075
All right, I'll take the doom watch.
You go be with Mira.

485
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:59,277
I'll call you if
anything happens tonight.

486
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:01,713
Pace yourself.

487
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,093
Come on, asshole,
pick up the damn crayon.

488
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,232
JESSICA:
Brody.

489
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,301
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

490
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,736
Hey, where you been?

491
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:26,638
You cut your hair.

492
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,240
(laughs)
What do you think?

493
00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:32,243
Nice.

494
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,779
You always liked it short.

495
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:37,549
No, I like it. Really.

496
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:42,954
You did something for me by
going to that support group,

497
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:45,190
so I thought I'd do
something for you.

498
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,627
Tea?

499
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:51,430
Thanks.

500
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:53,932
(groans)

501
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,701
What are you doing out here?

502
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:57,769
Nothing. Just
enjoying the quiet.

503
00:26:57,804 --> 00:26:59,371
Rough day?

504
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:03,775
What was it about, anyway?

505
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,612
I'm not really supposed
to talk about it, Jess.

506
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:08,947
Not even a little?
I can't.

507
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:10,549
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:26,131
How's your tea?
Good.

509
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:28,466
Yorkshire Gold.
Your favorite.

510
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,068
It's perfect.

511
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:32,037
(clears throat)
Thanks.

512
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:50,853
(loud heavy metal playing)

513
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:55,058
(heavy metal stops)

514
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,393
(exhales quietly)

515
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:00,230
(loud heavy metal playing)

516
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:04,768
(loud heavy metal continues)

517
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:08,673
(heavy metal stops)

518
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:15,046
(loud heavy metal playing)

519
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,750
(heavy metal stops)

520
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:24,122
(loud heavy metal playing)

521
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:28,125
(heavy metal stops)

522
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,128
(loud heavy metal playing)

523
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,331
(heavy metal stops)

524
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:42,439
(filling cup)

525
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:45,308
(loud heavy metal playing)

526
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,678
(heavy metal stops)

527
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,422
(exhales)

528
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,710
(groans softly)

529
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,347
(fan whirring)

530
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:27,151
(loud heavy metal playing)

531
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:40,798
(water sploshes)

532
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:49,706
(water sploshes)

533
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,517
(exhales)

534
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,722
(fan whirring)

535
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:10,360
(loud heavy metal playing)

536
00:30:18,102 --> 00:30:20,738
(heavy metal stops)

537
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:22,173
Saul...

538
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:24,175
looks like he's getting ready.

539
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:29,314
Eight names--
four in Islamabad, three in Lahore,

540
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:30,749
one in Larkana.

541
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:33,318
That's gonna take some doing.

542
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:35,687
First we need
a show of faith from you.

543
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:37,355
Do you understand
what that means?

544
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:42,726
I don't know anything.

545
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,062
You know I don't.

546
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:47,063
That is how we operate--

547
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,066
for exactly this reason.

548
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,202
Say good-bye to your family.

549
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,101
An e-mail address in Pakistan.

550
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:26,736
Whose e-mail?

551
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:28,738
I don't know.

552
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:31,741
I swear to you.

553
00:31:33,777 --> 00:31:35,645
Now you promise...

554
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,948
my family...

555
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:39,383
my children.

556
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,252
What do you send to
this e-mail address?

557
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:45,624
I forward ones sent to me
from someone else.

558
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,226
Who?

559
00:31:56,303 --> 00:32:00,073
Was the location of the compound where
you were holding Sergeant Brody

560
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:02,508
deliberately leaked to us so we would find him?
Carrie. Carrie.

561
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:05,512
Did Abu Nazir ever
meet Sergeant Brody?

562
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:06,913
(chair creaks)

563
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:08,247
First...

564
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,316
my family.

565
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,050
Then we talk.

566
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:18,591
We'll be back.

567
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:40,814
Come on in.

568
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:42,449
Thank you for meeting me, sir.

569
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:44,851
You know, when I told you
my door was always open,

570
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:46,319
Sergeant Brody, I meant it.

571
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:47,821
Good timing--
it appears

572
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:49,622
our friend in the safe house

573
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:50,957
is getting ready to do business.

574
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:52,292
No friend of mine, sir.

575
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:54,027
Uh, no, no. 'Course not.

576
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:56,496
What can I do for you, Sergeant?

577
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:00,167
I believe I've earned a moment

578
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,502
face-to-face
with my torturer, sir.

579
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:07,507
Yeah, I, uh... I heard.

580
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:09,876
And I've got to tell you
that Carrie was correct.

581
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,311
She doesn't have
the authorization

582
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:13,479
to let you in there with Hamid.
Do you?

583
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:15,581
As much as I'd like to...

584
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:17,015
Sir, can I stop you there,

585
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,417
save you the trouble?

586
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:20,252
Please.

587
00:33:20,286 --> 00:33:22,420
Nobody respects your
operational concerns

588
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:24,188
more than I do.

589
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:27,157
I did not come here to tell you
that I can get Hamid talking

590
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:28,859
any quicker than
your own experts can.

591
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:31,395
But yesterday, I did exactly

592
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,032
as was asked of me,
hard as it was just to sit there

593
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,600
and watch us dance around
his rights,

594
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,603
after what he did to me
for eight years.

595
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:42,540
Now you're telling me

596
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,409
he's ready to talk.

597
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:47,513
I think that means
I've earned the right

598
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,715
to at least look him in the eye,
and tell him

599
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,918
that he didn't beat me,
he doesn't get to win...

600
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:53,553
Sergeant Brody...
Sir, I haven't finished,

601
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:55,054
if you don't mind.

602
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:57,523
This is really important to me.

603
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:04,129
I need to do right
by my wife and my kids,

604
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:06,798
and I need to be fully able,
both physically and mentally,

605
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:09,400
to honor my duties
as a Marine and as a man.

606
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:13,737
But first, I got to close
the door on this chapter

607
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,640
of my life.

608
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:19,277
That's all I ask, sir.

609
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:25,416
Please don't rob me of the
opportunity to do that.

610
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,820
For my own sanity,
if nothing else.

611
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:37,129
Sergeant, would you, uh,

612
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:39,164
would you wait outside
for a second?

613
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,247
Lorraine, will you
get me the DCI.

614
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:56,282
Yes, sir. Right away.

615
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:13,798
Let's, uh...

616
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:21,808
Let's go close that door,
Sergeant.

617
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:31,353
We sent a phantom e-mail
to the one Hamid gave you.

618
00:35:31,387 --> 00:35:32,955
Whoever it is
will never actually

619
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:35,356
receive the e-mail
or know that it was sent.

620
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:37,626
So far, it's bounced
off of a server in Rio,

621
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,894
where it went through

622
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,030
a re-encryption
filtering protocol,

623
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:43,232
then to Johannesburg--
same drill--

624
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,234
then to Thailand,
then Finland, and now,

625
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,237
nearly an hour later,
your guess is as...

626
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,038
(computer chimes)

627
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,876
I'd say you owe me dinner,
Carrie.

628
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,878
Possibly even sex.

629
00:35:56,912 --> 00:35:59,179
Holy fuck.

630
00:35:59,214 --> 00:36:00,681
I wouldn't go that far.

631
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,416
(sighs):
Jesus Christ.

632
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:10,256
The 14th man gave up
an e-mail address we just traced

633
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,525
to the Engineering Department
at Bryden University.

634
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,393
Faisel? Are you
fucking kidding me?

635
00:36:14,427 --> 00:36:15,895
The professor we
tailed then cleared?

636
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:17,930
Correct. Everybody stop
what you're doing.

637
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:19,665
Only thing I need you
to do right now

638
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,235
is find this man: Raqim Faisel.

639
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:41,855
Faisel hasn't been
at the university all day.

640
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,123
And he's not home, either.

641
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:44,458
What home address
you got for him?

642
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:46,093
An apartment in Truxton Circle.

643
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:48,129
(sighs)

644
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,433
(dialing)

645
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:57,938
Virgil, I need you to look for
something at Bryden University.

646
00:36:57,972 --> 00:36:59,673
Yeah, today. Right now.

647
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:05,044
(door opens)

648
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:10,583
(door closes)

649
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:32,475
You beat me.

650
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,611
You humiliated me.

651
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:37,880
You killed my friend.

652
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,984
But you did not break me.

653
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:44,753
You should've killed me

654
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:47,655
when you had the chance.

655
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,258
But now, here we are.

656
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:57,365
I'm a sergeant in the United
States Marine Corps, shit-bird.

657
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,434
How did you think
this would end?

658
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:08,011
Hey! Hey, come on!

659
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,449
(grunting)

660
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:17,020
Calm down!

661
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:18,021
Calm down.

662
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:20,090
(Brody panting)

663
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:28,999
Thank you, sir.

664
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,568
Means a lot.

665
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,469
(Hamid speaking Arabic)

666
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,646
VIRGIL:
<i>Fact is,</i>

667
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,214
these eggheads
and whatnot may be

668
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:44,316
smarter than all of us
put together in this room.

669
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,817
But what I learned
over the years,

670
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,719
when it comes to safety
in the workplace,

671
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:50,589
you would not believe some of
the violations that I've seen.

672
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:54,893
Can't you come back when
Dr. Faisel is actually here?

673
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,328
I'm not comfortable letting
people in his office

674
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:58,363
when he's not present.

675
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,198
We understand, ma'am.

676
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:09,508
Um, look, uh,
if we damaged anything,

677
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:12,210
I can put in the paperwork
to pay for it.

678
00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:15,280
Maybe we can help you
with one or two of

679
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,281
the violations in here.

680
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,048
Excuse me?

681
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,717
Are-Are you
suggesting...

682
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:21,352
No, he's not.
Not on my watch.

683
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:22,753
Just do the paperwork,
numb nuts.

684
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:24,922
(phone ringing)

685
00:39:24,956 --> 00:39:26,457
Yes, we have a few

686
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,125
potential violations
we'd like to report.

687
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,893
That could be Dr.
Faisel calling now.

688
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,061
Hey.
Hello.

689
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,362
Know where this address is?

690
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:33,630
Hello?

691
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:34,831
Right next to
the fucking airport.

692
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:42,405
Hey.

693
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:45,941
See that new belt he's wearing?

694
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,077
Yeah.

695
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:50,278
Blue.

696
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:51,246
Impressive.

697
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,281
I'm sorry I missed it.

698
00:39:53,316 --> 00:39:54,449
I wish I'd been there, son.

699
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:55,918
I got caught up at a meeting.

700
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:57,486
It's okay.

701
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,155
Mike took me.

702
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,723
Yeah, I see that.

703
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:02,258
MIKE: Ice cream?
No, I'm good, thanks.

704
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,294
Have some.
We're celebrating.

705
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:12,904
Anyway, I should hit the road.

706
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:16,440
Did your mom ask Uncle Mike
to take you to karate?

707
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:18,109
MIKE:
It's no big deal.

708
00:40:18,143 --> 00:40:19,410
I've been taking him

709
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:21,445
for the last, uh, three years.

710
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:22,646
CHRIS:
Four.

711
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,114
I started when I was eight.

712
00:40:24,148 --> 00:40:25,649
MIKE: Right. And look
at you now.

713
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:26,650
A blue belt.

714
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:28,251
Pretty damn awesome, huh?

715
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:29,353
Right, Brody?

716
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,421
You bet.

717
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:38,795
What meeting?

718
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:40,496
I can't talk about it.

719
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,300
Your son did awesome today.

720
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:45,401
You should be proud.

721
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:50,506
Didn't you say you
were leaving, Mike?

722
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,010
See you later, bud, okay?

723
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:55,412
Later, gator.

724
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:03,621
(door opens, closes)

725
00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:04,989
Got any sprinkles?

726
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:09,861
CARRIE: <i>He led us right past this house</i>
<i>just this last Tuesday.</i>

727
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:11,829
VIRGIL: <i>Which probably means</i>
<i>he knew we were tailing him.</i>

728
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:13,164
Should've had us do it.

729
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:14,499
MAX:
Dead quiet in there.

730
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:15,700
Not a squeak.

731
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:18,002
Maybe they're taking a nap.

732
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:21,738
Sometimes, I swear to God,
he's my own brother,

733
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,240
and I don't know
if he's part moron

734
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:24,907
or just acting like
it to piss me off.

735
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:27,910
(cell phone ringing)

736
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,379
What's going on, Saul?

737
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:32,180
SAUL:
He's dead, Carrie.

738
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:36,986
Hamid's dead.

739
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,354
Suicide.

740
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:40,523
Jesus Christ, no.

741
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:42,058
Wha-- How?

742
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,760
When?
Carrie, what happened?

743
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:44,862
Minutes ago.

744
00:41:44,896 --> 00:41:46,697
I just got here.

745
00:41:46,732 --> 00:41:48,032
Body's still warm.

746
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,901
How the hell is that possible?

747
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:53,171
Razor blade fragment,
left wrist.

748
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,673
What? Where did he get that?

749
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:59,044
H-He must have had
it on his person.

750
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:00,279
We missed it.

751
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:01,746
Saul, he had to have
gone through

752
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:04,416
at least a dozen
full body searches.

753
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,386
The fragment is tiny.

754
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,588
He could have had it
concealed in a cavity

755
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:16,593
or under his skin
in scar tissue.

756
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:18,228
Or somebody passed it to him.

757
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:19,429
Passed him what?

758
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:21,264
Carrie...

759
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:23,266
Admit it's possible, Saul,
because we're sitting on

760
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,600
Dr. Faisel's
house right now,

761
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:25,868
and there's no sign
of him anywhere.

762
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:28,070
What's your point?

763
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:29,738
My point is, whoever gave
Hamid the razor blade

764
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:30,940
could have warned
the professor, too.

765
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:33,642
A fucking razor blade?

766
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,710
I want authorization to go in.

767
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:37,779
Estes wants us
to watch and wait.

768
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,614
Damn it, Saul, there's no time!

769
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:42,450
If Faisel is on the run,
we need to know now.

770
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:45,052
You have my authorization.

771
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,553
Move in.

772
00:42:48,623 --> 00:42:50,390
Alpha team, go.

773
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:52,292
Bravo, cover the back.

774
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:53,727
Charlie team, stand by.

775
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:02,204
Here we go.

776
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,926
MAN: House is empty.
He must have left in a hurry.

777
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,094
Looks like for good.

778
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,162
Did you hear that, Saul?

779
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:29,630
Saul?

780
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,701
Saul?

781
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,737
(speaking Hebrew)

782
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:46,314
(Saul continues speaking Hebrew)

783
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:58,961
(door closes)

784
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:02,598
(footsteps approaching)

785
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,333
I'm so sorry.

786
00:44:05,368 --> 00:44:06,835
(exhales)

787
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:10,038
I know what you're gonna
say, and you're right.

788
00:44:10,072 --> 00:44:14,509
All I can say is this is not how
I planned your first days back.

789
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,214
You must still be
jet-lagged.

790
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:21,049
Why are you still up?

791
00:44:21,084 --> 00:44:23,752
You should be in bed.

792
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,888
I know that look.

793
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:28,191
You been waiting up for me.

794
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:30,527
What's wrong?
Saul, darling,

795
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:33,496
you know what's wrong-- you just more
or less said so in a nutshell yours...

796
00:44:33,531 --> 00:44:37,033
Wait, wait. Please
not do this right now.

797
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:39,502
Do you mind?

798
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:42,538
It's been a very, um...

799
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:44,707
complicated day.

800
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:47,777
Your life is a very
complicated day.

801
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:55,350
You must...
be aware, Saul,

802
00:44:55,385 --> 00:44:58,887
this last month in
India with my family

803
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:02,724
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

804
00:45:02,758 --> 00:45:05,160
Soul searching.

805
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:10,432
We discussed this
before you left.

806
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:12,034
I can start scaling back,

807
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:14,636
maybe even get reassigned,
spend more time at home.

808
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,672
Just listen.

809
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,475
I actually realize now

810
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:22,378
it's not right or fair
to ask you to do less.

811
00:45:22,413 --> 00:45:24,715
So what I need--

812
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:26,049
me, Mira--

813
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:30,087
is to make my life
not just about you.

814
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,390
You know,

815
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:35,759
you said yesterday
that my parents

816
00:45:35,794 --> 00:45:38,429
should pass
the Mumbai slums project

817
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:41,164
onto someone else.
Not to you. I didn't mean to you.

818
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:42,799
Our life is here, Mira.

819
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:47,737
Our life is
wherever you get sent--

820
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:49,906
Amman, Beirut, London, Aden--

821
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,809
often at a moment's notice,
and I need more than that.

822
00:45:52,843 --> 00:45:55,045
I need to make my life...

823
00:45:56,314 --> 00:45:58,681
I need to make my life

824
00:45:58,716 --> 00:45:59,782
about my passion.

825
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:01,751
I need to put my
roots down somewhere

826
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:03,653
that matter to me, Saul.

827
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:07,623
(doorbell rings)
Do I get any sort of say in all this?

828
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,997
Are you gonna get that?

829
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:26,276
Mira.

830
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,978
How was your trip?
Welcome home.

831
00:46:28,012 --> 00:46:29,946
Uh, um, it was wonderful.

832
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:31,381
It was an inspiring time.

833
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,616
How are you...

834
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:34,218
Carrie?

835
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:36,521
I'm so sorry, I really
didn't mean to intrude.

836
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,056
However...
It's really important that I talk to you.

837
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:41,192
It's, uh, so lovely to see you,

838
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:42,827
but I didn't sleep
on the plane,

839
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:44,729
so I'm completely
sideways. Forgive me.

840
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,898
We'll catch up soon.
That'd be great.

841
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,566
Good night.

842
00:46:53,572 --> 00:46:57,909
Don't say I didn't warn you this whole
thing would blow up in our faces.

843

SAUL:
What the hell?

844
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:04,815
Who let Brody in
that room with him?

845
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,016
Who do you think, Saul?

846
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:08,085
Jesus fucking Christ.

847
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,687
Yep, I had pretty much
the same response.

848
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:13,323
(sighs) Brody must
have identified

849
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:15,393
that camera blind spot while
watching the interrogation.

850
00:47:15,427 --> 00:47:17,061
SAUL:
Just so you know,

851
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:18,763
the working theory
is that Hamid smuggled

852
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,500
the razor blade inside
the soul of his shoe.

853
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:25,939
Bullshit! I mean, not only did Brody
contrive to get himself in the room,

854
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,240
he orchestrated Hamid's suicide

855
00:47:27,274 --> 00:47:28,574
and he warned Dr. Faisel.

856
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:31,278
And we-- you and I--
let it happen.

857
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:33,713
(low grunt)

858
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:36,249
Enough on the sidelines,
enough in the shadows--

859
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:39,218
we need to take this up the chain
before we're counting bodies

860
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:41,788
and trying to spin yet another
monumental intelligence screw-up.

861
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:43,789
Don't think I'm
not considering it.

862
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:45,591
Well, how about doing
something about it?

863
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,092
Because nothing's
changed, Carrie.

864
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:51,729
Wh-Wh... What do you
mean, nothing's changed?

865
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:54,466
I don't see Brody giving
Hamid a damn thing, do you?

866
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,035
Not a razor blade,
not a goddamn summer cold.

867
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,104
Good! You know?
Get angry!

868
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:01,307
I'm over your whole
detached routine.

869
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:03,576
(whispers):
You're out of line.

870
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:06,213
This is my home. Get out...
I'm going to Estes

871
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,881
with or without your approval.
Take some boxes with you,

872
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:11,218
'cause you're gonna need 'em
when you clean out your desk.

did three months in
a Malaysian prison

875
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:21,460
stared down Uday Hussein
at the height of his power?

876
00:48:21,495 --> 00:48:24,630
When did you become
such a pussy, Saul?

877
00:48:24,664 --> 00:48:27,933
(whispers):
I think you should leave now.

878
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:29,401
With pleasure.

879
00:48:29,435 --> 00:48:30,569
You know what?
You can keep that.

880

(crying): I'm sorry, Maggie.

887
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,563
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, God, what happened?

888
00:49:29,598 --> 00:49:32,500
I think I just quit my job.

889
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,535
MAGGIE:
What? Don't be silly.

890
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,904
No, I'm serious.
I'm done. I'm done!

891
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:40,574
I've had it up to here.
All right, just stop. Stop.

892
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:42,911
Stop.

893
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:45,980
You were so right,
you were so fuckin' right

894
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:49,984
- when you told me that my job would kill me
one day. - Just take a deep breath.

895
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:51,919
Calm down, 'kay, Carrie?

896
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:53,988
Carrie, just calm down, okay?

897
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:58,392
Does Saul know about any of this?
Saul?

898

No, S-Saul is part
of the problem.

899

But you said he
always had your back.

900

Well, I'm on my own now,
that's for damn sure.

901
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:08,269
Do you really want
to know the truth?

902
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:13,007

Stop.

903
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:15,209
We both know you're not
quitting anything, okay?

904
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:17,011
It's just the heat
of the moment,

905
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:19,013
it's not you, okay?

906
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:22,183
That's not who you really
are-- I know you. So...

907
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:23,951
this is what's gonna happen.

908
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:25,953
You're sleeping here
tonight, okay?

909

My guest room's
already made up.

910

The girls are gonna be over the
moon to see you in the morning.

Yeah.

get some rest, okay?
