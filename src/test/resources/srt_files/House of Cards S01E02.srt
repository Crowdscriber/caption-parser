1
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,127
You know what I like about people?

2
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:21,722
They stack so well.

3
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,524
Let me get this for you.

4
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:29,286
- Want the paper?
- No.

5
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:33,246
This is too much.

6
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:34,037
It's not half enough.

7
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:35,061
Thanks for opening up for me.

8
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:37,461
Any time, day or night.
You know that.

9
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:39,531
In a town where everyone's

10
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,212
so carefully reinventing themselves,

11
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,493
what I like about Freddy

12
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:45,455
is that he doesn't even
pretend to change.

13
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,335
Ooh. I'm late.

14
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:48,496
Every Tuesday I sit down

15
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:50,417
with the speaker and the majority leader

16
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,937
to discuss the week's agenda.

17
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:54,179
Well, discuss is probably
the wrong word.

18
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,940
They talk while I sit quietly

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,820
and imaging their lightly salted faces

20
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:59,260
frying in a skillet.

21
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:16,222

22
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,885
Vasquez must be shitting herself.

23
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:37,046
Shitting herself,
or Walker is shitting himself

24
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,047
and shoveling his shit on her shit.

25
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,527
Bob, I'm planning on eating.

26
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:41,769
Do we have a backup on the docket?

27
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,129
You're on that, right, Frank?

28
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,330
Yeah, I'm working
with my staff--

29
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:45,611
Republicans are gonna ram this

30
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,371
up our ass.
I would if I was them.

31
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,813
Why, even if we squeak it
through the house,

32
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,573
watch them mangle it in the senate.

33
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:52,134
- Or filibuster.
- Why, sure, if it looks anything like this.

34
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,535
I don't know why Walker's

35
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:55,415
trying to tackle a charging elephant.

36
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,617
It's madness.

37
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,217
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,

38
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,737
but I saw you
sitting over here--

39
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,499
Remy. Gentlemen,
this is Remy Danton.

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,300
Remy, this is Speaker
Birch and Congress--

41
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,261
I'm well aware.
Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

42
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,461
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

43
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:09,502
Glendon Hill?
Great team over there.

44
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,024
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

45
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,704
When was the last time
they added a partner?

46
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,144
It's been a while.

47
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,746
Well, they know a winner
when they see one.

48
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,547
Remy was the best press
secretary I ever had.

49
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,147
Why did you let him go?

50
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,309
I didn't.
They stole him away.

51
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,670
What accounts do you have?

52
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,591
San Corp Industries is my main one.

53
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:26,272
I run that account now.

54
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:27,873
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.

55
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:28,833
Sorry again to interrupt.

56
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:29,873
No problem.

57
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:31,914
Very nice to meet you both.

58
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:34,635
- Nice.
- Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.

59
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,157
He's probably making more
than all of us combined.

60
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:38,438
Gentlemen, this one's on me.

61
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,199
I'm gonna track down that check.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

63
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,521
San Corp is deep into natural gas.

64
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,402
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,

65
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:47,883
but I have 67 deputy whips,

66
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,964
and they all need cash to win races.

67
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,965
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,

68
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:53,525
and in return they expect mine.

69
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,846
It's degrading, I know,

70
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,167
but when the tit's that big,

71
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,327
everybody gets in line.

72
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,490
Tell them I'm on top of it.

73
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:03,931
I need more than that.

74
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:06,332
You are well aware
that I do not drop the ball

75
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,613
on things like this, Remy.

76
00:05:07,614 --> 00:05:09,893
Promises, Frank.
Secretary of State,

77
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,215
Argentine and offshore
drilling contracts--

78
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,095
talk to me when I've solved the problem.

79
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,856
Don't waste my time when I'm
working on solving the problem.

80
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,937
When there's billions on the line,

81
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:17,138
I can't not show up.

82
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,498
Fine. Thank you
for your diligence.

83
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,300
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.

84
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:23,021
6 million to build that library
of yours in your name.

85
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,182
- I know.
- Don't make them throw money

86
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,783
at your challenger next cycle.

87
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,223
You've made your point.

88
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,825
Have I? I hope so.

89
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,987
Such a waste of talent.

90
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,269
He chose money over power--

91
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,790
In this town, a mistake
nearly everyone makes.

92
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,591
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota

93
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,752
that starts falling apart
after ten years.

94
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:48,554
Power is the old stone building

95
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,076
that stands for centuries.

96
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:54,277
I cannot respect someone
who doesn't see the difference.

97
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:57,479
[Frank] What am I looking at?

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,679
The Williams register.

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,999
- Williams?
- College.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,161
September '78.

101
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,561
And why am I looking at it?

102
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,801
The editorial.

103
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,166
Not that interesting.

104
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,326
Michael Kern went to Williams.

105
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,927
Check out the masthead.

106
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:18,209
And then there's this.

107
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,491
It's thin.

108
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,613
The guy's a unicorn.
He pisses rainbows.

109
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,413
- You think we can get traction with this?
- I think you could.

110
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:26,814
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

111
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,574
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.

112
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:31,216
It's only 6 past 9:00.

113
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:33,057
Which means she read
the Herald 3 hours ago

114
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,618
and spent the past 2 1/2 getting
reamed by the president.

115
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,499
Tell her I'm on my way.

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,660
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me that you--

117
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,302
25 years he's been pushing
this particular agenda.

118
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:44,223
We got between the
mother bear and her cub.

119
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:45,743
It's a setback.
That's all.

120
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,264
On our first day in office.

121
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,985
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.

122
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:50,906
Setbacks are a dime a dozen
with a bill of this size.

123
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:52,586
Frank, if you
can't control this--

124
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:54,428
I don't take well to being
micromanaged, Linda.

125
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:57,109
You want to do my job for
me and run the White House?

126
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,111
Good luck.
I won't stand in your way.

127
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:02,312
Okay, Frank. Fine.
This is yours now.

128
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:05,193
If this thing can't make it to
the floor in the first 100 days,

129
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:06,714
then I'll let you explain
to the president

130
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,195
why he lied to the American people.

131
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,636
I'm gonna get back to work.

132
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,997
Please do.

133
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:31,487
Well, we really should be
doing this on a Friday

134
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:32,608
instead of a Wednesday.

135
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,369
If we do it on a Friday,

136
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,610
- people have the weekend--
- Fine. We'll do it on Friday.

137
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,051
[Claire] Is all the paperwork ready?

138
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,252
Some of the more senior
people are trickier.

139
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,852
There's severance.

140
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:43,373
But we shouldn't run into
any legal issues.

141
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:47,055
No, no. We use at-will
employment contracts

142
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,295
across the board.

143
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:50,017
Well, get started first thing Friday.

144
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,978
I want all of the exit interviews

145
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,219
done by lunch.

146
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,300
Claire, I just can't help but think

147
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,821
that this is a mistake.

148
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,462
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.

149
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,543
I know, I know,
but I just have to say it

150
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:03,424
for the sake of my conscience.

151
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:06,345
I think that you are dismantling

152
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:09,067
what we have built
over the past ten years,

153
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,228
and I--

154
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,352
and I think the way you're handling this

155
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:22,794
is...is cruel.

156
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,234
It's not easy, Evelyn.

157
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:27,116
But it's necessary.

158
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:30,518
You have always asked me
to be honest with you.

159
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,159
It's how we work together.

160
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,439
I disagree with something, I say it.

161
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,641
Well, I disagree 100%.

162
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,162
Please, Claire, don't do this.

163
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,364
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,

164
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,405
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,

165
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:47,126
but I'm not going to change my mind.

166
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:50,888
Friday, then.

167
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,970
If that's what you want.

168
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:04,936
This is major reform,
a complete overhaul.

169
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,936
That would usually take months.

170
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,778
Well, we only have days, not months.

171
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,298
But think about the process.
We can't just change--

172
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,460
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,

173
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,221
who are the smartest minds in education,

174
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,942
out of hundreds,
we arrived at you--

175
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:20,863
the six of you in this room.

176
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,584
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,

177
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:25,466
but we have the opportunity
to make history here.

178
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:29,227
And I want all of us
to make it together.

179
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,589
So good luck.
We're counting on you.

These bullet points

182
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:36,632
reflect the key planks

183
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,273
at the center of our bill.

184
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:40,073
Get comfy.
This is your home

185
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:41,714
until we have a presentable first draft.

186
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:46,957
Donald, what a morning.

187
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,638
I have no idea how they got this.

188
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,039
I specifically told my staff

189
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,599
to destroy everything.
I can't imagine--

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,160
It doesn't matter how it happened.

191
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,241
We can't make it unhappen,
so we have to adapt.

192
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:57,242
Don't they realize
that this is a first draft?

193
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,003
All we have here really
is a perception problem.

194
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,485
We don't get a second chance
at a first impression, Donald.

195
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:04,046
You know that. Now,
look, I'm on your side,

196
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:06,167
but Linda is furious.

197
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,568
What's she saying?

198
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,449
They want to point fingers.

199
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,569
At me?

200
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,090
I told her we cannot do that.

201
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,891
I mean, you are vital to this process.

202
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:16,412
I'm up to here with them,
Donald--

203
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:19,374
for lying, for turning
their back on you.

204
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,775
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.

205
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,737
I'll fall on this grenade myself,

206
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,897
just to piss them off.

Give me John king at CNN.

208
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,179
Wait, Frank.
This is not your fault.

209
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,140
No, we have to protect your reputation.

210
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,981
But you're the man that needs to
get the bill through the house.

211
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,662
I will-- hang on.
I will assign it to one of my deputies,

212
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,824
quietly manage it, and help
guide you through the process.

213
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,463
I am not comfortable with this.

214
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:42,025
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

[Sigh]

What a martyr craves more than anything

217

is a sword to fall on,

and then 3, 2, 1--

It should be me.

222

It was my bill.

No. Impossible. Donald,

The truth is my heart
is not in this fight.

227
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,759
You know me. I'm not
a wheeler dealer.

228
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
I can put my mind to policy,

229
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:13,001
but I'm no good at this
brand of politics.

230
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:15,483
Well, if not you, then who?

You're formidable.

They will follow your lead.
Let me--

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,769
let me be on the sidelines for this.

236
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,332
Well, I could only
consider that as an option

237
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,415
if I knew that I could still
come to you for counsel.

Of course.

Part of me is glad this got leaked.

241
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,501
Well, it would have been
better if it hadn't,

242
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,743
but at least people know where I stand.

243
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:57,705
Thank you, Donald.

Happy to do it, Frank.

Stamper! But why dampen
his mood by telling him?

248
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,233
We just gave him
a great gift--

00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,114
a chance to fulfill his destiny.

of the education reform act.

I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,

262

but, uh,
it does represent--

00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,127
it came from your office,
though, correct?

Uh, we wrote it,

or did
the administration--

Are you going running now?

328
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:46,623
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.

329
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:47,943
I had an early meeting.

330
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:50,584
Use the monstrosity.
It's freezing out.

331
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,306
You break it in.

332
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:57,628
It looks positively
medieval, doesn't it?

333
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,550
And to turn my only sanctuary
into a fitness dungeon.

334
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,831
I won't have it.

335
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,192
It's a stretch.

336
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:05,872
[Zoe] We're not misleading anyone.

337
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,914
- He was the editor.
- Did you call for a comment?

338
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:09,955
I tried three times. The press
secretary said he'd get back to me.

339
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,876
- He didn't.
- What about research?

340
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:13,477
You couldn't find anything
to echo the editorial?

341
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:14,958
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?

342
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,638
Don't you think if something
like that existed,

343
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,280
someone would have printed it by now?

344
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,639
Nobody else has this, Lucas.

345
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,320
I don't think there's a story here.

346
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,121
I'm not saying there's a story.
All I'm saying

347
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:25,162
is that there's a question
that needs to be answered.

348
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,725
This is a nominee
for Secretary of State.

349
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,885
We have an editorial
on Palestine and Israel.

350
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:32,247
Which he didn't write.

351
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:34,168
Which we don't know he didn't write.

352
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,568
Exactly.

353
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:36,729
We don't have to print it.

354
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,010
I could just scan the thing,

355
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:39,649
stick it on a site, and tweet the link.

356
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,131
But if I did that,
some other paper might--

357
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,412
Whoa, whoa.
Don't be a bitch.

358
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,173
I'll talk to Tom.

359
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,974
That's all I was asking.

360
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,775
We simply can't afford
to allow the--

361
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,256
We got a guy who's almost perfect.

362
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,217
He's a libertarian drug fiend

363
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:54,698
- marinating in a mobile home.
- Shh.

364
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,379
I didn't agree with President Reagan

365
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,540
on many things,

366
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,940
but there was some merit

367
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,501
to the notion
of trickle-down economics,

368
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:01,982
and I feel there is much merit

369
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:05,263
to the idea
of trickle-down diplomacy.

370
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,784
Those are my lines.

371
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,304
Vasquez must have given them to him.

372
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,106
...stalemate between
Israel and Palestine,

373
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:12,787
that success will trickle down

374
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,227
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas

375
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:16,028
between Muslims,
Jews, Christians--

376
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,790
I'm glad you brought up
Israel and Palestine

377
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,471
because just before we came on the air,

378
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,072
I received an advance copy of an article

379
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,672
that's going to be in tomorrow's

380
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:24,153
Washington Herald's front page

381
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:25,834
and was written by Zoe Barnes,

382
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,714
and in it she quotes an editorial

383
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,635
that ran in the Williams
college register

384
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,557
when you were editor
back in September 1978,

385
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:33,879
which called the Israeli presence

386
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,279
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,

387
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,960
quote, an illegal occupation.

388
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,721
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

389
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,802
Did you write those words,
"illegal occupation"?

390
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:43,683
No. I have
no memory of this.

391
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,444
But you were the editor of the paper.

392
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:46,845
Yes, but--

393
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,165
So it couldn't have gone out

394
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,407
without your approval.

395
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:51,567
No, of course not,
but my staff--

396
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:53,208
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,

397
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,209
the, uh-- and then
we'd vote, and if--

398
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,570
Did you vote for it?

399
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,690
Honestly, George, I can't remember.

400
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,811
It was 35 years ago.

401
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,251
So you're not sure

402
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,853
whether or not you
supported these words--

403
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:03,734
I can tell you without
a shadow of a doubt

404
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,535
I did not write these words.

405
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:08,096
But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?

406
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:10,577
[Laughing] This is ludicrous.

407
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:12,938
That's all we need--
him laughing.

408
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,619
[George] I know it was
a long time ago--

409
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,220
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

410
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,661
The Middle East is a vital
American interest.

411
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,622
What you think about
the Middle East is relevant.

412
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,743
You can look at my voting record.

413
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:25,224
Every single vote has been
in defense of Israel--

414
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,145
So when did your views change?

415
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:28,426
What I'm saying to you
is my--

416
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:29,547
What's important now, George,

417
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,227
is how I have voted

418
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:33,308
while I have represented
the great state of Colorado--

419
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,270
I understand that's your position,
but a lot of other people

420
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:36,791
are going to look at it
and think what you thought then

421
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,031
is relevant as well.

422
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:39,551
Have you ever changed your views

423
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,553
- since college?
- I'm not the nominee

424
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,834
for Secretary of State.

425
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:45,075
Uh,
even if I did have--

426
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:46,315
It's golden.

427
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,556
This has not been my views--

428
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:48,917
It's a bull's eye.

429
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,878
What were you saying when you came in?

430
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,519
So, ahem, I found a guy

431
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,160
who was on the college editorial staff

432
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:56,321
when Kern was there.

433
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:57,602
This burnout,

still pumping mimeographed manifestos

435
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:00,923
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.

436
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:02,524
You're not planning on talking to him.

00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,044
Peter Russo.

438
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:05,926
- Good.

[Toilet flushes]

444

You look sexy when you're improving

the lives of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

Is it the improving lives,

or is it these fetching sweat pants?

Move that computer out of the way.

Let me see what that looks like.

00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,262
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.

451
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,864
Fuck off.

452
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,344
You're not paying
enough attention to me.

I pay attention to you
all day at the office.

Hey, you know, I don't think

455
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,269
I've ever seen you
brush your teeth before.

456
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,869
- Sure you have.
- No, I don't think so.

457
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,951
I know that you do brush,
but I don't think

00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,352
I've ever actually witnessed it before.

Well, here it is in all its glory.

460

Is that my toothbrush?

I don't know. Is it?

Yes, it is.

807
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,460
Good. With your go-ahead,
I'll start the mock-up.

808
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,182
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?

809
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,183
Not yet. I wanted you to be
the first to have a look.

810
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,144
I'll schedule a time for you
to fill in the president.

811
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:06,104
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda.
You should do that.

812
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:09,227
- Thank you, Frank.
- My pleasure. Thank you.

813
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:12,469
- I so apologize for everything--
- No, no, no, n--

814
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,870
it's not necessary.

815
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:16,870
Now for the real meeting.

816
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,113
So what is happening with Michael Kern?

817
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,113
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

818
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:24,354
You know who you're gonna tap next?

819
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:26,595
Frank, we still need you
in the house--

820
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,597
No, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

821
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,998
We've got our education bill.
I was just curious.

822
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:32,839
Somehow the rumor is flying around

823
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,600
that we're gonna nominate
Catherine Durant.

824
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:37,241
- I'm sure you've noticed.
- Is the rumor true?

825
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,882
Well, we weren't
considering her at first,

826
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:40,523
but the president asked me
to have her vetted

827
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:42,844
in case we wanna go that route.

828
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:45,525
- Interesting.
- What do you think?

829
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,528
Well, she wouldn't be
my first choice--

830
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:52,089
Who would be your first choice?

831
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,289
She campaigned hard against us
in the primaries.

832
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,812
- That's my reservation.
- But you'd show yourself above party politics,

833
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,932
and I know she'd work
all the harder for it.

834
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:02,454
Decent experience,
respect across the aisle.

835
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:04,496
So you think we can
seriously consider her?

836
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:08,897
It's not the worst idea in the world.

837
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:12,300
[Door closes]

838
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,904
[Inhales, exhales]

839
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:30,628
- Where are you getting this shit?
- What?

840
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:33,951
- Your stories. Who are you fucking?
- I was just--

841
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,752
- Nobody.
- Oh, come on.

842
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:39,874
You're a metro scrub,
and now look at you.

843
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,714
You'd have to be fucking
somebody important.

844
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:44,556
I'm just doing my job, Janine.

845
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:46,397
Excuse me.

846
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,081
[Mutters] All set.

847
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:58,404
- Is this your first remote?
- Yeah, it's my first time.

848
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,770
Right into the camera,
don't shift in your seat,

849
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:13,291
and there's no reason to speak
above a conversational volume.

850
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:15,452
- The mic will pick you up. You all ready?
- Yeah.

851
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:17,614
All right.
Don't forget to breathe.

852
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:23,495
Five, four...

853
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:25,938
[No audible dialogue]

854
00:41:25,938 --> 00:41:31,260
[Man] We'd like to welcome Zoe
Barnes from the Washington Herald.

855
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:33,301
Zoe, thank you for joining us.

856
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:35,902
I'm very glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

857
00:41:35,903 --> 00:41:39,265
You broke the education bill, the
Kern editorial, and now Durant.

858
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,785
I'm just thrilled to be
reporting news that matters.

859
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:43,626
And it's truly been a team effort.

860
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,547
Everyone at the Herald pitched in.

861
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:49,469
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

862
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,670
First national story, first...

863
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:54,032
[Whirring]

864
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:02,156
Thank you.

865
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,757
Calling it a night.

866
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:09,360
See you tomorrow, sir.

867
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:17,484
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

868
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:20,005
First national story,

869
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:22,086
first front-page byline,

870
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:24,607
first TV interview.

871
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,250
I would wave to my mom, but the
cameraman said not to shift in my seat.

872
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:35,013
What a roller coaster.

873
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:38,775
It really is too bad.
Kern was a good man.

874
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:40,976
- And now Catherine Durant.
- Yes.

875
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:43,257
Right place, right time, I suppose.

876
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:46,058
- We like her, don't we?
- Very much.

877
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,100
Question is, does she like San
Corp as much as we like her?

878
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:51,582
I would say that
that is a very good bet.

879
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:53,463
But then again, I'm not a betting man.

880
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:56,024
- No. You always like a sure thing.
- When it avails itself.

881
00:42:56,025 --> 00:42:57,985
- Good night, Remy.
- Good night, Frank.

882
00:42:57,986 --> 00:43:01,307
- See you around.
- Hopefully less and less now.

883

[Beeping]

884
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:08,550
Oh, no.
I charged the wrong thing.

885
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:11,272
- What did you have again?
- A medium decaf latte.

886
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:14,674
- Med lat, dec.
- [Beeping]

[Mutters]

I don't know how to get it to go back.

889
00:43:21,158 --> 00:43:23,677
- This one and this one.
- This one?

890
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:25,759
- No. Let me do it.

I have to ask you
to stay back, congressman.

894
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:42,928
- What's going on?
- Some guy was trying to get into the building.

895
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:46,010
When we said no, he started
tearing his clothes off.

896

- [Siren wailing]
- [Yelling continues]

Nobody can hear you.
Nobody cares about you.

Nothing will come of this.

gentlemen take you home?

Cover him up.
It's cold out here.
