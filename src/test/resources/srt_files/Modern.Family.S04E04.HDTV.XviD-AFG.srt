1
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:05,817
Is everybody OK?

2
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:07,186
I'm fine.

3
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:08,097
Thanks for waiting.

4
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:08,817
What was that?

5
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:11,085
Water heater, gas line, the train.
It's the same, people.

6
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:12,573
Just stay low and move out!

7
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:14,049
Honey, Luke's gone.

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,572
Claire, spontaneous human
combustion is very rare.

9
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:18,693
I don't think he exploded, Phil.

10
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,206
The rope ladder works.
At least someone followed protocol.

11
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh! Oh, it's there!

12
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,852
Smoke is coming out of
Luke's stupid suitcase.

13
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:29,657
Like his old man,
Luke is a magician.

14
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:32,729
I'm taking lessons from some guy
my dad found online.

15
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,631
He came personally recommended
from the guy who runs

16
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,648
the warlock conference
up in Modesto.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

18
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,358
Ocupado, big guy.

19
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,761
Find another foxhole.

20
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:22,949
This is how we learn to sing.

21
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:26,969
Who can go up here with me?

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,384
Cam took a job teaching music
at the local middle school.

23
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:31,901
Yeah, his first day is tomorrow.

24
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:33,534
I'm excited for me,

25
00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:35,679
but I'm probably
more excited for the students

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,822
because a great teacher is a gift.

27
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:39,073
Hasn't started yet.

28
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:41,626
I have to tip my hat to my
High School music teacher...

29
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:43,530
A real force of nature
who was also

30
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,823
the defensive coordinator
for the football team

31
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:49,005
and supervised calf birthing
for the animal husbandry club.

32
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,103
Doris Olson.
Great lady.

33
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:53,362
Lady.

34
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:58,052
This is how... we learn to sing

35

36
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:19,387
Ay, Jay, I'm going to miss you.

37
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,174
It's one night.

38
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,899
No, I don't want
to be without you,

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,641
not even one night
in my whole life.

40
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,386
What can I make you?

41
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:28,507
How about a little room
on my side of the bed?

42
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,512
I mean, I shouldn't complain.
My wife's a knockout. But...

43
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,434
She's at that place
in her pregnancy

44
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:36,031
where, she's, you know... ample.

45
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:37,240
And the snoring.

46
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,570
I swear in the last ultrasound,
the baby was like this...

47
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:44,259
So I should be home
about noon tomorrow.

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,378
Who drank all the coffee?

49
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,466
Oh, I, uh, I had
quite a bit of that.

50
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,169
You know, I haven't, um,
been sleeping too well.

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,278
There's actually a funny story
about what's causing that.

52
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:56,791
Mom, I'm fully aware of the changes
your body is going through,

53
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,528
and that nasal stuffiness
is very common during pregnancy,

54
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,305
but we got a crisis in this house.

55
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,727
You've been snoring.
But I got you these nasal strips.

56
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:04,555
In the commercial,

57
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:07,244
the old man's angry red
sound waves turn a gentle blue.

58
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,912
- So I'm like an old man?
- No!

59
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,065
Like a dog then? A pig?

60
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:15,255
What is it, Manny?
I'm an old man, a dog, or a pig?

61
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,529
Jay, help me out here.
You've heard it.

62
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,112
I don't know what
the boy's talking about.

63
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:21,600
If this is a glimpse of teenage
Manny, I don't love it.

64
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,687
Have a little respect
for your beautiful mother.

65
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,970
Thank you, Jay.

66
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,971
You're right. Sorry, mom.

67
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,260
And, Jay,

68
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:32,004
have a great trip
to San Francisco.

69
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,720
Okay, Lily's drop-off time
is between 8:45 and 8:50,

70
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:40,827
so you should be fine
to get to work by 9.

71
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:43,603
Here is her checklist
for her backpack.

72
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,656
Uh, wow.

73
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,253
Oh, I have this
whole thing planned.

74
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:47,339
Okay, I'm gonna walk in,
take off my jacket,

75
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,831
and say, "here comes treble."

76
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,303
Big swing on the first day.

77
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,114
Please don't tamp down
my enthusiasm.

78
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:52,730
Okay, what else?

79
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,485
Oh! The dimmer came in
for the switch,

80
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:56,362
so I want you to call
the electrician, but not Brad.

81
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:58,386
Remember? We had a problem
with him last time about the billing.

82
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,925
He wanted his name
above the title?

83
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:02,217
Yes, you've done that joke before.
So cute. So funny.

84
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:02,951
What else? Oh!

85
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,281
Lily needs to get a present
for Gio's birthday party.

86
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:06,465
And don't be thrown
by the invitation.

87
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:08,316
It is a pirates party,
not a pilates party.

88
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,665
Now sit.
I wanna talk juice boxes.

89
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,426
Cam. Cam, I know
what's happening here.

90
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:14,373
You're feeling very anxious
about your first day at work,

91
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:16,852
and you're focusing that
anxiety on my day with Lily.

92
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:17,747
Really? Are you sure I'm not

93
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,305
completely confident
about my first day

94
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,362
because it's gonna be a home run,

95
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,811
and I am worried about you
because you're taking on

96
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,340
a little bit more
of the Lily load?

97
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,396
Don't be scared, sweetie.
Mwah!

98
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,537
She's not scared!
Wh-wh-what are you doing?

99
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,358
- Just call me if you need me.
- I won't!

100
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,065
And thank you for managing
my expectations today.

101
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:34,442
- Not necessary.
- I saw you practicing a bow last night.

102
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:35,583
That was just in fun.

103
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:37,634
You know, I highly doubt
some teenagers are gonna

104
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,373
throw rose petals at my feet.

105
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:40,430
Yeah.

106
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:42,113
But I wouldn't be surprised

107
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,347
if I got slow-clapped out
of my first class.

108
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:46,794
Wrong.

109
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,145
I am thinking.

110
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:48,996
If you were thinking,

111
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,710
you wouldn't have Seattle
as the capital of Washington.

112
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,548
Oh. Yeah.

113
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:54,680
It's Spokane.

114
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:56,916
Sure, which makes the 11th
President of the United States

115
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,202
"James K. Pslk."

116
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:00,688
Okay, Alex, stop.
I'm trying to figure this out.

117
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:03,490
Buzz. Time's up, dummy.
It's Olympia.

118
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,599
Make sure you sound out
the big scary words.

119
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,955
Mom, something's on my mind,
and it's really bothering me.

120
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,869
Yeah, it's really bothering me, too,

121
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,517
but I think it's gonna be rich,
so we better be nice to it.

122
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,918
I wanna quit magic.

123
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:20,093
What?

124
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:21,898
I'm not really interested anymore,

125
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,627
but I don't think dad's
gonna be happy.

126
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:25,714
Oh, sweetheart. Don't worry
about disappointing your father.

127
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:28,181
He only wants you
to do it if you wanna do it.

128
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,198
Tell you what.
I will talk to dad--

129
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,943
Whoa! Talk to dad?
That sounds serious.

130
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,583
Don't do drugs.

131
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,760
Stay in school.

132
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,737
Luke wants to quit magic.

133
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,806
That's not happening.

134
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,623
Well, see you guys at dinner.

135
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,631
Sweetheart, don't you even
want to talk about this?

136
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,407
What's to talk about?
The kid's a natural.

137
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:47,775
He has everything--
the hands, the patter, the outfits.

138
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,041
Okay, let's play this out.

139
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,458
Even if he is one in a million,

140
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,894
what's our best case scenario here?

141
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,963
He becomes, what...

142
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:56,111
- A professional magician!
- A professional magician?

143
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,104
Honey, the boy has a gift.

144
00:05:58,105 --> 00:05:59,594
You wanna just throw that away?

145
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:01,197
I don't think it's about
throwing it away.

146
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:01,826
I think it's about
you pushing him--

147
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,491
Don't I get a say in any of this?

148
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,013
I'm sorry I don't like magic
as much as you, but I don't.

149
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:07,029
This isn't about magic.

150
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,347
No, it's about my life
and you controlling it.

151
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:12,083
Look, you made a commitment.
You will honor that commitment.

152
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:13,548
Ugh! I hate it here!

153
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,959
Luke!

154
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:28,496
All right, young ladies
and gentlemen,

155
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,181
if I can have
your attention, please.

156
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,128
Let's settle down

157
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,755
and let's say a temporary
good-bye to your neighbor

158
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:37,209
and to life as you know it,
because here comes treble.

159
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,108
That's right, my friends,
we got treble,

160
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:40,691
right here at Franklin Middle.

161
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:42,618
I'm Cameron T.,
and that rhymes with "g,"

162
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,163
and that stands for "good morning"!

163
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,257
Huh? Yes! Love the enthusiasm.
Go ahead. First question.

164
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,257
When's Mr. Namagachi
coming back?

165
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,818
Okay, Mr. namagachi
isn't coming back,

166
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,547
but there is somebody that
I'd like to introduce you to.

167
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,930
Don't know that you properly met.

168
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,659
She's a good friend of mine,

169
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,487
and she goes
by the name of "music."

170
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:08,303
And sometimes my friend music
can be shy.

171
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,415
Sometimes she can be angry!

172
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,291
Huh?
Sometimes she can be playful.

173
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,322
And sometimes
she can be downright a-funky!

174
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:27,989
Train wreck.

175
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,022
There's no way
he ran this past Mitchell.

176
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,570
Daddy always parks
in the back of the school.

177
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,092
I know, sweetie, but, uh,

178
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,099
- those spots were all taken.
- Because we're late?

179
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,284
No, we're, like, a minute late,
and that's 'cause of traffic.

180
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,077
And because I tipped over

181
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:44,709
you didn't snap my car seat right.

182
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,381
Okay, well, it certainly
didn't hurt your memory any.

183
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,879
All right, here's your lunch.

184
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,351
You spilled it!

185
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,188
Oh! Why is the top open?

186
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,580
Daddy always zips it for me.

187
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:55,868
Maybe you should zip it.

188
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,147
I heard that.

189
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,031
So with just a few
more minutes left--

190
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,971
- Mr. Namagachi--
- Used to work here,

191
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,540
but he got fired, okay?

192
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,841
So now let's form an orchestra

193
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,824
made up of
my favorite instruments--

194
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:08,049
your beautiful bodies.

195
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,924
Gettin' creepy.

196
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:12,021
Okay, so you guys are gonna be
my, uh, table slappers.

197
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,174
You're my bass line.

198
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,393
Okay, and you're gonna be
mouth trumpeters in the back

199
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,382
with the melody.

200
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,276
Okay, now let's
bring it all together.

201
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,565
One, two, three.

202
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,956
The bass line is a little--
a little softer.

203
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,159
Okay, louder with
the mouth trumpets.

204
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,256
Okay. Great.
Well, thank you so much.

205
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,282
And, um, I thought
it was a great first day.

206
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:35,175
And I love
the give-and-take, everyone.

207
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,272
And, um...

208
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,712
Hey, dad. How's Frisco?

209
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,128
My meetings ended early.

210
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,687
I didn't even have
to spend the night.

211
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:48,951
And don't say "Frisco."

212
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,656
They hate it
when you call it "frisco."

213
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:51,461
How do you know what they hate?

214
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,783
You've been there
two times in your life.

215
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,759
Anyway, I haven't slept in a week.

216
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,442
Gloria's snoring
like a water buffalo.

217
00:08:57,443 --> 00:09:00,504
Aw. Well, she's pregnant.
It's uncomfortable.

218
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:03,732
What, she put on 15? 20? 25? 30?

219
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,912
We're not doing this again.
How do I bring it up?

220
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,509
Well, for starters, you don't.

221
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,527
You suck it up.

222
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,385
Dad, your hot wife

223
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,987
who was learning to walk
when you were 30 years old,

224
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,651
is pregnant with
a baby you conceived

225
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,548
doing something
most men would kill to do.

226
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:22,916
- I'm just so tired.
- It's a small sacrifice

227
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,526
compared to what
she's going through.

228
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:28,103
Poor thing, what with the extra...
30? 35? 40? 45?

229
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:29,136
We're done.

230
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:30,751
All right, here we go.
How's this?

231
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,295
That's not the kind we get.

232
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:33,303
Okay.

233
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,670
Hello? Hey, Cam.

234
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,397
Just checking in on me again?

235
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:40,325
Yeah. Just wanted
to see if you got Lily.

236
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:41,819
Yeah, we're--we're just--
we're at the grocery store,

237
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,212
having a great time.

238
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:47,219
Oh. Yeah.
Any questions about the...

239
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,052
About the grocery list?

240
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,774
No, we're just
picking up the granola.

241
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,872
So how was it?
How was the big debut?

242
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:55,787
Was it a comfortable ride
around the schoolyard

243
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:57,235
on the shoulders of the children?

244
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,142
Well, I stood and delivered.

245
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,919
Thank you for sarcastically asking.

246
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,010
Yeah.

247
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,233
Okay, did you call the electrician
about the dimmer?

248
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,228
Yes. Yeah.

249
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,061
Yeah, I'm on the other line
with him right now.

250
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,265
Oh, well, I should
probably let you go.

251
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,583
Keep your eye on Lily.
She has a tendency to wander off.

252
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:14,036
Cam... uh, wh-wh--I'm--
I'm totally capable of...

253
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,443
- You lost her, didn't you?
- No. No, no, no, no.

254
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:18,617
No, she is right next to me.
Hi, honey.

255
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,690
I can hear it in your voice.
Look in the dairy case.

256
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:23,471
Cam, do you honestly think
that I would lose...

257
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:25,130
The doors don't pull.
They slide.

258
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,321
You never saw me.

259
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,349
Thank you very much.

260
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:57,766
Hey.

261
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,282
Look, um, I thought about it,

262
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,956
and if you really want to,
you can quit magic.

263
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,498
You just have
to do one thing first--

264
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:09,088
execute the Butler's escape.

265
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,263
It goes without saying
that the Butler's escape

266
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,697
is one of the most challenging
feats of escapology

267
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,223
an illusionist can perform.

268
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,505
It's-- it's based, of course,
on the well-known story

269
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,414
of the Earl of Flanning's
manservant Percy,

270
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:21,559
who was imprisoned
in the Tower of London,

271
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:24,061
and as we all know,
refused to take off his uniform

272
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:25,088
when he was shackled.

273
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,602
Famously, as the, uh,
tower guard Gert slept,

274
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:31,300
Percy freed himself and
leapt over the sleeping guard,

275
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,749
giving rise to
the popular expression...

276
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:37,862
"Percy jumped the Gert."

277
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:41,488
Why are you making me
do this stupid trick?

278
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,311
I think you're quitting...

279
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,857
because magic's getting hard,

280
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,945
and that's not a good reason
for quitting anything.

281
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,227
But...

282
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,731
if you can do this,

283
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,865
then I'll know that
you genuinely don't like it,

284
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:53,512
and you'll have my blessing
to pursue other interests.

285
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:55,975
No strings attached.

286
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,041
Sorry, buddy.

287
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:58,073
- Ow!
- I'm so sorry.

288
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:00,381
You're kidding, right?

289
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:02,686
You cannot really be
enjoying that stupid show.

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,975
I was changing channels.

291
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,067
God. Why are you so mean lately?

292
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:07,384
Is something wrong with you?

293
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,637
Is it that obvious?

294
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,558
Oh, my gosh. Come on.
You can talk to me.

295
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,890
- Well...
- Mm-hmm?

296
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:16,410
- There's this girl at school, and...
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,522
She got pregnant.

298
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:19,797
No.

299
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,062
I know.
I've been trying to help her,

300
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,356
but with all the pills she's taking,
she kinda lashes out.

301
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:25,585
Oh, honey, this is too much
for you to take on alone.

302
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,554
- Where are the parents?
- They're no help.

303
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,988
Dad's all consumed with
his plastic surgery business,

304
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,909
and her mom's an ex-model
who's trying to launch a music career.

305
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,565
You're describing the show
I was just watching, right?

306
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,582
I'm just saying,
mix in a book every now and then.

307
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:38,262
Mean! Mean!

308
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,813
Try to see this
from my perspective.

309
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:41,894
I can't.

310
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,560
I'm not raising a quitter.

311
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:45,976
Trust me.
I know what's best for you.

312
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,847
And watch your time.
In the stage version,

313
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,485
the rope's on fire, and
you're suspended over a bed of nails.

314
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,731
I hate this!
Why are you making me do this?

315
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:54,957
Use that anger, Lukini.

316
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,055
Let it be the key that
opens the vault of fear...

317
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,885
that holds the chalice of hope

318
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:04,386
that contains
the elixir of success.

319
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:06,187
In a few short minutes...

320
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:10,933
Son of Alkazeel!
You've done it!

321
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,153
I quit.

322
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,370
So how was your first day?
Tell me everything.

323
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,820
Well, you know,
it was a lovefest.

324
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,894
And the kids-- they were,
you know, and...

325
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:29,582
Is that a roast?

326
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,134
W-- yes. Yes. But I'm surprised
you could smell it over the

327
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,986
no-dairy yellow pepper bisque
with cheesy croutons.

328
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,019
Oh, wow. You had time
to do a roast and soup.

329
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,252
- Hi, daddy!
- Hi, angel!

330
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,149
How are you?
Did you miss daddy?

331
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,434
Wow. Bathed and braided.

332
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:46,381
Yeah. Let me just put you
in a more flattering light here.

333
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:47,865
- The dimmer.
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:48,825
Who'd you call?

335
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,738
I called myself 'cause I did it.

336
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:54,053
Yeah, I had time after
picking up Gio's present,

337
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:56,010
so, uh...
Go show daddy what it is.

338
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,212
Okay. Yeah.

339
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:00,453
It sounds like you had a
pretty successful day yourself.

340
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,369
Well, it's just a matter
of being organized.

341
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,650
But who am I telling, huh?

342
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:05,331
You do this sort
of stuff every day.

343
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,598
Oh, blow on that.

344
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,171
So tell me more about the kids.

345
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,121
Well, it was as I predicted,
you know.

346
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,649
They just needed somebody
to come in there

347
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,704
and bring music back to life.

348
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:16,650
And, you know, that person was...

349
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:18,406
That person was...

350
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:20,756
It's not me!

351
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,445
What's happening?

352
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:23,022
It was a disaster, Mitchell.

353
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:26,078
They hated me!
Not just the kids, the teachers.

354
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,346
They wouldn't sit with me at lunch.
I had to sit alone.

355
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,459
Oh, honey.

356
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,785
And my sweater--
the shop teacher spilled juice on it.

357
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:34,344
He said it was an accident,
but it wasn't an accident.

358
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:36,297
- It's okay.
- It's not okay!

359
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,913
I failed miserably.

360
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:40,431
And look at you.
You did everything so perfectly.

361
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,136
Well, yes.

362
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:44,577
And-- and-- and no.

363
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:46,720
Look, look, I... I gotta tell ya.

364
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:49,152
Uh... I've just been watching

365
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,383
how you've done things
all these years,

366
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:51,856
and I just perfected it.

367
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,738
- Oh, please, Mitchell!
- Claire...

368
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,971
Cam, he was every bit
the failure you were.

369
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,993
He was late picking up Lily.
She was in with the custodians.

370
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:00,946
The only thing he had less
to do with than dinner

371
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,349
was the dimmer.

372
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:05,942
And her hair was in braids
because there was gum in it.

373
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:07,682
And... why are we hugging?

374
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:09,500
Because I know
if he called you for help

375
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,893
and heard as many insults
as I know he had to hear,

376
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,381
then he had
a worse day than me.

377
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,231
Oh, she was horrible, Cam.

378
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,503
- Oh! You know what? It's gonna get better.
- No, I know.

379
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,510
We just need some time
to settle into these new roles.

380
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:21,169
You were right
to lower my expectations.

381
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,881
I just wish I had lowered mine.

382
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:27,198
This gonna work its way around
to a "thank you," ladies?

383
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:37,839
Hey, honey.

384
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,907
Surprise! I'm in San Francisco!

385
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:40,596
What?

386
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:43,326
I dropped Manny at a friend's and,
I know it's crazy,

387
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,208
but I hopped
on a plane and I'm here!

388
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,474
I'm driving to the hotel.

389
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,211
That is so great.

390
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,965
The thing is, honey,
I'm not here right now.

391
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:53,165
See, I'm, uh, I'm out at dinner.

392
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:55,549
Probably won't be back for, um...

393
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:57,942
Oh, I don't know.
A couple of hours.

394
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,495
It's okay.
I'll wait for you there.

395
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,759
Don't be silly. How often
do you get to San Francisco?

396
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:04,575
There's so much to see there.

397
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,042
I mean, here.

398
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:08,911
Ghirardelli square?
 Fisherman's wharf?

399
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:11,525
Alcatraz?
Hey, take that segway tour.

400
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,119
That's a great way
to see the city.

401
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,018
And when you get the chowder,

402
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,811
make sure it's one
of those bread bowls.

403
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,339
You can eat the bowl.

404
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,758
Yeah, it's a story
you'll tell for a lifetime.

405
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:26,904
You know what?
Later on...

406
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:29,479
Maybe we can watch some
of your Lance Burton DVDs.

407
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,890
Thanks. I think I just
wanna try this escape.

408
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:34,154
Would you mind tightening my arms?

409
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,324
Oh. Sure. Here.

410
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,738
- It's just hard, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,710
It's the first time he hasn't
shared one of my interests.

412
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,858
It's scary to think that this is
the start of us growing apart.

413
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:45,836
Oh, honey,
it's probably just a phase.

414
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,106
Alex is going through
something right now.

415
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,448
I wish I could figure that out.

416
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,633
- I can't breathe.
- Anxiety.

417
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,462
No, no, I'm--
I'm fighting the jacket.

418
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,059
The key to this escape is balance.

419
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,275
The whole thing is based
on the idea of opposing forces

420
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:58,957
holding each other in check.

421
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:00,816
That actually makes some sense.

422
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:03,814
Some sense?

423
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,867
There are two things
I know with dead certainty--

424
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,030
how to shoulder roll
out of a human pyramid,

425
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,202
and the black arts
of the Butler's escape.

426
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:13,654
No, honey, our house
is out of balance

427
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:16,722
because Alex is missing
her opposing force.

428
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:17,843
Mm? Yeah.

429
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,682
Oh. Y-you're missing out.

430
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:22,661
Some people describe
this escape as visual poetry.

431
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:26,837
Honey?

432
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,567
Oh, no.

433
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:37,354
Gloria.

434
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,404
You told me that
you were in Frisco,

435
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:41,848
and you were here in a hotel?

436
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,172
Let me just say one thing.

437
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:44,778
Don't say "Frisco."
They hate that.

438
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:46,674
And how the hell
did you find me?

439
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,666
The house has been
a little noisy lately,

440
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,480
and the school library
is a pickup scene.

441
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:52,575
So where does a kid go
for some peace and quiet?

442
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:05,390
Tell me right now
if you're having an affair,

443
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:08,004
and we will find some time
later for me to kill you.

444
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,108
No. I'm just trying to have
one night away from your snoring.

445
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:13,501
You came to a hotel to sleep?

446
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:16,227
I'm exhausted, and I didn't want
to hurt your feelings,

447
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,106
but you're huge and you're loud.

448
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:20,003
It's like sleeping
with Rush Limbaugh.

449
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,836
And I didn't want to bring it up
because I figured

450
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,682
you'd get mad at me the way
you got mad at Manny.

451
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,694
I am not mad at you because
you told me that I snore.

452
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:29,142
I am mad at you because
you didn't say anything.

453
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,495
'Cause I didn't want
to get yelled at.

454
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,735
Well, too bad.

455
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,129
When you're married to me,

456
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,698
you're going to get
yelled at many times.

457
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:37,874
And you're tough
enough to take it.

458
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,404
That's what I love
about our marriage.

459
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:42,126
We can say whatever we want,

460
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:44,007
but the next day,
we're still there.

461
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:45,707
That's what I like about it, too.

462
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,608
Ah. What am I gonna say
you couldn't forgive me?

463
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,116
There are things, Jay.

464
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:51,333
You ready to go?

465
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:53,956
I was thinking,
it's such a shame

466
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,741
that this hotel room
is going to go to waste.

467
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,268
I like where this is headed.

468
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:02,340
Make Manny some pasta.
I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?

469
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:07,421
Hey, dad.

470
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,517
Hey, buddy.

471
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,759
Look, I-I'm sorry if I--

472
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,159
No, no, no, no.
Don't apologize.

473
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,174
There's still plenty of stuff
we can do together.

474
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,081
So if you want out,

475
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:20,178
you are... out!

476
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,600
Uh, I know we bought
a lot of magic stuff,

477
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:27,261
but we can return some of it--

478
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:31,213
Merlin's hat, the gloves,
most of the capes.

479
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:32,717
What about Houdini's wands?

480
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:35,443
Uh... they kinda got broken.

481
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,999
All three? What happened?
I got you carbon fiber.

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,176
Some kids were messing around
with them at school.

483
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:42,291
What do you mean?
What-- what were they doing?

484
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,100
I don't really want
to talk about it.

485
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,752
You know, I went through that,

486
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,468
kids-- kids messing with my stuff.

487
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:53,872
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. In High School,

488
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,377
when I first got nominated
for junior tumbling congress,

489
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:59,323
my parents had to sign a...
release!

490
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,061
Anyway, my buddy Dizzy Brindizzi

491
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,962
saw it, grabbed it,
and made a lot of fun of me.

492
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,191
I thought about not going.

493
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,384
But you did.

494
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:14,434
Oh, yeah. Had a blast.

495
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,811
Made a lot of friends,

496
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,255
shared milkshakes with more
than one female tumbler.

497
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,611
The minute I stopped caring
what other people thought

498
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:24,004
and started doing what
I wanted to do, is the minute

499
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,376
I finally felt... free!

500
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:32,837
Buddy...

501
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,272
You're gonna make your own choices,

502
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,753
and whatever you decide,
I'll always support you.

503
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,133
You're not just saying all this
'cause you're stuck, right?

504
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:45,262
Nothing you decide
will ever disappoint me.

505
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,317
Thanks, dad.

506
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:50,208
Relax your arms,

507
00:20:50,523 --> 00:20:52,107
roll your shoulders forward,

508
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,490
bend down your head,

509
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,523
exhale...

510
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:55,684
and then arch.

511
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:00,504
- Uh...
- It sorta worked.

512
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:14,456
Well, honey, I just wanted
to check in and say hi.

513
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,712
Alex, come say hi to your sister!

514
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,065
I love you so much.

515
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,527
What's up, lady?

516
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,129
Oh, my God. You did not just say,
"what's up, lady?"

517
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,367
What's wrong with you?

518
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,407
I was just saying hello--

519
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,375
Oh, it's like the lamest thing
you've ever said.

520
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,266
And what is that shirt?
What are you, a flapper?

521
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,457
I just bought it
at that store that you--

522
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,408
Oh, where? Forever 1921?

523
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:32,973
And what is going on
with your hair?

524
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:34,318
What's wrong with my hair?

525
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,624
Oh, you should just dip
yourself in boy repellent.

526
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,113
Shut up! Mom!

527
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,624
And balance...

528
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,131
is restored.

529
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:47,931
