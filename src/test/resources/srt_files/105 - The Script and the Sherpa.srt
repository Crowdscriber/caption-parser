3
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,500
Do you guys not see the problem here?

4
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,200
Vince said she was staying a couple
of nights, all right? A couple is two.

5
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,700
Except in Utah.

6
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,500
Look at him. Stop doing fucking yoga, man.
It's embarrassing.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
- She thinks she's his trainer.
- So do you.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
What? I'm not?

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
What the fuck did I get certified for then?

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Relax, Drama, you're his trainer.

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
It's all a big joke to E, because he's been
sleeping off campus at Emily's.

12
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,500
What, you got a low-jack on me, Turtle?

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
You guys are both gonna get girlfriends,
and you're gonna fuck everything up.

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,800
Quiet, here they come.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,200
How was yoga?

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,300
- Great. Fiona is a great teacher.
- Thanks, baby.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
All right.
You ready for a real workout, Vince?

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,000
No weights. I just had a mean stretch.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Vince, you got to hit the weights
if you want to put on size.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bulk is so '90s, Johnny.
It's all about flexibility, don't you think?

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
No, I don't.

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,000
We'll catch you later.
We're gonna go grab breakfast.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Bye, guys.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
I don't trust that New Age bullshit.

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,000
Me, neither,
even if it is attached to an ass like that.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Yo, E. What up, dawg?

27
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,400
Not much. How about you?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Never better.

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Who's that jerkoff?

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,500
No clue.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,300
Yankees playing the Angels Tuesday.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,600
I got the company box
if you want to roll with.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Got the gals from {y:i}The L Word coming.
Trust me, they're only acting.

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,000
Not trying to be an asshole or anything,
but do we know each other?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Are you kidding me? Josh Weinstein, Triad.
We met at the fight.

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, yeah, okay. All right.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,700
Do me a favor.
Put a towel on or something. Cover up.

38
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,800
Not a locker room guy. No problem.

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,900
So listen, E,
I didn't want to interrupt Vince's workout...

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
but I got a great piece of material.

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Would you do me a favor
and have him take a look?

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,900
You got to understand, the guy gets
hundreds of scripts a week, you know that.

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,800
Yet this is something special. It kicks ass.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,300
It's gritty as shit. You'll love it.
I guarantee Vince will flip.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Tell Vince it was a great move
passing on {y:i}Matterhorn, too.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,600
- You think?
- Yeah. Script is a piece of shit.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
It's not a movie, it's a theme park ride.
There's no characters.

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,200
- That's what I said.
- But Ari pushed hard for that one.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,500
- Yeah.
- You know he doesn't read, right?

50
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Anyway, man, this one is different.
Takes place in your old neighborhood.

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
- Queens, right?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,300
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi, sweetheart.

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,300
My God. I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,300
- Come on, Monica.
- I'm done talking to you, Turtle.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,300
You were supposed to hook me up
with some weed two days ago.

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,600
The whole town is dry, believe me.
I'm not holding out on you.

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,900
What are you looking at?

58
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,500
These Uggs, they're great,
but I can't find them anywhere.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
I can get those for you in two seconds...

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
just give me the size and the style number.

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,000
Hey, Shauna. What up?

62
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,900
I have an apparel request for Vince.

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,300
He needs a pair of Uggs
for his lady friend ASAP.

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Yeah.

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
You don't have a weed guy, do you?

66
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,500
- What are you doing?
- Just reading a script.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,000
- Any good?
- It's great so far.

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,800
So that's your job? You read some scripts
and tell Vince which the good ones are?

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Yes, something like that.

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
That's a really cool job.
So did you go to school for that?

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,500
No.

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,100
I love to read.
I read all the Harry Potter books and...

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,100
I don't know. If you need a second opinion,
don't hesitate.

75
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,900
Okay. Cool.

76
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,000
- All right.
- Thanks.

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,600
Don't get mad,
but I think she's stealing food.

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
- She's not stealing food.
- Shit keeps disappearing from the fridge.

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
Did have an eye on the meatloaf, vanish.

80
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,400
I know how these kleptos work.
First it's the food, then it's the plasma.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,000
All right. She didn't steal it,
she threw it away.

82
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,900
- Thrown it away, why?
- She's vegan.

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Means she's into a cruelty-free lifestyle.

84
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,200
It's cruel to throw away
a $65.00 steak from Morton's.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Just do me a favor, and keep the meat
out of her eye line while she's around.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Look, she's already got him
wearing cloth shoes.

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,900
These are my slippers. They are the ones
he stole from the Four Seasons, Maui.

88
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,300
Those are the slippers? Where's the robe?

89
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,900
Fiona just dropped the robe at the pool
and had nothing on underneath.

90
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
- She's naked at the pool?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,400
- And you were looking at her?
- She's naked at the pool.

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,700
- How's she look?
- Good enough to eat, I bet.

93
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,900
- Yeah.
- Too bad Vince can't eat animal products.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm going up. You mind?

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,300
- Yeah, I mind.
- Sue me, I'm going.

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,700
- Vince.
- Did you call the Hack?

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,900
- Yeah. He's got nothing.
- How can the whole town be out of weed?

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,300
Hack said the drought dried up the crops.
It ain't on me. Peace.

99
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,500
- Three days, Vince. Don't bend the rules.
- I made the rules.

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
- Can we talk about something important?
- This is important, it's a lifestyle issue.

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,200
Did you see the picture
of the swami in the bathroom?

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
It's her guru.

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't like the way he looks at me
when I'm pissing.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
- I found your next movie, Vince.
- Yeah?

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,000
The script is awesome,
you got to read it now.

106
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,200
Vince, I need you.

107
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll read it later. All she wants to do is fuck.

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,500
The idea is to get as close as possible
without actually touching.

109
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,200
How long do we have to go for?

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,700
The longer we hold out, the better the sex.

111
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,000
Sometimes great masters hold out for years.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But they're up in the mountains somewhere
by themselves, whacking off like crazy.

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,000
Vince, read that script?

114
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,300
I'm sorry, baby, I'm on a tight schedule.

115
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,200
Here you go, Turtle.
Now you have to stop bothering me.

116
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Thanks, Shauna.
Vince's lady friend is going to love these.

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
- These are not Taiwanese knockoffs?
- Would I do that to you?

118
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,800
No, those are real goods.
Look at the sheepskin.

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,400
You can tell these were born
and raised in the outback.

120
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,100
- Thanks a mil, Shauna.
- Don't thank me, thank Christy.

122
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,000
Christy.

123
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

124
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
If you ever need anything, you know,
concert tickets, pedicure...

125
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,500
- full body massage...
- How about a stun gun?

126
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
All right.

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
Shauna, what's with the photographer?

128
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,500
I told you, I don't want Vince
posing on these things.

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
I called back and said...

130
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,500
if he wants the Harley,
he has to take a picture on it.

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,900
- We never had that discussion.
- I had it with Turtle.

132
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,700
- And I spoke with Vince.
- That's all I give a shit about:

133
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,200
What Vincent wants. So don't fuck with me
like you're fucking with Ari.

134
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey, Eric, I read it, it's awesome.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,700
- Read what?
- The script, it's so good.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,900
- You read it?
- God, it even made me cry. Right, Vince?

137
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, it did.

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Hey, Shauna, just so you know.
Look, you know I love you...

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,200
- but I can't take a picture on that thing.
- Turtle said you'd do it.

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,500
It's just my girl, she's really conscious
about the environment...

141
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,400
she thinks it sends the wrong message.

142
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,200
I mean, she doesn't mind riding around
in your Hummer. What is she thinking?

143
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,700
I don't know what she is thinking,
but I can't be hassled.

144
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,000
Vince, you're totally fucking me on this.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,300
I'll take the picture.

146
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,400
What am I going to do
with your fucking picture?

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,900
Give me back those Uggs.
I know they're not for him, you fat midget.

148
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,000
You're going to have to pull them
from my cold, dead hands.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Oh, really?

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Good boy, Arnold.

151
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,100
- What are you doing?
- You didn't call bank shot.

152
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,900
- I did. You didn't hear me.
- You got to learn to project.

153
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,300
You hire a vocal coach,
you become a real asshole.

154
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,800
E, the script's great.

155
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,100
- You read it?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,300
- How many pages?
- The whole thing.

157
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,000
Right. How does it end?

158
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,600
What are you, an asshole?

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
I tell you I got your next movie,
you ignore me...

160
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,300
Fiona likes it, you read it in an hour?

161
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,800
- I read it, what's the difference?
- I don't know, but there is one.

162
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
Don't worry about that. Let's get it together.

163
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,300
Call Ari and find out
why he doesn't know about it.

164
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,600
- Yeah. Go call Ari, get us paid.
- Shut up, Turtle.

165
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,800
Vince, you seen any juicy parts for me?

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,500
- Maybe you could play his father.
- Fuck you.

167
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
- Ari Gold's office.
- Hey.

168
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,400
{y:i}- Hey, you left your wallet at my house.
- Did I?

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,700
Yes. Is that your way of saying
you want to come back?

170
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
{y:i}Sort of, yeah.

171
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,200
We read a script that we love.
Any way Ari is free for lunch?

172
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
{y:i}Like in December.

173
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,600
Hold on.
Let me just take care of something for you.

174
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,700
All right, I just rescheduled
Anthony LaPaglia.

175
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,300
- Thanks.
{y:i}- I'll see you tonight?

176
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,600
- Okay. Bye.
{y:i}- Bye.

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,300
- Pussy.
- Faggot.

178
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Yeah, I'll get the Full Mung Bean Meatloaf.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Okay.

180
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,000
What the fuck are we doing here?
I'm on Atkins, I need protein.

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,300
Come on, there's plenty of protein
in mung beans.

182
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I'm talking about real proteins,
like man protein.

183
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,100
Like from the flesh of slaughtered animals.

184
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Got to have war paint on them,
blood dripping. It's what I need.

185
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Have you seen a video
of a slaughterhouse, Ari?

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Meat is murder.

187
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,300
Even broccoli screams
when you rip it from the ground.

188
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,500
Enough about the fucking menu.
Can we talk about {y:i}Queens Boulevard?

189
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,300
- Yeah Ari, I really want to do this.
- It's the best script I ever read.

190
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
- She's reading your scripts now?
- Vince asked me to.

191
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
He did?

192
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you guys have a problem with that?

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, if you don't mind it not being printed
on recycled paper.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
What's the matter, E?

195
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,500
Did the big words overwhelm you?
Had to pass it along?

196
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
Well, I read it.
You didn't even know about it.

197
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,000
I knew about it.
You think you knew about it and I didn't?

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,800
You think there is anything in this universe
that you know, that I don't know?

199
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,700
- Vince, can I talk to you, please?
- Yeah.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,300
First rule of being a manager:
Control the star's fucking girlfriend.

201
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,200
'Cause Yoko Ono is macro-psychotic.

202
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
- What's wrong?
- Heard what he said about meat.

203
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
I know, baby, I'm sorry.

204
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,400
I don't know, I'm gonna wait outside.

205
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,500
- Your agent is a karmic disaster.
- Okay, I'll see you out there.

206
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,300
- I'll be like five minutes.
- All right.

207
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,400
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could take a picture with us.

208
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,700
Sure, why not.

209
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,700
Hey, idiot, you know that Scott Wick
is my best friend.

210
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,400
Who is Scott Wick, asshole?

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,700
He is the producer of the movie,
you dumb fuck.

212
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Then it should be fucking easy,
don't you think, douche bag?

213
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,400
No, Eric, it shouldn't,
because what you don't know...

214
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,000
you little garlic knot-making motherfucker...

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,100
is that Wick hates Vince.

216
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,900
You got him excited about the script,
how'd you like to break that news to him?

217
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,500
Okay, I'll do that.

218
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,400
The producer of the movie thinks you suck.

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,800
Now what, Ari?

220
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,800
Is it all right if I hang out with you guys?

221
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
It's a free sidewalk.

222
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,300
- Bite?
- No, thank you.

223
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,300
You're telling me you can't find anyone
on the West Coast who has a joint?

224
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,800
You're slacking, Hack.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,400
He's sending a recon team up to
Humboldt County, but he's not hopeful.

226
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,700
You guys in need of weed?

227
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,000
What do you know about it?

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I got a Sherpa who grows 100% organic.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
No herbicides, no pesticides.

230
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,500
Like we are going all the way to Everest
to score weed from your Sherpa.

231
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Come on, you guys.

232
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
He doesn't live in Everest anymore,
he lives in Bel Air.

233
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,900
What's a Sherpa?

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,900
This guy sells weed out of his house?

235
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,500
Yeah, even the carpet is made out of hemp.
It's cool.

236
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Just stepped in shit.

237
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
Come on, guys.

238
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,000
Holy shit.

239
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,600
Field of fucking dreams.

240
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,100
I said check the resins
in the vegetation chamber.

241
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,500
It's the new thing with lights on.

242
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,200
- Hey, baby.
- Dakatoka!

243
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
How're you doing?

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's her channel name.
Fiona's channel name is Dakatoka.

245
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,200
You are an ancient wisdom giver.

246
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,000
Who, Fiona is?

247
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,300
Johnny Drama?

248
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
I'm Johnny Drama.

249
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm a fan, man.

250
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,000
When's the next season
of {y:i}Viking Quest, dude?

251
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
It got cancelled seven years ago.

252
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,500
Euridice, Atena,
we're gonna have a little tea...

254
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
mix some ancient Mayan mule shit.

255
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,300
It's hybrid.

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Drama.

257
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,900
Earth is moving.

258
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Did you feel that?

259
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Everything all the time.

260
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,900
There's dimensions we can't even see.

261
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,300
Everything is evolving...

262
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Turtle, you are a dove.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,700
That's cool. Can I hit that, Sherp? Thanks.

264
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
Aren't you afraid of getting busted?

265
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,700
Busted, I'm entrusted.

266
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't steal, I heal.

267
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Not getting stoned, getting honed.

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,000
My probation officer
is one of my best customers.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm a prisoner of war.

270
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,700
War on drugs.

271
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,900
Sounds so negative, man.

272
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,500
I mean the man's most positive,
positive "tive" is a negative.

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,500
It's a mega negative.

274
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Right?

275
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,200
Fight grass!

276
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Let them be low, we are getting high.

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,300
We're not getting fucked down...

278
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
we're getting fucked up.

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,500
That's awesome.
I think that went out, though.

280
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,700
Don't touch that!

281
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,100
It's cool, Finley, cell phone.

282
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
- Is it cool?
- Please, enjoy.

283
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm vibrating.

284
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,400
Hello.

285
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Call me Helen Keller,
'cause I'm a fucking miracle worker.

286
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,300
7:00 at Maestros...

287
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,700
you're gonna break bread with Wick,
and don't be late.

288
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,500
{y:i}And tell Vince to wear something tight.

289
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,900
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Sorry about that.

291
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Ari delivered Wick. We have dinner
at Maestros at 7:00.

292
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm over that project, dude.

293
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
What? I thought you loved the script.

294
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
I'll love another.

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I'm not wasting my time with some guy
who doesn't like me.

296
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,300
There are no others, trust me.
I know, I'm the one who reads them.

297
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,700
When this guy meets you, he'll love you.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh, yeah.

299
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,500
Free steak, what the fuck.

300
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm dying for some red meat.

301
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Anybody need some clean urine?

302
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
You're fucking whipped, bro.

303
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,000
Will you stop it already?

304
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's true, though.

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,400
I mean, this girl tells you
what pictures to make...

306
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,800
what scripts to read,
what dinners to go to. Come on...

307
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
where's your fucking balls?

308
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,700
E, don't freak, all right?

309
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,900
I love her, I want to marry her.

310
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,300
- I'm fucking with you. Relax, bro.
- That's not funny.

311
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
Look, she's leaving on Friday...

312
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,800
she's going to an ashram in India
for four months.

313
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,300
In that case, I love her.

314
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,200
- No problem. She's gone.
- Got to get her out of here.

315
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,900
- Gentlemen, Scott Wick.
- Hello.

316
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,800
Let's make this snappy.

317
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,600
Be nice.

318
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Beluga.

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
- Excuse me?
- Caviar.

320
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,500
Reminds me of a cold winter night
in Novgorod.

321
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Where is Novgorod?

322
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,500
It's in Russia.

323
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,900
He didn't know that
'cause he dropped out of college.

324
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,600
So what did you do in Russia?

325
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,000
My father was an American diplomat.

326
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,300
That's nice, my father was a douche bag.

327
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm gonna get the New York Strip...

328
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,900
because it reminds me
of my childhood in New York.

329
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,200
That's funny.

330
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,400
So, Scott, listen,
we want to talk to you about the script.

331
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
Vince wants to do it.

332
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,400
I read it and I loved it.

333
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,100
I appreciate that, boys...

334
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,500
but unfortunately, I just don't see you in it.

335
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
This movie is about a guy from Queens.

336
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,300
It's a kid from the neighborhood.

337
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,200
Vince is a guy from Queens,
he's from the neighborhood.

338
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
He doesn't feel like he is.

339
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
Where does he feel like he's from?

340
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,600
- The Appalachians.
- Come on.

341
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
You know what? With all due respect...

342
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,600
I grew up a block
from where the script takes place...

343
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
in a shitty little apartment...

344
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,800
with five brothers and sisters
and a psychotically drunk father.

345
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,300
I am this part.

346
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Yes, but you know that even the truth
sometimes seems fake, wouldn't you say?

347
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,900
This doesn't seem like it's going anywhere,
does it?

348
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,000
Not really.

349
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm gonna order a little extra.

350
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe I'll get this rib-eye to go.

351
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,400
Bring a little doggy bag home for the boys.

352
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,500
Do I look like Goodwill to you?

353
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,100
What are you, high?

354
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,000
Actually, Scott, I am.

355
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,900
Is that a problem?

356
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine.

357
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,300
Some of the best shit I've ever smoked.
Are you in need?

358
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,200
I am.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,500
My guy says the town is dry,
something about a drought.

360
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,100
Is your guy Black Hack?

361
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,500
My guy spoke to another guy.
I don't really have a guy.

362
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
I could hook you up.

363
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,700
What are we doing here,
talking about the script or weed?

364
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,500
Maybe both, E. Maybe both.

365
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,800
Oh, Christ.

366
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
I have to lie at my N.A. Meeting again.

367
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
Can I ask you a question?

368
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
Why do you have to be such a hardass
all the time?

369
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,700
I don't know...

370
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,600
because it's just fucking fun.

371
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,300
- Shit.
- This should be fun.

372
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,200
Give me one of those...
Cocksucker, motherfucker.

373
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Relax, you said your dad's a diplomat,
right?

374
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,000
That was 50 fucking years ago, asshole.

375
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,700
- Just roll down the window.
- I'm on fucking probation.

376
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,800
For what?

377
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,000
It was nothing, it wasn't anything,
it wasn't even true.

378
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Hello, Officer.

379
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
- License and registration.
- Sure.

380
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,200
Here we go.

381
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,000
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, Mr. Wick.

382
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,900
You're parked in a red zone.

383
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,300
Step out of the car, please.

384
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,500
- Lf you like, I can just move.
- Sir!

385
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,600
- Out of the car.
- Excuse me, Officer.

386
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,100
Hi, how are you?

387
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,300
You know Officer Hecht? His daughter,
Melissa, is a good friend of mine.

388
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,000
I know you.

389
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,900
I saw the new trailer, movie looks good.

390
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,800
Yes, it's a good film.

391
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,300
It is good.

392
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,800
Not only does he not bust us for
smoking weed or parking in the red zone...

393
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,700
he asked this guy for his autograph.

394
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,000
- Awesome.
- What can I say, I'm above the law.

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,300
Let's toast.

396
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,200
What is this stuff, is it weed or grass?

397
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,700
Whatever, it's good for you.

398
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,500
I don't trust this shit.
I lived on this stuff in '93.

399
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,000
By the end of the year
I was sleeping standing up.

400
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Come on guys, a goodbye toast.

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
- You really gonna leave us?
- I could cancel my trip.

402
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,700
No, don't do that.

403
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,200
We wouldn't want you to bum out Ramdash.

404
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,300
Ram Dass.

405
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,500
Whatever.

406
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
All right, on the count of three.

407
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Three.

408
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,700
That's disgusting.

409
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,100
Hello.

410
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,900
- Mini Vince.
{y:i}- Hey, Ari.

411
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,700
I don't know who blew who...

412
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,000
but Wick's got a crush on your boy Vince,
wants him to star in his vanity project.

413
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,300
All right, I'll tell him.

414
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Prepare to enter the poor house,
you little bitch.

415
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,200
Wick wants you in the movie.

416
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,800
I don't know, you think I'm Queens enough?

417
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
We'll see.

418
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,300
Get another round here.

419
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,142
