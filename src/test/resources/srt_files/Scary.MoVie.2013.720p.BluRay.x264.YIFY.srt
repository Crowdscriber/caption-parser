2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,851
I just don't want to
make one of these tapes

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,764
if it's something you
do with every girl.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,528
Every girl? No, no. I am
strictly a one-woman guy.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,808
Well, I don't want to end
up all over the Internet.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,167
I pride myself on
keeping a low profile.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,721
My private life is private.
Hm.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,170
Wait. I thought you never did this before.
What are all these?

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,210
Oh, uh, just some
movies I rented.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,081
"Me and Brandy, missionary"?

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,931
A tale of two girls
who become nuns.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,445
"Me and Brandy, doggy"?

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,122
The sequel. The nuns
adopt a chocolate lab.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,282
What are all those?

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,811
Oh, that's just your standard

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,361
home security setup.
Basic run-of-the mill.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,000
No big deal, nothing too elaborate.
Everybody has them.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,891
And why do you need security
cameras pointing at your bed?

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,361
In case a burglar tries
to steal my sex tapes.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Now, let's get into bed.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Let's just make this quick. I have
a court hearing in the morning.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,450
Judge Henderson? No.
I wish. Thompson.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,682
Mm. That's going
to suck for you.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,201
It was a driving mishap thingy.

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,283
Do me a favor. Promise
me you won't drive.

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,329
That's sweet. You're
worried about me driving.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,563
Mm-mm. I'm worried about me.
I'm a pedestrian.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,211
Ow!

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,840
Sorry. That's my
sobriety monitor.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,681
Ow!

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,842
Sorry. Sorry.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,604
Ankle. Tracking bracelet.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,407
Oh, wait. Wait. Sorry, just...

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,568
Who put that on you? I did.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,324
It's the only way I
can have an orgasm.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,928
Not tonight.

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,005
What are you doing? Huh?

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,249
Just... warming up.

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,206
You sure we're alone here? Feels like
there's somebody else in this house.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Did you hear that?

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,207
That's nothing.

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,521
Ok, what is that?

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,967
Just... unraveling the old hose.

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,809
Save it for tomorrow, Raul.

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,610
Si, senor.

46
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,889
Wow. That was amazing.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,201
Charlie.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,643
Wow. Get out of here, Emilio.

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,324
Charlie, I'm scared.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Lindsay, sweetie, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

51
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,928
Hey, I got the stuff. I got
to call you back, man.

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,604
Ow!

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,445
I think I better go.

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,089
Really? How about tomorrow?
You busy?

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,011
I'm going to blow you
across the room.

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,491
Sounds awesome.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,004
And thus our story begins.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,687
The large reward offered for
the rescue of Charlie's kids

59
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,411
drew the attention of
police, private detectives

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,927
and red cross volunteers.

61
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,129
Everyone was on high alert
for these children,

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,209
except these two guys.

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,807
No, man, obamacare gives senior
citizens access to cheaper drugs,

64
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,124
free preventative care, and it
closes the medicare part d loophole.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,931
And how does that help if I
get shampoo in my dick hole?

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,681
What? Mean to tell me
you ain't never got

67
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,410
shampoo in your pee hole? Ok.

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,085
Maybe like once or twice.
Yeah, once or twice

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,844
when you was playing
with yourself.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,764
No, I wasn't playing
with myself.

71
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,082
I was showering, and
crazy got up in there.

72
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,084
Bullshit. Cam Newton's
law of gravity is:

73
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,323
That thing must be up in order
for that soap to go down.

74
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,330
Well, either way, that
shit stings like hell.

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,171
Sting like a mother, man, it feel
like it's a hornet up in there.

76
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,443
And he found out his girl be, you know,
doing her thing with another man.

77
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,489
Exactly. I don't
understand why

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,404
the shampoo company
can't fix that, man.

79
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,130
They got "no more tears."

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,964
Why they can't make no
more hornets in your dick?

81
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't really think they expect you
to use the no more tears on your dick.

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,721
Well, why they call
it Johnson & Johnson?

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,400
I got a better question, man. What
the hell are two stoners doing

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,209
wandering around these
spooky-ass woods?

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,049
Look, it's going to be worth it.
I told you...

86
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,762
This is humboldt county.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,003
This is where all the growers
grow their bomb-ass shit.

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,208
You think they're gonna be cool
with us just helping ourselves?

89
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,885
Look, man, we ain't
taking no plants.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,008
We're gonna snip a few buds.
You know what I'm saying?

91
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,764
It's gonna grow back
just like a lobster paw.

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
You know, that's how nature do.

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,004
I don't know, man. Just
doesn't feel right.

94
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,480
Man, they ain't gonna care.
Look, man, we're gonna be cool.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,086
We're gonna roll one blunt, then
we're gonna get up out of here.

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,203
Just one? Just one.

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,648
They won't care, huh?
Man, just keep running.

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,929
Holy shit. Is that a drone? They're
going all zero dark thirty on our ass.

99
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,683
Yo, I think they gone.

100
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,649
Oh, whoa. It's a cabin in the woods.
We need to go hide over in there.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,171
Nah, man, I'm not
going in there.

102
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,526
It reminds me of a
horror movie I once saw.

103
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,883
What horror movie? The one
with the cabin in the woods.

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,565
Friday the 13th? No.

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,210
The one with the
cabin in the woods.

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,725
Texas chain saw massacre?

107
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,928
No, the one with the
cabin in the woods.

108
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,491
The ring. Uh-uh.

109
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,246
The one with the cabin in the woods.
Blair witch project.

110
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,681
No, man, the one with
the cabin in the woods.

111
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,569
The munsters. That
wasn't in the woods.

112
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,563
They wasn't even a damn movie.
Look, man,

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
we ain't got time for
this shit right now.

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,329
We need to get to that
cabin in the woods.

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,802
What the hell is that sound?

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,691
Sound like the house settling.
It looked new.

117
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,604
I'm gonna take a look around.
Go ahead.

118
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,081
Ah! What is that?

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,171
Ah! Oh!

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,565
Where we shooting? There.

121
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,006
Where? The dark!

122
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,611
There? No, this dark.

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,362
Over there.

124
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,405
Dude, what the hell was that?

125
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,291
Big-ass Alaskan king crab
just ran up on me, man.

126
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,090
Crab? Cuz, we banging?
Ja'Marcus,

127
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,368
put the guns down, man. Put
yours down first, homey.

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,842
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,650
Damn. You want
to try it again?

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,963
Sure. One, two, three.

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,724
One, two, three.

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,731
Uno, dos, tres.

133
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,962
Man, we could do
this shit all day.

134
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,804
Truce? Truce.

135
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,488
Hey, yo, d'Andre. Look, homey.
It's two little girls.

136
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,768
They're little
racist girls, man.

137
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,163
Wearing blackface.
Cool with that?

138
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,730
Hey, little girl,
what's your name?

139
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,650
What'd she say? She said,
"I wonder what your leg"

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,126
"tastes like." What? Ah, man!

141
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,645
Little spider girl bit me.

142
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,006
Maybe you're going
to get superpowers.

143
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,003
Ain't no black superheroes.
I'm on it.

144
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,605
' Hi-ya!

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,006
Yo. D'Andre, I think they're the
missing kids from the news.

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,525
How can you be so sure? Look.

147
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,888
I don't know, man. Well,
if it is the missing kids,

148
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
I'm gonna take that reward
money, and I'm gonna buy me

149
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,244
a yacht, fill it with cash,
bitches and a shark.

150
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,761
Why would you want
to buy a shark?

151
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,803
Trust me... we're
gonna need a shark.

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,211
No, this can't be right.

153
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,331
Hi, mom.

154
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,924
I got to call you back.

155
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,963
No baby, no baby,
no baby, no baby.

156
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,645
You're pregnant... no!

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,725
With anticipation over the
outcome of this ipregnancy test,

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,804
which has determined
that you are...

159
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,371
You got to be kidding me.

160
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,241
Oh, no.

161
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,925
Not pregnant.

162
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,009
You dodged a bullet,
you lucky slut.

163
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,084
Thank you, God. Sweet!

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,403
Great news: They found
my brother's kids.

165
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,846
Oh, crap.

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,571
We're very fortunate the older
one, Kathy, has retained

167
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,205
most of her vocabulary.

168
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,488
The baby hasn't
actually said a word.

169
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,968
Why not? Because he's a baby.

170
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,567
They've been alone here
over three long months.

171
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,362
I need to warn both of you that
this is not going to be easy.

172
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,602
I'm ready for it.

173
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,286
Hello. No, no. Wrong window.

174
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,920
Here's where the children are.

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,648
- What is she doing?
- In order to survive

176
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,282
their extreme isolation, the girls
created an imaginary guardian,

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,650
a parent figure to feed them, sing to them.
They call her mama.

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,446
But these may help
you break through.

179
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,329
And the ritalin may
help, as well.

180
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,767
The proper dosage for
someone their age is...

181
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,206
Wish me luck.

182
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,250
Hey, lily.

183
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,970
Oh, how cute.

184
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,643
Ok. Kathy.

185
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,726
It's ok, Kathy. Remember these?

186
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,565
You used to wear them
to help you see better.

187
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,650
No, no, no!

188
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,844
Maybe we should get her some contacts...
The soft kind.

189
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,011
Daddy?

190
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,366
No, sweetheart. Not daddy.

191
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,164
I'm your Uncle Dan. Remember?

192
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,765
And this is Jody.

193
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,888
Jo...

194
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,884
Jody. No pause between
"Jo" and "dy."

195
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,008
Jo...

196
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,601
Dan, we're at an impasse.
I see constant conflict.

197
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,808
It's fine. They'll
warm up to you.

198
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,371
Oh!

199
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, hey, hey, little
lady, that's not how...

200
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,810
You little mother...!

201
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,047
Well, everything checks out.
They seem like good kids, doc.

202
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,486
Just validate our parking.
We'll take them home.

203
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,927
Folks, I wish it were that easy.
You don't validate?

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,321
I'm saying the kids are
not yours to take.

205
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,448
Well, you can't win them all.
Let's skedaddle.

206
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,611
That's not fair. They're my brother
Charlie's kids. We deserve them.

207
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,128
Do you? Your wife plays in a punk rock
band, staying out all night long,

208
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,965
high on drugs, sleeping with
a different man every night.

209
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,885
I don't think the courts are gonna
look upon that too favorably.

210
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,401
But... I was just
messing with you.

211
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
The kids are yours. They are?

212
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,481
Did you hear that, honey?
They're ours!

213
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,127
On one condition. This house is owned
by the institute for case studies.

214
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,328
Every room is fully
wired with cameras.

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,086
If you move into the
house, you get the kids.

216
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,130
Can't we just sell the house and put
the kids in a high-end orphanage?

217
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,487
Jody, do you really think
you're out out to be a mom?

218
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,641
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

219
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,046
Of course she is. Dan!

220
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,124
Now, no more rock band,
no more silly wig.

221
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,362
It's not silly. It's
all a part of me.

222
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,363
And no more tattoos.
What are you doing?

223
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,166
What I had to. We're a
perfect suburban couple.

224
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,087
And so Dan and Jody headed to their
new house with their new children.

225
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,562
But, like a slutty sorority girl
returning from spring break,

226
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,282
they were also bringing
home a hidden evil.

227
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,171
All right, kids,
here's our new house.

228
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,924
And here's Uncle Dan.

229
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,283
Hi. Don't forget about mommy!

230
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
Dan, I'm not their mommy.
They can call me aunt Jody.

231
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,641
Or jodes, j-mom, Mrs. Sanders.

232
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
Or, if they really want to call me...
Garage!

233
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,370
Here comes Jody and Aidan,

234
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,200
entering the house for
the very first time.

235
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,921
This is where we're going to protect
you and make sure nothing bad...

236
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,760
Oh, my God, Aidan! I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

237
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,643
Maybe we should put
him in the carrier.

238
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,010
There, see, that's better. Come on, Aidan.
What, what, what?

239
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,447
Relax, it's ok. Oh, my gosh.

240
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,443
Dan, I lost the baby! What?

241
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh, my gosh, Aidan!
Aidan, where are you?!

242
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,686
- Aidan!
- Where did you go?

243
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,084
Oh, there he is, ok.

244
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,129
Here's your sister Kathy.

245
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,611
Oh, Aidan, it's ok.

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,489
You've just got to
talk in a baby voice.

247
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,849
It doesn't even matter
what you say. Ok.

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,162
I'm your stepmommy.

249
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,046
I'm not your fricking mommy.

250
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,441
There you go, you're a natural.

251
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,688
What's that smell?

252
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,244
Oh, my God, what do I do? Oh, oh!
Here, this, hold on!

253
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,444
' Uncle Dan!

254
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,207
' Kathy! Oh, sorry, ow!

255
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,927
All right, there
you go, sweetie.

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,448
Is it chilly in here? I felt it
as soon as I entered the room.

257
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,682
Feels fine. Hey, what are these?

258
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,491
This is interesting.
What is this?

259
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,246
I don't know, mama
drew that one.

260
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,131
Look, we drew this
picture for Aidan.

261
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,403
See? It's Aidan on a
rocket to the moon.

262
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,610
Oh. Sitting on a rocket.
Where's lily?

263
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,362
Oh, no, sweetie, the other end.

264
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,770
Ooh!

265
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,167
Let's go introduce Aidan
to the rest of the family.

266
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,411
Oh, and there's our
furry family member.

267
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,131
- Yes, Maria.
- No, Dan, Artie.

268
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,248
Oh, yes, of course,
our dog Artie.

269
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,324
Ay, the new baby. I make blessing.
Oh.

270
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,169
Ok, ok, that's good, Maria.

271
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,005
Oh, my gosh.

272
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,849
With three new
kids to care for,

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,890
Dan really needed to start
performing at work.

274
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,761
Unfortunately he was having
some issues with a colleague.

275
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,481
Ok, Caesar, this is the
one, I can feel it.

276
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,888
Eighty-one seconds? Oh, Caesar.

277
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,247
That's your worst time yet.

278
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,880
You're doing even worse
on your creativity test.

279
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,601
I mean, look at all the imaginative
things I made out of blocks.

280
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,205
Like this awesome plane.

281
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,049
Dan, do you have
any results yet?

282
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,851
Oh, well, I've been injecting
the primates twice a day

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,800
with the I-13 intelligence drug.
I'm hoping in a week or so...

284
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,964
I hope Caesar is not just a
big waste of time and money.

285
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,761
I'm the one responsible to the board.
Just show me one thing positive.

286
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,371
Look. They still
throw their shit.

287
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,727
But now they can keep score.

288
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,046
We have to kick-start this thing.
When can we go to human trials?

289
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,041
We're close, but there's
an intermediate step.

290
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,562
If the I-13 works on
these reality wives...

291
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,769
You better check that shit.
Who gonna check me, boo?

292
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,727
We're pinning the future
of our lab on wild beasts.

293
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,723
They're not beasts.

294
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,247
They have feelings,
they have families.

295
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,165
Males pee standing up,
females pee sitting down.

296
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,482
These apes are just like you.

297
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,530
And me... you and me,
blacks and whites.

298
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,002
More like whites, of course. We
whites are a lighter shade of ape

299
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,004
whereas you are bla... dder
infection, we're all at risk.

300
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,367
So, what were we talking about again?
Vaginae.

301
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,851
Shut up. Yes, of course.

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,401
Caesar has got to show some human
intelligence at that board meeting...

303
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,769
Caesar's probably smarter than
half of those board members.

304
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,206
Dan... I know what
you're going to say.

305
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,045
"If he's so smart, why
is he in a cage?"

306
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,881
You're in the cage.

307
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,050
What?

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,684
Oh, you're looking for this?
Uh-huh.

309
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,841
It's my ballerina doll.

310
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,165
You made this? Mama did,

311
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,490
using twigs, moss, spiderwebs,
sparrow bones, lizard eyes,

312
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,610
all held together with rat droppings.
Oh, geez.

313
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,524
Ah, ah, ah. What...
What are you doing?

314
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,160
I just can't deal with these kids.
They're creepy.

315
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,481
We should just take 'em back.

316
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,962
Maybe you guys just need to
find some common ground.

317
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,440
What about that ballerina doll
Kathy's always playing with?

318
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,123
I don't want to talk
about the ballet.

319
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,408
I saw what the ballet
did to my mom.

320
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,089
She became obsessed.

321
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,881
She even danced the swan while
she was pregnant with me.

322
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,127
Boo, ray, boo! Shh!

323
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,369
Shh. Hell. You better sit back before
I punch you in your damn throat.

324
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,521
We're trying to enjoy the show.

325
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,446
You go on... shh... shh me again.
I double-dog dare you, hell.

326
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,568
Better ask somebody who I am.

327
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,724
Whoa!

328
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,091
Got it.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,604
Mom was never the same.

330
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,368
That's unlikely to ever
happen again, ever.

331
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,842
Just give it a shot. Look
what I found earlier.

332
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,490
I mean, I know it's just
a local production.

333
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,248
But could be something for you and
Kathy to talk about, could be fun.

334
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,085
You really think so? Yes.

335
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,528
Well, I suppose I
could check it out.

336
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,763
Ok. But the minute it becomes
too difficult, I'm giving up.

337
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,686
That's the spirit.

338
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,720
Even though Jody only
returned to the ballet

339
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,484
to connect with the girls,

340
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,486
as she got closer she couldn't help
but get excited at the prospect

341
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,803
of becoming the swan queen.

342
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,201
This season we open
with "swan lake."

343
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,400
As you all know, this piece
has the most challenging

344
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,605
and demanding role in all of ballet...
The swan queen.

345
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,330
Sizing up her competition,

346
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,245
Jody knew the battle
would be a tough one.

347
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,368
The white and the black.

348
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,524
Fortunately we have with us
prima ballerina and the lead

349
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,810
in my last 146 productions...
Heather Darcy.

350
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,845
Ah, the seasoned professional.

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,401
The still brilliant,
crusty, old, weathered,

352
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,764
leather-faced elder statesman of
ballet to whom these young girls,

353
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,764
less experienced, more
beautiful and delicious,

354
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,720
but still very raw ballerina
hopefuls, look up.

355
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,487
Show these far more desirable
children how it's done, huh?

356
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,642
Music!

357
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
Try that thing where
you are skipping

358
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,448
and you hop and you spread
your legs a little bit.

359
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,287
Look at that form,
that technique.

360
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,090
I'll never be that good.

361
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,805
I'm Jody, by the way.

362
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,883
Kendra.

363
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,966
Are you going to try out? Me?

364
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,442
Oh, I don't know. I mean, I
like to dance, but I just...

365
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,329
I don't like to be the
center of attention.

366
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,446
Ok, who's next? Oh, food.

367
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,965
Huh?

368
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,843
It is as if I am seeing
ballet for the first time.

369
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,851
That's not ballet.

370
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,447
The passion, the sensuality.

371
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,883
An ass that makes you want to crawl
inside and take up residence.

372
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,526
I can show passion.

373
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,366
Oh, yeah.

374
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,121
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh.

375
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,244
Jody certainly had her
work cut out for her.

376
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,371
That kendra chick was smokin'.

377
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,204
Do you accept Euros?

378
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,249
Kathy, lily, Aidan?

379
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,247
Jody? Ah!

380
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,925
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

381
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,209
I'm so sorry. I'm fine.

382
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,600
It was on the floor.

383
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,088
Ah, probably a screw loose.
I'll fix it.

384
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,725
I feel like there's
something in this house.

385
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,881
Like what?

386
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,931
Like I feel hot, clammy,
foul-smelling breath on my neck.

387
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,082
You need call psychic.
Kill bad spirits.

388
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,289
Ugh. No, Maria,
enough of this stuff.

389
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,569
Ok, then I do blessing,
I protect house.

390
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,727
Honey, you really need to relax.

391
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,449
You're just stressed out
about the children.

392
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,444
No, it's this house.
I... I feel it.

393
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,922
And Maria's a little off. I mean,
honestly do you really trust her?

394
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,368
Oh, honey, don't worry,
she couldn't hurt a fly.

395
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,361
Look, you have a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

396
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,807
Let's just get you
some sleep, ok?

397
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,761
Love you.

398
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,611
I don't believe this... our
whole house ransacked.

399
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,047
You leave the house unattended
with the doors unlocked

400
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,486
and look what happens.

401
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,371
They didn't take anything.
It's just vandalism.

402
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,761
Every room except the
kids' rooms was trashed.

403
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,921
So you suspect the kids?

404
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,401
It was mama. Mama did it.

405
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,848
She hates this house.
She hates you.

406
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,966
Ok, Maria, this is camera.
Necesito filming.

407
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,009
Thank you for helping
me clean up, sweetie.

408
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,970
Oh, hey, been looking all
over for this thing.

409
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,849
Still got it...

410
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm sorry! God, help, honey!

411
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,241
Maria, honey, help! Geez!
Maria, put the camera...

412
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,006
Oh, look at this.

413
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,561
Mom coaching me when
I was a little girl.

414
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,202
Aw... always applying
the guilt trip.

415
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,129
That got me the lead.

416
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,444
Look, Maria.

417
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,967
Maria, look what I found.
What is this?

418
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,927
Oh, uh, that's... a new type
of electric toothbrush.

419
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,527
Vibrations knock the
tartar off your teeth.

420
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,806
- Look, a whole box of toothbrushes.
- Whoa.

421
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,162
This black one is huge. Ok.

422
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,891
And look, here's a double-sided one.
All right.

423
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,088
And one that I can
strap on to my face.

424
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,368
Nope. Put that over here.

425
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,330
Uncle Dan, what is this?
Beaded floss?

426
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,608
That's grown-up floss, honey.

427
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,331
Graffiti!

428
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,602
Did you see this?

429
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,923
Who does that? What are we...?
Maria.

430
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,971
Maria, por favor.

431
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,761
Miss Jody, miss Jody, you call this man...
Mr. Blaine.

432
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,888
He helped my sister.

433
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,481
This is a psychic.
Si, he'll help you.

434
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,449
No, what we really need are
more security cameras.

435
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,650
Uncle Dan. You know, these toothbrushes
look an awful lot like dildos.

436
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,241
Ow!

437
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,048
This is fun, mama.

438
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,326
You're still awake?

439
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,926
All right, listen,
guys, it's just us

440
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
until Uncle Dan comes
back from the hospital.

441
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,281
I don't like it, you don't
like it, I don't like it.

442
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,807
Now go to sleep. I have to be
up early for ballet tomorrow.

443
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,408
You really like ballet, don't you?
Yeah, but I don't want you to go.

444
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,607
Why?

445
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,888
Mama says you're going
to have an accident.

446
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,204
Oh, ok. Is this the same
mama who trashed the house?

447
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,328
Basically, yes.

448
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,970
Don't go in there.

449
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,882
I wasn't going to.

450
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,326
Just don't.

451
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,171
It's my house, I can if I want.

452
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,521
I wouldn't.

453
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,364
Would. Wouldn't.

454
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,363
Would, too. Would not.

455
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,524
You know what? I'm the adult.
You're not the boss of me.

456
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,681
Don't.

457
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,610
I told you not to
let anyone in!

458
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,244
And so Jody was...

459
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,886
Oh, my God, I just smelled that.

460
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,008
It just got to me, yeah.

461
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,804
And so Jody was...

462
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,928
Oh, no, I... I'm sorry,
you have to excuse me.

463
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,246
I got to get some fresh air.

464
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,402
The next section
should explain itself.

465
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,724
All right, attention.

466
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,484
I do not wish to repeat myself.

467
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,286
I repeat, I do not
wish to repeat myself.

468
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,602
I require the sweater
I wear as a scarf.

469
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,011
Ah. Comfortable, huh?

470
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,650
Mm... mother, please,
I am working.

471
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,282
All right, because Heather
Darcy is so old, this season

472
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,249
we will have a new swan queen,

473
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,121
and that person is Jody Sanders.

474
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,121
Now, Jody, show us your routine.

475
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,011
No, I'm the swan queen.

476
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,770
Watch me. Ah...!

477
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,685
As I was saying, my
choice for new...

478
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,968
Her?! Anyone but her!

479
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,681
You might just as well
have picked the janitor!

480
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,571
Me?

481
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,651
Ira, please, not now.
Ok. What?

482
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,802
Yes, it was a
difficult decision,

483
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,770
but I have always been
attracted to Jody.

484
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,888
How could I not? She has the
body of a fifth-grade boy.

485
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,004
But in the event that
she is unable to dance,

486
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,165
I am naming as her
understudy kendra Brooks.

487
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,642
All right, that's lunch.

488
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,890
Ooh, this is a nice house.
I'm gonna go find the girls.

489
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Kathy, how did you know I was going to
have an accident today at the ballet?

490
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,286
Mama told me.

491
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,762
Ok, well, how did mama know I
was going to have an accident?

492
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,683
Oh, there you are. I found
this bandage on my head.

493
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,850
Dan, please. I think there is
something going on in this house,

494
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,286
something about this mama.

495
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,281
I'm gonna call the psychic
Maria told us about.

496
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,080
Jody, do you really think
we need a psychic?

497
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,207
Uncle Dan, come here.

498
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,169
Coming. I want to
show you something.

499
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,526
Uncle Dan, mama taught me some tricks.
Look what I can do.

500
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,047
- Oh, wow, that's really good, honey.
- Dada.

501
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,851
Good lord.

502
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,243
Uncle Dan, look at me.
Evil spirits.

503
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,731
Look, Mr. Dan, look.

504
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,645
Isn't that one of
Jody's bathing suits?

505
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,849
You're facing something our
human minds cannot imagine.

506
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,520
Mama.

507
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,442
Let's get you in a robe.

508
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,400
Do you want to hear
about the ballet today?

509
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,767
Mama's helping us get ready.
Oh, ok, I'll brush, too.

510
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,531
Hm. Where did my toothbrush go?

511
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,400
Hey, we don't lick our
balls in this house.

512
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,927
Sorry, won't happen again.

513
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,965
Try as she might,

514
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,283
Jody just couldn't seem to
connect with those kids.

515
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,091
Or get the taste of that
toothbrush out of her mouth.

516
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,846
Was it just eight-year-old
teen angst,

517
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,408
or were there otherworldly
forces at work here?

518
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,205
Baby. Hm?

519
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,560
Babe, I heard something. What?

520
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,727
I think there's someone
in the kitchen.

521
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,611
See? There's nobody down here.

522
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,888
There it is again! Right there.
Go look.

523
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,125
Jody, calm down. See, there's nothing
to worry about. It's just...

524
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,169
Oh, God! Geez!

525
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,484
Dan, I'm calling the psychic!

526
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,727
Ah! Make the call!

527
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,563
Blaine fulda,
professional psychic.

528
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,051
Hi, I'm Jody.

529
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,601
Indeed you are. Yes. And
this is my husband Dan.

530
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,604
Your payment as requested.
$500 in unmarked bills.

531
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,569
And of course, you know Maria.

532
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,246
Hola, Mr. Blaine. Hi, Maria.
How's your sister?

533
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,607
Dead. Demon kill her.

534
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,601
Well, that explains the
unreturned phone calls.

535
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,246
I'm sensing evil.

536
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,324
I'm gonna have to get some of
your personal belongings here,

537
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,131
just so I can check for
demon and ghost residue.

538
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,486
I'm not gonna be able to
lift all those monitors,

539
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,233
but I'll send my cousin
tomorrow with the white van.

540
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:56,849
He can get them in there.

541
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,809
Dan was attacked by the
kitchen last night.

542
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,406
We think it might be mama.
Kitchen attack?

543
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,085
You could've said that earlier.

544
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,005
If a room turns on you, it's
either a ghost or a demon.

545
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,609
Can a demon take over someone?
Like, live within them?

546
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,171
Damn, that's some scary shit.

547
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,482
So a demon is about the
worst thing you can have?

548
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,371
No, ma'am, an std is the worst
thing that you can have.

549
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,002
Who do you know who wants to hurt you?
Do you have a jealous colleague at work?

550
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,083
A Facebook friend you
might have ignored?

551
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,363
Maybe you adopted a small
African child named ikatababwe,

552
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,568
promising to feed this
nigga for 25 cents a day.

553
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,240
But then he needs
something to drink!

554
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,521
Anyway, let's begin. Ok.

555
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,047
This is the evil communicator.

556
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,124
When I put this on, I'll be able
to cross over to the other side

557
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,601
and confront the entity. That
will immediately trigger

558
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,362
the final $350 payment of
child support to tisha fulda.

559
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,808
And if you guys would just join
hands, close eyes and concentrate.

560
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,169
Empty your mind of all the
thoughts of today's troubles.

561
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,806
Everything that went on,
get that out of your mind.

562
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,122
This is all about the
spirit world here.

563
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,564
And three, two and one.

564
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,166
What's happening? Things are
starting to move all by itself!

565
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,684
Breathe! Breathe!

566
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,649
- Wait, I don't think he can breathe!
- He's a pro!

567
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,210
A sophisticated piece
of equipment like that?

568
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:20,644
Of course he can breathe.

569
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,161
Shit, I couldn't breathe.

570
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,051
Almost killed myself. All
right, I communicated.

571
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,601
It was definitely a demon.
Oh, my God.

572
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,360
Wait a minute. I was wrong.
It's a ghost.

573
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,005
So strong.

574
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,926
Ow!

575
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,966
Help, it's got me! Dan!

576
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,565
Dan, wake up!
Ma'am, you got to

577
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,088
get out of here. It's evil!
It's pure evil! It's mama!

578
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
Now do you believe that
something's going on?

579
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,921
He got dragged away,
yelling out, "mama."

580
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,082
He got dragged away? I
don't remember that.

581
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,528
Dan, you were unconscious. I
don't remember that, either.

582
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,205
Look, honey, I don't
want to argue.

583
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,328
The important thing is,
we love each other, ok?

584
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
No, the important thing is that
this mama thing could be real

585
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,644
and she might be
trying to kill us.

586
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,770
Jod, that guy was a fraud
and that's it. Ok?

587
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,882
What's that? My penis.

588
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,684
No. Yes.

589
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,489
There, right now, there.
I know. I'm trying.

590
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,883
What the hell is that?
My penis?

591
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,207
What's making that sound?

592
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,481
Dan, what is that?

593
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,810
My penis.

594
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,930
Is that smoke?

595
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,891
Maria! What are you doing?!
You're gonna burn down the house!

596
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,202
Kill bad spirits!

597
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,842
What is going on? Maria
almost burned the house down.

598
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,160
What? That's it, she's got...

599
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,922
Enough! This is getting out of hand.
You're scaring everybody.

600
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,128
You can't fire her. I mean,
she's been with us for years.

601
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,611
I don't know what to do.

602
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,842
That's discrimination.
Ok, now what the hell?

603
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,368
This is completely insane! It's
what she believes in, honey!

604
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,646
Give me that!

605
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,644
You're gonna let me go?!
Your family is not safe!

606
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,928
I'm sorry, Maria, it's
just not working out.

607
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,811
I'll give you a recommendation,
just nothing involving kids

608
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,725
or within a mile
of anyone's house.

609
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,846
I can't do this anymore.
I got to go to work.

610
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,720
I don't even understand
what you're saying!

611
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,883
Ow!

612
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,684
Ladies and gentlemen,

613
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,605
for the past two years, our
own Dan Sanders has been

614
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,445
testing the I-13
compound on 30 apes.

615
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,887
Unfortunately, 29
of them turned into

616
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,611
insane, aggressive,
deviant sexual predators.

617
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,802
But one, Caesar,

618
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,043
has experienced a huge
leap in intelligence.

619
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,362
Here he plays three opponents.

620
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,925
Of course, they're apes.

621
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,881
But Caesar's superior capabilities
are the work of one man.

622
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,567
The brains behind the
I-13 project, Dan San...

623
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,051
Are you ok? I'm fine, Martin.

624
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,642
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to introduce you to Caesar...

625
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,080
You're not getting away from me!

626
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,009
Oof!

627
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,567
Oh, no!

628
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,527
Traffic is backed up on
the broad street bridge,

629
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,127
where apparently police are battling
dozens of apes in a running gunfight.

630
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,369
Our reports indicate that a
scientist at a research laboratory

631
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,444
gave these apes an experimental
intelligence drug.

632
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,127
I'm being told that all available
officers are now on the scene.

633
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,411
But at this time, we are advising all
our viewers to find alternate routes.

634
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,370
I'm now being told we
have the actual 911 call

635
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,682
that first alerted the
police to the situation.

636
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,121
911, what's your emergency?

637
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,886
Oh, my God! Apes are
inside the house!

638
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,202
Calm down, ma'am. What happened?

639
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,283
We were making love and...
Oh, my God!

640
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,363
- They're attacking him!
- Who are they attacking, ma'am?

641
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,201
Carl! Oh, my God!
Please, help him!

642
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,680
- Where is your husband right now?
- Carl's not my husband.

643
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,551
My husband's the anchor
for channel 12 news.

644
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:56,406
He can't know about it.

645
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,130
- Ok, ma'am, but we need to...
- Hurry!

646
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,288
Send help while my husband's
still on the air!

647
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,841
Ma'am, that's not important.
Your life is.

648
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,048
Yeah, you're right.
Why should he care?

649
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,483
I mean, I'm pretty sure he's been
sleeping with his co-anchor, that bitch!

650
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,846
Oh, I'm gonna rip her...

651
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,408
Congratulations, girl.

652
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,007
I knew it was gonna be you. You're
just so perfect, so mechanical.

653
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,731
Watching you dance is
like watching a robot.

654
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,086
Thanks.

655
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,924
So hungry.

656
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,521
Mm.

657
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,047
Is that all? Pierre
has a weight limit.

658
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,010
I'm too heavy. Look at mara.

659
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,527
She looks great.

660
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,286
Look, are you sure you're ok?

661
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,961
Weird things have been
happening at home.

662
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,207
Kathy said there was
going to be an accident.

663
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,285
Then it happened to Heather.
That's some serious shit.

664
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,647
You should talk to those kids.

665
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,370
Whoa, pizza.

666
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,527
I eat and eat and eat, and
I don't gain a pound.

667
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,604
Heather!

668
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,485
You think you can replace me?

669
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,248
Well, we'll see how you like
it once the swan consumes you!

670
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,763
Damn it!

671
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,685
Door!

672
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,849
Son of a bitch!

673
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,609
Oh, I didn't know you
were such a good builder.

674
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,365
Wow.

675
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,563
Kathy, I want you to
tell me about mama.

676
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,724
Mama doesn't like it
when you talk about her.

677
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,927
Who is mama?

678
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,361
She was a woman who
read from an evil book.

679
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,808
Sometimes she comes
to us in a dream.

680
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,968
In a dream?

681
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,282
In your dreams, of course.

682
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,283
I wish I could see what's
inside your dreams.

683
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,163
To extract what's in your dreams.
To perform an inception.

684
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,887
Will you drop that?
That's my birth tuba.

685
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,005
Hello. I'm dom kolb. You called
about a dream extraction?

686
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,561
Yes. I need to find out
about an evil book.

687
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,881
Mm-hm.

688
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,765
This machine will allow us
access to the dream world.

689
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,251
Let's begin.

690
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,164
So when do we start dreaming?

691
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,971
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream,

692
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,326
do you? I guess.

693
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,443
Ok, then,

694
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,286
this is your first lesson in
shared dreaming. Stay calm.

695
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,125
Sorry. I dropped
my phone in there.

696
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,608
You need to clear your subconscious.
And watch what you think about.

697
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,001
Nothing crazy. Right.

698
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,891
Like having your crotch
burst into flames.

699
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,203
What does that have
to do with ma...?

700
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,931
Hey! Oh.

701
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,247
Let's start over.

702
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,128
I'm Jody Sanders.

703
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,362
Yes, my dear. I've
been expecting you.

704
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,363
Please, come in.

705
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,170
They call me Christian grey.

706
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,209
How do you like my blue room?

707
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,284
It's red. Oh. I'm color-blind.

708
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,721
My decorator assured me that...
Never mind.

709
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,210
Champagne? Mm.

710
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,965
Have a seat.

711
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,281
I'll stand.

712
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,808
Hey, Christian, man, golly, man!
I'd like to thank you a lot, man,

713
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,321
for working on my prostrate
like it was a speed bag.

714
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,450
Yes, Michael, I must admit, I was
surprised at your performance, as well.

715
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,922
Not bad for a washed-up,
overweight, facially tattooed...

716
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,727
Do it again.

717
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,845
Oh...!

718
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,571
I have no idea
what that one was.

719
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,328
Me neither.

720
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,328
Mama, are you here?

721
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,087
Dom, is that you? Oh, shit.

722
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,528
You said you'd had a dream
that we'd grow old together.

723
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,409
Right. And we will.

724
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,609
What are you doing here? Hi.

725
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,880
How could you bring her here?
What about our children?

726
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,527
They're not real. Yes, they are.
Watch.

727
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,768
James, phillippa!

728
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,408
Ew.

729
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,966
You're not gonna jump, are you?

730
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,851
I hadn't thought about that.
Thank you.

731
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,927
Ok, we're not getting anywhere.

732
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,570
What does any of this
have to do with Kathy?

733
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,529
Kathy? I thought you were Kathy.

734
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,086
Oh.

735
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,926
"Gort klaatu barada nikto."

736
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,767
What's happening to me?!

737
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,603
That must have been her. Mama.

738
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,484
She wants to take us
home to the cliff.

739
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,769
What does that mean?
I don't know.

740
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,920
But I trust you'll give me
a favorable yelp review?

741
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,451
Jody's mission was clear.

742
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,563
The evil book that created mama

743
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,247
was located in the cellar
of a cabin, in the woods.

744
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,570
If she could find that cabin, maybe
she could find some answers.

745
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,803
If we can find that cabin, maybe
we can find some answers.

746
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,849
Ok, calm down. I'm
gonna come over.

747
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,846
Kendra? What?

748
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,643
Ok, wait, what's going on now?

749
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,167
I think she's out there!

750
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,722
Ok, ok, just... you stay calm!

751
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,001
Front door open.

752
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,288
She's in the house!
Front door open.

753
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,568
Ok, stay... front door open.

754
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,171
Shut the hell up!

755
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,970
No need for that, bitch.

756
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,009
Bitch?! Front door open.

757
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,361
No, you did not just call me a bitch!
Front door open...

758
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,051
Honey? Dan?!

759
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,171
I am so sorry. I didn't
know who you were and...

760
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,046
It's ok, honey, it was an accident.
Right, Caesar?

761
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,971
And of course he can stay here.

762
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,367
Look at that. Caesar wants to
help out around the house.

763
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,521
Aw.

764
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,407
Hey...

765
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,681
I'm sorry, I see an ape,
I come out swinging.

766
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,963
That's understandable.

767
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,645
Here you go.

768
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,770
I am so glad you're ok, but
tonight was a wake-up call.

769
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,720
I think we've got to find that cabin.
Ok. I got an idea.

770
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,282
Wait, we fired Maria. Who's
gonna watch the kids?

771
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,960
I already took care of it.

772
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,005
Naughty nanny's here. Nice
to meet you, naughty.

773
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,249
This is my wife Jody. Threesome?
That costs extra.

774
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,051
Oh, Jesus. Monkey, too?

775
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,125
Oh, you people are freaks,
but for an extra $100.

776
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,645
What agency did you call?

777
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,371
Oh, they have nurses and
cheerleaders and nannies.

778
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,807
Dan, you called an
escort service.

779
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,645
I used the same agency to
book a Santa for Christmas.

780
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,490
Someone called for Santa?

781
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,961
Ho, ho, ho.

782
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,048
Dan, you're watching the kids.

783
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,924
Jody was nervous about what
she might find at the cabin,

784
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,684
but she was comforted
by the fact

785
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,287
that Caesar and the girls
were in good hands.

786
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,521
Who do you work for?

787
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,763
Kendra, this isn't the
cabin I was talking about.

788
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,924
I know, I just thought
you needed to relax.

789
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,127
Take one of these.

790
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,611
Um, I don't know.

791
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,570
Oh, come on, they'll only
last a couple of hours, tops.

792
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,883
Kendra, I don't need
drugs to have fun.

793
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,321
Let me take a picture. Ok.

794
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,641
Oh, that's so hot!

795
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,490
Yeah!

796
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,731
Yeah, ride it, yeah, yeah!

797
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,765
A dollar will make me holler,
honey boo boo child.

798
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,167
Sorry.

799
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,642
I don't always go downtown,

800
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,765
but when I do, I
drink a beer first.

801
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,686
I'm the king of the world!
Woo! Woo!

802
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,011
I'm wicked hard!

803
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,806
Mind if I play through?

804
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,686
Ooh, shit!

805
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,923
Again? You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill you!

806
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,922
Oh, my God, rehearsal.
I'm late.

807
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,769
Oh, no, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

808
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,848
Stop, stop! Oh, Jody, thank
God you're here, girl.

809
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,411
I was just dancing
and kissing him

810
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,005
'cause I didn't want him to
think about you being late.

811
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,401
Well, I'm the dancer, so I'll
do the kissing around here.

812
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,210
That was amazing.

813
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,440
I want you to have my children.

814
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,967
But, papa, please, we
want to stay with you.

815
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,407
Back in the car, gaston. Aw...

816
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,244
She can't make you
forget about me.

817
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,482
I overslept because you
just took off this morning.

818
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,210
This morning? Yeah,
you slept over.

819
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,091
What? Wait a minute, did you have
some kind of lezzo dream fantasy

820
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,242
about me? Don't act
like you weren't there.

821
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,244
We had something special. We
made love last night for hours.

822
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,164
What? Oh, and now
you're gonna tell me.

823
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,921
Tiger Woods didn't
come out of my vagina?

824
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,449
Jody.

825
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,489
What?!

826
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,808
Oh, yeah, yeah.

827
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,167
Well, that explains
the poison Ivy.

828
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,731
Jody?

829
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,047
There you are. Kendra?

830
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,850
Oh, the door was open
so I let myself in.

831
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,685
It's ok. Look, I'm so sorry.

832
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,366
I really believed something
happened between us last night.

833
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,683
I must have dreamt the whole thing.
Oh, no, we had sex.

834
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,480
But this morning at
rehearsal, you said...

835
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,400
I can't have the whole
cast knowing my business.

836
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,010
I'm already doing half of 'em,

837
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,043
and besides, me and Pierre...
We have this little thing...

838
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,406
Wait, then, what's this?

839
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,600
Beats me... must have
happened after I left.

840
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,042
Oh, yeah! Girl,
you are freaky.

841
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,609
Oh, yeah.

842
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,962
Oh, yeah, get it. Oh, my God.

843
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,209
Oh, shit!

844
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,204
See, I knew she was real.

845
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,482
All right, let's find out
where this cabin is.

846
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,649
Ugh!

847
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,680
What in the hell?

848
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,002
Bad girl.

849
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,481
Oh, what is this?

850
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,201
Oh, my God, it's the same cabin
from the dream. Of course.

851
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,561
So, what are we gonna do
if we find that book?

852
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,331
I don't know, if that's the book
that turned mama into what she is,

853
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,051
maybe it could somehow
reverse the curse.

854
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,690
Ok, we're almost there.

855
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,163
Hey, I'm not going in there.
We have to go inside.

856
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,569
The book is the key to the
nightmare I'm living.

857
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,281
Oh, my gosh, who are you? I'm
Jody and this is kendra.

858
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,204
We're looking for
something very important.

859
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,601
We all are. Come on in.

863
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,004
Hello, Jody and kendra. Hi.

864
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,400
Pardon me for not standing,

865
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,120
but I'm mending the wing of this
bird that we found in the woods.

866
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,971
Ok. Hi, we're in a hurry.

867
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,884
We're actually looking for a
book that could save lives.

868
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,407
Yes, I've got it right here.
Oh, thank God.

869
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,724
Thank him indeed. The Bible.
Here, let me read to you.

870
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,611
Oh, no, no, see, we're
actually looking for...

871
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,606
The book of evil. I
know evil all too well.

872
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,649
You do? This weekend's
devoted to Mia.

873
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,086
It's a detox weekend.

874
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,727
She's hooked on energy shots.

875
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,484
Oh, yeah, that's
a real struggle.

876
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,324
Ok, listen, we're looking
for another book

877
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,165
somewhere in this cabin. Hm.
We haven't seen anything.

878
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,004
We gave it a shot,
let's get out of here.

879
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,003
Ok, wait.

880
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,243
- Is there a cellar?
- Great.

881
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,082
There it is. Oh!

882
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,051
Ok, I don't care what it says.

883
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,289
"The curse begins
with four words.

884

885

What the heck?

890
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,447
Why? I don't have an arm.

891
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,411
For some reason I cut
my tongue in half.

892
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,007
Ok, well, let's at least finish the song.
Everyone hold hands.

893
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,403

Is this yours? That's a left.

901
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,445
That's mine. Could you
hand it to me, please?

902
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,126
I need a right. Eric
chainsawed it off.

Look, I'm sorry. My... my leg?

No, that's black. It's not mine.

905

Oh, shit. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

Maybe the curse has
somehow been lifted.

923

Luckily for Dan and Jody, there
was someone in the house

924
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,521
who, thanks to the I-13 formula,

925
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,480
had increased intelligence and
superior cognitive ability.

926
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,211
His analytical problem-solving
skills allowed him...

927
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,170
To ascertain crucial
information.

928
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,281
A marvel of modern-day science, his
IQ had surpassed even the most...

929
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,726
Aw, hell.

930
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,569
Why did I think you
could be intelligent?

931
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,762
You're nothing but
a dumb animal.

Idiot!

934
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,921
- I can talk.
- Hey, Caesar.

935
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,604
Steve?

936
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,444
Dan's got a mad
demon in his house.

937
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,329
Matt Damon's in his house?
No, a mad demon.

938
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,565
I love Matt Damon. Jason bourne.

939
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,926
Oy.

940
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,729
I should have known not to bring
a wild animal into the house.

941
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,524
I'm... I'm so sorry.

942
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,760
But I believed in Caesar. I
thought he was different.

943
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,120
There's something more to this.

944
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,528
I can feel it. No, he just...
Went crazy.

945
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,042
Forget it. But I still think
mama could be in this house.

946
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,080
But don't you... we just
had a whole night go on

947
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,886
without a single sign of anything.
I guess.

948
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,803
I was just so scared
last night for the kids.

949
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,450
You're coming around.

950
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,447
Am I getting attached to them?

951
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,444
It's the cliff from the dream.

952
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,930
Get in the car now.
Don't make me yell!

953
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,686
Unto thee, Satan, I
sacrifice these children.

954
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,286
Return home to the cliff of...
Holy shit!

955
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,766
Home is at the cliff.
Oh, my God. Girls!

956
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,167
Kathy. It's ok. I saw the cliff.
I know what "home" means.

957
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,129
Whoa!

958
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,565
Come on, girls.
Let's go get Aidan.

959
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,563
That's cool.

960
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,087
Lily! Come on.

961
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,849
Aidan! Are you ok?

962
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,529
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan!

963
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,170
Mama! Mama! Mama!

964
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,446
She's here!

965
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,524
Whoa. Girls, girls, girls. One at a time.
Lily, you first.

966
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,086
Got it. Now Kathy.

967
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,686
Mama! Mama! She's here!
She's gonna kill us!

968
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,561
How many times do I have to tell
everyone there's no such thing as...

969
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,406
Ow!

970
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,724
Maria? What are you doing here?

971
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,724
I was angry you fire me,
so I bake you this.

972
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,163
A shit pie?

973
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,443
Uh, thanks, but... hot dog?

974
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,329
No, that's still
shit with mustard.

975
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,724
Maybe just a banana, then?
Very much potassium.

976
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,446
So bueno, Mr. Dan.

977
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,887
No, I... I'm sorry. I should
have listened to you...

978
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,443
Mr. Dan, we have our problems,
but I always love you.

979
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,045
So much.

980
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,365
When I see you, I see my father.

981
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,245
Dan. Dan, we have to...

982
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,409
Wait. What's going on here?
I can explain.

983
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,800
There's no time. Mama has the girls.
I know where she took them.

984
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,289
Got to go.

985
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,930
You remind me of my father.

986
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,849
Dan!

987
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,649
Knowing the girls
were in danger,

988
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,043
Dan and Jody sped off, racing
to get to the cliff they...

989
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,407
Oh, my God. What
happened to the car?

990
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,005
Where...? Oh, there it is.

991
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,449
They were no longer able to sit idly
by and let a ghost jump off a cliff,

992
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,210
- sacrificing their children with her.
- Kathy! Lily!

993
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,045
Oh, my God. There they are.
Kathy, lily, stop!

994
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,008
What do we do now?
Um, I'll just...

995
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,880
Read from this and change
her back to human.

996
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,166
Girls, run! Run! No.

997
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,890
No, not that way.
Away from the cliff!

998
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,566
I'm not going to let mama
take you away again.

999
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,961
Hm?

1000
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,051
Lily, stop! Come on. Come on.
Here, girl. Come on, lily.

1001
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,086
Come on. Look. Oh, look. Yeah.

1002
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,406
Come on. Look. Oh, yeah. Lily.

1003
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,450
Oh, wow. Yeah.

1004
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,880
Oh, come on.

1005
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,730
Enough! This is crazy.

1006
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,486
Lily's not a dog.

1007
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,120
She's a beautiful little
girl who I've grown to love.

1008
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,727
I love all these children, mama,
even if they don't all love me.

1009
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,130
Lily loves you, too, Jody.

1010
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,850
And they belong in this
world with me and Dan.

1011
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,606
Because they deserve parents
who aren't decomposing.

1012
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,165
Good girl.

1013
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,449
All right, enough.

1014
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,562
Where's the page? Damn
it, I can't find it.

1015
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,165
Forget it.

1016
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,322
There, that worked. Maybe not.

1017
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,920
Man, we need to stop
smoking this shit.

1018
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,207
Told you that shark was
going to come in handy.

1019
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,601
Thank you. Lily.

1020
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,482
Honey, thank God
you're all right.

1021
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,004
Your cue is coming up.
Oh, kendra.

1022
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,001
Look, it's ok, girl. Let's
forget about what happened.

1023
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,364
You are the black swan.
No. It's you.

1024
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,445
Throwing mama off the cliff has really
made me reevaluate my priorities.

1025
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,729
My family comes first. You
dance the black swan.

1026
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,440
Because sometimes in life...
Ok.

1027
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,808
Introducing our new swan
queen, miss kendra Brooks.

1028
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,803
This is not ballet. No,
it the hell ain't.

1029
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,409
This some bullshit.

1030
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,164
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1031
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,244
That's what I'm talking about!
Right? Right?

1032
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,811
You know that shit, right?

1033
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,964
And so our story ends.

1034
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,282
If anything is to be
learned from this,

1035
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,450
it's that mankind
is a pathetic race

1036
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,968
and apes need to take
over this planet.

1037
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,602
Enjoy earth while
you still got it.

1038
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,086
Well, we'll see how you like
it once the swan consumes you!

1039
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,729
I cannot hold it that long. It's, like...
It's so long.

1040
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,404
We're kissing.

1041
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,402
' Cut! Cut!

1042
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,565
Cut!

1043
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,321
We're kissing.

1044
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,683
Cut!

1045
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,486
- What happened?
- Guy was in the shot.

1046
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,166
- Ah.
- Cut!

1047
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,646
But was he dressed like a demon?

1048
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,524
Do the second "my
penis" as a question.

1049
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,762
Ok. And then "my other
penis" is a question also?

1050
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,126
Yeah. Ok.

1051
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,203
But remember, you're jumping
to "what the hell is that?"

1052
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,442
I know. I don't know why.
You're jumping... yeah.

1053
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,329
There's just so many penises.

1054
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,881
Welcome to Hollywood.

1055
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,287
I'm ready for it. Hey.

1056
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,965
I'm ok with this.

1057
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,044
That's the temporary
nurses' shower.

1058
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,123
And we're painting it. Cut.

1059
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,284
That's the... temporary
nurses' shower.

1060
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,090
I'm ok with this.

1061
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,969
Sorry, you guys. I...

1062
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,811
I'm ok with this.

1063
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,407
That's the nurses'
temporary locker room,

1064
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,210
and we're repainting it.

1065
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,166
' Cut.

1066
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,289
Ouch. Hello here!

1067
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,481
B mark!

1068
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,569
- And background.
- Action!

1069
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,169
Oh!

1070
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,769
Jody! Thank God I caught you.

1071
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,564
I forgot to tell you, now that
you are the swan queen...

1072
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,851
Suck my...

1073
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,602
I'll save you, snoop dogg.

1074
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,923
My name ain't snoop dogg in this...
Movie, man!

1075
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,367
Well, I mean, I... sh...

1076
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,521
Stop it!

1077
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,569
We're good. We're good.

1078
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,889
Now prepare for a night
of unparalleled passion.

1079
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,725
Oh, wait, wait, Mr. grey...
The safe word is "deeper."

1080
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,881
What?

1081
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,081
Damn! Ow!

1082
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,571
Whoa!

1083
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,489
What does all this have
to do with the ballet?

1084
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,167
Ballet? Yes. Aren't you
donating millions?

1085
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,084
Millions? What...? I'm broke.

1086
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,242
Every cent I have has
been put into this room.

1087
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,280
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

1088
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,006
Oh, cry me a river.

1089
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:44,609
I'm going to need a little help.
I don't have a penis.

1090
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,365
It does not come off.

1091
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,568
It does not come off. I'm sorry.

1092
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,643
I'm getting tired of
talking about this...

1093
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,768
In the woods with this man.

1094
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,481
Man, we keep going in circles,
talking about a... man.

1095
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,971
Let's talk about a... man,

1096
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,804
- or getting some...
- Getting some...

1097
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,962
Talking about... these
two dudes in the woods.

1098
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,250
If we had a... here, she could wash our...
Off right now.

1099
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,880
You understand me? That's
the way I would say it.

1100
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,764
Hey, babe, check out this
psychic's book for a clue.

1101
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,685
It really freaks me out. Come
on, there's nothing to be...

1102
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,604
Nuh!

1103
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,491
These books are all...

1104
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,211
There's nothing to be scared...

1105
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,483
To be scared...

1106
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,200
Oh, there's nothing
to be scared...

1107
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,089
Oh, wrong animal.

1108
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,643
Be scared... a dinosaur?

1109
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,808
What does this have
to do with...?

1110
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,207
I know. Sorry.

1111
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,088
And... action!

1112
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,847
- What does this have to do with...?
- Sorry.

1113
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,320
You just keep cupping your boobs.
Ok, sorry.

1114
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,482
Ok, how do we know
who's a witch?

1115
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,242
Do they have a broom?

1116
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,811
Do they have a pointy nose?

1117
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,285
I'm... I'm going
to pee my pants!

1118
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,365
So, what, I didn't get the part?

1119
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,409
Where's everybody going?

1120
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,321
I just had the most
bizarre dream.

1121
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,687
Demons, apes, a ballet.

1122
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,127
You have a very
active subconscious.

1123
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,521
Anyway, the idea took hold.

1124
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,570
Lindsay Lohan's coming over
to spend the night with you.

1125
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,563
Awesome!

1126
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,920
You were driving.

1127
01:27:59,045 --> 01:28:03,945
