1
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,739
That's far enough.
Drop your laundry and turn slowly.

2
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,239
So you gonna rob me now?
I need to remind you who I am?

3
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,776
Omar, isn't it?

4
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,881
Pull it slowly. Then toss it.

5
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,687
Oh, I will move slow.

6
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,819
I ain't tossing nothing, Bow Tie.

7
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,493
So whatever you gonna do, you might
as well go ahead and make it quick.

8
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,000
- I knew you'd come back.
- I trust you didn't lose sleep over it.

9
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,303
Worrying about you would be like
wondering if the sun gonna come up.

10
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,537
I ain't about to wild out over it.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,979
- What I want to know is how you found me.
- Your boy, he didn't give you up easy.

12
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,610
Ain't no sugar-water
run through them veins.

13
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,153
- You kill him?
- He's resting.

14
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,524
- I see you favor a .45.
- Tonight I do.

15
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,827
And I keeps one in the chamber,
in case you pondering.

16
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,762
Nice showpiece you got there.

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,464
Walther PPK .380, double action.

18
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:51,405
- Hear them Walthers like to jump some.
- As will you, with one in your elbow.

19
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,479
That gun ain't got enough firepower
to make my joint useless.

20
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,947
It definitely won't stop me
from emptying out half my mag.

21
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,248
- You might not hit me.
- This range? And this caliber?

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,285
- Even if I miss, I can't miss.
- I admire a man with confidence.

23
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,053
I don't see no sweat
on your brow neither, bro.

24
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,868
- I suppose we could stand here all night.
- Suppose we could.

25
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,897
Or settle this once and forever.

26
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,749
I want to ask you something, brother.

27
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,081
Omar listening.

28
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,730
<i>- I'm going to the West.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

29
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,603
<i>- Peace out.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

30
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,271
Here we go.

31
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:50,219
<i>- Yo. I need some face time with the man.</i>
<i>- Hold on, I'll holler back at you, man.</i>

32
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,517
That'd be Shamrock.

33
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,287
Assuming Stringer Bell is the man,
now we wait for the return call.

34
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,253
This is beautiful.

35
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,492
Lester, can you actually believe
we fucking sold the wiretaps...

36
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,125
to the targets.

37
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,965
For a week at least.

38
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,808
Maybe we ducked a bullet.
Maybe we clean this mess quietly...

39
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,179
throw some horseshit
at whatever reporter shows up...

40
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,441
and the Mayor forgives and forgets.

41
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,306
We're ready to move on this, right?

42
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,182
As soon as we get the word,
we shut down all three zones...

43
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,618
toss everyone into wagons.

44
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,054
There'll be nothing left of it
before midnight shift.

45
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,093
So what the fuck are we waiting on
for a day and half?

46
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,094
Why isn't the Hall calling us?

47
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,063
<i>- Mayor's Office.</i>
- Commissioner Burrell for Mayor Royce.

48
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,639
- I've heard enough.
- Hold on, Coleman.

49
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,301
Come on, let the man talk, huh?

50
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,879
Excuse me, Mayor.
I have Commissioner Burrell on the line.

51
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,175
- He says it's urgent.
- I'll bet it is.

52
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,080
He wants to move, Clarence.

53
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,847
He wants to clean this shit up
yesterday, and so do we.

54
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,445
Tell him to hold. Go ahead, Gene.

55
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,549
Look, I'm not a politician, I'm an academic.

56
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,854
All I know is that
from a public health perspective...

57
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,158
there are remarkable things
happening in the free zones.

58
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,326
Needle exchanges, on-site blood testing,
condom distribution.

59
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,836
Most of all, we're interacting
with an at-risk community...

60
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,270
that is largely elusive.

61
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,706
I mean, we're even talking
some of these people into drug treatment.

62
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,245
And that's just what UM and Bon Secours
have brought to the table.

63
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,813
If this thing were sanctioned...

64
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,314
my department
could put public resources into play.

65
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,353
- You people can't see the forest here.
- Odell?

66
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,249
When the story breaks,
the ministers will surely be against you.

67
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,050
And most of the City Council
will be walking sideways...

68
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,153
away from your administration.

69
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,891
And my guess is
the Governor and the Legislature...

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,527
will use this opportunity
to piss on the city from a great height.

71
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,566
And Washington?

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,835
Can you imagine how far
the United States Department of Justice...

73
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,173
is gonna crawl up your ass behind this?

74
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,611
Crime is down, Odell.

75
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,717
Medical people
are telling me this could work.

76
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,380
I mean, a 14% decline in felonies citywide...

77
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,758
I might be untouchable on this.
Now, look, we need to think.

78
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,022
See if we can keep this thing going
without calling it what it really is, huh?

79
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,461
- Jesus.
- Now, there's got to be a way.

80
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,625
I want you to talk this thing out.
Hey, Erv, thanks for holding.

81
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,994
Yes, <i>but...</i>

82
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,463
Yes, I understand.

83
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,134
Then I'll wait to hear from you.

84
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,446
We're to hold off
on any action in Hamsterdam.

85
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,184
No arrests,
no movement until further notice.

86
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,982
He says he wants to regroup.

87
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,550
Determine the most effective
course of action.

88
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,559
Translate that for me, will you, Erv?
I don't speak his fucked-up lingo.

89
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,997
Royce is figuring a way to put
all of us in the guillotine...

90
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,728
and keep the blood from
spraying anywhere near the Hall.

91
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,932
Shit, I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna go out like that.

92
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,508
Bent over in public.

93
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,838
I can spin the story
just as well as that motherfucker.

94
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,414
- You're gonna go to the press?
- Not me.

95
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,449
But I know a slick little bastard...

96
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,383
who will happily
put His Honor's shit in the street.

97
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,285
Something funny about that?

98
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,585
'Cause I look in the paper...

99
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,595
and I see all these Federal grants
coming down, but nothing for B&B.

100
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,264
- You're expecting what?
- Payout.

101
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,358
A big payout for what we put in, man.

102
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,664
Federal dollars
on them Howard Street rehabs.

103
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,760
You gave money up front?

104
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,501
- $250,000, yep.
- To Clay Davis.

105
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,805
How you know?

106
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,906
What you saying? He's running game?

107
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,451
- No, hell, no, he ain't that brazen.
- Let me guess.

108
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,884
He's told you about the faucet.

109
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,013
Or was it the goose
that laid the golden egg?

110
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,715
You ever actually meet the man?

111
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,522
Did you ever actually see any of your cash
reach anyone in authority?

112
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,597
Yeah, I met the guy at the Federal Building.
Yeah, I met him.

113
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,597
Yeah? What office?

114
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,565
He came down to the lobby.

115
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,406
He rainmade you.

116
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,868
A guy says if you pay him,
he can make it rain.

117
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,971
You pay him.
If and when it rains, he takes the credit.

118
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,313
If and when it doesn't,
he finds reasons for you to pay him more.

119
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,818
- Clay Davis rainmade you.
- No, man...

120
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,890
he got them building permits
in no time at all, man.

121
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,824
I mean, we bribing these motherfuckers.
He got the city contractor's money back.

122
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,919
- How much?
- $35,000 so far.

123
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,863
- On the $250,000 you gave him?
- It's for bribing the motherfuckers.

124
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,433
There are no bribes!

125
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,199
You really think a State Senator
is going to risk his salary...

126
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,570
and his position
by walking into a Federal office...

127
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,472
with a briefcase full of drug money?

128
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,477
I seen Chunky, Chunky Coates.

129
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,809
Chunky Coates gets his grant money
same way everyone does.

130
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,314
He fills out applications,
he makes sure the plans meet spec...

131
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,577
then he prays like hell.

132
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,019
This is an old game in this town,
and Clay Davis?

133
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,021
That <i>ganef</i> was born
with his hand in someone's pocket.

134
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,617
I just wish you'd run it by me sooner.

135
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:13,042
Now here's Shamrock
returning Bodie's call.

136
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,335
<i>Talk light.</i>

137
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,041
<i>Yo, the man said he'd see you</i>
<i>same time as always.</i>

138
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,673
<i>- You know the spot.</i>
- During the first call...

139
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,218
Sydnor had eyes on Shamrock
over in West Baltimore.

140
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,345
All right? Now look at this.

141
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,122
At the time, Stringer Bell
was at the print shop.

142
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,054
So it couldn't be a face-to-face meet.

143
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,789
We didn't catch a call
between Stringer and Shamrock.

144
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,262
How can that be?

145
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,733
Stringer's phone isn't on the same network
as everyone below him.

146
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,203
- Right you are, ma'am.
- Bell's not using Bernard's burners.

147
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,467
And Shamrock has a separate phone
for calling Bell.

148
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,470
We can't hear those calls
because the system's compartmentalized.

149
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,704
They're some tricky motherfuckers.

150
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,477
A week or so up on Bernard's phones
and we'll have everybody...

151
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,816
up to and including Shamrock,
tangled up in conspiracy counts.

152
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,411
But Bell or Barksdale?

153
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,549
Not unless we can
pluck their cell numbers out of the air.

154
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,490
- Where you headed?
- Toy store.

155
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,999
- He legalized drugs in special zones?
- It's more than that.

156
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,837
Major Colvin
lost the necessary perspective...

157
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,138
that is required for command.

158
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,272
Now, we were all under pressure
to reduce crime before year-end...

159
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,977
and he responded poorly to that pressure.

160
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,077
Pressure by who? Mayor?

161
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,480
I'm just explaining to you...

162
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,560
that the pressure
was applied all down the line...

163
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,587
from Headquarters
to the District Commanders...

164
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,189
to the shift and sector supervisors.

165
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,733
So Colvin's 14% decline was bullshit.

166
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,269
And they're selling drugs
with police permission in Western?

167
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,344
The Department
is ready to shut that mess down...

168
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,969
with mass arrests.

169
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,013
- I'm on top of it.
- Why don't you move?

170
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,541
The Mayor says wait.

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,778
Why?

172
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,215
I think he's gonna make
some kind of show.

173
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,292
Spin it so that I take the weight
for something...

174
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,861
that has nothing to do with me,
and everything to do...

175
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,489
with the pressure that my Commanders
were getting from City Hall.

176
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:23,534
Going public and putting the responsibility
for this back at City Hall...

177
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,837
is the only move I have left, right?

178
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,542
I mean, I spin Royce before he spins me.

179
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,312
- And you want me to...
- No, no, not you.

180
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,147
Your pal, Tony Gray.

181
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,187
If he's gonna take a run at Royce,
he's gonna need ammunition, right?

182
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,723
I don't have a relationship with Gray.
I do have one with you.

183
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,326
And, Councilman, you owe me.

184
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,735
- What's up, hotshot?
- I got a technical question.

185
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,969
Remember those analog units...

186
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,205
we used to use
to pull cell numbers out of the air?

187
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:05,374
- CF-something-something.
- Yeah, cell frequency identification device.

188
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,179
- The Triggerfish, yeah.
- That one. It could flag a number.

189
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,381
Right. With the old analog machines,
we used to have to follow the guy around...

190
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,889
stay close while he used the phone.

191
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,323
New digitals?

192
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,553
Bing, you just pull the number
right off the cell tower.

193
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,789
So, you got any down out at Woodlawn
that Daddy can borrow?

194
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,832
- What about yours?
- What?

195
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
City has three of them, I remember right.

196
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,799
Homeland Security grant sent them to you,
every big county department in the state.

197
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,134
No fucking way.

198
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,202
Thanks.

199
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,515
- I doubted you, Tommy.
- I told you it was big.

200
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,676
If we play it right.

201
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,981
He wants me to turn the information
over to Tony Gray...

202
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,077
let him use it.

203
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,090
He figures if Tony's gonna be running
against the Mayor...

204
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,057
he'll take aim at Royce
and not the Department.

205
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,618
You may want to bring Tony in on it,
keep him viable against the Mayor.

206
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,028
But right now, you need to find out
what this is all about.

207
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,593
- Firsthand. Do you know this Major Colvin?
- To shake hands, maybe.

208
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,533
If Burrell's painting him the villain...

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,302
Colvin might be anxious
to tell someone his side of the story.

210
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,084
McNulty, Major Crimes.

211
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,623
Sullivan, minor irritations.

212
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,324
You got anything back there
that's like the old CFID, but digital?

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,791
For catching cell numbers?

214
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,627
- Catching who?
- You know, a Triggerfish machine.

215
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,869
Triggerfish. For cell numbers.

216
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,840
How about I look around there on my own?

217
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,756
Yes, this is Councilman Carcetti
over at the Hall.

218
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,726
- I'm trying to reach Major Colvin.
<i>- I'm sorry, but he's on vacation.</i>

219
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,818
I'm aware of that...

220
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,864
but I'm trying to reach him
on municipal business.

221
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,694
<i>Well, I can put you</i>
<i>through to his voicemail.</i>

222
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,892
No, not his voicemail.

223
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,493
- I said I have to reach him immediately.
<i>- Immediately?</i>

224
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,003
- Right.
<i>- How about his cell phone?</i>

225
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,540
- His cell? Yeah, that would be fine.
<i>- All right.</i>

226
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,211
All right, that's enough.

227
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,145
Yeah, I know, it hurts.

228
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,184
But your fists
gonna be like rocks after awhile.

229
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,225
Justin, come here.

230
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,999
All right.
I want you to push me in my chest.

231
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,899
You ain't got to do it hard.

232
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,310
- That's how you were standing.
- You ain't had no weight on your back foot.

233
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,743
That's right. No center of gravity.

234
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,178
Plus, if you get your stance right...

235
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,716
then you got the means
to put your hip into the punch.

236
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,386
Right?

237
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,223
- That's where your power'll come from.
- Yeah, but what happen when we get hit?

238
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,091
- Say what?
- We get hit, even with this pad...

239
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,430
you gonna get trucked.

240
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:09,058
- All this stuff falling apart.
- Yeah, the heavy bag, too.

241
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,427
Yeah, where you get this stuff at?
The town of Bedrock?

242
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,000
No, he say, "Nobody."
So you gonna have to wait right here.

243
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,101
What you mean, "Wait right here?"
You know who I am, boy?

244
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,109
Man say he want to see Avon.

245
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,910
Making me wait to see my own partner.

246
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,780
- He new, String.
- Fuck that.

247
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,215
Lot of new faces round here, man.
Way too many, you ask me.

248
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,018
Get the fuck out of here.

249
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,290
- Where Avon at?
- He'll be along shortly.

250
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,124
That's good,
'cause I came to see you, anyway.

251
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,696
What you need?

252
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,475
I need you to hit somebody.

253
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,013
- Who we hitting?
- Clay Davis.

254
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,674
The Clay Davis?

255
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,611
Downtown Clay Davis?

256
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,882
Is that suppose to mean
something to me, man?

257
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,289
- That nigga need to be got.
- Shit, String, murder ain't no thing.

258
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,294
But this here is some assassination shit...

259
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,694
I tell you you getting somebody,
you getting him.

260
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,459
- I ain't asking.
- Damn, String, I don't know...

261
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,399
Nigga, I got to remind you
who the fuck you work for?

262
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,492
Hey, yo.

263
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,669
I think Slim gonna have
to sit this one out, boss.

264
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,241
So you finna
go hit a State Senator now, huh?

265
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,372
Yo, you kill a downtown nigga like that...

266
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,143
the whole world
gonna stand up and take notice.

267
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,285
I'm talking about the State Police...

268
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,947
Federals, all of that.

269
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,726
You need a <i>Day of the Jackal</i> type
motherfucker, basically...

270
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,919
to do some shit like that...

271
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,486
- not a rough-and-tumble nigga like Slim.
- That nigga took our money, man.

272
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,656
I seen it coming.

273
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,032
- Well, he got to go.
- No, you a fucking businessman.

274
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,297
You wanna handle it like that.

275
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,772
You don't wanna get all gangster wild
with it and shit, right?

276
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,069
What I tell you about playing
them fucking away games?

277
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,275
Yeah.

278
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,510
They saw your ghetto ass
coming from miles away, nigga.

279
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,553
You got a fucking beef with them?
That shit is on you.

280
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,434
So, we aim this at the nearest cell tower...

281
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,263
the one that would be
the conduit for calls...

282
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,499
coming to and from our boy, Bell...

283
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,640
and we let rip.

284
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,711
Fucking hell.

285
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,151
Looks like Baltimore White Pages
without any names.

286
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,449
But the pattern tracer'll pull that down.

287
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,786
You know, if we know
the approximate time of Bell's call...

288
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,622
we could start just by pulling calls
off that tower at that time.

289
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,355
That could be thousands.

290
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,188
Yeah, that's the base line,
but we get a second hit...

291
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,857
and that list comes down to dozens.

292
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,766
- And after a third or <i>fourth...</i>
- Then we've got his number.

293
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,773
I can't believe that this was
just sitting over at ISD, gathering dust.

294
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,868
We're going to be on these motherfuckers
for real now, Lester.

295
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,378
Well, they don't know
about this technology yet.

296
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,380
For once they can't change and adjust.

297
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,908
It's genius.

298
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,643
Need something?

299
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,244
- Yeah, how much you make, man?
- What?

300
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,113
On them tees? How much you make?

301
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,919
Fair profit. No more than that.

302
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,992
You should
probably sell sweats with hoodies.

303
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,219
Since the season's changing and all.

304
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,828
Where you live at?

305
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,533
Yellow tops, yellow tops,
got them yellow tops.

306
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,074
- Bodie Broadus.
- The man with the hands.

307
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,877
I heard you was opening up a gym
or something.

308
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,345
Yeah, trying to.

309
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,051
- I'm looking to get up with Avon.
- Thought you was out.

310
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,017
Hey, man, that's why I came to you.

311
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,489
I mean, I feel like the way we left it,
I can't just roll up on the man, you know?

312
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,695
Hey, yo, it's me.
Yo, I got that hitter here with me.

313
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,261
Yeah, the soldier that walked in and out.

314
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,430
Yeah, he want to see the top man.

315
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,810
You slam shit like that,
you gonna fall out one day.

316
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,803
I'm good.

317
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,980
I'm trying to school you, boy,
and you just don't wanna know.

318
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,521
I'm cool. I'm good.

319
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,998
Whitey sale, whitey sale.
One for three, three for five.

320
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,062
Whitey sale, whitey sale.

321
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,835
Whitey sale, whitey sale, whitey sale, here.
One for three, three for five.

322
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,210
Whitey sale, whitey sale.

323
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,793
Whitey sale, whitey sale!

324
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,969
<i>All right, so what</i>
<i>you want me to tell the man?</i>

325
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,436
<i>Yo, I'll give word up, then I'll hit you back.</i>

326
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,600
- Shamrock.
- 4:40 p.m.

327
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,988
- B&B Enterprises.
<i>- We need to have lunch.</i>

328
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,664
All right, hold on. I'll call you back.

329
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,326
- Yo.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

330
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,557
What's good?

331
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,065
Yeah, it's me.

332
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,464
<i>Yo, tell the hitter,</i>
<i>tell him the tall man will pick him up.</i>

333
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,098
<i>- Right.</i>
- 4:47.

334
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,868
Seven-minute window.

335
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,272
There's 892 phone numbers.

336
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,182
That's our base line. We're on our way.

337
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,310
Yep.

338
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,730
Stay the fuck there, man.

339
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,335
Yo.

340
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,952
Jimmy! On the clean phone.

341
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,422
He just hit your friend's number.
The one off the business card you gave me.

342
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,827
- The Western?
- His cell.

343
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,264
Should we be worried about this?

344
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,334
No.

345
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,506
- A boxing gym, huh?
- Ain't a proper one yet.

346
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,207
That's why I asked to see you.

347
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,019
So, what you know
about taking care of something like that?

348
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,579
Not a damn thing.
But I know that sweet science.

349
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,385
And I got some kids who are interested.

350
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,929
But what I got a need for, brother,
is equipment.

351
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,494
Man, these kids gonna get rained on.

352
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,831
They need headgear,
they need guards, cups, you know...

353
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:32,961
so they can take the hit.

354
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,834
Shoot, you know what I'm saying, man.

355
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,374
I seen your picture on them
Globe posters back in the day.

356
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,503
- Little undercard shit, maybe, you know.
- Yeah, but still, you was Golden Gloves.

357
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,807
For a minute, but I had a physical defect.

358
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,881
- What, you got a glass jaw?
- No, forehead, nigga.

359
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,955
- Cranium shot'll do you wrong.
- Yo, look here, man.

360
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:57,486
You see the new heavy bags?
Look, freestanding, man.

361
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,496
All you gotta do is add water.

362
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,296
Then you got speed bags,
right there, right?

363
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,093
You got this headgear right here. It's new.

364
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,435
Look, protect the cheek and the chin,
you know?

365
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:14,068
And I know I can go around
and collect a dollar here and a dollar there.

366
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,942
But I'm trying to put together
a select group of people, right?

367
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,040
I call them my Gold Circle Club...

368
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,979
and they gonna make
a substantial contribution...

369
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,386
and just get this thing rolling right.

370
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,922
I mean, I'm gonna put their name
and picture up on the wall in the gym.

371
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:34,396
- What, you trying to get me to join a club?
- No, man, I'm just saying.

372
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,499
There's all sorts of levels.

373
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,763
We got the, the Silver Club,
we got the Bronze Club.

374
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,534
Man, for motherfuckers
who really don't want to dig that deep.

375
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,271
Come on, man, check it out.

376
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,403
No, man, I ain't got no time
for this bullshit, man.

377
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,243
And you know I don't want
my fucking name and face on no damn wall.

378
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,512
You crazy, nigga?
How much money you talking about?

379
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,150
$10,000.

380
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,400
See him go through all that for $10,000?

381
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,127
Man, Slim, go get him $15,000 cash, man.

382
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,363
<i>Yo...</i>

383
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,668
Shit.

384
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,541
All right. Later, man. Hey, you take care
of them little niggas, you hear?

385
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,670
Yeah, no doubt, bro.

386
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,436
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yo, you talk to him?

387
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,533
<i>Fat man wanna parlay.</i>

388
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,935
- All right, you good. Hook me up.
<i>- Yeah, all right.</i>

389
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,676
You check out what I sent you?

390
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,306
Yeah, your information's good.

391
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,882
So, we can talk on the real side now, huh?

392
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,726
<i>- Tell your man I'm good for tomorrow.</i>
<i>- Yo, I'll hit you back.</i>

393
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,664
- Now we're cooking.
- Cutting butter with a hot knife.

394
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,260
Next time Stringer Bell
takes a call off the base line, he's ours.

395
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,497
Game over.

396
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,576
So, it ain't what it might seem to you.

397
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,113
That man there is my brother.

398
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,916
But if it keep on like it been, <i>then...</i>

399
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,114
Oh, fuck.

400
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,483
You got problems?

401
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,458
I stirred up some shit
with this Hamsterdam mess.

402
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,329
That's 'cause you was behind that...

403
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,558
that made me come to you with this.

404
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,200
Look like you and me
both trying to make sense of this game.

405
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,703
Speak your mind, Russell.

406
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,717
We two good?

407
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,013
Yeah.

408
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,890
We got y'all out front. Let's go, P-Square.

409
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:02,033
- You look healthy.
- For a man who was gut-shot.

410
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,768
You reached out to a third party...

411
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,178
who engaged me
in the purpose of holding your Towers.

412
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:13,213
That third person's word was your word,
as he represented you.

413
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,307
That's right.

414
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,081
And I ran those
East Baltimore gentlemen off.

415
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,587
I held up my end of the agreement...

416
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,619
at least for as long as I was physically able.

417
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,716
You did.

418
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,729
Your man then set up
a meet at Butchie's bar.

419
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,499
Your man told Omar Little
that I was responsible...

420
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,230
for the torture of a young boy
who was close to Mr. Little's heart.

421
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,005
Your man, in effect...

422
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,870
sought to have me hit.

423
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,240
Omar told you that
and you believe that motherfucker?

424
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,109
He doesn't strike me
as a man who would tell stories.

425
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,378
Even at the point of dying.

426
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,309
Shit.

427
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,979
Proposition Joe package.

428
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,321
The inner workings
of your organization don't concern me.

429
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,727
If there's a way, I mean, if my <i>man...</i>

430
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,202
If he made a mistake here,
then I'm willing to pay the cost.

431
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,435
How can we fix it? You want money?

432
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,207
- Money?
- Yeah, this is business.

433
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,408
Business is where you are now.

434
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,179
But what got you here
is your word and your reputation.

435
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:28,020
With that alone,
you've still got an open line to New York.

436
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,319
Without it, you're done.

437
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,875
My man's still on paper.

438
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,679
I can put him in a spot
that got heavy artillery.

439
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,277
I ain't talking about pistols.
I'm talking about mini TEC-9s...

440
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,289
shotguns, they even got grenades
in that motherfucker.

441
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,756
That's a automatic fall.

442
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,556
So, I'm hoping
you could keep that shit to five.

443
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,358
Look, if you hit the joint...

444
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,329
his people are gonna try
and take the rap for it.

445
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,958
They gonna say all that firepower is theirs.

446
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,402
So all you gotta do
is just hit him with the parole backup.

447
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,406
Look, I can't make no promises.

448
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,272
- It's gonna be a nickel, at least.
- Come on, man.

449
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,343
- Him and me...
- I'm gonna do my best, all right?

450
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,882
He's always at this place?

451
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:37,293
No, he come and go.
But it's the spot since the war started.

452
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,375
He must have done something to you.

453
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,312
No, it's just business.

454
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,607
Almost forgot.
This came in for you last night.

455
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,700
Said she called your cell phone,
but you didn't answer.

456
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,143
Had a nice voice. Like a kitty cat.

457
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,342
We're on.

458
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,214
<i>- He said for you to be there, half-pint.</i>
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

459
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,296
- Stringer Bell, that's him.
- There it is.

460
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,268
Yeah, but for how long?
He could toss that burner at any moment.

461
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,772
- I got Rhonda, you raise Daniels.
- Okay.

462
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,240
- Ronnie? Yeah, we're on Stringer's phone.
- Lieutenant.

463
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,249
You should go straight to the judge.
I'll meet you there with an affidavit.

464
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,377
- Lester's raising Daniels.
- McNulty's calling Pearlman.

465
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,181
Watch that footwork, baby.

466
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,193
All right. Take it to him, now.

467
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,557
Yeah. Take it to him, now.

468
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,236
- I'm a beast, coach.
- All right, boy, don't be gloating on it.

469
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,872
Yo, when we gonna have some real fights?
You know, one of them tournament things.

470
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,740
- Yeah, we gladiators, son.
- Y'all got more fire than skills.

471
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,709
You ain't ready
for no full-blown thing just yet.

472
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,242
But I don't know,
maybe it'd be good for y'all...

473
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,113
to spar with some boys you don't know.

474
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,013
A nigga step in my house,
he getting dropped.

475
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,713
Yo, I met these fellas at that gym
over on Pennsylvania Avenue.

476
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,353
I'll see if they wanna roll through, all right?

477
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,019
- All right.
- All right.

478
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,268
You don't return a Councilman's calls?

479
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,675
I'm off this week.

480
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,412
Taking a little accrued vacation.

481
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,277
Yeah. And I heard why.

482
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,617
I'm here for your side of this story.
If I can't get that...

483
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,746
then whatever comes
out of Burrell's mouth is gonna stand.

484
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,289
You good with that?

485
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,717
What did you do, Major?

486
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,194
And why the fuck
haven't they shut it down?

487
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,288
We've seen that law enforcement's
steamroller approach...

488
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,264
- is just spitting in the wind!
- I really think...

489
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,598
I really think that you're
onto something here, Clarence.

490
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,762
But if you keep it up, before you know it...

491
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,965
they'll be calling you
the most dangerous man in America.

492
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,771
Well, I know it may appear
that we're vulnerable here.

493
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,707
But if we enforce the drug laws
everywhere else in the city...

494
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,180
aggressively...

495
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,945
how can they say
we're not a law and order administration?

496
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,351
Now there's got to be a middle ground here
that we have yet to find.

497
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,583
There's got to be some way
to accomplish this...

498
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,726
without turning everything upside down.

499
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,021
Without turning everything upside down.

500
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,427
This used to be one of my worst corners.

501
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,126
This is the neighborhood
where a cop got shot last summer, right?

502
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,566
- Dozerman.
- Looks quiet now.

503
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,037
So do most all my corners.

504
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,268
G-man.

505
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,489
- So, what's up?
- Shut the door.

506
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,827
In 10 minutes we're gonna have an affidavit
for a city judge to sign.

507
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,196
- It's for Russell Bell's dirty cell.
- It's a good pull.

508
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,670
It is if Bay Wireless
doesn't take five days to process it.

509
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,572
You owe me, Fitz.

510
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,704
That whole port case came down early...

511
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,972
behind some ugly shit in your house.

512
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:55,475
Now, I don't care how you do it,
but I need my wire today.

513
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,249
These guys were in radio cars
two months ago, chasing calls...

514
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,828
clearing corners.

515
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,960
I pulled them to do felony follow-up.

516
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,795
More police work, less bullshit,
and that's why my crime is down.

517
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,536
The numbers are true.

518
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,670
- What did he do?
- Church burglaries, 14 of them.

519
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,403
Let's go.

520
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,411
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

521
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,621
Is it affiant or affiant?

522
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,715
I've never <i>been...</i>
I've never been clear on that.

523
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,795
You been hunting
this guy Bell for a long time...

524
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,330
haven't you, Jimmy?

525
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,094
A while, yeah.

526
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,860
Name's familiar to me.

527
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,571
That thing that we did
a few years back, was he the...

528
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,698
Yeah.

529
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,040
What's done is done, Jimmy.

530
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,276
Now, for your own fucking sake,
just let it go.

531
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,910
Come on.

532
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,483
As the affiant, do you solemnly swear...

533
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,959
and attest that the information
contained in this <i>document...</i>

534
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,888
That's the most significant drop
in crime in this district...

535
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,364
in recent history.

536
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,498
We still got some
hard-looking boys out on them streets.

537
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,632
And, Sergeant,
you know them little mini-motorcycles?

538
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,107
They keeping me up at night.

539
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,037
We're working on that.

540
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,080
Look, I have been living
in this part of the city my whole life.

541
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,379
And I can tell you something.
We weren't any angels when we were kids.

542
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,419
And those hard boys you talking about...

543
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,421
half of them, they's just playing gangster.

544
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,684
They ain't no different from what we were.

545
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,260
Shirts and drawers a little longer, is all.

546
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,960
The one thing
I do miss about my neighborhood...

547
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm talking about the neighborhood
I came up in.

548
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,536
See, we knew the police. See?

549
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,196
We had a white police officer.

550
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,797
Our house was on his beat,
on his foot beat.

551
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,567
And he would be sitting out...

552
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,702
talking to my mother
damn near every night...

553
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,076
I mean, just sitting out
on her stoop, just talking.

554
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,412
And I'm telling you, this man,
his name was Frazier O'Leary.

555
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,486
- He even knew my grandmother by name.
- Yes, ma'am.

556
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,783
Let's move on
to the tip-line information...

557
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,882
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm real sorry, but I was not finished.

558
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,688
You see, let me tell you something.

559
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:22,732
I have not seen that face-to-face
policing in a long while.

560
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,596
In a very long while. Until last week.

561
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,695
A young officer, black officer,
came by my stoop. I was sitting out...

562
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,899
gave me his card.

563
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,500
His name is Reggie Ballard,
is his name, right?

564
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,274
And he sat, and he talked to me.
We just talked.

565
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:41,477
And, see, now I know his name and face
and he knows my name and face.

566
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,519
You see?
And I'm going to tell you something.

567
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,521
That is how it should be.

568
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,388
My son wanna open up
one of them snowball stands on the street.

569
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,362
Do we need a permit for this?

570
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,536
You ever seen a West Side
community meeting like this one?

571
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,163
In fact, the folks downtown
at Minor Privileges tell me...

572
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,300
that stands aren't allowed
in the city right-of-way at all.

573
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,810
Now they do say it is possible
to have a snowball stand...

574
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,506
behind the sidewalk.

575
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,955
Why are you really down here,
Councilman?

576
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,684
- I mean, this ain't even your district.
- I'm interested.

577
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,460
And I have the Public Safety Subcommittee.

578
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,993
You see that building there?

579
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,705
It was the old Stryker building.

580
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,275
It was a funeral parlor.

581
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,312
The last stop before the cemetery
for West Side white folk...

582
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,745
back when there were
still some of those around.

583
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,341
Right about the time
that Jim Crow was breaking up...

584
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,817
back in the early '60s...

585
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,581
somebody asked old man Stryker...

586
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,122
they say, "Stryker...

587
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,452
"you gonna change your policy...

588
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,322
"and start burying black folk?"

589
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,361
And Stryker said...

590
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,866
"Yeah, on one condition.

591
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,726
"That I can do them all at once."

592
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,366
That's sick.

593
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:15,139
But you know something?
I had a lot of respect for that man.

594
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,943
'Cause, unlike most folks...

595
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,080
I always knew where he stood.

596
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,315
I'm doing my job.

597
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,018
Look, I done showed you the good.

598
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,922
Come on, let me show you the ugly.

599
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:48,979
Hey.

600
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,606
- How come so quick?
- Stringer Bell's given name.

601
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,249
- Russell.
- For now?

602
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,280
Ahmed.

603
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,353
We're on the top of the mountain.

604
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,261
Red tops over here.
Come get them, come get them.

605
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,915
- This is it?
- One of three.

606
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,553
How did you make this happen?

607
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,050
I just did it.

608
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,790
I got tired of hearing folks
talk about what needs to be done...

609
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,891
or what they would do if it was up to them.

610
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:49,597
- Bottle rockets, got them bottle rockets.
- So, this is about you making a mark?

611
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,570
No, I ain't analyzed it all that deep.

612
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,940
I ain't claiming no kind of victory, neither.

613
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,612
I will say I'm glad I tried.

614
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,588
Go on, Councilman.
I'll wait for you down here.

615
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,426
You're not coming?

616
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,558
What you gonna see ain't pretty.

617
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,234
- But it's safe.
- WMDs, got them WMDs.

618
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,101
I think you need to take this journey
your own self.

619
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,380
Got those yellow, those yellow tops.
Yellow tops right here.

620
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:11,076
- I ordered one for you.
- Thanks.

621
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,924
- Surprised I called?
- A little.

622
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,621
After the way we left it.

623
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,020
I'm a type A, Jimmy.

624
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,363
People like me break things.

625
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:28,096
When I slow down, or when I take
a minute to think about it, <i>I...</i>

626
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,134
Is that your idea of an apology?

627
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,202
I didn't drive an hour up 95 to apologize.

628
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,442
I missed you.

629
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,818
I missed you, too, I guess.

630
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,756
Still, seems a long way
to come just to tell me that...

631
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,351
then turn around
and drive back down to DC.

632
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:53,891
I'm not driving back tonight.

633
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,497
So what's going on?
Are you working on a case?

634
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,840
It's a good one.

635
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,378
How about you? Anything interesting?

636
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,280
I did hear a crazy Baltimore story...

637
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,319
you know,
through the rumor mill of Washington.

638
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,150
- Really?
- Some...

639
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,291
renegade Police Commander
takes it on himself <i>to...</i>

640
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,623
I don't know,
legalize drugs in the precinct?

641
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,291
Mayor doesn't even know about it?

642
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,627
- Can you believe that?
- Crazy story.

643
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,296
Someone...

644
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,397
I think it's Colvin.

645
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,670
You know him?

646
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,142
No, I can't say that I do.

647
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,748
Still, I think it's funny that some...

648
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,581
water-cooler talker down in DC
knows any Baltimore cop's name.

649
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,451
I was just wondering.

650
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,538
Listen, <i>I'm...</i>

651
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,503
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I think so.

652
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,472
Good night.

653
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,451
Damn, man, I miss this crib already.

654
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,161
Yeah, well, you spending
a lot of time at the other spot...

655
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,355
- doing what you gotta do.
- Yeah.

656
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,791
Man, it's a shame we got to deal
with this Marlo bullshit, man.

657
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,029
I mean, if I had taken care
of that earlier, <i>man...</i>

658
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,368
There's always gonna be a Marlo, man.

659
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,007
No Marlo, no game.

660
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,011
But you could've dealt with that shit
a little sooner, I mean, yeah.

661
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,809
But, you know what I'm saying?
Don't let it lay on you like that.

662
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,852
Tonight, I mean, I'm gonna kick back
and just enjoy this view.

663
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:01,686
I mean, look at this shit.
Can you fucking believe this?

664
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,851
I mean, I got a crib
that's overlooking the Harbor.

665
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,395
This is the same <i>place...</i>
We used to run through this motherfucker...

666
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,625
we had every security guard in there
following us.

667
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,793
- As they should have.
- True, true.

668
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,167
- And then there was that one time...
- Toy store?

669
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,639
Hell, yeah, I told your ass
not to steal the badminton set.

670
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,438
What you gonna do with a fucking net...

671
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,241
and a racket and we ain't got no yard.

672
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,574
You like, "Yo, that white boy
ain't gonna jump over that counter...

673
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,982
"and come chase after me."

674
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,577
- He sure did, though.
- Then he <i>said...</i>

675
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,350
- I said, "What the fuck?"
- He was on your ass like Carl Lewis.

676
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,891
Fists was rolled up.

677
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,627
Your ass was running, too,
fast as you could.

678
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,823
Punching yourself in the chest
looking all mad and shit.

679
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,861
That shit was crazy, man.

680
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,433
Right here, too, man, right there. Goddamn.

681
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,270
Can you imagine, man,
if I had the money that I have now, man...

682
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,345
I could have bought
half this waterfront property.

683
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,639
God damn it.

684
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,575
Forget about that for a while, man.

685
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,746
You know, just dream with me.

686
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,284
We ain't gotta dream no more, man.

687
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,495
We got real shit...

688
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,497
real estate, we can touch.

689
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,471
I can't get too fucked up tonight, man.

690
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,102
I got some shit
I gotta do on the site tomorrow.

691
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:33,741
Plus, the fucking Polack
we got working for us, man...

692
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,909
I gotta pull his coat.

693
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,846
If he had anything to do
with that Clay Davis bullshit, man...

694
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,618
I'm gonna have to cut his money,
little faggot.

695
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,488
What time y'all meeting?

696
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,737
What time? 12:00, I think. Why?

697
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,299
You need me to do something for you?

698
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,209
No, I'm just seeing
where you going to be at.

699
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,411
You need to relax more, man.

700
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,449
Well, when the time is right, I will.

701
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,457
You know,
I don't take my work too seriously.

702
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,055
That's right.

703
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,965
It's just business.

704
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,575
Us, motherfucker.

705
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,478
Us, man.

706
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,587
Get him, Andre, go get him.

707
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,155
Come on, Spider, you got him. Come on.

708
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,424
Easy, easy, easy.

709
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,067
- All right?
- I'm good, I'm good.

710
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,136
All right.

711
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,862
- All right, Ditty, you up.
- Why didn't you hit him back, man?

712
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,099
You, Justin.

713
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,870
Come on, boy, I'm calling your name.

714
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,074
All right, listen up.
We gonna have three two-minute rounds.

715
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,779
Watch the low blows. Touch gloves.

716
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,384
<i>And...</i>

717
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:58,786
Let's go, Justin.

718
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,654
Justin, come on. Come on.

719
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,632
That's good, that's good.

720
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,726
Straight shot, come on.

721
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,470
Get your hands up, Justin.

722
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,773
- Come on, man. Come on.
- You gotta block that.

723
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:15,675
He leading left and punching right, Justin.
Move towards his weak side.

724
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,373
- He only come up to your waist.
- Man, bell.

725
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,615
- That was a quick two minutes.
- Yeah, I know.

726
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,153
Get you some water, boy, and spit it out.

727
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,989
- You all right?
- Dizzy.

728
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,454
That's why the hell
I keep telling you you got to breathe, boy.

729
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,360
So, what? You had enough?

730
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,400
- No, I'm good.
- All right, all right.

731
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,401
- Let's go, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin!

732
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,301
- Come on, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin.

733
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,000
- Let's go, Justin.
- Come on.

734
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,634
Jab, Justin. Gotta jab.

735
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,460
Hey, we're up. Here it is.

736
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,496
<i>- It's me, man.</i>
<i>- You heard from the fat man?</i>

737
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,155
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- We low, right?</i>

738
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:12,030
<i>- One mark shy of the mark.</i>
<i>- Yeah, it's light.</i>

739
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,864
<i>- Cherry say it's light.</i>
<i>- Tell the man I'm doing what needs done.</i>

740
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,167
<i>All right, I'll tell him.</i>
<i>Oh, and that other thing?</i>

741
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,503
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Them two hitters you asked after.</i>

742
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,841
<i>- He good with it.</i>
<i>- Not on the phone.</i>

743
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,982
- That's it.
- We got it!

744
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:37,987
Good work.

745
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,026
I guess this is pertinent.

746
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,034
Yeah!

747
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:16,656
Ain't no need to go back out.
You ain't got to prove nothing.

748
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:21,066
Shoot, my momma hit me harder than that.
I still got a chance, he getting tired.

749
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,900
Drink and spit.

750
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,834
- Ready.
- You more than ready, boy.

751
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,381
- You game rooster.
- Let's go, Justin.

752
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,676
Hey, Justin.

753
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:52,958
- Is there an alley entrance?
- Boarded up on both sides.

754
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,400
So we gonna have to go through the front.

755
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,499
That's a change for you, isn't it?

756
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,204
You just be ready, Bow Tie.
You know what I'm talking about?

757
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,090
Breathe, boy. Breathe.

758
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,258
Touch gloves.

759
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,863
- How'd I do?
- You still got plenty to learn.

760
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,306
But on the heart side? You did good.

761
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,876
Go on home, soldier. You done for the day.

762
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,793
Oh, I can see it all clearly now.

763
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,920
Between you and them subcontractors
and that motherfucking politician...

764
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,395
y'all had me in a spin, right?

765
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,728
- Mr. Bell, I don't know...
- Little man!

766
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,697
We gonna get all this shit sorted out.
And, hey, if the shit don't come up right...

767
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,137
one way or another
you gonna pay for this shit.

768
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,175
Look, I understand you're angry
but at the same time...

769
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,743
you can see
the progress we've made in here.

770
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,402
- Progress.
- Now I honestly don't know what...

771
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,945
passed between you and Senator Davis.

772
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,844
But if you're unhappy
with Clayton's performance...

773
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,940
then you have to work that out...

774
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,980
- Shit.
- Oh, God.

775
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,751
Oh, God, no.

776
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,061
Oh, God, no, <i>no...</i>

777
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,931
I ain't strapped.

778
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,036
Look, man, I ain't involved.

779
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,841
I ain't involved
in that gangster bullshit no more.

780
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,779
What y'all niggers want, man?
Huh? Money?

781
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,758
Is that it?

782
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,590
'Cause if it is, man,
I can be a better friend to y'all alive.

783
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,602
You still don't get it, do you?

784
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,305
Huh?

785
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,965
This ain't about your money, bro.

786
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,237
Your boy gave you up.

787
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:53,446
That's right.
And we ain't had to torture his ass, neither.

788
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,598
Well, it seem <i>like...</i>

789
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,203
I can't say nothing to change y'all minds.

790
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,186
Well, get on with it, mother...
