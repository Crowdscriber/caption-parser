1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,519
There she is!
The old library.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,970
That's some late nights in there.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,570
Some of them I even spent studying.
Don't tell your mom.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,930
And maybe don't tell me.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,260
College!

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,840
He was shielding
his eyes from the sun.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,910
Knew it when I hit it.

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,860
Phil is taking Haley
to visit his Alma Mater.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,690
Loved college.

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,650
Mm, we were hoping some of that
enthusiasm rubs off on her.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,500
Go, bullfrogs!

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,710
Dogs. Bulldogs. I feel
like you do that on purpose.

13
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,880
No, it's just... I say "bull, " and
I can't remember if it's frogs or dogs.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,780
When I talk to my old friends from
college, do we croak or do we bark?

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,960
I got it.
Hello?

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,370
No way! Haley, no way!
Check it out!

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,550
After a few beers, my buds and I
would jump on these lunch trays

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,200
and race down this same hill.
Hop on.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,250
- I don't want to to hop on.
- Seriously, you'll get the giggles.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,770
I don't want the giggles.

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,505
Hey, honey.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,660
- How's the trip going?
- So good.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,680
Go, bullfrogs.

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,200
It's dogs.

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,500
Oh, sorry. How's Haley doing?

26
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,290
She's... she's loving it.
She's loving it.

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,900
I showed her the student union.
We visited the dorms.

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,980
We sat in on a class.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,570
I really think she's starting
to see what college has to offer.

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,830
Oh, hang on, Claire.

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,560
Go, bulldogs!

32
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:45,851

33
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,970
Manny, who is this Bella girl, and why
is her name all over your notebook?

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,380
Bella's no girl, mom.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,830
She has recently blossomed,
like a purple lilac in April.

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,090
What do you mean, she blossom?

37
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,310
Like, the poo-berty?

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,050
Yeah.
I'll get it.

39
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,510
Hey, Gloria, your show's
about to start.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,440
Record it.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,990
No, the DVR's filling up.
Let's just watch and get it over with.

42
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,960
Gloria's always saying we
should do more stuff together.

43
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,840
So I agreed to watch this crazy
Colombian soap opera she loves.

44
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
"Fuego y hielo."

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,120
Which apparently, is Spanish
for "big hair and yelling."

46
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,610
"Fire and ice." It's about
human suffering. I relate to it.

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,010
I'm just saying, the guy's a judge.
He can put a shirt on.

48
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,849
- Ay, what is that?
- Oh, nothing.

49
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,630
That doesn't look like a
nothing. What is inside?

50
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,170
Oh, it's just something I bought.

51
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm gonna go open it in my room.

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,700
I don't like this.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,929
Manny has never kept a secret from me.

54
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,360
Don't worry about it.

55
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,240
What do you think it could be?

56
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,270
Well, right now I'm a little worried
it could be the rest of my evening.

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,900
Mwah!
Bye-bye. Love you.

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,959
Hey, Claire, listen. Uh, if you want,
some of the moms are gonna stay and watch

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,190
"Gone with the wind" in
my new screening room.

60
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,850
I got Pinot!

61
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,810
I would love to, but
I'm not feeling that great,

62
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,380
so I'm probably just
gonna go home and rest.

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,640
Plus I've seen that movie.

64
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,160
No, I never saw
"Gone with the wind,"

65
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,070
but I have two kids at sleepovers,
and Haley's out of town with Phil.

66
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,840
That means I have one night to myself,
which happens once every never.

67
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,160
I am not spending it with some gossipy
mom who was mean to me in High School.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,250
I need a fun night out.

69
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,050
What the hell is this?
No.

70
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,680
I asked you guys for
a fun night out, not this.

71
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,080
I-I-I need music and dancing
and secondhand smoke.

72
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,050
Oh, please give this place
a chance. It's a great value.

73
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,990
The room is so cozy,
and the potpies are to die for.

74
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,040
Are you really comfortable
with what you just said?

75
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Come on. What happened to the
party people who took me to a rave,

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,880
and I got to wear a tube top, and I stuffed
cash in a caged go-go boy's speedo?

77
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,460
We're still party people.

78
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, Joanne, before I
forget, can I get a punch?

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,550
One away from a free potpie.

80
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,400
If that was your gay card,
it would be revoked.

81
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,930
Okay, you know what, Claire?

82
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,980
You're being a little High School you.

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,440
I am sorry, Mitchell,
but I get one free night,

84
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,330
and I can't spend it at a place that is
a proud supporter of Wilson Elementary.

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,060
- We all need to give back, Claire.
- Give me back my night.

86
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,050
Okay, well, Longinus did invite us to a
boutique opening, you know, cocktails, DJ.

87
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,860
But it'll... it'll be
a whole scene, though.

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,140
A scene? A scene is perfect.
That's great.

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,860
I will get in the car before
you guys change your mind.

90
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,689
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

91
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,010
So does that mean no potpies?

92
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,320
Uh, hey, Joanne?
Two number nines to go.

93
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,080
Was I wrong?

94
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,130
Are these not the best wings
you've ever had in your life?

95
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,960
- Oh, my God.
- And you didn't wanna get 40.

96
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,100
Oh, and by the way, this is
just the start of your evening.

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,290
Next up, it's over to the quad for a
musical interlude from tenors, anyone?

98
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,290
It's an all-male singing group...

99
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,950
Got it.

100
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,060
Weren't you on my tour this morning?

101
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,880
Yeah, I'm Haley,
and this is my d...

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,980
Big Brother. You bought it
for a second. How are you?

103
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,740
Okay.
Anyway, you know what?

104
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,900
There is a student
mixer going on tonight.

105
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,910
If you wanna go, me and a bunch of
other girls are gonna head over there.

106
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,900
Oh! Uh, you know what?
That's okay.

107
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,860
My dad's got this whole thing
planned... but thank you anyway.

108
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,780
No problem.
Well, it was nice meeting you.

109
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,270
Nice meeting you.

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,640
How fun is this?
Just me and you.

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,190
I was a little nervous you wouldn't see
what's so special about this place.

112
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,850
Not that I'm pushing you to come here.

113
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,580
You know, you're... you're
gonna make your own decisions.

114
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,690
You wanna go with them, don't you?

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,750
No, we're doing our thing.

116
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,730
Yeah, quick. Before they leave.

117
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,650
- Are you sure?
- Go. I can handle it.

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,300
You're not the first girl to leave me at
this table with a plateful of chicken wings.

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm kidding!

120
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,190
I wish I was kidding.

121
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,990
You weren't supposed
to hear that. Have fun.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
Okay.
Love you.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,930
Love you.

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,570
Nose job.

125
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,190
Butt lift. Last summer, that thing
was 4 inches off the ground.

126
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,780
What do they do with all
the butt they take out?

127
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,130
I have a theory.

128
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,800
Oh, damn! Here comes my ex.

129
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,100
- Who? Randolph?
- Marcus?

130
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,700
- Lamichael?
- No. Matt. I gotta go.

131
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,690
Drama. Love it!
This is what I wanted.

132
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,040
- Who needs a drink?
- I could use a little seltzer water.

133
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,829
- More bubbly, Claire?
- Mm, I will be after I get a drink.

134
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,270
See, that's what gay
is supposed to be like.

135
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,290
Okay, I don't know about you,

136
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,770
but I got about five minutes
of fabulous left in me.

137
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,480
Yeah, in my mind,
I'm already in our kitchen.

138
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm watching my potpie
rotate in the microwave.

139
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,589
Okay. Okay.
When did hats come back?

140
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,980
That one's come back
about eight times.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,930
Pick a side of the room, lady.

142
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,180
All right, there's, like, a
thousand people waiting for wine.

143
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,580
I wanna try on a couple of dresses,

144
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,530
and then Julian here's gonna
take us to a club across town.

145
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,390
I think we're gonna go home.

146
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,140
What? Why? It's 9:30.

147
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,740
It's 9:30?

148
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,050
When did you two
become such old women?

149
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,230
First, you take me to that
senior center for porridge,

150
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,170
and now you can't even
stay up past Luke's bedtime?

151
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,850
- It's Friday. We get tired on Fridays.
- We get very tired.

152
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,330
I have 3 children.
I've been tired since 2005.

153
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,250
Let's rally. You're my ride.

154
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,560
If you want to stay out,
I can take you home.

155
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,040
- Really?
- Of course.

156
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,400
Okay. All right, girls, go home,
roll up your hair, clap out the lights,

157
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,780
'cause this guy, who I just met,
is gonna show me a good time.

158
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,060
Okay, well, if he was straight, this
would be just like High School.

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,170
This is ridiculous.

160
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,330
She's obviously got a
pistol under that poncho.

161
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,380
How do you watch this stuff?

162
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,390
He's been up there for more
than one hour. I can't stand this.

163
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,680
Who's been up there? Ronaldo's doing
the dishes right in front of her.

164
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,250
Manny, in his bedroom.

165
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,240
Gloria, are you even watching this?

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,670
I'm doing this for you.

167
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,560
What does he has in that box
that he cannot show to me?

168
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,060
Little boys are supposed to
keep secrets from their mothers.

169
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,940
Wait. The judge just
peeked through the window.

170
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,940
Is he interested in Celia now?

171
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,410
She could be his daughter.

172
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,070
I bet it's a birthday gift for me.

173
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,770
Yeah, that sounds right.
What's he saying?

174
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,740
I've never seen him this mad.

175
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,690
Wait a minute.

176
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,030
I already found my birthday gift
underneath his bed.

177
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,780
It's a giant hat.

178
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,750
When did hats came back anyway?

179
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,460
Now she's reaching
under the poncho.

180
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,470
Like she's gonna shoot Ronaldo.

181
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,140
He's the main character, right?

182
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,260
That's it. I'm going up there.

183
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,980
Wait, Gloria. No. Don't go.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,410
- Why not?
- Think about it.

185
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,010
13-year-old boy,
talks about girls all day long.

186
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,880
We have more security on these
computers than the Pentagon.

187
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,100
What do you think he's
doing up there... alone?

188
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,410
Do you think he ordered
some movies?

189
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Movies, magazines,
whatever the hell.

190
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,010
How dare do you say that, Jay?!

191
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,559
He's a little boy! He's just a boy.

192
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,460
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm gonna take a walk.

193
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:34,060
Gloria, come on. Come back.
I know you're not mad at me.

194
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,860
You just...
Oh! What'd she do?

195
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,170
Ronaldo!

196
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,700
Wang chung!

197
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,840
Pay up, gentlemen!

198
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,040
Yes! Thank you!

199
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,950
Really? That's so nice.

200
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,540
Another pitcher, my good woman.

201
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,620
Claire would have killed me if she'd
known that I let Haley go off alone

202
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,020
while I chilled in a bar with some undergrads,
but I happen to trust my daughter.

203
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,400
Also, I was tracking her location
with the GPS on her phone.

204
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,910
Fellas, Cedar and Los Alamos.
That's, uh... Pi Chi house?

205
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,610
Pi Chi?

206
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,590
Oh, come on. Why is my
Bluetooth not working?

207
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,810
Oh, God. It's Longinus.
He's gonna be so mad at us.

208
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,860
Hey, Longe. Don't be
mad at us for leaving.

209
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
I went back to our spot,
and everybody was gone.

210
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,290
Who does that to a sister?!

211
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,600
We're sorry, but the sitter called,
and, uh, Lily was running a fever.

212
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,940
So... we feel even worse about dumping
Claire on you and your hot date.

213
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,239
Who is gorgeous, by the way.
Seems super funny, too. Perfect for you.

214
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,610
Please, I wish that was a date.
He's my trainer, and he's straight.

215
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,950
What? Julian's straight.

216
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,700
Oh, I love it when a straight person
and a gay person go out together.

217
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,370
I'd love it a lot more
if he was gay.

218
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,490
Oh, my God. This isn't our car.

219
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,570
- What?
- This isn't our Prius!

220
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,810
They... they must've given us
the wrong one at the valet.

221
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,550
That's why the Bluetooth
isn't working.

222
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,610
- We stole a car? Are you serious?
- What's happening?

223
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,450
Oh, we stole a car.
Uh, we gotta go.

224
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,140
Okay, we did not steal a car, Cam.
It was given to us.

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,600
Why are you giving me attitude?
You're the one that stole a car.

226
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,610
How is this a stolen car?! How?!

227
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,240
I don't know! I'm confused!
Do you have an aspirin?

228
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,010
This isn't my car!

229
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,260
Hey, Lukie. Hi.
What's going on?

230
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,750
I'll check.

231
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,420
I have it.

232
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,860
Well, I could bring it by and
meet you outside in 20 minutes?

233
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,560
No, sw... out... out...
Outside, sweetie.

234
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,680
Okay. Bye-bye.

235
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,360
Do you mind swinging
by my kid's sleepover?

236
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,640
I gotta give him this retainer.
It's on the way to the club.

237
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,590
Sure, no problem.

238
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,950
You are so sweet.

239
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,050
Holy pythons, Batman.
Do you ever leave the gym?

240
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,370
Uh, no. Actually,
I'm a trainer and a masseur.

241
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,990
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have
to try out that second one.

242
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,180
Zip, please.

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,390
I gotta say, this night is turning out
to be a lot more fun than I expected.

244
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,940
I've got two kids at sleepovers
and one upstate with daddy.

245
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,280
The fun is just beginning.

246
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,230
Unbelievable. The valet gave
our car away to someone, like,

247
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,750
and hour and a half ago.

248
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,780
You know what that means.
Our potpies could be anywhere by now.

249
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,050
Y... they probably went home.
If... if we knew their address,

250
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,820
maybe we could see
if our car was there.

251
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,020
Oh, yeah. And how do
you propose we do that?

252
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,630
Calculating route home.

253
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,350
Oh, you're good.
Oh, and look. Only .6 miles away.

254
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,480
Prepare to turn right in 500 feet.

255
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,150
Notice how she didn't wait until
after the turn to tell me, Cam?

256
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,490
- Really? This? Now?
- I'm just...

257
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,030
Oh, look. They went to see Jay-Z.

258
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,510
We almost went
to see Jay-Z, didn't we?

259
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,470
No, no, no, 'cause remember
it started at 8:30.

260
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,760
Oh, yeah, which meant he wouldn't
have gone on until 10:00.

261
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,800
- And then that parking nightmare.
- Oh, and those stairs.

262
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,750
Okay, I'm hearing it now.

263
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,560
Is Claire right? Are we in a rut?

264
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,790
Well, we might be, especially
compared to these people.

265
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,440
Look at this.
Cancun luggage tickets.

266
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,210
A parking pass to Yosemite.

267
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,840
A triathlon bib.
This is living.

268
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,260
No, but you know what?
We have Lily, okay?

269
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,930
I know. You can't do that with a child.

270
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,990
They have a car seat.

271
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,480
Okay, fine, we're in a rut.

272
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,880
Destination ahead in 900 feet.

273
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,650
You know, maybe we just need
to be around more stimulating people.

274
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,470
Well, we're gonna be
in about 900 feet.

275
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,810
It's not the craziest idea.
They seem like fun people.

276
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,780
Yeah, and maybe we can be
new couples friends with them.

277
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,700
You know, we can go out to concerts,

278
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,510
try exciting new food,
maybe do some luxury camping.

279
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,440
Yeah, hitch our wagon to their star and
see how fast they spice up our life.

280
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,470
You have arrived.

281
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,100
I believe we have.

282
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,410
You dumb son of a bitch!

283
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,520
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- What's happening?!

284
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,329
I can't believe you came back here,
you filthy, cheating pig!

285
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,570
Where is she? Where is she?!

286
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:49,610
I'm trying! We are in a rut!

287
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,270
Really? You wanna talk
about that right now?

288
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,310
No, we are stuck! We're in
an actual rut. We're stuck.

289
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,420
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

290
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,270
We are victims of
a hate crime right now!

291
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,080
- Go! Go!
- Oh, my God!

292
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,500
Oh, no, you don't.

293
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,658
Dad, what are you doing here?

294
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,370
- What's this, buddy.
- Ginger ale.

295
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,850
Oh, really? 'Cause is smells...
Okay, it smells like ginger ale.

296
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,090
But that doesn't prove anything.

297
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,640
- What the hell?
- We are leaving.

298
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,910
- I'm having a nice time with...
- With this clown?

299
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,860
And by the way, it's a little cliche to pick
someone who looks exactly like your dad.

300
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,430
I got your number, Pi Chi.

301
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,650
- I know you.
- Yeah, you do.

302
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,480
This is Ben Ford. He's in my class.
He's visiting, too.

303
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,130
You were my T-ball coach.

304
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,190
My dad's your doctor.
He's right over there.

305
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,030
What is wrong with you?

306
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,579
Are you trying to ruin college
for me before I even get here?

307
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,740
No, I-I'm not. I am so sorry.
You are not a clown.

308
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,240
You were an excellent
backup shortstop.

309
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,540
Alecia. Bruce. Go, bullfrogs...
Dogs! Go, bulldogs.

310
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,150
Claire!

311
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,250
Wow. Really?

312
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,190
No, it's just a shock, is all.

313
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,370
Jay?

314
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,840
So Celia's carrying
the judge's baby.

315
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,330
No wonder she shot him.
She's hormonal.

316
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,950
- Who are you talking to?
- The housekeeper.

317
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,300
Maria, I've gotta go.
Thanks a lot.

318
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,050
- Jay, I need you to talk to Manny.
- What?

319
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,760
Well, if he's doing what
you think he's doing,

320
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,520
then he needs to talk to a man.

321
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't want him to
be ashame of anything.

322
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,600
Then you don't want
to send me in there.

323
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,060
Yeah, but what if...
if he has questions?

324
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,300
What if he doesn't
know how to...

325
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,020
Gloria, Gloria, whatever he's going
through, he can work it out himself.

326
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,630
Help! I'm stuck!

327
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,530
Ay, no, Jay, go. I beg of you!

328
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,940
- Go! Go! Go!
- Gloria.

329
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,270
I'm extremely reluctant to do this.

330
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,760
Please hurry!

331
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,190
Ay, no. I cannot look at this.

332
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,440
- What the hell?
- I can't get down, Jay.

333
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,240
What? What happened to Manny?!

334
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,790
Ay, somebody say
something to me!

335
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,380
- Gloria, it's okay. Come on in.
- Okay.

336
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,120
He was hanging from
that bar up there.

337
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,960
What? Why?
What do you have on your head?

338
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,040
It's a weighted helmet to
stretch me so I can get taller.

339
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,540
Manny! Why do you
have to get tall now?

340
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,250
Love, mom. Why else?

341
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,000
I lost Bella to Durkus because,
in her words, "he's tall."

342
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,330
Everybody else
is getting taller but me.

343
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,210
You think it's the coffee?

344
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,300
No. Maybe.

345
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,590
But... but hanging downside up
is not gonna help you.

346
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,660
The web site said it would.

347
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,010
Listen, Manny, you're already
intelligent and beautiful and funny.

348
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,190
If you get tall, you're
going to have everything,

349
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,490
and those poor boys are not gonna
have anything to compete with you.

350
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,960
Look at this.

351
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,230
You have a mark on your head now.

352
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,570
I'm gonna go get you some ice, okay?

353
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,840
That's a lot of pretty words,
but they don't help me tomorrow.

354
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:36,080
Sorry, kid. It's just
one of those things.

355
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,329
You get taller when you get taller.

356
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,890
Why don't you get ready for bed?

357
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,590
Ah, jeez.

358
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,550
You know, when I was your age,
I started working out to get the girls.

359
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,530
- You think that would help?
- Yeah.

360
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,130
So tomorrow, we start working out.
Okay?

361
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,580
Maybe I'll even show you a few pull-ups
on, uh, this bad boy here, huh?

362
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,370
You see that?

363
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,710
Pretty soon, that's how strong...
you're gonna be.

364
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,600
Thanks, mom.

365
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,540
- I don't want them to know I was here.
- Okay.

366
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,050
Oh, Claire, I thought that was you.
Thank God. Come in.

367
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,700
I can't. 'Cause I'm sick, remember?
Sorry.

368
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Well, my DVD player just broke, and none
of us know how "Gone with the wind" ends.

369
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,368
But you saw it, right? I...

370
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,800
- Oh, is that Claire?
- Yeah.

371
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,090
Can you tell us what happened?

372
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,300
I could, but I don't
want to ruin it for you.

373
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,420
Claire. Just tell us.

374
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:40,070
Um... Scarlett is...
really mad at Clark Gable

375
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,910
because, um, he says
so many bad things.

376
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,360
And didn't he, um, burn down
a farm or something?

377
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,920
Claire, have you been drinking?

378
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,920
I had a hot toddy.
Made one for my throat.

379
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,700
Pretty dressed up
for a night in bed, right?

380
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,490
Yeah, I-I just threw on
the first thing I could find...

381
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,360
when Luke called, and it was
just right there on the chair.

382
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,590
She has a stamp on her hand.

383
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,890
Okay. All right.

384
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,400
Before we bust out the
pitchforks and the torches,

385
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,390
may I remind you that I've driven
every one of your children home

386
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,500
and Heimliched
at least one, Bethenny.

387
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,930
- Hi.
- Hello.

388
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,400
This is totally inappropriate.
But could I use your bathroom?

389
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,730
Sorry. You kept pushing the drinks.

390
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,630
I... friend. Gay friend. Gay.

391
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,490
- I'm not gay.
- Yes, you are.

392
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,360
I-I'm not gay. I'm... I'm French.
You thought I was gay?

393
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,300
- Are you serious right now?
- Well, are you?

394
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,780
You've been throwing
yourself at me all night.

395
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,400
No, no. No, I have not.

396
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,170
- Bethenny, grab the Pinot.
- Bethenny, do not grab the Pinot.

397
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,390
You undressed in front of me.
You squeezed my arm.

398
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,680
You asked me for a massage.
What was all that?

399
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,510
That was... that was me safely
objectifying a gay person.

400
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,389
Wow, Claire! When I wrote
"don't ever change" in your yearbook,

401
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,970
I didn't mean it like this.

402
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,850
Oh, ease up, Holly.

403
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,610
Okay, I lied.

404
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,149
I lied, but I get
one night to myself,

405
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,050
and I just wanted to spend it
with some fun gay people.

406
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,018
It's not my fault this one
decided to be straight.

407
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,188
I've always been straight.

408
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:00,620
Oh, you don't get to talk!

409
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,250
I took fashion advice from you!

410
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,320
Oh, my God. Do I even
look good in this dress?

411
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,820
No. Not you.

412
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,699
It's really short, isn't it?

413
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,500
- It's short.
- Yeah.

414
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,360
Please? Please, just listen
to me for one second.

415
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,130
Go away! Stop following me!

416
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,240
Hey, you wanna tell me why
you're bothering this young lady?

417
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,859
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Officer, this is my daughter. Tell him.

418
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,920
Tonight, I don't know who you are.

419
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,590
She's... she's joking.

420
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,920
I'm not dangerous. In fact, I-I-I helped
to put all the lights on this path.

421
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,430
20 years ago, some friends
and I took back the night.

422
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:36,890
So... I-I think I just...
I embarrassed her a little.

423
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,110
"A little"?

424
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,770
That sweatshirt
embarrasses me "a little."

425
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,350
Yep, that's a daughter.

426
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,480
Tonight was insane.
Why did you have to act like that?

427
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,020
You were at that party.
I see you talking to frat boys, and...

428
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,410
Isn't that why we're here,
so I can experience college?

429
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,690
I mean, what are you
gonna do when I actually go?

430
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,700
I don't know.
Freak out, I think.

431
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,500
Look... your whole life, my job
has been to protect you...

432
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,200
a job I kinda love.

433
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,070
Now I feel like I'm being
forced into early retirement.

434
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,130
I just needed to find you
and make sure you were okay...

435
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,800
for as long as
I still get to do that.

436
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:29,850
Just like you... piss me off
and then say something sweet.

437
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm not leaving until the fall.

438
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,390
Maybe by then I can figure out how
to put a force field around you.

439
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,930
I've been working on that one

440
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,780
since the first time I tried to
fasten you into your car seat.

441
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,700
I pinched your chunky little thigh.

442
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,580
Even though you basically
just called me fat.

443
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,210
So... is it really fun?

444
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,360
What?

445
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,280
No!

446
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,320
We all struggle with limitations...

447
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,769
Some we're willing to accept...

448
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:20,060
You know, I just wanna be home,
reading on opposite ends of the sofa.

449
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,620
And some we're not.

450
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,380
I'm so embarrassed I did that.

451
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,050
I'm just so happy that
that was all it was.

452
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,610
Why? What'd you think I was doing?

453
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,140
It's never too late
to grow in life.

454
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,950
Oh, my God!

455
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:39,570
"Thanks to our patented lengthenator, you
can increase your height by up to 4 inches."

456
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,130
I can't believe he would
spend $50 on this thing.

457
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,070
I know. He could've got a 2-year
subscription to "Playboy" for that.

458
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,860
He's not getting the "Playboy" ever!
He's a little boy!

459
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,370
Wouldn't it be great
if we woke up tomorrow

460
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:55,960
and our car had found
its way home?

461
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,590
Yeah, I feel that's not
the way it's gonna happen.

462
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,150
Happened on the farm one time.

463
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,959
A tornado scooped up one of our
calves, dropped it who knows where.

464
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,220
Six months later, a full-grown cow
comes walking up the driveway...

465
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,450
same markings, same moo.
That night, we...

466
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,470
We ate like kings.
Okay, I've told it before.

467
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,040
Oh, my gosh! It's our car!

468
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,500
I see you've met my wife.

469
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,440
