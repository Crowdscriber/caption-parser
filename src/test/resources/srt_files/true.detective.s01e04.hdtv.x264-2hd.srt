_

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,794
What is it you think happened?

3
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,963
Someone killed this girl,
made a big show of it...

4
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:06,758
left a painting
of the crime scene

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,257
on one of your old churches.

6
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:09,567
You're obsessive.

7
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,702
You're obsessive, too,
just not about the job.

8
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:14,111
Are you gonna go home
with this guy?

9
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:15,744
Really none of your business.

10
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,438
Stop!

11
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:18,662
You know if it's true?

12
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,128
I didn't hear anything.

13
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,277
What have you been
doing, Marty?

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,579
I found another girl.

15
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,373
She was positive for
meth and LSD.

16
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,776
You ever think maybe

17
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:30,592
he tried to push things
where he wanted them to go?

18
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,352
Hey, we caught a break
in the case, boss.

19
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,856
I thought you were
handing that off.

20
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,842
She had a boyfriend
you know about?

21
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,153
Reggie.

22
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,624
Reggie Ledoux.

23
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,080
Reggie Ledoux skipped
parole 8 months ago.

24
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,971
He's busted in connection
to a narcotics lab

25
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,013
used to make meth and LSD,

26
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,744
did two years at Avoyelles,

27
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,685
and guess who his cellmate was
the last 4 months.

28
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,872
Charlie Lange.

29
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,926
What Dori do?

30
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,240
Dori's dead.

31
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,302
I need an all-state APB
on one Reginald Ledoux.

True Detective - 1x04
"Who Goes There"

51
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,145
What you doing?

52
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,549
You fucked with us, Charlie.

53
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:45,709
I did not, sir.

54
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,417
Reggie Ledoux.

55
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,441
Hey, I don't even want
to know that freak, man.

56
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:54,526
Y'all ain't asked
nothin' about Reggie.

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,568
Fuck, man, my--
my wife just died--

58
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,065
Ex-wife!

59
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,016
You had Reggie Ledoux
take her out,

60
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,904
didn't you?

61
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,024
- No.
- Hmm?

62
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,335
- What are you talking about, man?
- Hmm?

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,733
Reggie? Put her out there
with them antlers on? I--

64
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,172
You have Reggie do it?

65
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,648
- What are you talking about?
- Hmm?

66
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,184
Reggie Ledoux did this?

67
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,108
Reggie Ledoux?

68
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:18,029
Reggie motherfuckin'
Ledoux did this?!

69
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,038
Fuck, man! Shit!
Let me out, man!

70
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,577
Let me out!
Fuck, man!

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,455
Hey, Charlie?

72
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:27,168
We're not gonna give you the Oscar
no matter how hard you try.

73
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,787
Oh, fuck you, man.
You don't know me.

74
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:33,026
You don't know
what I been through.

75
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,329
And what are you talking
about? You talk to me!

76
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,776
Ledoux knew about her, right?

77
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,512
You talk about her to him?

78
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,911
Yeah, man-- yeah, the way
you do sharing a house.

79
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,734
Yeah, you talk pussy,
talk scores.

80
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,712
That's what you do.

81
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,503
Showed him pictures
of her, hmm?

82
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:50,816
Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

83
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,951
I had some she give me
when I first went down,

84
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:54,941
stuff for me to look at.

85
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,340
You know, like Polaroids.

86
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,424
He was a big guy--

87
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,984
a lot bigger than you.

88
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:04,192
Do you tell me you
didn't get along?

89
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,440
Nah, I mean, I did, most part.

90
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,008
You've got to,
you're sharing a house,

91
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,417
like I'm saying.

92
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,585
I mean, he gets you high, man, but he's creep.
I ain't want to know him.

93
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,923
Tell me about Ledoux.

94
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,187
How is he creep?

95
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,965
He's a cook, you know,
like a chemist?

96
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,336
He used to, uh, make shit
out of kitchen stuff--

97
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:25,247
cook down cleansers
and whatnot.

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,552
Used tater skins and fry grease
to make high-test sour mash.

99
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,596
He got mad knowledge for that shit,
but, like, I don't know, man,

100
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,184
he talk like a short-eyes,
like something.

101
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:36,358
How you mean? He wouldn't
talk that shit up in here.

102
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,529
No, man, he didn't. Like,
me and him at night,

103
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:41,148
blasted up on one of his mixes.

104
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,199
I mean, he could
brew some shit up

105
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:44,672
put you up out your head, man.

106
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,207
That's a big deal in here.

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,103
I mean, fuck, man, it's a
big deal out there, too.

108
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:52,055
So, uh, what kind
of shit was he talking?

109
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,128
He said that there's
this place down south

110
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:59,619
where all these rich men
go to, uh, devil-worship.

111
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:01,985
He said that, uh...

112
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:04,990
they-- they sacrifice
kids and whatnot.

113
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:06,528
Women and children
all got--

114
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,834
all got murdered there,
and, um,

115
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,467
something about someplace
called Carcosa

116
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:13,095
and the Yellow King.

117
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:16,541
He said there's all these, like,
old stones out in the woods,

118
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:20,288
people go to, like, worship.

119
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,489
He said, uh...

120
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,320
He said there's just so much
good killin' down there.

121
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:27,517
Reggie got this
brand on his back,

122
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,696
like in a spiral?

123
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,093
He says that's their sign.

124
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,629
What the fuck ever,
you understand?

125
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,230
I don't listen
to the man, but he's big,

126
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:37,765
so I don't tell him to
shut the fuck up, neither!

127
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:41,344
You remember any buddies
he ever talked about?

128
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:42,679
So we checked the records here,

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,118
and he hadn't ever
had any visitors.

130
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,486
We both know Tyro Weems.

131
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,387
Tyrone like to tell you
where he's at.

132
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,756
Look, man, Reggie's
crazy, like, for real.

133
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,634
Had to be tough,

134
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,336
living with somebody
spouting insane shit

135
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,354
in your ear all day long.

136
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:15,104
You gonna give me something
for what I told you just now?

137
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,311
Parole board nod.

138
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,243
Fair's fair.

139
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,632
Hey. Hey!

140
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:35,616
You think 'cause I talked
to him about Dori that...

141
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,398
I might have got her killed?

142
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:42,752
You probably had
something to do with it.

143
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,995
I don't think you should have
shown him those pictures.

144
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,916
Do you?

145
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:11,072
We need to find
this Tyrone Weems,

146
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,976
see what he knows about Ledoux.

147
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,847
Yeah.

148
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,478
Ahem.

149
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,407
You didn't have to tell
him it was his fault.

150
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:24,744
Guy was already low.

151
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,047
Yeah, he asked
about his end first.

152
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,656
Parole board.

153
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,794
So?

154
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,658
So fuck him.

155
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,560
You're funny, Marty--

156
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:45,528
the shit you get soft about.

157
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:48,926
I wanted every member
of that family that I could find.

158
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,799
Turns out...

159
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:52,706
there weren't any.

160
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,474
You know how weird
that is in Louisiana?

161
00:07:56,507 --> 00:08:00,542
A cousin, what was it,
Dewall, was

162
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:06,045
not on paper except
for a, uh, trucker's license.

163
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:09,182
Ledoux had turned into a ghost

164
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,443
from the time he skipped
parole check.

165
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,584
Tell me, young studs,

166
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:20,621
what would you do
when you hit a wall like that?

167
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:25,818
Responding to the complaint,
I approached the house.

168
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:31,857
Seeing that the screen door
was broken and the inner door...

169
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,265
ajar, I-- I felt that entrance

170
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,464
complied with standard
procedure.

171
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,136
Upon entering
the domicile, I noticed

172
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,546
what appeared to be marijuana
and a white powder

173
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,111
on the coffee table.

174
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,408
Hey, Martin.

175
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:58,440
We don't have to talk, Lisa.

176
00:08:58,473 --> 00:08:59,520
The hell we don't.

177
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,679
You don't get to do what
you did to me last week.

178
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:05,384
Look, I'm sorry. I was
hurt and real drunk.

179
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,415
Talk to me now.

180
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,136
Okay. Ah, I wish you
a great life

181
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,240
and good luck with
your new friend.

182
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:16,279
You philandering
fucking asshole.

183
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:17,248
Hey, look.

184
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:20,448
There is no pageant
to perform, okay, and

185
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:23,119
your disappointment
is irrelevant.

186
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:25,721
You don't get to act
like that, Marty,

187
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:27,519
or like this.

188
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:28,919
The fact is it's nice
to know you got him,

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,224
and I don't want to have
this conversation with you.

190
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,494
You need to respect me, Marty.

191
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,862
This is respect.

192
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:41,374
Rust figured a connection with
an earlier death, suspicious--

193
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:44,192
Rianne Olivier.

194
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:48,696
Led us to the DB's old
boyfriend, Reginald Ledoux, 35.

195
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:51,389
Statch rape charge
against a 12-year-old,

196
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,396
acquitted for lack of testimony.

197
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,117
Did a bit for manufacturing
meth and LSD,

198
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,525
which fits the tox screen
for Lange.

199
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:03,104
His old cellmate
was Lange's ex-husband.

200
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,367
He showed him some
cheesecake pictures of her.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,872
Uh, from what we
know about him,

202
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:08,832
the way he talked,

203
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:11,528
he sounds like he's
real good for it.

204
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,297
No line on any of his people.

205
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,391
Swamp folk, dug in
off the grid.

206
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:19,337
We are tracking
a KA, Tyrone Weems.

207
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,315
He's in the sheets
that we passed out.

208
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,650
Any questions?

209
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:26,214
I didn't think so.
Let's get to work.

210
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:58,122
Are you Theresa Weems,

211
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,871
Tyrone Weems' mom?

212
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,208
Tyrone ain't been around
in a while.

213
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,607
You know, a few months.

214
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,880
We got in a fight 'cause
he sold my microwave.

215
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,960
And what about his friends?

216
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:11,960
You know where they hang out?

217
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:13,560
I don't know, he dated
this girl Kelsey

218
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:15,464
for a little while.

219
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:18,464
Kelsey, when's the
last time you saw Tyrone?

220
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,474
Months.
We've been broke up.

221
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,868
I don't ever hear from him.
I don't want to.

222
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,952
I heard he got
Shawnda Miller pregnant.

223
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,302
So do you have his
address, phone number?

224
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,672
Look. I really wish I could
help you, but I can't.

225
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,943
I have to get back to work.

226
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,098
Hey.

227
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:04,034
You know that gal back there?

228
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,464
She got a man, manager?

229
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:18,006
Hey, do I got to pull my badge?

230
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,510
Hey, we run clean here.

231
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,646
How you gonna run
when you're shut down

232
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,208
6 months for
a grand jury inquiry?

233
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:31,437
Why are you making me
say this shit, man?

234
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,084
Do you know her old man?

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, he came around,
collecting from her.

236
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,951
Boss kicked him out for trying
to sell christie, the girls.

237
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,121
That was about a month ago.

238
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,720
Look familiar?

239
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:47,164
- Yeah, that's him.
- He ever pick her up?

240
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,701
Yeah.

241
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,741
Went to work on Tyro
Weems, known associates, family.

242
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:55,399
Had a little leeway
with Quesada

243
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:58,749
now that we had our suspect.

244
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,769
Fuck!

245
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:55,938
Fuck! Fuck!
Goddamn it!

246
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:58,075
- Lisa?
- How does it feel?

247
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,442
I told you you can't
treat people like this.

248
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:03,167
Listen, I just need to know

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,440
exactly what you told her.

250
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:07,166
You think it's okay
what you do?

251
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,668
All of you think it's okay
to treat your wives

252
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,790
the way you do,
to treat women the way--

253
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:14,832
fucking liars and bullies,
and this is what you get!

254
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,496
This is what you get!

255
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,503
I have children.

256
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,502
You blew up my life,

257
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:22,134
you fucking whore!

258
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,775
What did you just call me?!

259
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:28,143
What did you just call me, you fucking
wet-noodle, whiskey-dick faggot fuck?!

260
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:30,474
I will skull-fuck you,
you bitch!

261
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:38,982
Hello, Jake?

262
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,928
- Jake, is this you?
- Marty?

263
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,966
- Is Maggie there?
- That's none of your goddamn business.

264
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,080
Jake, I know she's there,

265
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:47,745
I know she's there,
so just put her

266
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,470
on the phone,
would you, please?

267
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:52,576
Leave her alone,
you fuckin' asshole.

268
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,436
- Jake, I--
- You're not hearing me.

269
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,508
- I don't know what she told you.
- Leave her alone.

270
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,560
And I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye--

271
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,449
- You're goddamn right, we haven't
seen eye to eye. - Just please,

272
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,272
- put her on the phone
for me. Just please-- - No, no.

273
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:03,648
You are no damn good, Marty,

274
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:05,823
she deserves better,
and don't call here again.

275
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,096
Jake.

276
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:14,499
How many exes you guys have?

277
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,372
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

278
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:20,578
Did I make some mistakes?

279
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:21,438
Yes.

280
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,902
You know the detective's curse?

281
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:29,056
Solution was right under my nose, but I
was paying attention to the wrong clues?

282
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,704
- See you later.
- Bye, hon.

283
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:21,989
Fuck.

284
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,576
Reggie Ledoux.
Where is he? Now.

285
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,480
That's what this is about? Yo,
man, why didn't you say so?

286
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:29,943
Where the fuck is he?

287
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,815
I-- I heard
he still cook.

288
00:18:31,848 --> 00:18:33,953
I heard he stopped selling
after he did his bit,

289
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:35,872
that he only cook
for one client now.

290
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,374
Who?

291
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,006
Some bike gang.

292
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,014
They buy all his product.
Bulk order, no mess.

293
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,128
I heard this
at the clubs is all.

294
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,045
Reggie don't
distribute no more.

295
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,488
Which bike club?

296
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:50,526
Iron Heroes or some shit.

297
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,326
Iron-- Iron Crusaders.

298
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,132
I don't keep up
with them gearheads.

299
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,664
Iron Crusaders?
You sure?

300
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,128
Yup. Them ones.

301
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:07,232
What I heard, Reggie cook
their loads and that's all.

302
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,856
Close your eyes and
count to a hundred,

303
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,855
if you can.

304
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,358
Go.

305
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:15,326
1... 2...

306
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,859
- Louder.
- 3!

307
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:20,459
4... 5...

308
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,458
Listen I-- I talked to Weems and, uh,

309
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:28,368
the dude is cooking for some
motorcycle gang out of Texas.

310
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,336
Iron Crusaders.

311
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
but-- Iron-- Iron Crusaders?

312
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,718
You're sure he said
Iron Crusaders?

313
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,121
I'm sure he said
Iron Crusaders.

314
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:39,712
So we'll, uh,

315
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,826
we'll chase that
tomorrow, yeah?

316
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,864
- What are you doing right now?
- Right now I'm busy.

317
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:54,719
And, as I recall, I...

318
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:58,082
I had to take
some personal time,

319
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,217
see my dad.

320
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,439
I mean, this is like,
what, 17 years ago?

321
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:09,568
Yeah, you'll have to understand

322
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,100
if my memory hasn't
sharpened in the interim.

323
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,578
Ahem.

324
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,464
Fran, stay by the phone.

325
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,926
I will.

326
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,228
Maggie, can I talk to
you for just a second?

327
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,063
No. I'm working graveyard.

328
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,825
Girls are with my mom and dad.
It's all in the note, Marty.

329
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:31,327
Okay, will you give me
a chance to--

330
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,248
She came to my home.

331
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:35,750
Our daughters saw her.
You lying fuck.

332
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:38,254
You stupid, lying fuck.

333
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,219
Jesus Christ.
Listen to me, Mags.

334
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:44,754
I meant everything I said the
other night, every word.

335
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:46,890
- I-- I stopped.
- Oh, my God.

336
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:49,760
You think your betrayal's
removed by its interruption?

337
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,226
She was disgusting.
You're disgusting.

338
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,144
- You can't fix this.
- Listen to me. God, listen--

339
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:56,256
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.

340
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,791
I-- I've been--
I've been a mess.

341
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,756
Rattled. My...

342
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:04,796
Just...
my dad dying--

343
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,621
- Oh, my God. That was a year ago.
- And drinking and--

344
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:09,216
I don't give a shit about
your goddamn feelings.

345
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:12,286
You need to get out of our
lives, Marty, me and the girls'.

346
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,264
- Read the note. It's all there and you
can't come home. - You don't mean that.

347
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,470
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- You don't mean that.

348
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,902
Listen, I...

349
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:23,103
You are not gonna break up
my fuckin' family, okay?

350
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,927
- Get out of here right now!
- No.

351
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,150
Excuse me.
You all right, Maggie?

352
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,749
Sir, I suggest you leave.

353
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:32,100
Everything's fine, Doc.
I'm State Police.

354
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:35,296
I appreciate that, but are you
here in that capacity now,

355
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,140
as-- as law enforcement?

356
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,024
You don't want to do this.

357
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:34,975
Get your hands
off me, goddamn it,

358
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,575
and call your
commanding officer.

359
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,110
- You're making a scene, Marty!
- No!

360
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:41,248
There is no scene, unless
Mall Patrol here makes one.

361
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:43,515
I am calmly discussing
a private matter

362
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,664
with my wife!

363
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,482
Private in a pretty public way, man.
Easy, easy.

364
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,639
- This is none of your fuckin' business.
- No, no.

365
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:52,606
It's none of my business,
but we got to work.

366
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,141
You hear me, Marty?

367
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,487
I got a line on Ledoux.

368
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,312
I got it right fuckin' now.

369
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:59,909
I need you to come in,
leave this shit till later.

370
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,872
I love you, honey,

371
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:06,038
and I ain't givin' up.

372
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,138
Come on.

373
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:14,307
We can get to Ledoux.
Marty, it's gonna be dirty.

374
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,236
I just need her
to give me another shot.

375
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:20,832
If I could just get
another shot--

376
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,367
Listen, can I
tell you something?

377
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,705
Yeah.

378
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,816
This is none of my business.

379
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,354
I don't want to hear it.

380
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,713
All right. I'm sorry.

381
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:38,747
You total shit.

382
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:41,984
You know, this is part
on you, you know?

383
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,985
You can't just slide
into my life,

384
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:45,891
creating tensions,
judging me--

385
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,992
What, I make you tap some bimbo,
looks like a young Maggie?

386
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:51,325
I make you flaunt that shit?

387
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,284
Fuck, that night
at the Longhorn,

388
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,587
you were so obvious,
man, checking her out,

389
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,593
and she looked crazy enough
to have followed you there.

390
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:02,912
With all the dick swagger you
roll, you can't spot crazy pussy?

391
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:06,272
I fucked up.

392
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:08,280
I just...

393
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,997
I like something wild.
I always did.

394
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,093
I just...
it feels like it--

395
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:18,091
it smoothes out the other
parts of my life most of--

396
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,329
Listen, Marty, one more time.
It's none of my fuckin' business.

397
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:23,298
Ah, fuck.

398
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:26,145
Look, we got a job to do.

399
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:29,248
Off-book. That's the only
play I can think of.

400
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:33,151
I-- I got to straighten out things
with the family. I got to fix it.

401
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,515
That bike club.
I know 'em.

402
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,019
I had deals with 'em when
I was working narco.

403
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:41,632
We can get to that
motherfucker Ledoux.

404
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:44,628
So, enough with this
self-improvement,

405
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:46,687
penance,
hand-wringing shit.

406
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,191
Let's go to work.

407
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,816
Do you think you're...

408
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:54,783
Fuck!

409
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:57,748
Hell of a bedside manner
you got, Rust.

410
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:00,756
Ah, you know being stupid's
different than callin' in sick,

411
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:03,487
and this is a bar,
not a fuckin' bedside.

412
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,615
Friend in need.

413
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:08,961
Every time I think
you hit a ceiling,

414
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:10,928
you just keep raising the bar.

415
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:14,092
You are like the Michael Jordan
of being a son of a bitch.

416
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,660
Let's go. Come on. Really
gonna love this jacket I got.

417
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:24,496
Holy shit.

418
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,737
You visit a lot of gun shows?

419
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,437
Ah, it's just some stuff I kept in
case some work came back on me.

420
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,419
These boys Ledoux deals to,

421
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,976
they're out of east Texas.

422
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:42,113
I worked 'em when I
was DEA task force.

423
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,629
They know you're 5-0?

424
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:48,190
No.

425
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:49,347
I wasn't sure,

426
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:51,850
so I checked with
my old handler.

427
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,858
As far as my cover goes,

428
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:56,767
I took 3 slugs
in a DEA shootout

429
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,328
in Port Houston.

430
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,896
Anybody that gives a
shit figures I'm dead.

431
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,367
Major said

432
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,031
the task force used
to call you Crash.

433
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,870
I'm gonna have to take
some personal time

434
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:15,343
on this, Marty,
a couple of weeks.

435
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:18,404
Got to get out there and
get seen, drop some lines.

436
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:21,107
I mean, badges ain't gonna
get us near these people,

437
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,613
so the plan is
we make 'em an offer...

438
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:27,653
we get a line
on their supplier,

439
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,653
confirm it's Ledoux,

440
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:32,127
bring him in.

441
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,370
And then, once we're out there,

442
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,704
all right, it's just
you and me on this.

443
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,808
I don't like that.

444
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:43,009
What happens, they clock
you're not you?

445
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,343
Mmm.

446
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,504
No, I can't do what I need
to do if we got watchdogs.

447
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:52,411
Besides, like you said,
Quesada'd pull me.

448
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:55,168
The stakes ain't
that high anyway.

449
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,968
I get found, I take
a bullet to the head.

450
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,348
This cartel I worked
on the border,

451
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,640
they, uh, they had
this routine.

452
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:09,343
They'd duct-tape you to a chair
that was bolted to the floor,

453
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:11,228
use a couple rolls,

454
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,304
make sure you couldn't
budge a fuckin' inch.

455
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:17,806
And they'd cut
around your face,

456
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,448
grip your scalp, yank down,

457
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:23,091
rip your face off.

458
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:25,954
Hmm.

459
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:29,223
And they'd put a mirror
in front of you

460
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,064
so you could get
a good look at yourself.

461
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:37,565
And they'd cut your dick
and your balls off...

462
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:42,406
shove 'em down your throat

463
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:44,499
until you bled and choked out,

464
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,633
while you were watching.

465
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,979
So...

466
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,676
as far as high stakes go,

467
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:55,684
bullet to the head?

468
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,151
It ain't that.

469
00:27:58,192 --> 00:27:59,591
Hey.

470
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:03,928
You sure you want to do this?

471
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:07,128
Not exactly.

472
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,947
Realize you got
a upstairs here, right?

473
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:44,529
What is that?

474
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:47,498
Ink and cayenne.

475
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:50,463
Irritates the skin,
looks contused.

476
00:28:50,504 --> 00:28:54,535
How long they have you out
there, working the corridor?

477
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,040
Almost 4 years.

478
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,975
4? What the hell?

479
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:03,415
UCs ain't supposed to
do more than 11 months.

480
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:08,246
Yeah, but I-- I'd
fucked up on the job,

481
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:11,426
and to make it better,
they went with me.

482
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:15,930
That's a long time,
being like that.

483
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:26,706
I need a good story to move
fast, and I think I got one.

484
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:31,546
All we need now is
some good coke.

485
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:34,207
Where you gonna get that?

486
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:38,213
Don't worry about it.

487
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,451
So you got a suspect,

488
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:44,883
and you take a leave
of absence?

489
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,219
Yup.

490
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:49,295
Like I said, to see my pops.

491
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:51,430
Had leukemia.

492
00:29:58,286 --> 00:30:01,280
Favre. Ahem. I get the
evidence key from you?

493
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,783
Yeah. Heard you
were taking time.

494
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:06,286
- Thank you.
- Leaving tonight.

495
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,947
- Sign the log.
- Yep.

496
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:27,387
You supposed to see
both eyes in this one?

497
00:31:57,272 --> 00:32:00,206
They really should have
a better system for this.

498
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,878
We looked at your
old partner's history.

499
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:05,782
And coincidences
keep mounting, Detective.

500
00:32:05,815 --> 00:32:09,251
Oh, coincidences like what?

501
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:12,114
Well, I don't know if it would
qualify as coincidence, but,

502
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,786
near as we could tell, his
pops never had leukemia.

503
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:18,190
- No hospital records of that.
- Fact, nobody in that town in Alaska's

504
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:21,696
seen Travis Cohle
in more than 30 years.

505
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:23,799
That it?

506
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:26,231
You still angry
at him, your pops?

507
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:27,736
No.

508
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,735
He's dead.

509
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,711
You were, though.

510
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,078
I mean, why you two
didn't talk.

511
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:37,113
We never really liked
each other.

512
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:39,754
There's a difference.

513
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:45,021
He was in 'Nam.

514
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:47,955
Met my mother on leave
in Galveston.

515
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:50,219
Time he came back, I was two.

516
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,186
She dumped me on him,

517
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:55,330
then she hauled ass,
and he and I moved to Alaska.

518
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:59,834
He was a survivalist,
I guess you'd call it.

519
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:03,500
Had some very fucking
strange ideas.

520
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:11,504
Oh, there's nothing like
the night sky out there, though.

521
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,080
But I couldn't handle
the cold, so...

522
00:33:16,113 --> 00:33:18,981
I headed back to south Texas
'cause all I could remember

523
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:22,149
was at least it never got cold.

524
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:28,652
My old man always made like
I let him down that way.

525
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:33,659
Said I had no loyalty.

526
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:39,099
A clean break is best now,
while they're still young.

527
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,596
Look, that's none
of my business.

528
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:44,099
I mean, but I do need him
to watch my back on this.

529
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,601
This is how you all get warped.

530
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:49,642
You always short-change
the wrong things.

531
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,139
Short-change?

532
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,643
Mm-hmm.

533
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:54,274
What else?

534
00:33:55,643 --> 00:33:58,148
He wanted me to pass
a tide of apologies

535
00:33:58,181 --> 00:34:00,623
of which I'll skip...

536
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:03,127
and he wants to see the girls,

537
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,791
if you can make time for it.

538
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:15,476
Kids are the only thing
that matter, Maggie.

539
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:19,041
They're the only reason for
this whole man-woman drama.

540
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:21,048
I'm sorry.

541
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:23,509
What are you
suggesting, exactly?

542
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:26,382
Just that people fuck up.

543
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:28,854
We age.

544
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:31,389
Men, women-- it's not
supposed to work

545
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:34,389
except to make kids.

546
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,862
So, if you can imagine

547
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:39,401
Marty's behavior
as an expression

548
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:42,337
of weakness, pain,

549
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,802
you'd see that it's
not about you.

550
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:47,372
So, end of the day, you
duck under rationalization,

551
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:49,844
same as any of them.

552
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:53,411
You must have been
a great husband.

553
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:31,581
People have been seeing me
around for about a week.

554
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:35,053
Guy I used to run with, he
wants to meet me tonight.

555
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:37,550
Now, if I can get him
alone, we snatch him up,

556
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:40,591
work him over,
maybe get to Ledoux.

557
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,056
Okay.

558
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:43,593
- All right?
- Great.

559
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:45,161
Listen--

560
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:47,836
Phone's fully charged. And
remember, it's real simple.

561
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:50,172
Green-- answers,
red-- hangs up.

562
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:52,541
- All right.
- I'm the only one that's gonna be calling.

563
00:35:52,574 --> 00:35:54,709
- Yeah.
- And keep it charged.

564
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,583
Listen, uh, how was she?

565
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,790
What'd she say?

566
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:07,527
She was better. I could
see her softening.

567
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,031
She didn't use the "D" word.

568
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:13,860
My odds, I could see you two back
together within a couple months.

569
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:16,463
That your honest read?

570
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:20,002
That's my honest read, Marty.

571
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,287
Look, I don't know

572
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:47,858
how this guy I'm meeting
tonight feels about me.

573
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,636
- Okay?
- What does that mean?

574
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:53,134
It means, if you lose track of me
tonight, keep this fucker handy

575
00:36:53,174 --> 00:36:56,175
and be listening to
Beaumont police channels.

576
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,807
- Yeah.
- You got it?

577
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,278
Yeah.

578
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:00,741
You got it?

579
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:02,842
I got it. Are you
gonna be all right?

580
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:04,546
Yeah.

581
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:44,082
Crash, here for Ginger.

582
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,578
Well, after Houston,

583
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:18,083
I got to a doc in Eagle Pass,

584
00:38:18,116 --> 00:38:21,583
then a coyote got me
across the border.

585
00:38:21,624 --> 00:38:24,085
Past two years, I been
working security

586
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:26,621
for a group in San Miguel.

587
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,033
Feds never ID'd me,
you know, so I figured,

588
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:34,506
hell, two years pass,
things chill down,

589
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:37,274
it's cool for me to come
back, stick my head up.

590
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:40,242
That'll be tough, man...

591
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:43,239
thinkin' you been dead
this whole time.

592
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,244
I look dead, motherfucker?

593
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:49,277
I'm lookin' to get with you.

594
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,320
You or Miles.

595
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:53,786
Miles ain't gonna want
to see you, Crash.

596
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:56,256
- Oh, I think he might.
- Well, yeah.

597
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,622
Then I'd say

598
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:01,225
I don't think
you want to see Miles.

599
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:03,763
Man, I ain't here to start
a thing, all right?

600
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:06,234
Boys I been running
with in Mexico,

601
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:08,771
there could be a hell of
a deal for both sides,

602
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,814
fuckin' money to be made.

603
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:12,679
Real money.

604
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:15,384
What kind of money?

605
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,902
Goddamn Rust.

606
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:26,030
What the fuck?

607
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,735
My boys are looking
to trade, all right?

608
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:00,040
Coke for meth.

609
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,377
What you got there?
Ahem.

610
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,386
- This one's just for you.
- Just for me?

611
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,385
Uh-huh.

612
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:15,419
What'd you cut it with?

613
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:16,924
Oh, you'll see.

614
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,059
You'll dig it.

615
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:24,068
After all I meant to you, huh?

616
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:36,586
Now, who exactly
are these guys?

617
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,952
Uh, they, uh...

618
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:45,888
ex-Mex Army.

619
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:48,423
They got a Colombian connection.

620
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:51,922
They need meth for
the maquiladoras.

621
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:54,595
Yeah, they could
cook it themselves,

622
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:56,428
but then the cartels
would take notice,

623
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:58,467
and that ain't what
they're lookin' for.

624
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,099
Hmm.

625
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,970
Here.

626
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:08,609
Taste that, homie.

627
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:17,987
That ain't no
fuck-around shit.

628
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,123
Goddamn.

629
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:28,499
Whew.

630
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:30,437
You keep it.

631
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,135
I've got bulldozers' worth of
that shit where I came from.

632
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:39,513
The thing is...

633
00:41:39,546 --> 00:41:41,988
we got one cook.

634
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:44,484
Does all our work,
exclusive-like.

635
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:47,462
He's real specific about that.

636
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:51,492
Now, what's this worth to you,
Crash, me selling Miles on this?

637
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:55,029
Well, I'd go you one
better, brother.

638
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,039
We don't take that shit
to Miles at all.

639
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:00,343
You and me work the supplier,

640
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:02,375
the cut's whatever the
fuck we want it to be.

641
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:04,377
Now, now, that's
tricky shit, bro,

642
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,386
and I don't know you
like I used to.

643
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:08,154
Yeah, I don't know you
like I used to, either.

644
00:42:08,187 --> 00:42:09,649
That's why the fuck I'm here.

645
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:11,657
Well, let me tell you
why I came, Crash.

646
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,825
I need something
from you, tonight.

647
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,363
I had a 4-man team
for a big grab,

648
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,331
lost one to smokies.

649
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:19,808
I came looking to replace him,

650
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:21,312
if you're still
a bad-ass.

651
00:42:21,345 --> 00:42:23,481
I don't do A&R, man,
no fuckin' bank jobs.

652
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:25,186
It ain't nothin' like that.

653
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:26,689
I need a good soldier.

654
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,153
Now, you do this with us,

655
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:31,160
we talk about
puttin' you with my man.

656
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:33,159
Look.

657
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:35,192
I don't ride cowboy
no more, Ginger.

658
00:42:35,225 --> 00:42:37,131
- Oh.
- I don't do this small-time shit

659
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:39,172
like this thing you're
talking about, all right?

660
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:43,171
What, you get neutered
down south, huh?

661
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:45,676
I embrace the outlaw life.

662
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:48,842
Now, you dress the part still.

663
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:52,209
That just an act?

664
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:54,682
When in Rome, brother,

665
00:42:54,715 --> 00:42:57,220
but I do clean up
real fuckin' pretty.

666
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:01,689
Motherfucker,
I need a gunslinger.

667
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:05,194
Now, you ain't too timid,
get on this shit with me.

668
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:08,360
Then we can talk
about doin' business.

669
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:13,860
Where?

670
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,364
My place.

671
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,263
Down the bayou.

672
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:24,270
All right.
I got my truck.

673
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:26,301
It'll be safe here.

674
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,506
Members only.

675
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:35,171
I'm just lookin' for a friend.

676
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:13,921
Hey. What the fuck?

677
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,888
Look, look, look,
my buddy's not here.

678
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,921
- You ain't listening!
- I'm his sponsor, and

679
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:20,192
I'm worried that he might
have started drinking again.

680
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,222
You better worry that we
don't pull your head off

681
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:23,726
and shit down your neck!

682
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:25,229
He's been 20 years sober.

683
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,861
Just give me one second.

684
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:34,570
What the hell!

685
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:36,602
- I'm leaving, sir.
- A guy can just come in here and say,

686
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:39,603
"Lookin' for a fuckin' friend"?!

687
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,613
Ought to worry more
about your balls, faggot!

688
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,646
Get the fuck outta here!

689
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,652
I'm leaving.

690
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:48,148
Jesus Christ.

691
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,918
Run, motherfucker!

692
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:54,924
That's good.

693
00:45:18,787 --> 00:45:21,225
Son of a bitch, man!

694
00:45:21,258 --> 00:45:22,992
- Fuck is that?
- That there?

695
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:26,458
- That's Tigger the nigger.
- Name's Tiger Thomas.

696
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:29,960
Dealer in them Hoston Projects.
You know them?

697
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,695
That's like them bungalowed,
flat-like joints, right?

698
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:34,170
Yeah.

699
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:36,140
They keep a stash house there.

700
00:45:36,172 --> 00:45:38,643
I'll get you, you fucking dicks!

701
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:41,209
Hey, why don't you shut
the fuck up, nigger?

702
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,673
Fuck you!

703
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,178
So you all gonna
take a stash house

704
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:47,946
in coon country, huh, 4 guys?

705
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:50,650
Well, how big's the projects,
man, like square block-wise?

706
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:56,292
Get the gear, mates.

707
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,037
Wait till you see this.
You're gonna love it.

708
00:46:14,048 --> 00:46:16,181
Oh, you're going in
as cops, huh?

709
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:18,717
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

710
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,022
You know where
the stash house is?

711
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:23,755
Tiger's gonna take us there.

712
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:26,293
Well, you got an exit plan?

713
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,790
Hmm?

714
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:30,262
Timetable?

715
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:33,231
The real cops come,
then what, huh?

716
00:46:33,264 --> 00:46:35,931
I mean, you say you're going
in the one fuckin' car?

717
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:37,098
Uh-huh.

718
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:39,234
Far as I remember, man,

719
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:41,403
the place is blocked in.

720
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:42,939
That is one way in,
one way out.

721
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:45,875
It could be fuckin'
Mogadishu, man.

722
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:47,875
We hit trouble,

723
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,412
you're just gonna
fuck it in the ass.

724
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:53,422
You scoop out the soft brains

725
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:55,422
inside the skull.

726
00:46:57,423 --> 00:47:00,924
Well, so you have
thought it out.

727
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:03,227
My bad.

728
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:22,579
I come through
for you on this tonight,

729
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:25,053
I got to know you're
gonna hook me up,

730
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:28,621
'cause I got a real job I
was supposed to be doing.

731
00:47:28,654 --> 00:47:30,189
Hmm?

732
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:34,399
You got my word. You back
me on this, I'll back you.

733
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,881
Fuck it. Let's go.

734
00:47:47,915 --> 00:47:49,778
Up and at 'em, eggplant.

735
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:54,348
Motherfuckers.

736
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,348
- Fuck you!
- Come on.

737
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:59,347
I'll kill you, motherfuckers!

738
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:02,522
Y'all are dead!
Y'all are dead!

739
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,960
406 reported on Fullington Street...

740
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,442
Air 3, Dispatch.

741
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:27,441
Go ahead, Air 3.

742
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:30,945
Over Zone 6, Hoston Projects.

743
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,988
Pretty quiet, possible 507s.

744
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:36,452
Everything's Code 4.

745
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:39,629
Copy that.
10-4, Air 3.

746
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:45,167
Man, you got two ways
of lookin' at it, Tiger.

747
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,700
You can die and lose your shit,

748
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:49,666
or you could live,

749
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:52,340
go make some more shit.

750
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:49,928
- What's up? - Y'all get back
in your house, now. Police.

751
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:52,463
Sheriff's Department! Get
back in your house. Do it.

752
00:49:52,496 --> 00:49:54,328
There's nothin' to see here.

753
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,766
Sorry son of a bitch.

754
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:59,797
- Fuck out of here and start going...
- Fucker, start moving.

755
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,299
Tiger, man, yo.
What's up, man? What's this?

756
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,097
- Yo! Fuck! Lamar!
- Sheriff's Department.

757
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,135
- Lamar!
- Freeze, motherfucker.

758
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,632
Come on...

759
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,104
Aah!

760
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:10,904
Get up there, big boy.
Get on the door.

761
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:12,241
- Tell them that it's safe.
- Lamar.

762
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:13,915
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come open the door, Lamar.

763
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:16,483
- Tell them who you are.
- Fuckin' door, man. It's Tiger.

764
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:18,945
Get up here. Get back!

765
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:21,482
Police!

766
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:23,451
Fuck!

767
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:25,459
Everybody down, now!

768
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,458
Sheriffs!
Hands behind your head!

769
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,458
Shut up!
Get the fuck down!

770
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,145
Don't move.

771
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:56,499
Get in the tub.
Listen, listen.

772
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:59,501
You lay down.
Don't you move.

773
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:03,041
Got no shit!
Let me outta here!

774
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:04,977
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

775
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,978
Look on the left.
It's right there.

776
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:09,021
No, no, no, no. Ginger, no.
Don't touch it.

777
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:10,916
- It's in there.
- You open it, motherfucker.

778
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:12,988
- Get that gun out of my face.
- I'll put something else

779
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:14,356
in your face,
you don't shut up.

780
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:16,893
Get your fuckin' ass
over there! Start movin'!

781
00:51:16,926 --> 00:51:18,397
Come on!

782
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,363
Ginger.

783
00:51:20,397 --> 00:51:22,826
You motherfucker!
Get that shit off of there!

784
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:25,400
- Come on! Hurry your ass up!
- Fuck.

785
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:26,863
- Fuck you!
- Watch your fucking mouth.

786
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:28,367
All right, 30 seconds,
in and out.

787
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,399
30 seconds, in and out, Ginger.

788
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:31,839
Get that safe open.

789
00:51:31,872 --> 00:51:33,938
Watch it, watch it. I'll
nuke you, motherfucker.

790
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,874
Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

791
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:37,873
I'm gonna fire on you,
motherfucker.

792
00:51:37,914 --> 00:51:39,377
Get the fuck off my dawg!

793
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,916
- Fuck!
- Easy, easy.

794
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:44,388
Just get in and get
the fuck out, Ginger.

795
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:46,217
It's Christmastime, Crash!

796
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,720
- We got this shit!
- Easy.

797
00:51:47,753 --> 00:51:50,194
Fuck that fake-ass po-po!

798
00:51:50,227 --> 00:51:52,891
Stay calm. Get it, Ginger.
Get the fuck out of here.

799
00:51:52,932 --> 00:51:54,930
Ginger, man, they're
gathering out there--

800
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:57,512
Aah!

801
00:51:57,545 --> 00:51:58,648
Come on, Ginger!

802
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:00,986
- They're animals out there, man.
- Easy, easy.

803
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,987
Easy, motherfucker.

804
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,953
Easy. Easy.

805
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:07,426
Ginger, let's fuckin' go!

806
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:08,962
- You sorry-ass motherfucker!
- Easy.

807
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:11,465
I told your cracker ass!
You're dead!

808
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:13,799
Don't fucking
fire! Do not--

809
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:15,296
Goddamn it.

810
00:52:15,329 --> 00:52:16,768
Lamar!

811
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,934
Ginger! Ginger!
Stop fuckin' around!

812
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:23,803
Fuck!

813
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,305
Fuck!

814
00:52:31,307 --> 00:52:33,313
- What the fuck!
- Ginger!

815
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:35,439
I fuckin' knew it!

816
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:39,247
Aah!

817
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,316
Wish I could have done this from
the start, you fucking moron!

818
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:46,553
Oh, fuck! What the fuck
are you doin', man?

819
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:48,489
Shut the fuck up.

820
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:50,498
Motherfucker!

821
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:57,468
Hey!

822
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,142
Freeze. Who else
is in the house?

823
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:05,149
- Nobody.
- Okay. Get in the bathroom.

824
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,016
In the bathroom.
Lay down.

825
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,335
Marty, okay.

826
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:25,336
I need you to meet me

827
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,371
between 18th and 19th
in 90 seconds.

828
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:29,841
You got it?
You got it?

829
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,377

Get your ass up!
Come on!

Aah!

837

Ginger.

838
00:53:59,943 --> 00:54:01,447
You stupid mother--

839
00:54:01,481 --> 00:54:02,744
The neighborhood--

840
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:09,552
Come on, man!
Police behind us, man!

841
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:12,086
Come on.

842
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:20,602
Keep going, man!
Come on! Hurry up, man!

843
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:30,883
Put the weapon down!

844
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:32,914
You motherfucker!

845
00:54:32,947 --> 00:54:34,345
I'll get you!

846
00:54:34,378 --> 00:54:37,920
You'll get yours, fuckin'
Crash, you motherfucker.

847
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:39,892
You'll get-- aah!

848
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:42,427
Come out
with your hands raised!

849
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,423
Get down on your knees!

850
00:55:04,903 --> 00:55:06,872
Quick, hide. Here.

851
00:55:06,905 --> 00:55:08,503
Oh!

852
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,513
Oh, shit!

853
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,017
Hey!

854
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:27,903
Go!

855
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,919
Go, go, go!

856
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:06,198
What the fuck happened?

857
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:08,695
Remember that meth contact now?

858
00:56:08,736 --> 00:56:10,705
You rat motherfucker!

859
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:13,208
You're gonna give me
the location for Ledoux,

860
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:15,575
I'm gonna let you
slide, Ginger.

861
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:17,545
Bullshit.

862
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:19,916
What the fuck you think
I want with you, huh?

863
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,388
Oh, goddamn.

864
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,588
I am so done talking
to you like a man.

865
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,362
Go, go, go.

866
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,426
We have multiple gunshots.

867
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:35,900
217, multiple suspects...
