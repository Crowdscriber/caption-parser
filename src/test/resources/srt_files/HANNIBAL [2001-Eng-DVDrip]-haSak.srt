1
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:39,548
<i>Sometimes, Dr Lecter and I</i>
<i>would talk...</i>

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,633
<i>when things got quiet enough...</i>

3
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,802
<i>about the science courses</i>
<i>I was takin'.</i>

4
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,762
<i>Some kind of mail-order courses</i>
<i>in psychology, Nurse Barney?</i>

5
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,267
<i>No, sir.</i>

6
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:52,229
<i>I don't consider psychology</i>
<i>a science...</i>

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,893
<i>and neither did Dr Lecter.</i>

8
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,158
<i>Now, Barney...</i>

9
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,780
<i>while you were working</i>
<i>at the asylum...</i>

10
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,908
<i>you observed Clarice Starling</i>
<i>and Hannibal Lecter interacting.</i>

11
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,709
Interacting?

12
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:12,546
Talking to one another.

13
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:15,418
Yes.
Yes, it seemed to me that they...

14
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,044
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee...

15
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:22,304
but why don't we start
with what you saw...

16
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,430
not what you thought about
what you saw?

17
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:28,979
Cordell, don't be like that.
Barney can give us his opinion.

18
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:33,275
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

19
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,767
What was it between them?

20
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:41,277
Most of the time, Dr Lecter
didn't respond at all to visitors.

21
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,203
He'd just, for instance,
open his eyes long enough...

22
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:47,454
to insult some academic
who was there to look over him.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,621
With Starling,
he answered her questions.

24
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,495
She interested him.
She intrigued him.

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,089
He thought she was charming
and amusing.

26
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:02,965
So Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter...

27
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,974
became friendly.

28
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,973
Inside a kind of formal structure,
yes.

29
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,312
And he was fond of her.

30
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:17,858
Yes.

31
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:19,226
Thank you, Barney.

32
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,314
Thank you very much
for your candour.

33
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,693
And keep all those wonderful items...

34
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,490
from your personal Lecter
treasure trove coming.

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,371
I've enjoyed them immensely.

36
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,165
Mr Verger.

37
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,788
Oh, I almost forgot.

38
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,547
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you say, Cordell?

39
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,086
I think it would kill you.

40
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,642
- How much?
- Two hundred and fifty.

41
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,519
Thousand.

42
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:58,484
Cut a cheque for $250,000.

43
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,964
How can she sleep
at a time like this?

44
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:59,306
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.

45
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:32,627
We got some guy named Bolton
from the DC Police.

46
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:36,926
All right, everyone.
Pay attention. Here's the layout.

47
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,591
Excuse me.
I'm Officer Bolton, DC Police.

48
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:42,142
I can see that from your badge.
How do you do?

49
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:43,725
I'm in charge here.

50
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:46,022
Officer Bolton,
I'm Special Agent Starling.

51
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,268
Just so we don't get off
on the wrong foot...

52
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,520
let me explain
why we're all here.

53
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:54,742
I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.
I arrested her twice on RICO warrants.

54
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,448
DEA and ATF, in addition
to backing me up...

55
00:05:57,538 --> 00:05:59,530
are here for the drugs
and the weapons.

56
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:02,540
You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs...

57
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,867
especially after his own
cocaine conviction...

58
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,713
and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us here today.

59
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:10,838
You got a smart mouth, lady.

60
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:14,377
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me continue.

61
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,715
All right, take a look.

62
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:20,762
Fish market.
Back's on the water.

63
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:23,141
Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.

64
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,637
Evelda Drumgo's HIV positive.

65
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:29,101
She will spit and bite if cornered,
so you should watch it.

66
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:32,029
If you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car...

67
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:35,068
in front of the news cameras, Bolton,
you don't wanna push her head down.

68
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,483
She'll likely have a needle
in her hair.

69
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:40,364
<i>We want to take her inside the building,</i>
<i>not out in the street.</i>

70
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,447
<i>We can get closest with the van.</i>

71
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,624
<i>If it looks good, on my signal</i>
<i>we hit the front, DEA hits the back...</i>

72
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,703
<i>DCPD backin'them up.</i>

73
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:50,002
<i>She'll have her watchers out</i>
<i>at least three blocks around.</i>

74
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:54,417
<i>They've tipped her before in time, so</i>
<i>let's not make spectacles of ourselves.</i>

75
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:09,019
- Pretty busy today.
- I agree.

76
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,613
Can I please get
a cup of coffee?

77
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:36,672
- Did you see that?
- That's a roger.

78
00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:46,812
What's up, man?

79
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:58,197
Goddam it. It's her.

80
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:00,523
With three guys.
They're all packin'.

81
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:03,535
She's carryin' something.
She's got a baby.

82
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,036
<i>Hey, Brigham, it's too crowded.</i>

83
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,282
<i>There are too many people.</i>
<i>I say we call it off.</i>

84
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:10,574
What do you say?

85
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,709
<i>I agree.</i>

86
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,122
All units, stand down.

87
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,422
- Whisky team copies.
- Burke copy.

88
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,383
This is Bolton.
Stay on target.

89
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,175
I said all units stand down, Bolton,
right now.

90
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,387
<i>- It's too late. We're movin'in.</i>
- Bolton, he said it's off.

91
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:26,218
Stand down now.

92
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,303
She's carrying a baby.
I repeat, she's carrying a baby.

93
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,850
All units stand down.

94
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:32,978
<i>- Keep that gun down, Bolton.</i>
- Damn, dude got a piece.

95
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,809
- Light his ass up.
- It's a go!

96
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:36,395
FBI! Down on the ground!

97
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,403
Hold it!

98
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:22,481
Hold your fire!

99
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:25,821
Don't!

100
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,321
Evelda, get out of the car!

101
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,834
Starling, is that you?

102
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:39,086
Step away from the car!

103
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:42,798
Show me your hands, Evelda.

104
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,596
Please.
Show me your hands.

105
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,259
How've you been?

106
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,058
Don't do this.

107
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:52,222
Do what?

108
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:26,751
It's all right. It's okay.

109
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:29,799
I know, I know. Baby, I know.

110
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,345
It's okay.

111
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,676
It's okay.

112
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,805
It's all right.

113
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:58,909
<i>Friends, family and coworkers</i>
<i>gathered here this morning...</i>

114
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:03,130
<i>at Arlington National Cemetery</i>
<i>to bury BA TF Agent John Brigham...</i>

115
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:06,548
<i>shot and killed in the line of duty</i>
<i>Friday. He was 40 years old.</i>

116
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:09,920
<i>This ill-fated drug raid that claimed</i>
<i>his life and five others...</i>

117
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:12,586
<i>is the latest in a seemingly</i>
<i>endless series of incidents...</i>

118
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,474
<i>beginning with Waco, Texas...</i>

119
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,893
<i>in which theJustice Department</i>
<i>and the FBI have been questioned...</i>

120
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:20,850
<i>about their use of firepower</i>
<i>rather than judgment.</i>

121
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,610
<i>This time it was FBI</i>
<i>Special Agent Clarice Starling...</i>

122
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,437
<i>heading up</i>
<i>the calamitous strike force.</i>

123
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,111
<i>Agent Starling attained some measure</i>
<i>of celebrity ten years ago...</i>

124
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,533
<i>when she was given information</i>
<i>by Dr Hannibal "The Cannibal"Lecter...</i>

125
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,778
<i>which led to the rescue</i>
<i>of Catherine Martin...</i>

126
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,244
<i>daughter of the former US senator</i>
<i>from Tennessee.</i>

127
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:41,115
<i>When she returns to work this week,</i>
<i>she won't be so celebrated.</i>

128
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,164
<i>Attorney Telford Higgins, representing</i>

<i>a wrongful-death suit.</i>

130
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,217
Cordell!

131
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,935
- Yes, sir.
- Get me the justice Department.

132
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:14,534
<i>Agent Starling?</i>

133
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:18,367
<i>This is John Eldridge from DEA.</i>
<i>Assistant Director Noonan, you know.</i>

134
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:21,575
Larkin Wayne from our Office
of Professional Responsibility.

135
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,660
Bob Sneed, ATF.

136
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:26,919
Benny Holcombe, assistant to the mayor.
And Paul Krendler.

137
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,544
You know Paul.
Paul's come over from justice...

138
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:32,124
unofficially,
as a favour to us.

139
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,757
In other words, he's here,
and he's not here.

140
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:40,761
So I take it you've seen the coverage
in the papers and on television?

141
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,427
I have nothing to do with the news,
Mr Krendler.

142
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:46,310
The woman had a baby in her arms.

143
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,401
There are pictures. You could
see the problem, I would think.

144
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,772
Not in her arms.
In a carrier across her chest.

145
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,024
In her arms she had a MAC-10.

146
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:58,201
Look, we're here to help you,
Starling.

147
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:01,287
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to do with a combative attitude.

148
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,958
Can I speak freely, Mr Pearsall?

149
00:13:10,632 --> 00:13:13,717
Your agency called this office to get me
assigned to help you on this raid.

150
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:15,759
I tried to do that.

151
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:18,847
I clearly expressed my judgment
and was ignored.

152
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,017
And now a good agent and a friend
is dead.

153
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:27,720
You shot and killed five people
out there, Agent Starling.

154
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,023
Is that how you define
good judgment?

155
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:33,068
This raid was an ugly mess.

156
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:36,274
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying...

157
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,358
or shooting a woman
carrying a child.

158
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,693
I chose.

159
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,447
I shot her.

160
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,864
I killed a mother
holding her child.

161
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,452
And I regret it.
I resent myself for it.

162
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:53,038
Gentlemen, I'm going
to call a halt to this meeting...

163
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,540
and get back to you individually
by phone.

164
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,924
That was a waste of time.

165
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,010
You have a secret admirer, Starling.

166
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:09,687
He isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.

167
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:13,610
Remember Mason Verger?

168
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:16,268
Lecter's fourth victim.

169
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,858
The rich one.

170
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,356
The only one that survived.

171
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,157
He says he has some new information
on Lecter he'll only share with you.

172
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:27,865
What do you mean, only share it with me?
You want it, seize it.

173
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,126
- I'd rather not.
- I wasn't speaking to you.

174
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:33,703
When I speak to you, you'll know it
because I'll look at you.

175
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:36,961
Why would we rather not?

176
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:40,670
The last time he called was when we took
Lecter off the Ten Most Wanted List.

177
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:44,262
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

178
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,684
<i>He said, "This is a Senate</i>
<i>Oversight Committee...</i>

179
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,347
<i>to make your life miserable. "</i>

180
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:52,439
His family's political contributions
may not be enough...

181
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,232
to buy a senator...

182
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,311
but they are enough
to rent them from time to time.

183
00:14:57,154 --> 00:15:00,772
There's no reason to go through that
if he really does have something new.

184
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:06,824
<i>It's a good deal for you, Starling.</i>
<i>You can't pretend it isn't.</i>

185
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,200
<i>Get to go back</i>
<i>on a celebrated case.</i>

186
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,661
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

187
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,130
Everyone's gonna be happy.

188
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,298
I'm not happy.

189
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,171
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

190
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,344
Mr. Krendler...

191
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,931
out on the street, you know you might
take a bullet in the line of duty.

192
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,425
You accept it, or you get out.

193
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,347
You live with it.

194
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,144
What you don't expect or accept...

195
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,903
is taking one in the back
in your boss's office...

196
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,145
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

197
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,899
That makes you unhappy.

198
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,359
Of course you're right, Starling...

199
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,445
but it doesn't change anything.

200
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:50,741
It changes everything.
It changes me.

201
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:44,590
Hi, I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr Verger's private physician.

202
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:46,255
How do you do?

203
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:49,845
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

204
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,939
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

205
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:16,623
Mr Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

206
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,497
Good morning, Mr Verger.

207
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,912
Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

208
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes, it was.

209
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,042
Five-litre?

210
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:26,794
Yes.

211
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:29,293
Fast.

212
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,926
Cordell, I think
you can leave us now.

213
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:36,393
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

214
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:40,690
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

215
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:48,778
I'll attach this microphone to your
clothing or pillow, if that's okay.

216
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,989
By all means.

217
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:58,116
Here, this should make it easier.

218
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,373
You know, I thank God...

219
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:10,295
for what happened.

220
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,545
It was my salvation.

221
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,176
Have you accepted jesus,
Agent Starling?

222
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,807
- Do you have faith?
- I was raised Lutheran.

223
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,470
That's not what I asked.

224
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,935
This is Special Agent
Clarice Starling, 51 <i>4369</i>0...

225
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,863
deposing Mason R. Verger on March 20,
sworn and attested.

226
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:31,901
I want to tell you about summer camp.
It was a wonderful childhood experience.

227
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:34,993
- We can get to that later.
- We can get to it now.

228
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,946
You see, it all comes to bear.

229
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,582
It was a Christian camp
my father founded...

230
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:47,165
for poor, unfortunate, cast-off
little boys and girls...

231
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,008
who would do anything
for a candy bar.

232
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,631
Mr Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offences.

233
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:56,172
It's all right.
I have immunity from the US Attorney.

234
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,424
And I have immunity...

235
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:01,472
from the risen jesus.

236
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:04,101
And nobody beats the Riz.

237
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:08,066
Had you ever seen Dr Lecter before the
court assigned you to him for therapy?

238
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,528
What do you mean?

239
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,404
Socially?

240
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:16,199
It is what I mean, yes,
if you don't mind talking about it.

241
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,278
No, not at all.
I'm not ashamed.

242
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:21,621
- I didn't say you should be.
- No, we met conventionally...

243
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,747
as doctor and patient.

244
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,626
How did he end up at your house?

245
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:28,629
I invited him, of course...

246
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:32,462
<i>to my pied-�-terre.</i>

247
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:36,715
<i>I came to the door</i>
<i>in my nicest come-hither outfit.</i>

248
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,799
<i>I was concerned...</i>

249
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:42,177
<i>that he'd be afraid of me.</i>

250
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,686
<i>But he didn't seem to be</i>
<i>afraid of me.</i>

251
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:48,939
That's almost funny now.

252
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,353
<i>I showed him my toys...</i>

253
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:55,363
<i>my noose set-up,</i>
<i>among other things.</i>

254
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:59,696
It's where you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

255
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:01,910
<i>It feels good while you...</i>

256
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,829
well, you know.

257
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,197
Anyway...

258
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:10,836
<i>- he said, "Mason..."</i>
- Mason, would you like a popper?

259
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,298
And I said, "Would I? Oh, wow!"

260
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,091
<i>Once that kicked in,</i>
<i>I was flying.</i>

261
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,048
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"Mason, show me how you smile...</i>

262
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,725
<i>to gain the confidence</i>
<i>of a child. "</i>

263
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,767
When I smiled...

264
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:31,774
<i>he said,</i>
<i>"Oh, I see how you do it."</i>

265
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,569
<i>The good doctor approached me</i>
<i>with a piece of broken mirror.</i>

266
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:37,736
<i>"Try this."</i>

267
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,742
Try peeling off your face...

268
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:44,283
And feeding it to the dogs.

269
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,342
No, I can still see it.

270
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,589
Try again.

271
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,300
No, I'm afraid not.

272
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,095
<i>That's entertainment</i>

273
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,768
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

274
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:14,939
You indicated to me that you'd received
some kind of new information.

275
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:35,621
Where did this come from?

276
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:38,835
Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.

277
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,252
Where's the package it came in?

278
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:46,846
Good question. There was nothing
written on it of interest.

279
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,808
Did we throw it out?

280
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:51,930
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

281
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,774
Oh, dear.
You think it'll help?

282
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:56,851
I hope so.

283
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:58,937
I hope it'll help you catch him...

284
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,857
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonour.

285
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,611
Thank you. That's all I need.

286
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:08,657
Did you find some rapport
with Dr Lecter...

287
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:11,286
in your talks at the asylum?

288
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:15,462
I know I did
while I was peeling.

289
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:18,464
We exchanged information
in a civil way.

290
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:21,041
But always through the glass.

291
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:22,713
Yes.

292
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:36,307
- Isn't it funny?
- What's that?

293
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:39,018
You can look at my face...

294
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:43,696
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

295
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:13,302
- Finding what you want?
- Are you sure this is all of it?

296
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:15,387
That's all there is now.

297
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,932
There was more, but it's been picked
over little by little over the years.

298
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:24,026
You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

299
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,988
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here...

300
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,452
little by little.

301
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:55,827
Hey, Barney.

302
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,285
Remember me?

303
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,662
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling...

304
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,578
that I've not been read my rights?

305
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,591
I have not Mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

306
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,677
So when you turned Dr Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

307
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:19,846
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

308
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:22,262
They only survived his company
three days.

309
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,191
You survived him
six years at the asylum.

310
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:28,442
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

311
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,281
Yes, it was.

312
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,614
Did you ever think, after he escaped,
he might come after you?

313
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,732
No.

314
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,116
He once told me that,
whenever feasible...

315
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,281
he preferred to eat the rude.

316
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:44,502
"Free-range rude," he called 'em.
What about you?

317
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,920
You ever think he might come after you?
You ever think about him at all?

318
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,375
At least <i>3</i>0 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.

319
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,339
He's always with me,
like a bad habit.

320
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:59,595
Do you know what happened to his stuff...
his books, papers, drawings?

321
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,389
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed.

322
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,686
Cutbacks.

323
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,976
I just found out that Dr Lecter's
signed copy of <i>TheJoy of Cooking...</i>

324
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,602
sold to a private collector
for $ 1 <i>6</i>,000.

325
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,897
It was probably a fake.

326
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,989
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed "Karen Phlox."

327
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,328
Do you know Karen Phlox?
You should.

328
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:26,329
She filled out your employment
application, but signed it "Barney."

329
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,537
Same thing on your tax returns.

330
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:36,381
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

331
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:40,884
I want the X ray of Lecter's arm
you broke in the attack on that nurse...

332
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,099
and everything else you've got.

333
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,765
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night...

334
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,730
after the screamin'
finally died down.

335
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,869
We talked about you sometimes.
You wanna know what he said?

336
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,196
Go get the X ray.

337
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,289
I'm not a bad guy.

338
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,959
I didn't say you were.

339
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,541
Dr Chilton was a bad guy.

340
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,847
After your first visit, he started
taping your conversations with Lecter.

341
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,841
These are valuable.

342
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,314
Go on now.

343
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,809
You've grieved long enough.

344
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,156
And what'd he say?

345
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,237
What'd he say about me
late at night?

346
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,451
He was talking about
inherited, hardwired behaviour.

347
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,496
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

348
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:56,296
They fly up in the air, roll backwards
in a display, fallin' to the ground.

349
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,799
<i>There are shallow rollers,</i>
<i>and there are deep rollers.</i>

350
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,880
<i>You can't breed two deep rollers...</i>

351
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,175
<i>or their young, their offspring,</i>
<i>will roll all the way down...</i>

352
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,555
<i>hit and die.</i>

353
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,680
<i>Agent Starling is a deep roller,</i>
<i>Barney.</i>

354
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,355
<i>Let us hope one of her parents</i>
<i>was not.</i>

355
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:18,143
<i>Surely the odd confluence of events</i>
<i>hasn't escaped you, Clarice.</i>

356
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,360
<i>Jack Crawford dangles you</i>
<i>in front of me...</i>

357
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,155
<i>then I give you a bit of help.</i>

358
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,534
<i>Do you think it's because</i>
<i>I like to look at you...</i>

359
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,537
<i>and imagine how good</i>
<i>you would taste...</i>

360
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,952
<i>Clarice?</i>

361
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,619
<i>I don't know. Is it?</i>

362
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,338
<i>I've been in this room</i>
<i>for eight years now, Clarice.</i>

363
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,173
<i>I know they will never, ever</i>
<i>let me out while I'm alive.</i>

364
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,639
<i>What I want is a view.</i>

365
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:52,594
<i>I want a window where I</i>
<i>can see a tree or even water.</i>

366
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,262
<i>I want to be in a federal institution</i>
<i>far away from Dr Chilton.</i>

367
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,615
<i>The Capponi correspondence</i>
<i>goes back to the 13th century.</i>

368
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,496
Dr Fell might hold in his hand...

369
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,626
his non-Italian hand...

370
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,122
a note from Dante Alighieri himself.

371
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,086
But would he recognize it?
I think not.

372
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,630
Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian...

373
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:30,345
<i>and I will not deny</i>
<i>that his language is admirable...</i>

374
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:32,641
<i>for a</i> straniero.

375
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:35,978
<i>But is he acquainted</i>
<i>with the personalities...</i>

376
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,808
<i>of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?</i>

377
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,727
I think not.

378
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,489
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi library...

379
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,146
say from Guido di Cavalcanti?

380
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:50,026
Would he recognize that?
I think not.

381
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,529
They're still arguing?

382
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,046
Sogliato wants the job
for his nephew.

383
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,671
But the scholars seem satisfied
with the temporary guy they appointed.

384
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,331
If he's such an expert on Dante...

385
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:08,214
let him lecture on Dante
to the <i>Studiolo.</i>

386
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:11,176
- Let him face them if he can.
- I look fo<i>rw</i>ard to it.

387
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,884
Very well. On the 1 <i>4</i>th.

388
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:35,624
Dr Fell?

389
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,459
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the <i>questura.</i>

390
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:42,078
<i>Commendatore,</i>
how can I be of service?

391
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:45,007
Sorry. I'm investigating
the disappearance...

392
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:49,338
of your predecessor,
Signor di Bonaventura.

393
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,264
- I was wondering if...
- "Predecessor" implies I have the job.

394
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:56,049
Unfortunately, I don't.
Not yet, though I am hopeful.

395
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:59,928
They are letting me look after
the library for a stipend.

396
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:03,856
The officers who first checked...

397
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:08,024
didn't find any sort of farewell
or suicide note.

398
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,657
I was wondering if you...

399
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:13,360
If I come across anything in the Capponi
library stuffed in a drawer or book...

400
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:15,410
I'll call you at once.

401
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:19,372
Thank you.

402
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:22,250
You've been reassigned.

403
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,502
Pardon?

404
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:30,007
You were on the <i>II Mostro</i> case,
I'm sure I read.

405
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:32,420
- Yes, that's right.
- Now you're on this.

406
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:35,468
This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

407
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:39,223
Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms...

408
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:40,937
yes, I guess I'd agree.

409
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:44,097
- A missing person.
- Sorry?

410
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:48,142
Were you unfairly dismissed from
the grander case, or did you deserve it?

411
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:56,948
Regarding this one, Dr Fell...

412
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:59,991
are the signore's personal effects
still at the Palazzo?

413
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:05,160
Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.

414
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,875
Alas, no note.

415
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:14,880
I'll send someone over to pick them up.
Thank you for your help.

416
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,483
Hey, thanks.

417
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,145
How's it going? Any leads?

418
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:34,358
Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.

419
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,072
I don't know how you live
with this stuff.

420
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,620
Oh, God.

421
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:46,330
This is from the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records</i> congratulating me...

422
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,038
on being the female FBI agent
who has shot and killed the most people.

423
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,606
Would you excuse me, please?

424
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,859
Sure.

425
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:46,686
<i>Dear Clarice...</i>

426
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:52,234
<i>I've followed with enthusiasm the course</i>

427
00:33:52,318 --> 00:33:55,604
<i>My own never bothered me</i>
<i>except for the inconvenience...</i>

<i>of being incarcerated.</i>

429
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,940
<i>But you may lack perspective.</i>

430
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:03,408
<i>In our discussions</i>
<i>down in the dungeon...</i>

431
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:07,328

<i>the dead night watchman...</i>

432

<i>figures largely</i>
<i>in your value system.</i>

433
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:15,798
<i>I think your success in putting an end</i>
<i>to Jame Gumb's career as a couturier...</i>

434
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:20,510
<i>pleased you most because you could</i>
<i>imagine your father being pleased.</i>

435
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:24,380
<i>But now, alas,</i>

436
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:27,180
<i>Do you imagine your daddy</i>

437
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:30,223
<i>Do you see him</i>
<i>in his plain pine box...</i>

438
00:34:30,314 --> 00:34:32,307
<i>crushed by your failure...</i>

439
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,733
<i>the sorry, petty end</i>

440
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,354
<i>What is worst</i>

441
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:43,197
<i>Is it how your failure will reflect</i>

442
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:47,414
<i>Is your worst fear that people</i>

443
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:50,534
<i>they were indeed just good old</i>

<i>tornado-bait white trash...</i>

445
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,245
<i>and that perhaps you are too?</i>

446
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:01,546
<i>By the way, I couldn't help noticing</i>
<i>on the FBI's rather dull web site...</i>

447
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:06,512
<i>that I've been hoisted from the Bureau's</i>
<i>archives of the common criminal...</i>

448
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,720
<i>and elevated to the more prestigious</i>
<i>Ten Most Wanted List.</i>

449
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:15,399
<i>Is this coincidence,</i>
<i>or are you back on the case?</i>

450
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:18,935
<i>If so, goody goody, because</i>
<i>I need to come out of retirement...</i>

451
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:21,437
<i>and return to public life.</i>

452
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:27,317
<i>I imagine you sitting</i>
<i>in a dark basement room...</i>

00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:30,449
<i>bent over papers</i>

454
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,580
<i>Is that accurate?</i>

00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:36,962
<i>Please tell me truly,</i>

<i>is not your choice.</i>

458
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:49,925
<i>Rather, I suppose,</i>
<i>it is part of the bargain.</i>

459
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:52,805
<i>But you accepted it, Clarice.</i>

460
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:55,517
<i>Yourjob is to craft my doom...</i>

461
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:58,394
<i>so I'm not sure how well</i>
<i>I should wish you...</i>

462
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:00,940
<i>but I'm sure</i>
<i>we'll have a lot of fun.</i>

463
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:02,737
<i>Ta-ta.</i>

464
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:04,899
<i>"H."</i>

465
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,326
On the letter...

466
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,251
there's one partial fingerprint here.

467
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:18,419
- Not enough to hold up in court.
- I know it's him.

468
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:20,746
Where he was when he wrote it
is what I need.

469
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,165
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.

470
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:26,176
Yes, it's linen fibre,
yes, it's on the expensive side...

471
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:30,639
but it's not so rare that you won't find
it in a thousand stationery stores...

472
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:32,764
throughout the world.

473
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:36,553
It's the same with the ink,
and the same with the wax.

474
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:38,973
And your Las Vegas postmark?

475
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:42,851
You can check it out, but I'll bet you
it came from a remailing service.

476
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:45,271
Las Vegas would be
the last place he'd be.

477
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:48,401
It'd be an assault
on his sense of taste.

478
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:58,913
<i>Don't you feel eyes</i>
<i>moving over your body, Clarice?</i>

479
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,711
<i>I hardly see how you couldn't.</i>

480
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,880
<i>And don't your eyes move</i>
<i>over the things you want?</i>

481
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:08,175
<i>All right, then. Tell me how.</i>

482
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:09,542
<i>No.</i>

483
00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,797
<i>It's your turn to tell me, Clarice.</i>

484
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:16,220
<i>You don't have any more vacations</i>
<i>to sell on Anthrax Island.</i>

485
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:18,435
<i>Quid pro quo, Clarice.</i>

486
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:21,358
<i>I tell you things,</i>
<i>you tell me things.</i>

487
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:24,811
<i>Not about this case.</i>
<i>About yourself.</i>

488
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,528
<i>Quid pro quo.</i>

489
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:29,485
<i>Yes or no, Clarice?</i>

490
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:42,787
Hand cream.

491
00:37:44,673 --> 00:37:47,081
Raw ambergris base.

492
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,835
Tennessee lavender.

493
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:54,296
Trace of something else.

494
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,132
Fleece.

495
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,019
Lovely.

496
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:03,973
- What's ambergris?
- Ambergris is a whale product.

497
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:06,903
Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.

498
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:09,774
Endangered Species Act.

499
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:12,189
- Where isn't it illegal?
- Japan, of course.

500
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:14,406
Couple of places in Europe.

501
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:17,530
You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris...

502
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:20,030
Rome, Amsterdam.

503
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,370
Maybe London.

504
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:25,872
This bouquet was hand-engineered
to someone's specifications.

505
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:29,712
- Is there a way of knowing which shops?
- Of course. We'll give you a list.

506
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:32,755
It'll be short.

507
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:46,349
I need opera tickets.

508
00:38:46,443 --> 00:38:48,899
I don't think I got any on me.

509
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:51,524
It's sold out,
whatever it's called.

510
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:55,481
It's the pretty, young wife with the
ever-open beak who needs opera tickets.

511
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,538
- Benetti.
- What?

512
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:07,874
Rewind it.

513
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,918
I can't rewind it.
I'm making a copy. I'm recording.

514
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,849
What is this?

515
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:26,726
Security camera from a perfume shop
in Via Della Scala.

516
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:28,808
FBI, through Interpol,
requested a copy.

517
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:31,308
- Why?
- They didn't say.

518
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,400
- They didn't say?
- No. It was actually kind of weird.

519
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:39,362
They were making a point
not to say.

520
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:26,676
- Are we going to the opera?
- Yes.

521
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,389
Sorry. Yes, we are going.

522
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:31,388
You got tickets?

523
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,932
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.

524
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,399
Please, not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.

525
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,822
Nowhere near the back row...

526
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,282
no matter what the cost.

527
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:57,656
<i>Tell me, Clarice,</i>
<i>would you want to harm...</i>

528
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,873
<i>those who forced you</i>
<i>to consider it, though?</i>

529
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:02,083
<i>It's perfectly okay to admit it.</i>

530
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:05,089
<i>It's perfectly au naturel...</i>

531
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:06,966
<i>to want to taste the enemy.</i>

532
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:24,183
<i>It just feels so good.</i>
<i>Tell me, Clarice.</i>

533
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:26,649
<i>What is your worst memory</i>
<i>of childhood?</i>

534
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:29,311
- Jesus, Starling!
- Can I help you, Mr Krendler?

535
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:31,399
What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

536
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:33,199
Thinking about cannibalism.

537
00:44:33,285 --> 00:44:37,152
People in justice are thinking too.
You know that?

538
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,287
They're thinking, "What exactly
is she doing about Lecter?"

539
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,747
Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?

540
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:44,042
What's the point of that?

541
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:46,122
Are you writing a book
or are you catching a crook?

542
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:49,418
To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.

543
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:53,673
Or sometimes to perform
a public service.

544
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:56,338
In the case of the flautist,
Benjamin Raspail...

545
00:44:56,433 --> 00:45:00,681
he did it to improve the sound of
the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra...

546
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:03,808
serving the not-so-talented flute
player's sweetbreads to the board...

547
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:06,687
with a nice Montrachet
at $ 700 a bottle.

548
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,646
Wow.

549
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:12,608
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde...

550
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:15,985
followed by the sweetbreads,
a sorbet...

551
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:18,829
and then you can read here
in <i>Gourmet Cuisine:</i>

552
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:22,662
"A notable dark and glossy ragout,
the constituents never determined."

553
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,620
I always figured him
for a queer.

554
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:27,586
Why would you say that, Paul?

555
00:45:27,673 --> 00:45:30,543
All this artsy-fartsy stuff.

556
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:34,584
Chamber music, tea-party food.
Not that I mean anything personal...

557
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,930
if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.

558
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,562
What I came to impress
upon you, Starling...

559
00:45:42,646 --> 00:45:44,639
is I better see cooperation.

560
00:45:44,732 --> 00:45:47,138
There are no little fiefdoms here.

561
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,985
I want to be copied
on every <i>3</i>02, you understand?

562
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:53,194
If you work with me...

563
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:56,317
then your so-called career here
might improve.

564
00:45:57,827 --> 00:46:01,991
If you don't,
then all I have to do...

565
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:05,497
is draw a line through your name
rather than under it...

566
00:46:05,585 --> 00:46:06,960
and it's over.

567
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,452
Paul, what is it with you?

568
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,667
I told you to go home to your wife.
That was wrong?

569
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:15,926
What? Don't flatter yourself,
Starling.

570
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:18,682
That was a long time ago.

571
00:46:18,765 --> 00:46:21,434
Why would I hold that
against you?

572
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:25,261
And besides...

573
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:27,975
this town is full
of cornpone, country pussy.

574
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,442
That said...

575
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:34,647
I wouldn't mind having a go with you
right now, if you want to reconsider.

576
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,155
In the gym, anytime. No pads.

577
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:45,029
Is it possible it went out
with the regular mail?

578
00:46:45,124 --> 00:46:49,252
<i>No, I overnighted it to you.</i>
<i>I filled out the slip myself.</i>

579
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:51,495
<i>This was the day after your request.</i>

580
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:54,709
I did it right away.
I don't understand what happened.

581
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,509
You should have it by now.

582
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:58,883
I don't.
Can you send me another one?

583
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:01,545
<i>Sure, I'll make another copy</i>
<i>especially for you.</i>

584
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:05,389
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

585
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:06,853
<i>Agent Starling.</i>

586
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:09,689
I'd appreciate it.
What's your name?

587
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:11,565
My name is Franco Benetti.

588
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,643
<i>Agent Franco Benetti.</i>

589
00:47:13,736 --> 00:47:16,061
- Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.
<i>- Okay.</i>

590
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,693
- So I'll send you tomorrow?
<i>- All right.</i>

591
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:21,487
Bye-bye.

592
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:23,700
Nothin', huh?

593
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:26,243
Nothin' yet.
Still waitin' on Florence and London.

594
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:06,737
<i>The number you have dialled</i>
<i>is not in service at this time.</i>

595
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,238
<i>Please check the number...</i>

596
00:48:31,354 --> 00:48:33,145
<i>Yes?</i>

597
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:37,478
I have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

598
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:40,320
<i>Have you shared your information</i>
<i>with the police, sir?</i>

599
00:48:40,405 --> 00:48:43,026
<i>I'm required</i>
<i>to encourage you to do so.</i>

600
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:49,203
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

601
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:51,697
<i>May I suggest you contact</i>
<i>an attorney...</i>

602
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,413
<i>before taking any possibly</i>
<i>illegal action?</i>

603
00:48:54,502 --> 00:48:57,621
<i>There's one in Geneva</i>
<i>who's excellent in these matters.</i>

604
00:48:57,713 --> 00:48:59,706
<i>May I give you his toll-free number?</i>

605
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:05,884
<i>The number is 004123317.</i>

606
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:08,379
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>

607
00:49:26,993 --> 00:49:30,077
Yes. I was just speaking
with someone who suggested...

608
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:32,369
<i>There's a $ 100,000 advance.</i>

609
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:34,448
<i>To qualify for the advance...</i>

610
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:37,626
<i>a fingerprint must be provided,</i>
in situ, <i>on an object.</i>

611
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:41,127
<i>Once the print</i>
<i>has been positively identified...</i>

612
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:43,788
<i>the balance of the money</i>
<i>will be placed in escrow...</i>

613
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:45,711
<i>at Geneve Credit Suisse...</i>

614
00:49:45,803 --> 00:49:50,263
<i>and may be viewed at any time</i>
<i>subject to 24-hour prior notification.</i>

615
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:53,018
<i>To repeat the message in French,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

616
00:49:53,102 --> 00:49:55,937
<i>In Spanish, press three.</i>
<i>In German...</i>

617
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:25,502
Dr Fell, it's Inspector Pazzi.

618
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:28,083
<i>Yes, I can see you.</i>

619
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:29,886
Come on up.

620
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,692
Dr Fell?

621
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:24,939
Snap.

622
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:27,481
I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.

623
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,562
The cases are on the heavy side.

624
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:32,027
Maybe you could help me
with them.

625
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:35,941
Just down the stairs, I mean.

626
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:39,699
Yeah.

627
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,577
This way.

628
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:45,076
Here we are.

629
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:51,219
- Is that the inventory?
- Yes.

630
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:56,382
- May I see it?
- Of course.

631
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:11,267
You are a Pazzi
of the Pazzi family, I think.

632
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:16,908
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

633
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,654
Francesco de' Pazzi.

634
00:52:18,745 --> 00:52:22,115
Yes, thrown naked with a noose
around his neck from a window.

635
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:25,914
Writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop...

636
00:52:26,003 --> 00:52:29,004
against the cold stone wall.

637
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:32,209
In fact, I found
a very nice rendering of it...

638
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:35,053
here in the library the other day.

639
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:38,802
If you like, perhaps
I could sneak it out for you.

640
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,976
I would think that might
jeopardize your chances...

641
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:46,062
for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

642
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:48,187
Only if you told.

643
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:52,527
Remind me...
what was his crime?

644
00:52:52,612 --> 00:52:55,364
He was accused of killing
Giuliano de' Medici.

645
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:56,729
Unjustly?

646
00:52:56,825 --> 00:53:00,573
No, I don't think so.

647
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:03,616
Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it. He was guilty.

648
00:53:03,707 --> 00:53:08,001
I think that would make living
in Florence with the name Pazzi...

649
00:53:08,086 --> 00:53:11,289
uncomfortable,
even 500 years later.

650
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:14,547
Not really.

651
00:53:14,635 --> 00:53:18,086
In fact, I can't remember
the last time...

652
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,722
before today...

653
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:21,798
someone brought it up.

654
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:33,357
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

655
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,686
They just see to it you don't...

656
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,864
advance in life.

657
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,290
I'm sorry, <i>Commendatore.</i>

658
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:47,947
I too often say what I'm thinking.

659
00:53:49,919 --> 00:53:51,829
I'll be right back to help you.

660
00:54:06,352 --> 00:54:11,227
You know, the room you're standing in
was built in the 15th century.

661
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,106
It's beautiful.

662
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:16,068
Yes, it is.

663
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,360
Unfortunately, I think...

664
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:22,445
the heating system was installed
about the same time.

665
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:26,828
- That's a pity.
- Yes.

666
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:31,994
Okey-dokey.
Let's drag these down.

667
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:35,583
Must be as heavy as bodies.

668
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:07,698
- And the set?
- Eight thousand.

669
00:55:07,788 --> 00:55:09,163
Okay.

670
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,994
Hey, how much is this?

671
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:15,373
- Fifty thousand.
- I'll take it.

672
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:40,730
Well done.

673
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:53,244
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

674
00:55:53,332 --> 00:55:55,408
I have done this
a few times, Inspector.

675
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:57,494
Not like this.

676
00:55:58,337 --> 00:56:01,920
If there isn't a clean print
on the bracelet...

677
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:05,293
you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Sollicciano.

678
00:56:07,555 --> 00:56:09,880
Give me the bracelet.

679
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:12,551
Wash your fucking hands.

680
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,605
He's coming.

681
00:58:14,014 --> 00:58:15,971
I got it.

682
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:24,097
He grabbed me just right.

683
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:29,725
Tried to hit me in the balls.

684
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:35,692
But he missed.

685
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,581
Let me help you.

686
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,576
No. Don't.

687
00:59:41,308 --> 00:59:43,384
Sixteen-point match, Mr Verger.

688
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:46,558
Bingo.

689
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:08,156
- <i>Carlo?</i>
- Mason?

690
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:13,162
Well, well, well.

691
01:00:13,257 --> 01:00:17,255
- Am I coming to see you?
- <i>Yes, soon, I hope.</i>

692
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:20,926
But first I need you
to pack off the boys.

693
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:23,090
- <i>Now?</i>
- Yes, I know.

694
01:00:23,183 --> 01:00:26,018
The day you never
thought would arrive has.

695
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:28,640
<i>Now, Cordell will fax</i>
<i>the veterinary forms...</i>

696
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,897
<i>directly to</i>
<i>Animal and Plant Health...</i>

697
01:00:31,983 --> 01:00:33,976
<i>but you need to get</i>
<i>the vet affidavits...</i>

698
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:35,693
from Sardinia.

699
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,158
How are they?

700
01:00:41,243 --> 01:00:43,781
<i>They are big, Mason,</i>
<i>very big.</i>

701
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:53,665
- Say again?
- <i>Yeah, they are big, Mason.</i>

702
01:00:53,755 --> 01:00:57,622
Really big.
Maybe 270 kilos.

703
01:00:57,717 --> 01:01:00,208
Oh, wow.

704
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:01,880
Can you hear?

705
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:16,392
They sound fantastic.

706
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:27,741
Super.

707
01:02:02,698 --> 01:02:07,859
The full balance of the money is payable
upon receipt of the doctor, alive.

708
01:02:07,954 --> 01:02:10,527
Of course, you won't have to
seize him yourself.

709
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:12,531
Rather, just point him out.

710
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:17,538
It's preferable to all concerned if
that's the extent of your involvement...

711
01:02:17,629 --> 01:02:19,289
from this point.

712
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:23,461
I prefer to stay involved,
make sure things go right.

713
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:25,461
Professionals will see to that.

714
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:29,222
I am a professional.

715
01:04:52,616 --> 01:04:55,107
Did you enjoy the performance,
<i>Commendatore?</i>

716
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:57,111
Very much.

717
01:04:57,204 --> 01:05:01,581
Allegra, this is Dr Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.

718
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:02,995
Signora Pazzi.

719
01:05:03,085 --> 01:05:04,994
I'm honoured.

720
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:06,996
Are you from America,
Doctor?

721
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:09,710
Not originally.
I've travelled there.

722
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,836
I've always wanted to visit.
New England, especially.

723
01:05:12,928 --> 01:05:15,715
I've enjoyed many
excellent meals there.

724
01:05:16,932 --> 01:05:20,467
I noticed you wrapped up
in the libretto.

725
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:22,469
Thought this might amuse you.

726
01:05:24,606 --> 01:05:27,523
Dante's first sonnet
from <i>La Vita Nuova.</i>

727
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:29,518
It's beautiful.

728
01:05:30,778 --> 01:05:33,696
- Rinaldo, look at this.
- I can see.

729
01:05:35,283 --> 01:05:37,525
"Joyous Love seemed to me...

730
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:40,703
the while he held
my heart in his hands...

731
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:42,532
and in his arms...

732
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:44,996
my lady lay asleep...

733
01:05:45,085 --> 01:05:46,994
wrapped in a veil."

734
01:05:48,004 --> 01:05:49,249
"He woke her then...

735
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:54,131
and trembling and obedient, she ate
that burning heart out of his hand.

736
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:56,377
Weeping, I saw him
then depart from me."

737
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:02,387
Dr Fell, do you believe a man could
become so obsessed with a woman...

738
01:06:02,476 --> 01:06:05,050
from a single encounter?

739
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:08,063
Could he daily feel
a stab of hunger for her...

740
01:06:08,149 --> 01:06:11,066
and find nourishment
in the very sight of her?

741
01:06:11,152 --> 01:06:13,358
I think so.

742
01:06:13,446 --> 01:06:17,859
But would she see through the bars
of his plight and ache for him?

743
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:20,239
- Please keep that.
- I couldn't.

744
01:06:20,328 --> 01:06:21,905
I insist.

745
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:33,586
Goodbye.

746
01:06:35,176 --> 01:06:38,093
- Let's get something to eat.
- Of course.

747
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:40,087
Why not?

748
01:07:12,588 --> 01:07:14,580
Is that you, Doctor?

749
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:08,349
<i>I'd like to speak with</i>
<i>Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, please.</i>

750
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:11,638
<i>This is Agent Clarice Starling</i>
<i>from the American FBI.</i>

751
01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:13,010
<i>One moment.</i>

752
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:18,526
- FBI.
- I'm not here.

753
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:24,529
<i>Inspector Pazzi.</i>

754
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:27,453
It's Agent Starling
from the FBI. How do you do?

755
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:31,154
Actually, I was just
leaving for the day.

756
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:33,371
- Can I call you back tomorrow?
- <i>This won't take long.</i>

757
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:38,536
First, thank you for sending us the
security tape from the perfume store.

758
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:42,249
<i>When I say 'you, "I mean</i>
<i>your department... Agent Benetti.</i>

759
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:45,546
<i>Is he there?</i>
<i>Can I speak with him?</i>

760
01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:48,555
- I'm sorry. He's gone home.
- <i>That's all right.</i>

761
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:50,883
I should tell you this
rather than him anyway.

762
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:53,265
I'm late for
an important appointment.

763
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:55,975
The person I'm looking for,
Inspector...

764
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:59,066
who is indeed shown on that tape,
is Hannibal Lecter.

765
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:00,729
Who?

766
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:03,738
Dr Hannibal Lecter.
You've never heard of him?

767
01:09:03,823 --> 01:09:07,572
- I'm not familiar.
- <i>And the tape confirms...</i>

768
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,233
that he is
or was recently in Florence.

769
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:14,956
- Really?
- <i>He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.</i>

770
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:18,411
He's killed 1 <i>4</i> people
that we know of.

771
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:20,829
- I really have to go, Miss...
- <i>Starling.</i>

772
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,583
<i>Just another minute.</i>

773
01:09:22,674 --> 01:09:25,592
<i>- You sure you've never heard of him?</i>
- No, I haven't.

774
01:09:25,678 --> 01:09:27,587
Because I'm confused.

775
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,092
Someone there has been accessing
our private VICAP files on Dr Lecter...

776
01:09:32,184 --> 01:09:35,185
with some regularity
on your computer.

777
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:39,185
Everybody uses
everybody's computer here.

778
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:42,192
Maybe one of the detectives
on <i>II Mostro...</i>

779
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,235
was looking at
profiles of killers...

780
01:09:44,321 --> 01:09:46,776
I'm speaking about the computer
at your home, sir.

781
01:09:48,366 --> 01:09:51,818
<i>You're trying to catch him yourself,</i>
<i>aren't you? For the reward.</i>

782
01:09:51,912 --> 01:09:54,485
I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.

783
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:57,451
He killed three policemen
down in Memphis while in custody...

784
01:09:57,542 --> 01:10:01,243
<i>tearing the face off one of them,</i>
<i>and he will kill you too.</i>

785
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:39,408
<i>- I want him out of Tuscany fast.</i>
- Believe me...

786
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,455
he'll be gone
from the face of the earth fast.

787
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:44,123
Feet-first.

788
01:11:03,941 --> 01:11:07,476
<i>Because of his avarice and his betrayal</i>
<i>of the emperor's trust...</i>

789
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:11,817
<i>Pier della Vigna was disgraced,</i>
<i>blinded and imprisoned.</i>

790
01:11:11,907 --> 01:11:17,494
<i>Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna</i>
<i>on the seventh level of the Inferno...</i>

791
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,031
<i>and, likeJudas Iscariot,</i>
<i>he died by hanging.</i>

792
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,960
So judas and Pier della Vigna
are linked in Dante...

793
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:26,370
by the avarice
he saw in them.

794
01:11:26,464 --> 01:11:30,793
In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.

795
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:34,254
This is the earliest known
depiction of the Crucifixion...

796
01:11:34,347 --> 01:11:38,641
carved on an ivory box in Gaul
about A.D. <i>4</i>00.

797
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:43,553
It includes the death
by hanging of judas...

798
01:11:43,647 --> 01:11:45,556
his face upturned
to the branch that suspends him.

799
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,603
Here he is again on the doors
of the Benevento Cathedral...

800
01:11:48,694 --> 01:11:52,561
this time
with his bowels falling out.

801
01:11:59,705 --> 01:12:03,038
<i>It wasn't easy, but I got this number</i>
<i>without tellin'them why...</i>

802
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:05,497
- Sorry.
- Not at all. Welcome.

803
01:12:05,586 --> 01:12:08,919
- Please join us.
- Thank you.

804
01:12:09,006 --> 01:12:11,924
On this plate from the
15th-century edition of the <i>Inferno...</i>

805
01:12:12,009 --> 01:12:15,508
Pier della Vigna's body
hangs from a bleeding tree.

806
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:18,513
I will not belabour the obvious
parallel with judas Iscariot...

807
01:12:18,598 --> 01:12:21,516
but Dante Alighieri
needed no drawn illustration.

808
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:26,180
It was his genius to make
Pier della Vigna, now in hell...

809
01:12:26,273 --> 01:12:29,190
speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants...

810
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:32,146
as though
he is hanging still.

811
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:59,169
Avarice, hanging...

812
01:12:59,263 --> 01:13:00,841
self-destruction.

813
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:07,434
"I make my own home...

814
01:13:08,523 --> 01:13:10,432
be my gallows."

815
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:15,068
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.

816
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:34,164
I'm not a scholar,
but I think you've got the job.

817
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:35,501
Thank you.

818
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:38,508
- May I buy you a drink?
- How kind of you. I'd like that.

819
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:41,511
I'll be a minute
gathering my things.

820
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:43,590
Take your time.

821
01:13:53,192 --> 01:13:57,356
Allegra, I'll be home
just a little later than I said.

822
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:59,439
I'm taking Dr Fell out
for a drink.

823
01:14:03,077 --> 01:14:05,200
I can see the people
coming out now.

824
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:10,126
Yes. Bye, honey. My wife.

825
01:14:10,209 --> 01:14:11,833
Of course.

826
01:14:14,254 --> 01:14:16,924
I should have shown them
this one.

827
01:14:17,007 --> 01:14:20,791
I can't imagine how I missed it.
Remember? I told you about it.

828
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:23,507
It's a rendering
I found in the Capponi Library.

829
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:26,349
Can you make it out?

830
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:29,185
There's a name there...

831
01:14:29,269 --> 01:14:31,345
the one I told you about.

832
01:14:44,368 --> 01:14:46,491
It's your ancestor,
<i>Commendatore...</i>

833
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:49,151
hanging beneath
these very windows.

834
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:51,121
Francesco de' Pazzi.

835
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:55,958
On a related subject,
I must confess to you...

836
01:14:56,046 --> 01:14:58,619
I'm giving very serious thought...

837
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:06,714
to eating your wife.

838
01:15:40,048 --> 01:15:43,049
If you tell me what I need to know,
<i>Commendatore...</i>

839
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,707
it might be convenient for me
to leave Florence without my meal.

840
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:49,386
So I'll ask you the questions,
and then we'll see. All right?

841
01:15:49,474 --> 01:15:50,802
Okay?

842
01:16:03,405 --> 01:16:04,650
So.

843
01:16:07,366 --> 01:16:09,774
Now, is it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

844
01:16:11,996 --> 01:16:13,538
No, no.

845
01:16:13,622 --> 01:16:15,829
Blink twice for yes,
once for no.

846
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:18,454
Was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

847
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:21,996
Yes, good. Thank you.

848
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:25,007
And are his men
waiting for me outside?

849
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:28,837
Was that a single blink?

850
01:16:28,929 --> 01:16:30,803
You're confused.

851
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:35,018
Please don't be confused, because I may
have to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.

852
01:16:38,189 --> 01:16:40,645
Have you told anyone
in the <i>questura</i> about me?

853
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:44,101
No, I thought not.

854
01:16:44,778 --> 01:16:47,814
Have you told Allegra?

855
01:16:50,325 --> 01:16:52,318
No? Are you sure?

856
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:56,031
I believe you.

857
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,998
Okey-dokey, here we go.

858
01:17:07,551 --> 01:17:08,796
Okay.

859
01:17:10,387 --> 01:17:11,965
Your heart is really palpitating.

860
01:17:12,056 --> 01:17:14,973
Oh, it's not your heart.

861
01:17:16,936 --> 01:17:19,059
Shall I answer it?

862
01:17:21,397 --> 01:17:24,067
<i>I've gone above you.</i>
<i>I've spoken to your section chief.</i>

863
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,902
Someday you'll thank me.
Or you won't. I don't care.

864
01:17:26,986 --> 01:17:29,312
You'll be alive.

865
01:17:29,406 --> 01:17:31,279
Inspector Pazzi?

866
01:17:32,242 --> 01:17:34,531
<i>Is this Clarice?</i>

867
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:37,075
Hello, Clarice.

868
01:17:38,206 --> 01:17:40,080
I'm afraid I have
bad news for you.

869
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:43,286
- Is he dead?
- <i>Did you get my note?</i>

870
01:17:43,378 --> 01:17:46,047
<i>I hope you like the skin cream.</i>
<i>I had it specially made for you.</i>

871
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:48,040
Is he dead, Dr Lecter?

872
01:17:48,133 --> 01:17:52,261
<i>I would love nothing more in this world</i>
<i>than to be able to chat with you.</i>

873
01:17:52,346 --> 01:17:55,512
Unfortunately, you've caught me
at an awkward moment.

874
01:17:55,599 --> 01:17:57,841
Please forgive me.

875
01:17:57,935 --> 01:17:59,677
See you around.

876
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:03,930
An old friend.

877
01:18:07,944 --> 01:18:09,521
Okay, hold on.

878
01:18:11,239 --> 01:18:12,697
Here we go.

879
01:18:45,022 --> 01:18:49,150
I'll go around back!
Kill him if you have to!

880
01:18:52,363 --> 01:18:54,320
What's it to be?

881
01:18:54,407 --> 01:18:56,565
Bowels in or bowels out...

882
01:18:56,659 --> 01:18:58,651
like judas?

883
01:18:58,744 --> 01:19:00,571
Are you confused?

884
01:19:00,663 --> 01:19:03,498
I'll decide for you,
if you'll permit me.

885
01:20:17,072 --> 01:20:18,352
Good evening.

886
01:21:25,723 --> 01:21:28,261
Cordell...

887
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,260
to you...

888
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:33,722
does that look
like a wave goodbye...

889
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:37,432
or hello?

890
01:22:22,613 --> 01:22:25,779
So, what do you think?

891
01:22:25,865 --> 01:22:30,942
Does Lecter want to fuck her
or kill her or eat her or what?

892
01:22:31,037 --> 01:22:33,611
Probably all three.

893
01:22:33,706 --> 01:22:36,328
Though I wouldn't want
to predict in what order.

894
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,492
Here's what I think.

895
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:44,669
No matter how Barney
might want to romanticize it...

896
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:48,627
and make it
<i>Beauty and the Beast...</i>

897
01:22:48,722 --> 01:22:51,888
Lecter's object, as I know
from personal experience...

898
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:54,181
has always been...

899
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,392
degradation...

900
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,721
and suffering.

901
01:22:58,815 --> 01:23:03,560
Get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.

902
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:09,322
He comes in the guise
of a mentor...

903
01:23:09,408 --> 01:23:12,777
as he did with me and her.

904
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:16,820
But it's distress that excites him.

905
01:23:16,916 --> 01:23:18,825
To draw him...

906
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:22,577
she needs to be distressed.

907
01:23:25,383 --> 01:23:29,760
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.

908
01:23:31,889 --> 01:23:34,463
Let the damage he sees...

909
01:23:34,559 --> 01:23:37,560
suggest the damage
he could do.

910
01:23:46,904 --> 01:23:50,652
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-runnin'.

911
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:54,444
But not to help.

912
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:56,446
I don't understand.

913
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:58,662
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to understand, Paul.</i>

914
01:23:58,749 --> 01:24:02,581
<i>All you have to understand</i>
<i>is what it's worth to you.</i>

915
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:05,587
No, no, I don't understand
why she didn't turn this over.

916
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,630
I mean, she's such
a straight arrow.

917
01:24:07,717 --> 01:24:11,086
She didn't turn it over
because she didn't receive it.

918
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,218
She didn't receive it
because it was never sent.

919
01:24:13,306 --> 01:24:15,713
It was never sent because
Lecter didn't write it.

920
01:24:15,808 --> 01:24:18,381
He didn't write it
because I did.

921
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,599
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

922
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:29,108
You'd have been better off if
you'd never got her out of trouble.

923
01:24:29,196 --> 01:24:33,193
<i>Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda. I meant,</i>
<i>what do you think about the money?</i>

924
01:24:33,283 --> 01:24:34,446
Five.

925
01:24:35,535 --> 01:24:39,948
Let's just toss it off, like "five."

926
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,994
Let's say it
with the respect it deserves.

927
01:24:43,085 --> 01:24:46,039
Five hundred thousand dollars.

928
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:48,003
<i>That's better, but not much.</i>

929
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:50,497
- Now, will it work?
- <i>It'll work.</i>

930
01:24:50,592 --> 01:24:52,715
It won't be pretty.

931
01:24:52,803 --> 01:24:54,796
<i>What ever is?</i>

932
01:24:58,266 --> 01:25:00,424
Cocksucker.

933
01:25:00,518 --> 01:25:03,472
Never seen this before
in my life.

934
01:25:03,563 --> 01:25:07,940
Then how do you account for its being
found in your office, your basement?

935
01:25:08,026 --> 01:25:10,943
How do you want me to answer that,
Mr Krendler?

936
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:13,946
What possible reason
might I have to withhold it?

937
01:25:14,032 --> 01:25:17,282
Perhaps because of the nature
of its content.

938
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:20,323
Reads to me like a love letter.

939
01:25:20,413 --> 01:25:23,498
- Has it been tested for prints?
- No prints on it. None on the last one.

940
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,457
Handwriting analysis?

941
01:25:25,544 --> 01:25:29,162
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why
the philistines don't understand you?

942
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:31,544
It's because you're the answer
to Samson's riddle.

943
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:33,708
You are the honey in the lion."

944
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,295
Sounds like him to me.

945
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:39,680
- Do you mean, like a homosexual?
- Like a nut with a crush.

946
01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:41,094
Director Noonan,
I need to say something...

947
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:43,674
Agent Starling, I am placing you
on administrative leave...

948
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:47,933
till document analysis tells me
unequivocally a mistake's been made.

949
01:25:48,024 --> 01:25:51,227
In the meantime, you remain eligible
for insurance and medical benefits.

950
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:54,403
Surrender your weapons and
your identification to Agent Pearsall.

951
01:26:07,335 --> 01:26:10,087
I want to say something.
I think I'm entitled.

952
01:26:10,171 --> 01:26:11,914
Go ahead.

953
01:26:12,005 --> 01:26:15,457
I think Mr Mason Verger is
trying to capture Dr Lecter...

954
01:26:15,551 --> 01:26:17,543
for the purposes
of personal revenge.

955
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:20,127
I think Mr Krendler
is in collusion with him...

956
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:23,140
and wants the FBI's efforts against
Dr Lecter to work for Mr Verger.

957
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:26,096
I think Mr Krendler
is being paid to do this.

958
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:29,887
- Lucky you're not sworn here today.
- Swear me! You swear too!

959
01:26:29,982 --> 01:26:32,734
Clarice,
if the evidence is lacking...

960
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:35,440
you'll be entitled to full reinstatement
without prejudice...

961
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:39,942
if you don't do or say
anything in the meantime...

962
01:26:40,034 --> 01:26:42,572
that would make that impossible.

963
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:46,073
<i>Relieved of field duty pending</i>
<i>an internal investigation...</i>

964
01:26:46,165 --> 01:26:49,119
<i>Special Agent Clarice Starling,</i>
<i>a ten-year veteran on the Bureau...</i>

965
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:51,248
<i>began her career</i>
<i>with an assignment...</i>

966
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,412
<i>to interview lethal madman</i>
<i>Hannibal Lecter.</i>

967
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:57,337
<i>Earlier, we heard comments from Justice</i>
<i>Department spokesman Paul Krendler.</i>

968
01:26:58,468 --> 01:27:01,718
<i>Can you comment on theJustice</i>
<i>Department's decision this morning?</i>

969
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:05,885
<i>The FBI and theJustice Department are</i>
<i>looking very carefully into the charges.</i>

970
01:27:05,976 --> 01:27:08,301
<i>And, yes, they are extremely serious.</i>

971
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:09,889
<i>I'd like to add</i>
<i>a personal note, though.</i>

972
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:14,606
<i>- Starling's one of our best agents.</i>
- No, no, no, stay.

973
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:18,691
<i>I would be very surprised if these</i>
<i>accusations turn out to be true.</i>

974
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,232
<i>Is theJustice Department and FBI</i>
<i>united in this decision?</i>

975
01:27:22,326 --> 01:27:25,031
<i>It's much too soon to condemn her...</i>

976
01:28:10,289 --> 01:28:11,997
Good boy.

977
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:56,574
<i>I think she's nice.</i>

978
01:30:56,662 --> 01:30:59,533
<i>She's always been nice to me.</i>
<i>Polite.</i>

979
01:30:59,624 --> 01:31:01,118
<i>Don't you think?</i>

980
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:04,126
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>a roller pigeon is, Barney?</i>

981
01:31:04,212 --> 01:31:06,537
<i>Roller pigeons</i>
<i>climb high and fast...</i>

982
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:09,715
<i>then roll over and fall</i>
<i>Just as fast towards the Earth.</i>

983
01:31:09,801 --> 01:31:13,134
<i>There are shallow rollers</i>
<i>and there are deep rollers...</i>

984
01:31:13,221 --> 01:31:16,636
<i>but you can't breed two deep rollers,</i>
<i>or their young, their offspring...</i>

985
01:31:16,723 --> 01:31:20,139
<i>will roll all the way down,</i>
<i>hit and die.</i>

986
01:31:20,227 --> 01:31:24,225
<i>Agent Starling is a deep roller.</i>

987
01:31:24,314 --> 01:31:27,232
<i>Let's hope</i>
<i>one of her parents was not.</i>

988
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:59,898
<i>The power in that battery</i>
<i>is low, Clarice.</i>

989
01:32:59,993 --> 01:33:02,698
<i>I would've changed it,</i>
<i>but I didn't want to wake you.</i>

990
01:33:02,787 --> 01:33:07,117
<i>Use the one in the charger. Hopefully,</i>
<i>the light on it is green by now.</i>

991
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,912
<i>Because this is gonna be a long call</i>
<i>and I can't let you off...</i>

992
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:12,410
<i>because even though</i>
<i>you've been stripped of your duties...</i>

993
01:33:12,505 --> 01:33:15,790
<i>I know you won't abandon them...</i>
<i>you'll try to put on a trace.</i>

994
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:19,501
<i>So we'll disconnect long enough for you</i>
<i>to exchange the battery in the phone...</i>

995
01:33:19,595 --> 01:33:21,588
<i>for the one in the charger.</i>

996
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:24,681
<i>Shall we say, three seconds?</i>

997
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:26,309
<i>- Are you ready?</i>
- Yes.

998
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:27,343
<i>Go.</i>

999
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,774
- <i>Very good.</i>
- Thank you.

1000
01:33:34,861 --> 01:33:37,778
<i>Remember, Clarice, if you get caught</i>
<i>with a concealed, unlicensed firearm...</i>

1001
01:33:37,864 --> 01:33:40,699
<i>in the District of Columbia,</i>
<i>the penalty is very stiff.</i>

1002
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:44,366
<i>But bring the guns if you have to.</i>
<i>Now get in your car.</i>

1003
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:23,607
<i>The reason we're doing it</i>
<i>like this, Clarice...</i>

1004
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:27,745
<i>is because I like to watch you</i>
<i>as we speak, with your eyes open.</i>

1005
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:32,573
<i>No, it does not excite me.</i>
<i>It pleases me.</i>

1006
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,075
<i>You have very shapely feet.</i>

1007
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:40,830
<i>Where are we now?</i>
<i>Call it out.</i>

1008
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:42,717
Massachusetts Avenue.

1009
01:34:42,803 --> 01:34:44,676
<i>Take it.</i>

1010
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:48,547
<i>I thought, to begin with,</i>
<i>you might tell me how you're feeling.</i>

1011
01:34:48,642 --> 01:34:49,591
About what?

1012
01:34:49,685 --> 01:34:52,555
<i>The masters you serve</i>
<i>and how they've treated you.</i>

1013
01:34:52,646 --> 01:34:55,351
<i>Your career, such as it is.</i>

1014
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,314
<i>Your life, Clarice.</i>

1015
01:34:57,401 --> 01:34:59,358
I thought we might
talk about yours.

1016
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,444
<i>- What's the next cross street?</i>
- Capitol Street.

1017
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,777
<i>In two blocks, make a left</i>
<i>into Union Station. Park.</i>

1018
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:10,485
<i>My life? What is there</i>
<i>to say about mine?</i>

1019
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:13,664
I have been in a state of hibernation
for some time...

1020
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,826
<i>a little inactive.</i>

1021
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:19,204
<i>But now I'm back home</i>
<i>and I'm very happy...</i>

1022
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,005
<i>and very healthy.</i>

1023
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:25,468
<i>- You. It's you I'm worried about.</i>
- I'm fine.

1024
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,340
<i>No, you're certainly</i>
<i>not fine, Clarice.</i>

1025
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,136
<i>You fell in love with the Bureau,</i>
<i>the institution...</i>

1026
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:34,595
<i>only to discover, after giving it</i>
<i>everything you've got...</i>

1027
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:36,764
that it does not
love you back...

1028
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:38,849
that, in fact, it resents you.

1029
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:41,895
It resents you more than the husband
and children you gave up to it.

1030
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:46,446
<i>Why is that, do you think?</i>
<i>Why are you so resented?</i>

1031
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,987
- Tell me.
- Tell you?

1032
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:50,701
God bless you.

1033
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:52,660
Well, isn't it clear?

1034
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:57,831
You serve the idea
of order, Clarice.

1035
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,294
<i>They don't.</i>

1036
01:35:59,378 --> 01:36:02,961
<i>You believe in the oath you took.</i>
<i>They don't.</i>

1037
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:07,426
<i>You feel it is your duty</i>
<i>to protect the sheep. They don't.</i>

1038
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,634
<i>They don't like you</i>
<i>because you're not like them.</i>

1039
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:11,928
<i>They hate you and envy you.</i>

1040
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:15,765
<i>They are weak, unruly</i>
<i>and believe in nothing.</i>

1041
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:18,390
Mason Verger wants to kill you,
Dr Lecter.

1042
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,232
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

1043
01:36:21,316 --> 01:36:24,851
<i>Will you stay with me in my prison cell</i>
<i>and hold my hand, Clarice?</i>

1044
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:27,270
<i>We could have some fun.</i>

1045
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:30,815
<i>No, Mason Verger does not want to kill</i>
<i>me any more than I want to kill him.</i>

1046
01:36:30,909 --> 01:36:34,824
<i>Hejust wants to see me suffer</i>
<i>in some unimaginable way.</i>

1047
01:36:34,913 --> 01:36:37,036
<i>He is rather twisted,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

1048
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,580
Have you had the pleasure
of meeting him?

1049
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:41,875
Face-to-face, so to speak?

1050
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,871
Yes.

1051
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:47,084
<i>- Attractive, isn't he?</i>
- Dr Lecter?

1052
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:53,548
<i>Okay, back to you.</i>

1053
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:55,882
I want to know what it is
you think you will do...

1054
01:36:55,975 --> 01:36:59,309
now that everything you've ever cared
about has been taken away from you.

1055
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:01,803
I don't know, Dr Lecter.

1056
01:37:01,898 --> 01:37:04,733
<i>Clarice, do you think you'll work</i>
<i>as a chambermaid...</i>

1057
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:07,569
<i>at a motel on Route 66...</i>

1058
01:37:07,654 --> 01:37:10,359
<i>Just like your mommy?</i>

1059
01:37:19,624 --> 01:37:21,700
<i>What are you thinking now?</i>

1060
01:37:21,793 --> 01:37:25,838
Are you paying attention to me,
ex-Special Agent Starling?

1061
01:37:26,673 --> 01:37:30,007
<i>Are you, by any chance,</i>
<i>trying to trace my whereabouts?</i>

1062
01:37:34,055 --> 01:37:37,506
- I'm being followed, Dr Lecter.
- <i>I know. I've seen them.</i>

1063
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,471
<i>And now you're in</i>
<i>a real dilemma, aren't you?</i>

1064
01:37:40,561 --> 01:37:44,393
<i>Do you continue to try to find me,</i>
<i>knowing that you are leading them to me?</i>

1065
01:37:44,482 --> 01:37:48,100
<i>Do you have so much faith in your</i>
<i>abilities that you honestly believe...</i>

1066
01:37:48,194 --> 01:37:52,026
<i>you can somehow simultaneously</i>
<i>arrest me and them?</i>

1067
01:37:52,115 --> 01:37:56,065
<i>It could get very messy, Clarice,</i>
<i>like the fish market.</i>

1068
01:37:57,787 --> 01:38:00,456
- <i>What if I did it for you?</i>
- Did what?

1069
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:04,075
<i>Harmed them, Clarice,</i>
<i>the ones who have harmed you.</i>

1070
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:07,454
<i>What if I made them</i>
<i>scream apologies?</i>

1071
01:38:07,547 --> 01:38:09,540
<i>No, I shouldn't even say it...</i>

1072
01:38:09,632 --> 01:38:13,001
<i>because you'll feel, with your</i>
<i>perfect grasp of right and wrong...</i>

1073
01:38:13,093 --> 01:38:15,335
<i>that you were somehow</i> accompli.

1074
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,133
Don't help me.

1075
01:38:19,642 --> 01:38:21,634
No, of course not.
Forget I said it.

1076
01:38:26,607 --> 01:38:29,394
<i>Clarice, you were very,</i>
<i>very warm.</i>

1077
01:38:29,485 --> 01:38:31,478
<i>You were so close.</i>

1078
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:38,617
<i>And now you're getting</i>
<i>colder again.</i>

1079
01:38:38,703 --> 01:38:40,909
<i>Yeah, warmer again.</i>

1080
01:38:40,997 --> 01:38:45,160
<i>Well, I think I've been generous</i>
<i>enough with you and the clues.</i>

1081
01:38:45,251 --> 01:38:48,750
<i>- You're on your own now, Clarice.</i>
- Dr Lecter.

1082
01:38:58,013 --> 01:39:00,765
<i>Hope you like them, Clarice.</i>
<i>Ta-ta.</i>

1083
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,248
Go.

1084
01:39:48,772 --> 01:39:50,681
Get out of the way!

1085
01:40:02,285 --> 01:40:05,120
I know the first thing a hysteric
says is, "I am not a hysteric"...

1086
01:40:05,204 --> 01:40:08,490
but I am not a hysteric.
I am calm.

1087
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:11,453
I'll ask you one time.
Think before you answer.

1088
01:40:12,712 --> 01:40:15,666
Think about every good thing
you ever did.

1089
01:40:15,756 --> 01:40:17,630
Think about what you swore.

1090
01:40:17,717 --> 01:40:21,002
Two men in a van,
a third driving, another man down.

1091
01:40:21,095 --> 01:40:23,633
They put him in the back.
I think it was Lecter.

1092
01:40:23,723 --> 01:40:27,092
I gave you a licence, and I'm reporting
it to you again in front of witnesses.

1093
01:40:29,145 --> 01:40:30,770
All right.

1094
01:40:31,898 --> 01:40:33,891
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.

1095
01:40:34,567 --> 01:40:36,643
I'll send someone
with the local authorities...

1096
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,025
if they'll let us on the property
without a warrant.

1097
01:40:39,114 --> 01:40:43,442
- I should go. You could deputize me.
- No. You're not going.

1098
01:40:43,534 --> 01:40:46,203
You're going home,
where you'll wait for me to call...

1099
01:40:46,286 --> 01:40:49,987
and tell you what,
if anything, we've found.

1100
01:40:51,292 --> 01:40:54,577
Thank Mr Verger for letting us look
around. Sorry if we inconvenienced him.

1101
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:56,746
He's always happy to see you.

1102
01:41:06,349 --> 01:41:08,388
Phone.

1103
01:41:08,476 --> 01:41:11,049
<i>What number, please?</i>

1104
01:41:11,145 --> 01:41:12,520
Carlo.

1105
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:21,898
Give me one.

1106
01:41:26,493 --> 01:41:28,949
- <i>How is he?</i>
- Sleeping.

1107
01:41:29,037 --> 01:41:31,789
Bring him home.

1108
01:41:54,855 --> 01:41:58,306
<i>You've reached Clarice Starling.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1109
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,942
<i>Pick up, Starling.</i>

1110
01:42:00,026 --> 01:42:01,983
<i>There was nothing out there.</i>

1111
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:04,477
<i>I'm gonna say it again,</i>
<i>in case you didn't hear me.</i>

1112
01:42:04,572 --> 01:42:08,487
<i>You are not a law officer while</i>
<i>you're on suspension. You'reJoe Blow.</i>

1113
01:42:09,661 --> 01:42:12,662
<i>Hope for your sake</i>
<i>you're in the bathroom.</i>

1114
01:42:51,828 --> 01:42:53,452
<i>Hylochoerus...</i>

1115
01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:56,704
<i>meinertzhageni.</i>

1116
01:42:56,791 --> 01:43:00,871
Ring any bells from
high school biology, Doctor?

1117
01:43:01,963 --> 01:43:03,872
No?

1118
01:43:03,965 --> 01:43:07,548
Well, I could list
its most conspicuous features...

1119
01:43:07,635 --> 01:43:10,387
if that would help
jog the memory.

1120
01:43:11,139 --> 01:43:14,056
Three pairs of incisors...

1121
01:43:14,142 --> 01:43:18,719
one pair of elongated canines...

1122
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:23,564
three pairs of molars...

1123
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:26,189
four pairs of premolars...

1124
01:43:26,278 --> 01:43:28,567
upper and lower...

1125
01:43:28,656 --> 01:43:33,567
for a total of <i>44</i> teeth.

1126
01:43:38,374 --> 01:43:43,250
The meal will begin with
an hors d'oeuvres tartare...

1127
01:43:44,714 --> 01:43:47,418
your feet.

1128
01:43:47,508 --> 01:43:49,501
The main course...
the rest of you...

1129
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:53,258
won't be served
until seven hours later.

1130
01:43:53,346 --> 01:43:55,588
But during that time...

1131
01:43:55,682 --> 01:44:00,095
you'll be able to enjoy the effects
of the consumed appetizer...

1132
01:44:00,187 --> 01:44:03,603
with a full-bodied saline drip.

1133
01:44:05,651 --> 01:44:08,901
I guess you wish now...

1134
01:44:08,987 --> 01:44:11,561
you'd fed the rest of me
to the dogs.

1135
01:44:13,033 --> 01:44:15,073
No, Mason.

1136
01:44:15,661 --> 01:44:18,234
No, I much prefer you
the way you are.

1137
01:44:19,331 --> 01:44:20,825
So...

1138
01:44:22,459 --> 01:44:24,416
dinner at 8:00.

1139
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:55,857
You will stay
for the evening's entertainment...

1140
01:44:55,951 --> 01:44:57,694
won't you, Cordell?

1141
01:44:57,786 --> 01:45:00,359
If it's all right with you...

1142
01:45:00,455 --> 01:45:03,207
I think I'd rather not.

1143
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:05,450
Rather not...

1144
01:45:05,544 --> 01:45:08,330
or will not?

1145
01:47:12,168 --> 01:47:16,296
Your little brother must smell
almost as badly as you do by now.

1146
01:47:44,075 --> 01:47:46,400
Hold it!
Hands where I can see 'em!

1147
01:47:51,165 --> 01:47:52,494
Quiet!

1148
01:47:58,089 --> 01:48:00,627
What was that?

1149
01:48:00,716 --> 01:48:01,961
Cordell, quickly!

1150
01:48:02,051 --> 01:48:05,136
Get on your stomach.

1151
01:48:05,221 --> 01:48:06,799
Good evening, Clarice.

1152
01:48:06,889 --> 01:48:09,926
- Just like old times.
- Shut up.

1153
01:48:11,769 --> 01:48:14,011
- Can you walk?
- I can try.

1154
01:48:17,108 --> 01:48:18,601
You look well.

1155
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:20,732
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1156
01:48:20,819 --> 01:48:24,022
If you touch me,
I'll shoot you.

1157
01:48:24,114 --> 01:48:27,317
- Understood.
- Do right and you'll live through this.

1158
01:48:27,409 --> 01:48:30,363
Spoken like a true Protestant.
Better hurry.

1159
01:48:30,454 --> 01:48:32,862
Things might go faster
if you hand me the knife.

1160
01:48:32,957 --> 01:48:35,412
There was a third
in the loft.

1161
01:48:35,501 --> 01:48:39,036
No, Clarice. Behind me.

1162
01:49:16,833 --> 01:49:20,534
Cordell, shoot him!
Get the gun and shoot him!

1163
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:23,037
- Go into the pen?
- Yes!

1164
01:49:23,131 --> 01:49:25,373
No. I'm staying out of this.

1165
01:49:25,467 --> 01:49:29,465
You're involved, is what you are,
in all of it. Now do it!

1166
01:49:29,555 --> 01:49:30,586
- No.
- Yes!

1167
01:49:30,681 --> 01:49:33,764
Hey, Cordell,
why don't you push him in?

1168
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:35,973
You can always say
it was me.

1169
01:51:22,374 --> 01:51:23,952
Mary, it's me.

1170
01:51:24,043 --> 01:51:27,707
I decided to take off early.
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.

1171
01:51:27,796 --> 01:51:30,500
I don't want any calls
fo<i>rw</i>arded either. Do you understand?

1172
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:33,342
Whoever it is,
they can all wait. Okay?

1173
01:51:33,426 --> 01:51:37,294
Listen, it's <i>4</i>th of july,
for Christ's sake. Thank you.

1174
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:55,022
What the fuck?

1175
01:52:05,082 --> 01:52:07,159
Good. You brought the wine.

1176
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:34,084
One time I bet a friend I could hold
a lit firecracker in my hand...

1177
01:53:34,171 --> 01:53:35,914
longer than he could.

1178
01:53:36,006 --> 01:53:37,121
Can I guess?

1179
01:53:37,216 --> 01:53:41,130
You lost the bet, and he lost
a finger. Am I right?

1180
01:53:42,262 --> 01:53:44,670
This won't hurt a bit.

1181
01:53:50,896 --> 01:53:53,304
Are we expecting guests?

1182
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:29,843
<i>We've traced your call and units</i>
<i>will be there in about ten minutes.</i>

1183
01:54:29,935 --> 01:54:33,185
<i>If you can do it safely,</i>
<i>Just get out of the house.</i>

1184
01:54:33,272 --> 01:54:36,522
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>stay on the phone with me.</i>

1185
01:54:36,607 --> 01:54:38,018
<i>Ma'am?</i>

1186
01:54:38,109 --> 01:54:40,979
<i>Are you there? Ma'am?</i>

1187
01:54:57,212 --> 01:54:59,370
You need to make sure
they feel welcome.

1188
01:55:04,636 --> 01:55:08,301
- Are those shallots?
- And caper berries.

1189
01:55:11,309 --> 01:55:13,302
That butter smells wonderful.

1190
01:55:14,603 --> 01:55:16,810
You feeling hungry, Paul?

1191
01:55:16,897 --> 01:55:18,806
Very.

1192
01:55:24,071 --> 01:55:26,443
What's the main course?

1193
01:55:26,532 --> 01:55:30,067
You should never ask.
It spoils the surprise.

1194
01:55:30,161 --> 01:55:34,988
Clarice, what are you doing up?
You should be resting. Get back to bed.

1195
01:55:35,082 --> 01:55:37,122
I'm hungry.

1196
01:55:39,670 --> 01:55:42,458
- Hello, Paul.
- Paul, don't be rude.

1197
01:55:43,674 --> 01:55:46,675
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."

1198
01:55:46,761 --> 01:55:50,177
Hello, Agent Starling.

1199
01:55:52,016 --> 01:55:54,008
I always wanted
to watch you eat.

1200
01:55:54,101 --> 01:55:59,178
What have you got in your hand?
Something to bash me on the head with?

1201
01:56:00,023 --> 01:56:02,514
Put it on the table.

1202
01:56:02,609 --> 01:56:03,938
Good girl.

1203
01:56:04,027 --> 01:56:06,269
Hey. That's mine.

1204
01:56:06,363 --> 01:56:08,107
Now sit down.

1205
01:56:10,367 --> 01:56:13,285
Hey, Clarice, love the dress.

1206
01:56:13,370 --> 01:56:15,446
It's beautiful.

1207
01:56:15,539 --> 01:56:17,781
- What do you think, Paul?
- Nice.

1208
01:56:18,876 --> 01:56:20,703
Nice.

1209
01:56:28,886 --> 01:56:32,301
Why don't you say grace, Paul.

1210
01:56:32,388 --> 01:56:34,796
- Me?
- Yeah.

1211
01:56:34,891 --> 01:56:36,551
- Grace?
- Sure.

1212
01:56:37,477 --> 01:56:39,434
Okay.

1213
01:56:39,521 --> 01:56:41,145
Bow your head.

1214
01:56:43,567 --> 01:56:46,484
Father, we thank Thee
for Thy blessings...

1215
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:48,479
and dedicate them
to Thy mercy...

1216
01:56:48,572 --> 01:56:51,738
We are about to receive...

1217
01:56:51,825 --> 01:56:53,485
Forgive us all...

1218
01:56:53,577 --> 01:56:55,653
even white trash
like Starling here...

1219
01:56:55,746 --> 01:56:58,830
and bring her
into my service, amen.

1220
01:57:00,876 --> 01:57:05,170
I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have done better.

1221
01:57:05,255 --> 01:57:07,331
He hated women too.

1222
01:57:07,424 --> 01:57:10,874
- May I have some wine, please?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1223
01:57:10,968 --> 01:57:12,628
Not with the morphine.

1224
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,176
I think you should
eat some broth. Okay?

1225
01:57:15,264 --> 01:57:20,259
By the way, that was a job offering
I worked into the blessing.

1226
01:57:20,353 --> 01:57:22,345
I'm going to Congress,
you know.

1227
01:57:22,438 --> 01:57:24,146
Are you?

1228
01:57:24,232 --> 01:57:27,019
Come around campaign headquarters.

1229
01:57:27,110 --> 01:57:30,609
You could be an office girl.
Can you type and file?

1230
01:57:30,697 --> 01:57:34,397
Can you take dictation?
Take this down.

1231
01:57:34,492 --> 01:57:38,407
"Washington is full
of cornpone, country pussy."

1232
01:57:41,291 --> 01:57:44,043
I took it down.
You said it already.

1233
01:57:44,127 --> 01:57:47,412
Paul, now you're being rude,
and I hate rude people.

1234
01:57:47,504 --> 01:57:50,755
Drink your broth
like a good boy. Come on. Sip.

1235
01:57:52,426 --> 01:57:53,968
Good.

1236
01:57:57,223 --> 01:57:59,796
It's not very good, buddy.

1237
01:57:59,892 --> 01:58:02,846
I admit I added something to yours.
Perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.

1238
01:58:02,937 --> 01:58:06,270
But I assure you,
the next course is to die for.

1239
01:58:18,369 --> 01:58:20,326
Come on, Clarice.

1240
01:58:20,413 --> 01:58:22,489
That's a good girl.

1241
01:58:22,582 --> 01:58:24,158
Good.

1242
01:58:55,447 --> 01:58:56,527
Dr Lecter.

1243
01:58:56,615 --> 01:59:00,695
You see, the brain itself feels no pain,
Clarice, if that concerns you.

1244
01:59:00,786 --> 01:59:04,534
For example, Paul won't miss
this little piece here...

1245
01:59:04,622 --> 01:59:06,532
part of the prefrontal lobe...

1246
01:59:06,624 --> 01:59:09,709
which they say is
the seat of good manners.

1247
01:59:09,794 --> 01:59:13,495
Your profile at the border stations
has five features.

1248
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:15,464
- I'll trade you.
- Trade?

1249
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:20,129
- Stop, and I'll tell you what they are.
- How does that word taste to you?

1250
01:59:20,222 --> 01:59:24,266
Cheap and metallic,
like sucking on a greasy coin?

1251
01:59:24,351 --> 01:59:26,308
- Who's Clarice?
- Agent Starling, Paul.

1252
01:59:26,394 --> 01:59:29,846
If you can't keep up with the
conversation, try not to join in at all.

1253
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:32,016
Paul, I'm Starling.

1254
01:59:32,109 --> 01:59:34,018
See...

1255
01:59:34,111 --> 01:59:36,020
here...

1256
01:59:36,113 --> 01:59:39,979
right here's the sac
that contains the brain.

1257
01:59:42,326 --> 01:59:44,864
I would really like some wine.

1258
01:59:48,332 --> 01:59:50,740
- That smells great.
- Yes.

1259
01:59:50,835 --> 01:59:53,955
There.
Like to try a little piece?

1260
01:59:54,047 --> 01:59:56,834
I would really like
some wine...

1261
01:59:58,635 --> 02:00:00,592
It is good.

1262
02:00:01,471 --> 02:00:05,171
All right. Just a little.

1263
02:00:06,643 --> 02:00:07,592
Okay?

1264
02:00:25,035 --> 02:00:27,953
Given the chance, you would deny me
my life, wouldn't you?

1265
02:00:29,206 --> 02:00:30,914
Not your life.

1266
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,084
My freedom, just that.
You'd take that from me.

1267
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:37,539
And if you did, would they have
you back, do you think?

1268
02:00:37,631 --> 02:00:40,169
The FBI?

1269
02:00:40,259 --> 02:00:43,711
Those people you despise almost
as much as they despise you?

1270
02:00:43,804 --> 02:00:46,971
Will they give you a medal,
Clarice, do you think?

1271
02:00:47,058 --> 02:00:50,391
Would you have it professionally framed
and hang it on your wall to look at...

1272
02:00:50,478 --> 02:00:54,891
and remind you of your courage
and incorruptibility?

1273
02:00:57,484 --> 02:01:00,935
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

1274
02:01:02,531 --> 02:01:07,027
I have plans for that smart mouth.
I'm never gonna hire you now.

1275
02:01:12,124 --> 02:01:13,915
Remember what I said?

1276
02:01:14,001 --> 02:01:16,836
If you can't be polite
to our guests...

1277
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:19,755
you have to sit
at the kiddies' table.

1278
02:01:20,674 --> 02:01:22,916
Don't get up, Clarice.

1279
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:26,758
Paul will help me clear
and make the coffee.

1280
02:01:28,766 --> 02:01:30,758
Just think about
what I said, Clarice.

1281
02:01:32,978 --> 02:01:34,602
Coffee.

1282
02:02:12,683 --> 02:02:15,139
I came halfway
around the world...

1283
02:02:15,228 --> 02:02:17,635
to watch you run, Clarice.

1284
02:02:20,107 --> 02:02:22,100
Let me run, huh?

1285
02:02:41,254 --> 02:02:45,667
Tell me, Clarice,
would you ever say to me...

1286
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:47,301
"Stop.

1287
02:02:47,385 --> 02:02:49,377
If you loved me, you'd stop"?

1288
02:02:51,138 --> 02:02:53,380
Not in a thousand years.

1289
02:02:54,933 --> 02:02:56,926
Not in a thousand years.

1290
02:03:02,608 --> 02:03:04,601
That's my girl.

1291
02:03:18,291 --> 02:03:21,956
Now, that's really
interesting, Clarice...

1292
02:03:22,044 --> 02:03:24,037
and I'm really pressed for time.

1293
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:26,965
So where's the key?

1294
02:03:27,924 --> 02:03:29,917
Where's the key?

1295
02:03:35,682 --> 02:03:37,224
Okay.

1296
02:03:42,147 --> 02:03:43,558
Above...

1297
02:03:43,649 --> 02:03:45,440
or below the wrist...

1298
02:03:45,525 --> 02:03:47,150
Clarice?

1299
02:03:54,743 --> 02:03:57,661
This is really gonna hurt.

1300
02:04:46,377 --> 02:04:48,998
Show me your hands!

1301
02:04:49,088 --> 02:04:51,626
Identify yourself!

1302
02:04:51,716 --> 02:04:53,543
I'm Clarice Starling!

1303
02:04:54,635 --> 02:04:56,628
FBI!

1304
02:05:55,696 --> 02:05:57,404
- Hi.
- Hi.

1305
02:05:57,490 --> 02:05:59,197
What's that?

1306
02:06:01,117 --> 02:06:03,194
That's caviar.

1307
02:06:03,286 --> 02:06:06,537
- What are those?
- These are figs.

1308
02:06:06,623 --> 02:06:08,699
And that?

1309
02:06:10,877 --> 02:06:12,502
This?

1310
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,206
That I don't think
you would like.

1311
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:18,588
- It looks good.
- Oh, it is good.

1312
02:06:18,677 --> 02:06:20,088
Can I have some?

1313
02:06:21,513 --> 02:06:24,218
You're a very unusual boy,
aren't you?

1314
02:06:24,308 --> 02:06:27,759
- I couldn't eat what they gave me.
- Nor should you. It isn't even food...

1315
02:06:27,853 --> 02:06:31,554
as I understand the definition,
which is why I always bring my own.

1316
02:06:34,026 --> 02:06:36,398
So, which would you like to try?

1317
02:06:40,907 --> 02:06:43,315
Well, I suppose it's all right.

1318
02:06:44,994 --> 02:06:49,870
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me...

1319
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:52,449
"It is important,"
she always used to say...

1320
02:06:52,544 --> 02:06:55,414
"always to try new things."

1321
02:06:55,505 --> 02:06:56,916
Open up.
