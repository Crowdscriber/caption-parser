1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,990
Ooh! Individual frittatas!

2
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:06,799
What a treat.
You're a lucky man, Phil.

3
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:08,517
- I'm always saying, I'm...
- Phil.

4
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:10,209
- Sorry.
- You left the milk out again.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,158
Oh. Mmm.

6
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:12,887
I may have to take
one of these little guys home.

7
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,551
Claire, did you ever find
that tupperware I lent you?

8
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:16,612
Sweetie, for the hundredth time,

9
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,262
I gave it back to you, remember?

10
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:19,644
I remember you
telling me a hundred times,

11
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,735
yet my pea soup is in baggies.

12
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:23,170
Did you check your car?

13
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,198
In the...

14
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:24,814
Trunk.

15
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,140
Because that's where
you found that thing

16
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,134
that you thought that
you gave me long time ago,

17
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:29,952
- the... the...
- Pizza cutter.

18
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:30,855
Good, give me another one.

19
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,442
- Yes, I was wrong that time. I-- 
- It's a piece of plastic.

20
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:34,561
You're ruining brunch.

21
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:35,517
Don't sweat it, Cam.

22
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:36,887
I forget things all the time.

23
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:38,819
Like I can never
remember the name

24
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:41,543
of that weather guy
that I liked. Uh...

25
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:43,296
- Thunder something.
- Stormy...

26
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:45,320
Flash stormy?
Ah, whatever the hell it is.

27
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,320
- I don't know.
- Mm, just eat your eggs, Jay.

28
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,650
Yeah, just eat your eggs, Jay.

29
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:54,110
- Oh, ho ho ho!
- Grandpa got told!

30
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:55,350
Look at them.

31
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,845
They all think Lily's so great.

32
00:00:57,846 --> 00:00:59,167
The novelty will wear off.

33
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:00,902
We used to be the cute ones.

34
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:02,842
Now she gets all the attention.

35
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,470
We need to take her down.

36
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,953
And I should remember his name, too,

37
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:08,491
because your mom and I
got in a big fight over him.

38
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:10,855
She was using the convertible,
and I told her,

39
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:15,319
"put the top up because it's supposed
to rain tonight, according to..."

40
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,797
P-p-p-partly Mccloudy?

41
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:19,637
Whatever the hell his name is.
Anyway...

42
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,689
She didn't.
Ruined the car.

43
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,787
Well, not to be the one that
always come to mom's defense...

44
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:26,606
What? It was 20 years ago.

45
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,880
- What, you think he's gonna ground you?
- It was you?

46
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:32,932
Yes. Yes, I left the top down,
and I let mom take the fall.

47
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,338
And then they got divorced.

48
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:35,792
- 12 years later.
- I'm just saying.

49
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:36,935
Ugh. You're ruining brunch.

50
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,360
Relax. It was years ago.

51
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,245
There's a statute of limitation
on this stuff.

52
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,841
In that case, I should
probably let you know

53
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:45,000
I let the top down
to let out the cigarette smoke.

54
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:47,150
Not-- not mine. Not mine.

55
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,693
My-- my bad friend Eleanor.

56
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:50,304
Eleanor being her boyfriend Allen.

57
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:51,434
Statute of limitations.

58
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,887
Oh, relax, it's okay.

59
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,261
Remember when I told you

60
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,536
that I couldn't get to
your figure skating semifinal

61
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:57,596
because I was stuck at work?

62
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:58,126
Yeah.

63
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,540
Well, by "stuck" I meant "drunk,"

64
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,494
and by "work" I meant "the golf course."

65
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:05,131
- Wow. Dad!
- Oh, no. I got one. I got one.

66
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,209
Remember that time
we went golfing together,

67
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,989
- and you got a hole-in-one?
- Yeah?

68
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,453
You never got a hole-in-one.

69
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,397
I got bored and
I kicked it in the hole.

70
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,915
This is fun. Here's a corker.

71
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,518
They didn't used to label babies
as carefully in hospitals,

72
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,199
- so for two days--
- Not now, Phil.

73
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,738
What do you mean, you--
you kicked the ball in the hole?

74
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,994
What, was it, like, on the edge?

75
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,329
Yeah, it was on the edge of that, uh...

76
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,567
- What?
- That--that sandy thing.

77
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:27,769
Gee, it's sure gonna be fun
to face my friends today.

78
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,955
Well, you don't have to tell them.

79
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,723
They call me "ace," Mitch.

80
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:33,184
I haven't paid for a lemonade
down there in 20 years.

81
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,210
- You're mad at me?
- Mm.

82
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,739
Great, daddy.
You ruined brunch.

83
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,104
You did!

84
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,198
This ends today.

85

86
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,096
A little help here?

87
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,252
You can't expect me to focus

88
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,626
when Miranda Cornell lives
right down your street.

89
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,484
She's like a dream wrapped
in a wish poured into jeggings.

90
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,983
Yeah, yeah, that's nice and all,

91
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:10,265
but we got a trap to set.

92
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,775
Are you sure
this is going to work?

93
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,558
Trust me.
We'll use these cookies as bait.

94
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,200
Lily's crazy for them.

95
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,688
Asian metabolism.

96
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:20,095
When she grabs them
with her grubby little hands,

97
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,594
off goes the trap.

98
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:23,776
Boom-- Big puddle of milk.

99
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,278
She'll get in so much trouble.

100
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,648
My mom hates messes.

101
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,124
I'm familiar with Claire.

102
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:29,835
Lock...

103
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,011
and loaded.

104
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,707
Mmm! These cookies are so good...

105
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,153
And so easy to reach.

106
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,843
Lily!

107
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:54,568
- Oh, my God! Cam!
- Oh! Ohh!

108
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,293
What happened? Are you okay?

109
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:00,021
Oh! That milk... fell,
and I must have slipped in it!

110
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,226
Did I leave that out again?
I'm so sorry!

111
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,130
Oh! My back! Ooh! My back!

112
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:07,357
Can I give you a Swedish massage,
accent optional?

113
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:09,209
Oh! Oh, no,
I just need to lie down.

114
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,064
Come on. Let's just
get you over to the sofa.

115
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,489
Do you think it would be offensive

116
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,328
if I asked our daughter
to walk on my back?

117
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,374
I'd say so. I just offered
to give you a massage.

118
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,351
Oh, no! You broke Beatrice.

119
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:23,786
Now she can't feed the dolphins.

120
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,051
What is she talking about?

121
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:26,585
Oh, it's a "My sweet companion" doll.

122
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,368
They all have
these elaborate backstories.

123
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,115
Beatrice works with
blind dolphins and models.

124
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:33,206
There are blind models?

125
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:36,498
That's so sad.
They cannot see how pretty they are.

126
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:40,625
Okay. Hold on. Here we go.

127
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,556
- Give me some. Give me some. Give me some.
- Oh!

128
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:46,892
Let me buy Lily a new doll.
It's my fault Cam fell.

129
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,951
No, no need.
Uh, the My sweet companion store

130
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:51,087
actually has a hospital
with an on-call doctor.

131
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,049
Well, I can go. I'm taking the girls
to the mall anyway.

132
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,239
Oh, that'd be great. Yeah.

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,666
And don't worry.
She has medical insurance.

134
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,801
Yeah, and I think we've met
our deductible for the year,

135
00:04:57,802 --> 00:04:58,966
so you should be good.

136
00:04:58,967 --> 00:04:59,619
Yeah.

137
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,593
Do you know what
a doll is in my village?

138
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,522
An apple on a fork.

139
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,188
I never really got dolls.
Does that make me weird?

140
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,153
It's on the list.

141
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:11,021
You're not weird.

142
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:13,182
You just kind of skipped
the little girl stage.

143
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,922
And jumped to the "I dare you
to ring her doorbell" stage.

144
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:18,443
The only stage you're ever going
to jump on has a pole on it.

145
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,776
Hey, at least I have the body--

146
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,929
Okay! Okay!

147
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,454
We're gonna have to settle
this dispute in court--

148
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,750
the food court.

149
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:27,307
The honorable Judge Cinnabon presiding.

150
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:28,720
The food court? That place smells

151
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,585
like the inside
of Luke's bicycle helmet.

152
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,603
- I like the food court.
- Me, too.

153
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:34,726
Don't worry, girls.
We're not gonna deprive ourselves

154
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,962
just 'cause of Haley's
aversion to food--

155
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:41,415
Oh. Oh, Haley's "aversion."

156
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,958
I thought you said...

157
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,739
Never mind.

158
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:53,157
Okay, so after you have
turned on the monitor

159
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,686
and selected your input,

160
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,834
you can change the channel
with this guy.

161
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:59,207
But if you need to change the volume--

162
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,329
You know what? I think I'm fine.

163
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,388
Why don't you just go ahead?

164
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,664
I know this sounds
really confusing,

165
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,085
but there's actually a very
simple way to remember it.

166
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,672
Input 1 is the cable box

167
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:09,701
- cable box, ca--
- I think I'm just gonna take a nap.

168
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,366
Okay. I'm going to yoga.

169
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,879
Ay! That sounds like so much fun.

170
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,323
Oh, you should go with her, Gloria!

171
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,795
Oh, we should definitely
do that sometime.

172
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:18,271
I would love it. Bye!

173
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:22,026
Do you see how she gives me
the cold shoulders?

174
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,809
I don't even know why I try.

175
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,872
- Ay. Sorry.
- Oh, well, that's just Claire, you know?

176
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,036
She's a Pritchett.

177
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,034
You gotta break through those walls.

178
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,157
The sooner the better.

179
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,191
You really think so?

180
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,218
Yeah. Why don't you go? Now.

181
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:34,656
Forge that friendship!

182
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:37,125
Okay, I go. I have
my gym bag in the car.

183
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:38,613
Feel better!

184
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,953
Okay, thank you!
I'm just gonna lie here...

185
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:43,234
Some ice on my back!

186
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:54,377
I knew for a fact Claire
never returned my tupperware,

187
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:56,573
I just needed a few minutes
alone to find it.

188
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:57,640
And when I did,

189
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,972
I'd never have
to hear them snicker again,

190
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,452
"Oh, silly Cam" or "forgetful Cam,"

191
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:05,598
because revenge
is a dish best served cold.

192
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:07,208
And even better, two days later

193
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,053
out of 24-ounce microwave-friendly

194
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,937
burp-sealed pak-n-stor.

195
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,816
Oh, hey! I thought you
were going to the pharmacy.

196
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,334
- I forgot my phone.
- Oh.

197
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,734
I think I'm just upset about
this stupid thing with my dad.

198
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,021
Well, sweetie,
I'd love to hear about it

199
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,754
when you come back with
my heating pad from the pharmacy,

200
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:33,203
because I hurt my back, remember?

201
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,556
I mean, did he overreact or what?

202
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,279
It's just a game, right?

203
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,307
Well, unless there's
something more to it.

204
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,855
Maybe you should go talk to him.

205
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:42,887
- Yeah.
- Huh?

206
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,347
Oh, I should have just
kept my mouth shut.

207
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,839
I mean, it was such a great day.

208
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:48,705
After he thought he got
that hole-in-one,

209
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:51,748
he took us out to dinner.
He bought me my first beer.

210
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,164
Well, there you go.
He's probably hurt

211
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,830
because you marred a very special
father-son experience.

212
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,251
- You think?
- Ya marred it.

213
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,002
But you can fix it.

214
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:00,793
He's down at the club right now.

215
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,214
Go, Mitchell!

216
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:03,831
Un-mar that memory!

217
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:05,652
You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

218
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,886
- Ow.
- Sorry.

219
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:08,328
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

220
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,473
Okay! I'll miss you!

221
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:10,624
Call first.

222
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,122
What were you thinking
saying that in front of him?

223
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:21,601
I'm sorry. It slipped out.

224
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,566
Besides, I figured he knew.
Mom knows.

225
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,385
Only because she
dragged it out of Dylan.

226
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:28,344
And she promised not to tell dad
until I left for college,

227
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,830
which means he might
have never found out.

228
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,914
Stop panicking.

229
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,583
We don't even know for sure
he heard what I said.

230
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,282
Okay. Beatrice is with the nurse.

231
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,547
They'll call us.
Shouldn't be too long.

232
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,066
We can just wait
until she's married.

233
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,127
Until she's... ready.

234
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,132
Which, apparently,
everyone is these days.

235
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,111
Funny, I used to think it'd be years
until everyone was ready,

236
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:47,212
but I guess I was wrong.
Wrong and naive.

237
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:52,009
Surprise!

238
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,115
Oh! Gloria. My God.

239
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,057
I came to do yoga with you.

240
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:57,432
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

241
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,112
Yeah, that's why I say "surprise!"

242
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:01,670
Oh, yeah. This is awful,
because I was just thinking

243
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,473
I might have to bail on yoga.

244
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,314
I have the worst headache
all of a sudden.

245
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:06,929
Oh, but yoga is good for that, Claire.

246
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,032
For the meditation, for the mmm...

247
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,747
Yeah, yeah. It's just right now

248
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:13,783
I wanna go lie down
in a dark room and breathe.

249
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,049
That sounds like yoga.

250
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,555
I... I realize that.

251
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,414
Yes.

252
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,643
- But still, I-I... should go.
- Come on.

253
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,786
I'm not gonna do
the class by myself.

254
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,033
Okay, so let's go
and get massages.

255
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,488
Or there's a nail salon there.

256
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,250
Ooh, I would love to do that
some other time,

257
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,412
I really would. But right now

258
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,154
I need to get home and lie down.
You understand, right?

259
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,497
- Of course.
- Okay.

260
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:34,435
You go!

261
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:36,821
And lie.

262
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:40,921
- You're better!
- Oh!

263
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,033
Barely. Barely, yeah.

264
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,563
I was just getting something
cold for my back.

265
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,779
Gravy? Well, if it can save
your mom's turkey,

266
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,844
it can save anything.

267
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,660
I thought you were going
to see your friend Miranda.

268
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:51,040
This one chickened out.

269
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,084
For someone who says
he likes girls so much,

270
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,400
he sure is afraid of them.

271
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,786
It's a dance, Luke.

272
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:56,880
Chicken dance.

273
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,348
Well, since you're back,
what if I give you 20 bucks,

274
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,962
and you guys...

275
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,099
Go wash my car?

276
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,971
Is that 20 bucks for each of us,
or both of us?

277
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,027
Both.

278
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,661
That's what I thought.

279
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:19,978
Uh-oh, check it out.

280
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,718
Ace is drooling over
his plaque again.

281
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,140
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't smell you idiots come in.

282
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:25,845
Listen, I've been thinking,

283
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:28,353
maybe it's time
we retire the name "Ace."

284
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,580
You mean the name you
had printed on your golf cap?

285
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,410
- And his robe.
- You know, guys, about that--

286
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:34,837
remember how mad he got when
I yanked that cap off his head

287
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:35,859
and put it on?

288
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,830
You got to earn that!

289
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:37,926
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm just glad

290
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,166
one of those cheap hair plugs
didn't get caught in it.

291
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,073
Hey, for the millionth time,
they're not plugs.

292
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,055
So what, your hair just came back
when you turned 50?

293
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,299
- Unlike your wife.
- Hey, that was a blessing.

294
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,594
Otherwise, I wouldn't be taking out
Natalie Hobbes tonight.

295
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:50,318
Taking her out or doing her taxes?

296
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:51,613
So I'm trying to find
a way to come clean

297
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,613
about the hole-in-one,
when it occurs to me...

298
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:55,330
Why?

299
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:57,748
One idiot lies about his sex life,

300
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:01,585
the other dumbbell has a Ferrari
"in the shop" for years,

301
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:04,972
and moron number three
is a Hollywood stunt car driver

302
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:08,249
who gets sick when he rides
backwards in the golf cart.

303
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,818
So you ladies ready
to tee off or what?

304
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:13,256
- Yeah, just gotta settle up our tab.
- I took care of it.

305
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,444
You said you were
going to the restroom.

306
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,658
Ah! Can't trust a word
out of this guy's mouth.

307
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,277
20 years we've been falling for this.

308
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,624
I-I'm sorry to interrupt,

309
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,034
- but my dad never lied to you guys.
- Mitchell...

310
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:23,318
No, he didn't even know until today

311
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,984
- that he never made the hole-in-one.
- Okay.

312
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,943
But the fact that
he couldn't live with himself

313
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:27,957
when he found out,

314
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,958
and he raced down here
to confess to you,

315
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,339
that just shows
the kind of man he is.

316
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,743
He is a hole-in-one kind of man.

317
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,365
You never got a hole-in-one?

318
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,586
I didn't tell them.

319
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,709
So this is the gang.
Introduce me.

320
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,940
- Ahh.
- Score!

321
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,720
It's not like me and Miranda
are perfectly suited.

322
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,293
For one thing, she likes bad boys.

323
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,258
That's just not me.

324
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,087
I'm gonna turn on some music.

325
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:56,149
I'm sorry.

326
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,085
I can't unlearn how to treat a lady.

327
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,269
But where does that leave me?

328
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,286
Waiting till I'm 40 when
she looks me up on Facebook

329
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,867
after a failed first marriage?

330
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:03,761
Okay.

331
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,216
What are you doing?

332
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,384
I'm sick of hearing you
whine about Miranda!

333
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,643
- It's time to make her notice you!
- But we can't!

334
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:12,846
We got a full tank of gas,
and she's right down the block.

335
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:13,767
Now buckle up!

336
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,737
- Are you crazy?
- You tell me.

337
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:29,352
Lily, what is this?

338
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,666
Don't you rather have
a chemistry set or flash cards?

339
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,787
She's pretty.

340
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,038
No. No, she's dirty.
Look. Look at the dirt.

341
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,181
Let me wipe her off.

342
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:42,336
Fix that.

343
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,232
One of her breeds
is coming loose. Come here.

344
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,588
Fix that right up.

345
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:52,938
So I've completed the examination,

346
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,178
she did really well.

347
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,337
What's the prognosis?

348
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,288
We can fix most of her arm,

349
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,241
but she'll never regain
full mobility in her shoulder joint,

350
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:03,555
because they don't make
that part anymore.

351
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:04,772
Well, that's pretty good, right?

352
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,536
I mean, she'll look exactly the same.

353
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,282
No one will know.

354
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:08,163
I'll know.

355
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:11,720
I'm just saying I liked her
the way she was.

356
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,181
She was such a sweet little doll.

357
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:14,867
I'm sorry, doctor.

358
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,704
I'm having trouble
adjusting to all this.

359
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:19,440
Uh, dad, she's still
a sweet little doll.

360
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:20,751
No, she's broken.

361
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,506
No, she's just changed a little.

362
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:25,509
It happens. Dolls grow up.

363
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,804
Well, actually--

364
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,730
- Uh, could you...
- Yeah. Sure.

365
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,977
I actually have to go

366
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:32,013
give a little girl
some pretty bad news.

367
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:36,669
So, Haley...

368
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,880
The thing is...

369
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,974
Fact-- Haley's almost 18.

370
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,561
Fact-- I am the cool dad.

371
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:50,876
Haley, I understand
that sex is a part of life.

372
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,269
I can't say that
I'm thrilled to hear this,

373
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,558
but I'm sure you're being safe,
and I hope that you'll feel free

374
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,194
to talk to me about this anytime.

375
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,423
We should...

376
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,337
We should probably get Beatrice,
like, a-a cast or something,

377
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,661
and we can all sign it. Yeah?

378
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,680
Uh, yeah. Sure.

379
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,024
Fact-- I blew it.

380
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,530
This repair's probably
gonna take a little while.

381
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:14,635
Why don't you run up
to the food court

382
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,714
and grab us a table?
I'll get Alex and Lily.

383
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:18,157
Okay.

384
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:22,473
Do you want the counter or a booth?

385
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,393
Whatever seems right to you.

386
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:28,952
I trust you.

387
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,087
I have a cool dad.

388
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,297
Okay. Your turn.

389
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,619
Unh-unh! No way!

390
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,410
Do you wanna get
her attention, or not?

391
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,190
That was amazing!

392
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:05,057
Did you see the look
on Miranda's face?

393
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:07,616
No. But you did good, Thelma.

394
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:09,727
Please stop calling me that.
I hate that movie.

395
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,864
What movie?

396
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,420
Uh-oh! Dead end!

397
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,844
You gotta make a u-ey.

398
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,225
I don't know how to do that.

399
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,557
She pretended to have a headache, Cam.

400
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,495
She doesn't want
to spend time with me.

401
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,373
Maybe she just wanted to be alone.

402
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:33,716
Why?

403
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:34,999
Because some people

404
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,452
really value their privacy,

405
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,395
and you have to respect that.

406
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:42,500
I have to go.

407
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:44,817
Hola, Claire!

408
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,007
Gloria, you've gotta stop doing that!

409
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,910
Were you going back
to the yoga class without me?

410
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,103
No, that is not why I came back.

411
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:53,562
I don't understand you.

412
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,527
Why you don't want
to spend time with me?

413
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,438
Everybody wants
to spend time with me!

414
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,586
Even the lady that did my nails
wants to take me to pilates.

415
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:02,173
I didn't come back here to do yoga.

416
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,745
I don't do yoga. It's a cover, okay?

417
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:05,810
Look...

418
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,021
I know that from the outside,

419
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,053
it seems like I have
everything together.

420
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,397
No, not really.

421
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,485
My point is that my life
can be very stressful.

422
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:17,377
And I have found a way
to cope with that stress.

423
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:20,190
And it's my little secret.
And I'm not proud of it.

424
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:22,352
- Hey, Claire. See you inside.
- Hey!

425
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:23,893
Is that what you do?

426
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,944
No. No!

427
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,033
Okay. You're coming with me.
Come in.

428
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:31,464
But listen to me. Gloria...

429
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,830
It has to stay between us.

430
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,098
This is my sacred space.

431
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,953
It's just such a great release.

432
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:46,094
- Thank you for not judging me.
- Why would I?

433
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:48,110
If anything,
it makes me like you more.

434
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:49,426
- Mm.
- So how often do you come here?

435
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:50,865
Not that often. No.

436
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,505
Hey.

437
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,051
Maybe a little often.

438
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,284
That's so sad.

439
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,911
I live with four teenagers.

440
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,123
You live with two adults.

441
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,227
- You have no idea...
- No, no, no. It's so sad

442
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,527
that you come here so often

443
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,213
and that's the best
that you can shoot.

444
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,323
And that's with pretty nails.

445
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:07,544
But improper stance. I...

446
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:08,899
- Practice more.
- Okay.

447
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,639
Here you go, Ace...

448
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:12,936
I mean... what is your real name?

449
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:13,870
Jay.

450
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:18,536
- Dad, I--
- I told you, forget about it.

451
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:21,557
All right.
I-I just want you to know

452
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,291
I get why you're upset, okay?

453
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,056
That--that day
you got the hole-in-one,

454
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,340
it meant a lot to you.

455
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,050
And... I... I marred it.

456
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,831
But it meant a lot to me, too.

457
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,554
We had a steak dinner,
you gave me my first beer,

458
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,595
and, uh...

459
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,341
It was one of the greatest days
we ever spent together.

460
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,523
And it wasn't about some
meaningless hole-in-one,

461
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:41,926
it was about us.

462
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,835
No. It was about a hole-in-one.

463
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,311
Yes. Yes. A-a little bit, maybe.

464
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:48,565
But mostly, it was
about how we bonded.

465
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,785
I thought I hit a ball
straight from the tee

466
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,701
really, really far

467
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:55,172
into a tiny hole.

468
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:57,092
Okay.

469
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,967
Well, when will I learn?

470
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:03,604
And it wasn't your first beer, anyway.

471
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:05,935
Yes, it was, dad, but I wouldn't
expect you to remember.

472
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,012
It was your 14th birthday.

473
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,628
You asked me for a sip of mine.

474
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,818
Your mom yelled at you
in front of all your friends,

475
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,208
said you were just a baby.

476
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,558
You ran outside in tears...

477
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:19,101
Which, unfortunately,
supported your mom's argument.

478
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:22,449
Anyway, I came out
with a couple of beers.

479
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,349
We drank 'em on the porch

480
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,324
watching the storm clouds coming in.

481
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:31,149
I had completely
forgotten about that.

482
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,611
You know, you're--
you're unbelievable.

483
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,012
- Just when I peg you as some--
- Storm Stevens! That's it!

484
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:38,032
Give me something.
I'm gonna write it right here.

485
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,979
- Before I forget. "Storm Stevens."
- Stevens.

486
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,714
What were we just
talking about? Just now?

487
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:47,646
- No?
- Mnh-mnh.

488
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,354
Come on, Lily.
Let's see if Beatrice is ready.

489
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,003
Hey, dad?

490
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,336
I know I'm way too old for this,

491
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,499
but do you think
I could get this doll?

492
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:02,546
Her name's Genevieve,

493
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:04,128
and she's developing
a vaccine for...

494
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:05,170
Yes, you can get the doll.

495
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,254
You can get
as many dolls as you want.

496
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,408
It's $200.

497
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,830
Or one is fine.

498
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:15,109
I know you're here.

499
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:18,717
Hello.

500
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,741
I have a bad feeling about this.

501
00:19:25,742 --> 00:19:27,210
What if one of your neighbors saw us?

502
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:28,708
Maybe we should just confess.

503
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,642
We will...

504
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,396
In 20 years.

505
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:32,089
Huh?

506
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,862
You heard grandpa.
There's a statute of limitations,

507
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,098
which is a good thing

508
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:38,416
because we still need
to take Lily down.

509
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,056
Nah, let her be the cute one.

510
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:41,389
We don't need that anymore.

511
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,984
We're bad boys now.

512
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:45,573
Yeah. I like that.

513
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:47,344
Bad boys.

514
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,343
Your mom!

515
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,275
Oh, my God.

516
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:58,022
Cam!

517
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,541
Um, this had a lid?

518
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,165
I'll see you guys later.
I'm going to Abby's.

519
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,236
Bye, honey. Have fun.

520
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:09,859
Have fun, you! With Abby!

521
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:12,962
We've confirmed Abby's
a real person and a female?

522
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,322
Yes, sweetie. We met her.

523
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,081
Honey, we can't treat
Haley differently

524
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:20,633
just because we both know
what we know about her.

525
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:22,831
I know. I just need time.

526
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:26,636
So Dylan told you?

527
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:29,661
Why didn't he tell me?
He and I used to share everything.

528
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,858
You're upset about a lot of things.

529
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:33,978
Okay, I won't obsess over it.

530
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:36,634
I just wanna ask you one thing.

531
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:39,060
How long have you known?

532
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:41,615
Three months.

533
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:45,143
So this giant thing
happened to our first born,

534
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,341
and you kept me in the dark
about it for three whole months?

535
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,774
I'm sorry. I just wasn't sure how you'd--
Okay.

536
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,133
Thank you.

537
00:20:54,701 --> 00:21:01,201
