1
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,623
Page 43, section 7.
We'd like some clarification.

2
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:01,221
Section 7 has to do with
the evaluative measures--

3
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,851
"Evaluative measures."

4
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,002
What we're talking about here
are performance standards,

5
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,505
plain and simple.

6
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:06,592
We can't have that.
We open that can of worms--

7
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:07,647
Gotta take it out, Frank.

8
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:08,925
The administration wants it in.

9
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:10,588
Then we're all wasting
our time.

10
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,026
Well, look, I can cut down
the frequency of testing,

11
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:13,625
but it's got to be
part of the overall--

12
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,095
That's the thin edge
of a two-ton wedge.

13
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:16,502
- No way, non-debatable.
- All right, hold on.

14
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:17,621
There's no harm
in hearing them out, right?

15
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,123
Frank, what do you have
in mind?

16
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:21,393
We adjust article 4.
Hand me article 4.

17
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:23,567
We go every three years
instead of two.

18
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,933
Frank, for us to even
consider testing--

19
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,043
Marty, we can't
negotiate time intervals here.

20
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,705
If-- I'm just saying if--

21
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:31,815
The frequency could never be
more than five years.

22
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,861
Look, five is a little high,
but if you can bend on that--

23
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,067
- Marty.
- Wait, wait, wait. And it's not just frequency.

24
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,889
Veteran teachers would have
to be exempt

25
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,446
if they have a proven record of
excellence with the students.

26
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:41,693
Well, excuse me for a moment.

27
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,132
Corey, will you take
the reins on this?

28
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:45,114
Right, so, article 4--
in terms of exceptions--

29
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:47,831
I've been saying for years
that we should tear it down.

30
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:51,284
It's vulgar, it's an
embarrassment to the county,

31
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,946
but time and time again
Frank Underwood

32
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,216
has fought to keep it standing.

33
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,782
If it weren't for him,

34
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,381
the Peachoid would've been
replaced ages ago.

35
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:01,833
And Jessica masters
would still be alive.

36
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,550
The congressman needs
to answer for this tragedy.

37
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,989
What exactly happened?

38
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,099
A 17-year-old girl

39
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,465
ran off the road texting
her boyfriend, and I quote,

40
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,310
"doesn't the Peachoid
look like a giant..."

41
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,484
- And then she lost control of the car.
- Jesus.

42
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:17,913
Orrin's making a big fuss
in the local press.

43
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:19,767
And he's pushing
the parents to sue Gaffney.

44
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,645
Sue Gaffney?
It's in his own jurisdiction.

45
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,307
It's worth throwing
Gaffney under the bus

46
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:25,426
to drag you into the mess.

47
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,992
He's after my seat again.

48
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,942
Has he learned
absolutely nothing?

49
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,660
It's a full-on smear
campaign, boss.

50
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,162
He's out to destroy you.

51
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,857
With this? It's a peach,
for Christ sake.

52
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,583
Let him make a fool
out of himself.

53
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,012
No, he will make a fool
out of you.

54
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:41,154
If he spins this right,
gets national coverage--

55
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,232
National coverage?
It's a joke.

56
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,351
And you will be the butt of it.

57
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:46,365
We can't afford that right now,

58
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:49,818
not when you're in the spotlight
with the education bill.

59
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:52,311
This thing has caused me
so much damn trouble.

60
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:55,093
- I know.
- So who should I call, parents?

61
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,819
Phone call's
not going to cut it.

62
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,609
- You need to go down there.
- Can it wait until Monday?

63
00:02:58,609 --> 00:02:59,952
We get on this thing right now,
we can contain it.

64
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:01,934
We wait until Monday,

65
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,108
then there's no way to know how much
this is going to blow up on us.

66
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,674
I can't go down to Gaffney.
The unions have just--

67
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:06,985
- We postpone--
- They're gonna be livid.

68
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,072
Marty's reasonable, okay?

69
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,542
He will explain to them.

70
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:10,981
And they're just supposed
to understand and accept

71
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,547
that I had to get up
from the negotiating table

72
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:14,433
because some two-bit county
administrator wants to--

73
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,096
I don't want
to interrupt you, sir,

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,343
but this is not just
about Orrin.

75
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,069
It's about the parents.

76
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,553
Now, you think
about the lawsuit.

77
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,846
What happens
if you have to testify?

78
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:28,052
Subpoenas, depositions.

79
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:29,778
You get dragged
into a court battle,

80
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,792
there is no education bill.

81
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,021
We can't ignore this.

82
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,305
I just hate
this small-ball crap.

83
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:13,100
It's called the what?
The peach what?

84
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,315
The Peachoid.

85
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,233
It's a giant water tower

86
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,352
in the shape of a peach.

87
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:20,101
Oh, wow.

88
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,499
I just googled it.
"The Peachoid."

89
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,257
She was 17, Linda.

90
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,111
You're right.
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,189
- I need another week.
- No, that's not going to work.

92
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,276
The president makes
his speech on Tuesday.

93
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,267
We've already announced.

94
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,930
Speeches can be rescheduled.

95
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,976
We have to show some progress
on education, Frank.

96
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,670
The first hundred days
is almost over.

97
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,173
If we push back the speech,

98
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:38,611
it'll look like we're
spinning our wheels.

99
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,794
All right,
I'll work something out.

100
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:41,233
Thank you, Linda.

101
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:46,316
Frank, these are the heads

102
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:48,585
of the two largest teachers
unions in the country.

103
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,791
- I understand.
- They flew here on a weekend.

104
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,709
Doug will lead the charge.
Congressman Phillips is well vetted--

105
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,787
They flew here to see you,
Frank.

106
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,778
You're managing this bill.

107
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:57,153
Put this in the other bag.

108
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,623
And I'll be in
constant communication.

109
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:00,126
Anything big comes up,
I'm a phone call away.

110
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,820
It's a 300-page document.

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,355
We need you in that room.

112
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:04,506
I would stay if I could,

113
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:05,976
but this is my home district.

114
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:07,862
Now, Marty,
cut me a little slack here.

115
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,333
We'll get it done.

116
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,835
You and I go way back.

117
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,169
Have I ever let you down?

118
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,384
No, you haven't.

119
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,909
And I don't intend
to start now.

120
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,212
Hello?

121
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,266
- Gillian?
- Claire.

122
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,025
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

123
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,335
Yeah-- I'm a little
under the weather.

124
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,742
I don't want to get you sick.

125
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,213
Well, if you're feeling ill,
we can--

126
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,491
No, no, no, I'm fine.
It's just a cold.

127
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,186
Well, thank you for coming in.

128
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,177
Of course.

129
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:03,327
Shall we talk in my office?

130
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,789
These are really cool
photographs.

131
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,908
Oh, thank you.

132
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:08,698
Adam Galloway
took the pictures.

133
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:09,753
Have you heard of him?

134
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,288
No.

135
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,238
I met him at the Whitney
biennial a couple years ago

136
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,389
and commissioned him
to do these.

137
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,489
He just had a big show at ps1.

138
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,088
I'm not up to date
on the art world.

139
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,686
That's all right.

140
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,700
We're not here to talk
about photography. Are we?

141
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,331
My office is over here.

142
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,386
You run into any trouble,
you call me.

143
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:26,409
I got it covered.

144
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,496
Gene Clancy know I'm coming?

145
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:28,455
Just spoke to him.

146
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,861
Get to it.

147
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,396
Your flight is booked,
leaves in 55 minutes.

148
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,547
Ed will be joining you.

149
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:33,857
Where's Steve?

150
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:35,775
He went home sick
about an hour ago, sir.

151
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,118
I'll be filling in.

152
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:38,493
What's your name again?
Edward what?

153
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:40,315
- Meacham.
- You drive fast, Meacham?

154
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:53,198
You wanted to talk to me?

155
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,756
Come on, Zoe.
This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of--

156
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,514
She knows who I am.

157
00:07:57,514 --> 00:08:00,071
Mrs. Tilden liked your profile
on Catherine Durant.

158
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:02,757
No, I didn't.
I loved it.

159
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,059
In depth, uncompromising.

160
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,168
Normally I don't read things
before they go to print,

161
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,863
but Cathy's a friend.

162
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,571
Tell me how you knew she'd be
nominated before she did?

163
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:13,690
You want my source?

164
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,384
Tom says you won't tell him.

165
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:16,439
I haven't told anyone.

166
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,814
Well, I own the paper.

167
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,148
And I'm very grateful
to be working here.

168
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:21,874
So you're not going to tell
me either.

169
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:24,176
Which do you want,
my source or my integrity?

170
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:29,418
Tom.

171
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:35,013
Move Zoe's piece to the front
page of Sunday's edition.

172
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,228
Let me think that over.

173
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:38,178
You think it over
as much as you want.

174
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:39,616
Then put it on the front page.

175
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:52,020
I've worked really hard to gain
a foothold with world well.

176
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,833
Six years ago it was just
me and a macbook.

177
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,496
I understand.

178
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,382
And I had to juggle two
temp jobs just to pay the rent.

179
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:00,716
It's your baby.
You don't want to let it go.

180
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,794
Well, I just--

181
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:06,502
And you wouldn't have to,
Gillian.

182
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:10,018
All I want is for you to grow
what you've already built.

183
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,329
I heard you fired
half your staff.

184
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes, I did.

185
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,750
That worries me.

186
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,650
I let them go to make room
for you.

187
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,111
I'm just not sure
we're the right match.

188
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:23,221
To be honest,
I'm a little uncomfortable

189
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,395
working with someone who's
commissioning famous photographers

190
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:29,072
when I can't even buy my
volunteers bus fair to the office.

191
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:30,862
Do you know
who Nicky Hemler is?

192
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,396
No.

193
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,954
Nicky owns one of the
biggest galleries in Chelsea.

194
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:38,278
She desperately wanted
to represent Adam Galloway.

195
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,589
I delivered on Adam,

196
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:40,996
and in return she contributes

197
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:43,553
almost 40 grand a year to CWI.

198
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:45,695
That money goes
to impact studies,

199
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,189
lobbying efforts, research.

200
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:51,194
World well could benefit from
that sort of money, Gillian,

201
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:54,678
and we can benefit
from your expertise.

202
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,250
Can I think about it?

203
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,255
Of course.

204
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:04,109
We don't have to jump
into anything.

205
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:06,347
I grew up here,
in the up country--

206
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:09,320
Bibles, barbecues,
and broken backs.

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,302
Everything gets
just a little bit thicker

208
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:12,708
this far south--

209
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,394
The air, the blood, even me.

210
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,600
I try to make it down here
at least once a month.

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,413
Every trip is a reminder
of how far I've come.

212
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,139
I hated Gaffney as a kid,

213
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,706
when I had nothing,

214
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,199
but now I've come
to appreciate it.

215
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,213
It's not as suffocating
as it once was,

216
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,939
except when I have to deal
with the sort of nonsense

217
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:31,410
that makes me want
to hang myself.

218
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,200
Turn left on route one--

219
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,639
Don't listen to her.
I know a better way.

220
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,854
Yes, sir.

221
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,132
We don't have the money, Frank.

222
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:39,498
The legal bills alone
will kill us.

223
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,320
How about a settlement?

224
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,558
I'll look at the numbers.

225
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,188
What's it look like to you?

226
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,595
Like a peach.

227
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,664
No, I mean what does it
really look like?

228
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,532
As mayor, I stick with a peach.

229
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,907
As a private citizen,

230
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:57,592
well, it looks like the sun
is shining

231
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:58,871
where it shouldn't be.

232
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,931
There's a
better way to handle this.

233
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:05,584
Really, Frank?
And what's that?

234
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,598
I'm not trying to start
an argument here.

235
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:09,676
You make it sound
like I'm in the wrong.

236
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,298
No, you know exactly
what you're doing, Orrin.

237
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,960
You're using
this poor girl's death

238
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,079
for your own political
advantage.

239
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,390
You're the one that fought me

240
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,413
when the peach farmers
bitched and moaned

241
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,659
about me tearing it down.

242
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,066
You're the one
that took their money.

243
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,856
- It's a water tower.
- It's ungodly.

244
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,295
- Orrin.
- This is cut and dry, Frank.

245
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:25,053
I fought to tear it down.

246
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,492
You fought to keep it up.

247
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:28,825
That girl's blood
is on your hands,

248
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:30,711
and I'm taking you
to task for it.

249
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:34,356
All right, I'll tell you what.

250
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:37,361
Dick Peters is going
to retire this term.

251
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,334
That means there's an open
race in the fourth district.

252
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,060
How about I help you
lock up that seat?

253
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,298
I'm not looking to make
a deal, Frank.

254
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,960
It's not a deal.

255
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,463
It's an opportunity.

256
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:50,852
I'll be just fine.

257
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,551
You may despise me, Orrin,

258
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,798
but the classy thing to do

259
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:57,821
would've been to invite us up

260
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:59,515
for some of that iced tea.

261
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,612
What are you doing?

262
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:41,777
You shouldn't run here.

263
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,504
It's disgraceful.

264
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,582
Have you no respect?

265
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,535
The criteria
is a starting point.

266
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:09,910
They're suggested,
not mandated.

267
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,668
We assemble
a council of experts

268
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,202
who will determine exactly--

269
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:15,376
Nowhere here does it say
who these experts are,

270
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,655
how they'll be chosen.

271
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,157
The president selects
the council.

272
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:19,436
What sort of oversight?

273
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:20,747
We'd like input
on the selection.

274
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:21,962
Doug, check with Linda.

275
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,560
Calling her now.

276
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,940
Okay, so now can we talk
about charter schools?

277
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,155
Charter schools are a no-go.

278
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,273
They have to be in there.

279
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:31,392
You keep them in, we walk.

280
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,479
The same goes for us.

281
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,301
Let's not jump to ultimatums.

282
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,955
Well, let's figure out a way
to reduce non-public spending.

283
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,681
All right, give me a few
minutes to think about that.

284
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,175
We can't move forward
without addressing this point.

285
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:44,180
- I understand, but this is the cornerstone of the bill.
- Let's talk it out.

286
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,417
Give me five minutes, Marty.
I'll call you right back.

287
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,016
No-- no--

288
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,614
If we consider
settlement as an option,

289
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:50,957
we need to be able
to pay for it.

290
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:52,555
But if we offer a settlement,

291
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:54,601
- aren't we saying--
- That's my point.

292
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,200
We're admitting that
the town's responsible

293
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,542
for this kid's death.

294
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,716
I say make the peach farmers
cough it up.

295
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,283
Oh, man, talk about
a shit storm.

296
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:02,753
Y'all mind catchin' me up?

297
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:04,544
Wayne and Travis
want to go to court.

298
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,142
I don't think
that's a good idea.

299
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:07,932
We can't be pouring
money into a settlement

300
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,403
when we can barely afford
to run the city.

301
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:11,161
What do you think, gene?

302
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:14,230
I think that we gotta worry about
the peach farmers association.

303
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,532
If there is a hint that
we're blaming the Peachoid,

304
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,938
they're going to raise
holy hell.

305
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,793
Who gives a crap.
They gotta suck it up.

306
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,199
Let him talk.

307
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:26,218
I'm just saying that we need
to keep them in mind.

308
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:27,912
She was breaking the law.
End of story.

309
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,223
You can't text while you drive.

310
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:30,822
Yeah, but all
a jury's going to see

311
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:33,187
is a beautiful 17-year-old
girl who's now dead.

312
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:34,946
No offense, Frank,
but you just got here.

313
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:36,736
We've been dealing with this
for the last week now.

314
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,238
And where's your solution?

315
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:39,581
What?

316
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,828
You think you know
better than us?

317
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,618
I'm just trying to be
realistic.

318
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,312
Frank, I know you want
to swoop down

319
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:45,655
and save the day,

320
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:47,349
but there's a principle
at stake here.

321
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,044
We allow ourselves
to be extorted

322
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,386
because of this teenager--

323
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:51,793
When Orrin gets a jury to weep
a river of snot

324
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:52,752
over this dead girl,

325
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:54,574
when Gaffney goes tits up

326
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:57,004
because you can't afford to pay a
seven-figure award in damages,

327
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,442
when you all get booted
out of office

328
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,817
and I lose to Chase,

329
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,863
then you can chew my ear off
about principles,

330
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:04,964
because we'll all have
nothing but time on our hands.

331
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:06,339
Until then,

332
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,394
you either contribute,

333
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:08,672
or you keep it shut, Travis.

334
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:09,983
Now, here's
what we're going to do.

335
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,453
Gene, how much
can we pull together

336
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,084
- for a settlement if we had to?
- About 150.

337
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,554
That'll work.

338
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:15,673
Jamie, get your boys down
to the hardware store

339
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:17,144
to build two billboards.

340
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:18,902
Put them out a mile out on
either side of the tower.

341
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:21,396
Have them read, "drive safely.
No texting behind the wheel."

342
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:22,898
- Got it.
- And get those up by tomorrow morning.

343
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:24,337
I'll issue the permits.

344
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,670
And let's stop lighting
the thing at night.

345
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,109
The peach farmers
aren't going to like that.

346
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,676
Well, how much does
the electric cost?

347
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,105
4,100 plus change per month.

348
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,704
About 50,000 a year.

349
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:37,124
Jesus, you could put
a kid through college on--

350
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:40,065
Let's use that money to start
a scholarship fund in her name.

351
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,696
Meantime, you tell
the association,

352
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,518
if they want it lit up,
they can pay for it.

353
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:45,084
I'll deliver
that message happily.

354
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,779
And do me up a budget
and a plan

355
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,898
for removing the sphincter.

356
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:48,952
The what?

357
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:50,775
He means the emergency valve.

358
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,117
That's interesting.

359
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,035
I always thought
of it as a clitoris.

360
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,666
But it's on bottom.

361
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,552
I believe the clitoris
is above the--

362
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,694
But if you imagine a woman
on her belly--

363
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,987
Enough. I want it done.

364
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:06,759
And, gene, give me everything
you've got on road regulations.

365
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,901
County statutes, not municipal.

366
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,563
And do you remember
that power line business

367
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:11,746
we pulled up
at the last election?

368
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:13,217
Sure do.

369
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,454
Let's make sure
we're rock solid on that.

370
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,875
Does this very expensive dinner

371
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,026
at least buy me an evening

372
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:21,912
of mind-blowing
sexual congress?

373
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,533
It was good, but I don't know
if it was that good.

374
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:25,620
Fellatio good?

375
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,201
Hand job maybe.
No promises.

376
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,151
Deal.

377
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:34,667
Okay, um, Peter, there's
something I need to tell you.

378
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,864
I have been thinking lately.

379
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,285
You know, um, it might be good
to work somewhere else.

380
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:42,883
So I did some interviews,

381
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:45,920
and the speaker's office
offered me deputy LD.

382
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,866
Peter.

383
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,017
Christina, um--

384
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:54,264
I just thought
it could be good, right,

385
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,958
if we're going to have
any future,

386
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,557
to stop this
boss-staffer thing

387
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:58,548
and be a real couple.

388
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,114
We are a real couple.

389
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:03,503
I mean not have to hide it
like we do at the office.

390
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:05,389
And it's a great opportunity.

391
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,755
The speaker?

392
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,760
Would you hate me
if I took the job?

393
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:18,272
Baby, I want what you want.

394
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:20,031
I'm not--
I won't fight you on this,

395
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,259
not if this is what
you feel you need to do.

396
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,538
- Really?
- Yeah.

397
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:26,137
And you're right.

398
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:27,191
This is a great opportunity.

399
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,982
When do you have
to tell them by?

400
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,283
There's no deadline.
I don't have to decide right away.

401
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,626
Okay, well, when you decide,

402
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,663
just, you know, help me find
a replacement.

403
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,070
You know, give me a heads-up.

404
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,508
Yeah, of course.

405
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,322
I haven't even decided
if I'm going to take it.

406
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,856
We don't have to talk this
through right now.

407
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,518
I just-- I just thought
I'd bring it up.

408
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:51,551
Should we get out of here?

409
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:52,638
Yes.

410
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:06,832
Let's go find the parents.

411
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,239
You hang back by the car.

412
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,189
It's a big crowd, sir.

413
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,354
If I get shot or stabbed

414
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,920
consoling two grieving parents,

415
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,542
I'm a hero from now
until the end of time.

416
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,364
Let's roll the dice.
Shall we?

417
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,515
Sir, I can't allow you
to go unescorted

418
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,017
into all those people.

419
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,940
Allow me?

420
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,699
Let's get one thing
straight, Meacham.

421
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:31,896
You are never to dictate
what I can and cannot do.

422
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:33,878
The only two words
I want to hear from you

423
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,060
when I ask you to do something

424
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,659
are "yes" and "sir."

425
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,225
Is that understood?

426
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:39,696
Yes, sir.

427
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:42,317
Good. Then we're gonna
get along just fine.

428
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:57,151
Mr. and Mrs. masters, I'm Frank
Underwood, your congressman.

429
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,284
I'm so sorry for your loss.

430
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:01,754
I cannot begin to fathom--

431
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:04,216
You're right. You can't.
You have no idea.

432
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:06,837
Forgive me.
I don't mean to intrude. I just--

433
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:08,819
- Well, you are intruding.
- Dean, please.

434
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:09,906
What?

435
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:11,057
It's his fault.
Isn't it?

436
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:13,998
Anyway, I just wanted
to express my condolences,

437
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:15,596
and say if there's anything
the two of you nee--

438
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,442
Dean, you don't want to be
talking to him.

439
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:20,072
We got legal action pending.

440
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:22,406
Look, I know what Mr. Chase
has been saying, and believe--

441
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:23,780
Nobody invited you.

442
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,155
Nobody wants your condolences

443
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:26,146
or your excuses.

444
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,096
Frank, please.

445
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,955
You shouldn't have to put up
with this right now.

446
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,001
I'm sorry.

447
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:41,043
Well, that went well.

448
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,766
Hang on a second.
Reverend.

449
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,003
Congressman.

450
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,666
Nice to see you again.

451
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,840
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

452
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,799
Terrible, isn't it?

453
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,365
It's just terrible.

454
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:57,187
This is so thoughtful
what you've organized here.

455
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:58,626
Least we can do.

456
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,247
Tell me, are the masters
in your congregation?

457
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,645
They are.
They come every Sunday.

458
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:05,947
Do you think they'll be
at the service tomorrow?

459
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,481
I'd be surprised
if they weren't.

460
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,262
I'm wondering.
Can you do me a favor?

461
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,660
Anything for you, Frank.

462
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,231
Oh, the blue toothbrush
is yours, right?

463
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:44,341
Uh, yeah, the blue one.

464
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,360
- Hey, Peter?
- Yeah?

465
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,926
Where do you keep
the light bulbs?

466
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:52,205
The lamp in the bedroom is out.

467
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,995
In the kitchen, under the sink.

468
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,577
Here's what I think.

469
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,048
I wish I could be bigger
than this, but I can't,

470
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,701
and I'm being selfish,

471
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,578
and I realize it's mostly
about me, but fuck it.

472
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:47,351
I have to say it. Please don't
take that other job, Christina.

473
00:21:53,872 --> 00:21:55,566
Anyway, that's how I feel.

474
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:58,380
I'm glad you told me.

475
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:07,555
Charters jeopardize
our ability to organize,

476
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:09,185
which is reason enough,

477
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:10,272
but the bigger issue is

478
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:11,327
that measuring their success--

479
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:12,829
Charters schools have operated

480
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:13,980
under the same evaluative
standards that every--

481
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,122
Apples and oranges.

482
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:19,223
No matter how you look at it, you can't
use the same standards to compare.

483
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:22,036
What, you're advocating a more
demanding criteria for charter schools

484
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,922
- than other schools--
- Our point is simple, Frank.

485
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:25,745
Several funds should only go

486
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:29,069
- to public union school districts
- Hold on a second.

487
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:31,659
Yeah, but we've already increased
non-charter funding by 10%.

488
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:33,865
The amount going to charter
schools is negligible.

489
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:36,390
It's the precedent, Frank,
not the number.

490
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,021
We're setting a lot
of precedents, Marty.

491
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,779
That's the nature of reform.

492
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:42,912
Well, some of them we can stomach.
Some of them we can't.

493
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:44,638
All right, let's not get
bogged down in abstractions.

494
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:45,917
Let's deal with specifics.

495
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:48,442
Corey, can you walk us
through it?

496
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:49,721
There's a three-prong approach

497
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,383
to determining
the amount of funding...

498
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,379
Miss me?

499
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:56,786
Maybe. A little.

500
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:58,608
What's it been, 15 hours?

501
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:02,636
Not even long enough
to notice you're gone.

502
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:04,267
Tell that to Marty Spinella.

503
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:05,513
How's it coming?

504
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:08,870
It's coming.
Slowly, painfully.

505
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,587
Hey, have we always had
tulips in the front yard,

506
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:13,506
or am I slowly going insane?

507
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:15,072
I planted them last fall.

508
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:16,479
You did not.

509
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,004
When I was down with you
for the campaign.

510
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:21,913
You've never gardened
a day in your life.

511
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:25,462
Not true. I have gardened
exactly one day in my life.

512
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:26,996
You were down in Spartanburg

513
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:28,627
doing some sort of fundraiser.

514
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:31,440
Gene's wife came over
with a bucket of bulbs,

515
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,221
and next thing you knew, I was
down on my knees in the dirt,

516
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:35,436
earthworms and all.

517
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,432
I can't even picture it.

518
00:23:39,432 --> 00:23:40,870
Neither can I, and I was there.

519
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,885
What else?

520
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:45,026
Distract me from giant
peaches and dead teenagers.

521
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,944
What else?

522
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,196
Oh, I went for a run today,

523
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,146
and the strangest...

524
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:58,038
I-- I don't know.

525
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,348
This woman...

526
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:04,527
That's interesting.

527
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,646
What is?

528
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:08,204
Oh, a text just came.
Zoe Barnes.

529
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,930
Who?

530
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,606
Oh, that reporter from
the herald you met one night.

531
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:14,917
Oh, her.
I remember.

532
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:16,483
Yeah, go if you need
to call her back.

533
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:17,890
No, she can wait.

534
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,488
I'm talking to my wife.

535
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,406
That's okay.
I'm going to bed soon anyway.

536
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:22,621
See you tomorrow?

537
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:23,868
I hope so.

538
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,243
Wish me luck.

539
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:31,636
Mm, bonsoir,
my petite Peachoid.

540
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,755
Disgusting.

541
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:34,865
- Good night.
- Good night.

542
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,943
Yeah, all right, that's fine, Corey.
Marty?

543
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,309
Frank, let me explain it to you.
Here's our problem.

544
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,119
Frank? Frank,
did we lose you?

545
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,877
Uh, yeah, I'm here, Marty.

546
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:54,690
Look, we can talk ourselves in
circles about charter schools,

547
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,193
but here's what I propose.

548
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:58,910
In your profile,
you go into great detail

549
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,468
about the sexism Durant faced
early on in her career.

550
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:02,587
That's right.

551
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,025
When she was first elected,

552
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:06,231
it was still an old boy's club
in the senate.

553
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,332
Journalism used to be that
way, too, not so long ago.

554
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:10,962
I feel really lucky.

555
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:14,319
I've had lots of trailblazers
come before me.

556
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,525
For instance, my colleague
Janine Skorsky

557
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:18,155
was the first woman
at the herald

558
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:19,754
to become chief political
correspondent,

559
00:26:19,754 --> 00:26:21,064
and that was
only five years ago.

560
00:26:21,064 --> 00:26:22,599
Has it been those trailblazers

561
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,229
who've allowed you
to rise so quickly?

562
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:26,211
You've moved up
from the Metro pages

563
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,161
to the front page
Sunday edition.

564
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,646
Uh, well, I don't know
that that would be possible

565
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:34,107
if Janine hadn't already
paved the way.

566
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:36,921
So does that mean that the herald
is not particularly progressive?

567
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:39,286
I think that they are.
Tom is very open minded.

568
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:41,109
He's the reason Janine
got promoted.

569
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,027
That's Tom Hammerschmidt,
the executive editor.

570
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:45,328
Yes, we actually call him
the hammer.

571
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:46,639
The hammer? Why?

572
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:47,790
Because he's tough.

573
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,229
How tough?

574
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:52,329
He's, uh--
Tom has very high standards.

575
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:53,512
I love him.

576
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,398
He's a-- he's a great mentor.

577
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:57,924
Um, it can be frustrating
at times.

578
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:02,144
Um, he makes you double
and triple-check things,

579
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:04,126
and you want to get
the news out

580
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:05,596
the moment you have it,

581
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:07,674
and he makes you rewrite
until it's perfect,

582
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:09,784
but that's what makes
the herald the herald.

583
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:12,502
Is that a workable model
in the Internet age?

584
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,812
Our readers think it is.

585
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:15,251
Well, you have
a declining readership.

586
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,009
But I don't lay that
at Tom's feet.

587
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,726
I think that that's the times
we live in, right?

588
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:22,508
Should newspapers adapt
to the times we live in?

589
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,353
It's not that the herald
refuses to adapt.

590
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,079
We have an online presence.

591
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,477
Is that maybe not adapting
fast enough?

592
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:31,842
I wouldn't argue
with that statement.

593
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:34,272
We could do more.

594
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,077
We've got a special guest
with us today.

595
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:13,146
He asked for the opportunity

596
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:17,174
to share a few words
with us this morning--

597
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:20,786
Our very own congressman,
Frank Underwood.

598
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,651
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

599
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:37,122
Thank you, reverend,

600
00:28:37,122 --> 00:28:39,264
and thanks to that choir
for that beautiful hymn.

601
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:43,388
I want to read,
this morning, from...

602
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:57,965
No.

603
00:28:57,965 --> 00:29:01,386
You know what no one
wants to talk about.

604
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:02,761
Hate.

605
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,647
I know all about hate.

606
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,949
It starts in your gut,

607
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:09,122
deep down here,

608
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,360
where it stirs and churns.

609
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,310
And then it rises.

610
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,283
Hate rises fast and volcanic.

611
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,489
It erupts hot on the breath.

612
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:20,695
Your eyes go wide with fire.

613
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,325
You clench your teeth so hard

614
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,851
you think they'll shatter.

615
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:29,199
I hate you, God. I hate you!

616
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:35,113
Oh, don't tell me you haven't
said those words before.

617
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:36,072
I know you have.

618
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:38,885
We all have,

619
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:44,224
if you've ever felt
so crushing a loss.

620
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:46,813
There are two parents
with us today

621
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:49,307
who know that pain,

622
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:53,207
the most terrible hurt of all--

623
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,084
Losing a child before her time.

624
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:58,354
If Dean and leanne
were to stand up right now

625
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:00,240
and scream those
awful words of hate,

626
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,615
could we blame them?

627
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:03,309
I couldn't.

628
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,994
At least their hatred
I can understand.

629
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:09,031
I can grasp it,

630
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:11,493
but God's wantonness,

631
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,922
his cruelty,

632
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:16,863
I can't even begin to--

633
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:23,992
My father dropped dead
of a heart attack

634
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:26,166
at the age of 43--
43 years old--

635
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,404
and when he died,
I looked up to God

636
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:29,907
and I said those words,

637
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:32,240
because my father was so young,

638
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,894
so full of life,
so full of dreams.

639
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:38,666
Why would God take him from us?

640
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,264
Truth be told,
I never really knew him

641
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,479
or what his dreams were.

642
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,557
He was quiet, timid,
almost invisible.

643
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:44,836
My mother didn't think
much of him.

644
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:46,274
My mother's mother hated him.

645
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:48,544
The man never scratched
the surface of life.

646
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,951
Maybe it's best he died
so young.

647
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:51,965
He wasn't doing much
but taking up space.

648
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:55,066
But that doesn't make for a very
powerful eulogy, now, does it?

649
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:58,518
I wept.
I screamed, "why, God?

650
00:30:58,518 --> 00:31:01,491
How can I not hate you

651
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:02,834
when you steal from me

652
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,816
the person I most love

653
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:07,086
and admire in this world?

654
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,169
I don't understand it,
and I hate you for it."

655
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:18,275
The Bible says

656
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:19,873
in proverbs,

657
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:23,933
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

658
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:28,121
and lean not on
your own understanding."

659
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:31,606
Lean not on your
own understanding.

660
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,227
God is telling us to trust him,

661
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,072
to love him despite
our own ignorance.

662
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,068
After all, what is faith

663
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,521
if it doesn't endure
when we are tested the most?

664
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,554
We will never understand

665
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,856
why God took Jessica

666
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,125
or my father or anyone.

667
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,971
And while God may not
give us any answers,

668
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:03,191
he has given us
the capacity for love.

669
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:06,164
Our job is to love him

670
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:09,328
without questioning his plan.

671
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,973
So I pray to you, dear Lord,

672
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,156
I pray to you

673
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:16,969
to help strengthen
our love for your

674
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:20,485
and to embrace Dean and leanne

675
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:24,290
with the warmth of your love
in return.

676
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:28,254
And I pray that you will
help us fend off hatred

677
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:32,633
so that we may all truly
trust in you

678
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,647
with all our hearts

679
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:38,867
and lean not on
our own understanding.

680
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:41,393
Amen.

681
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,927
Amen.

682
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,325
Your job is to report
the news, not be the news.

683
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:46,412
I was promoting the paper.

684
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:48,042
You were promoting Zoe Barnes.

685
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,120
Is this about how I said
we called you the hammer?

686
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,230
- Because if that upset you, I apologize.
- You're missing the point.

687
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,075
I don't want you talking about
anything that happens here,

688
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,281
not nicknames,
not how progressive we are,

689
00:32:57,281 --> 00:32:59,199
not whether we are adapting
to the Internet.

690
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,925
Any thoughts you have
about this paper,

691
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,684
you keep them to yourself,
or you bring them to me.

692
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:04,090
You don't get on national
television and sp--

693
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,593
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to--

694
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:07,799
Don't interrupt
when I'm talking.

695
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,877
You can speak to me
like an adult, Tom.

696
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,731
You don't have to lecture me
like a little girl.

697
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:15,088
You haven't earned the right
to be treated as an adult.

698
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:17,453
You think a few front-page
stories and some face time on TV

699
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,435
makes you the next Judy Miller?

700
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:20,522
You've got a long way to go.

701
00:33:20,522 --> 00:33:22,440
Don't be so arrogant.

702
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,756
Okay, so you think when a woman
asks to be treated with respect,

703
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,163
that's arrogance?

704
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:30,400
Are you accusing me of sexism?

705
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,031
Just making an observation.

706
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,725
No TV for a month.

707
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,164
- What?
- You heard me.

708
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:36,698
No interviews.

709
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,009
That's completely unfair.

710
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:40,119
You want to make it
no TV indefinitely?

711
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,850
We're done.
You can go now.

712
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:09,849
Hello?

713
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,695
Gillian, it's Claire Underwood.
Can I come up?

714
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:24,043
Have you seen a doctor?

715
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:25,994
Giardia's not so bad.

716
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:29,350
It'll pass in another
week or so.

717
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,565
You don't have
health insurance, do you?

718
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,611
Nope.

719
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:35,136
I'll make an appointment for you
to see my personal GP tomorrow.

720
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,799
Medicine doesn't
really do much.

721
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:38,717
You have to let it run
its course.

722
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:41,274
Well, we'll let it run its
course under proper supervision.

723
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:43,129
I won't take no
for an answer on this.

724
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,375
- Claire--
- I'll drag you to the hospital myself

725
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,686
if I have to.

726
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:48,052
You're going to the doctor.
No argument.

727
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,728
Thanks.

728
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,126
They're about to walk.
They won't listen to a word I say.

729
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,724
- Both unions?
- Yeah.

730
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:56,971
Put Marty on the phone.

731
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:57,994
Hang on.

732
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:59,401
Marty.

733
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:02,597
Yeah. It's Frank?

734
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,242
This isn't working, Frank.

735
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,799
Marty, you have got to keep
them in that room.

736
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,238
They lost their patience.

737
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:12,092
They're upset you're not
in the room, Frank.

738
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:14,202
- I'll be back this afternoon.
- No, it's too late.

739
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:18,709
Look, tell them I'll come down on
subsidies for charter schools.

740
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:20,116
Even so,

741
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,651
they're angry about
the performance standards.

742
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:22,961
We're not even halfway
through this thing.

743
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:24,720
There's so much in it
that they--

744
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,510
Tell them that I'll roll over
on performance standards,

745
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,971
five-year intervals.

746
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:31,401
It should be you
telling them that, Frank,

747
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:33,671
you here, at this table.

748
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:35,653
I know that.
I'm doing the best I can,

749
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,475
but I can't be
in two places at once.

750
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,809
Now, look.
I promise you,

751
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,247
if you keep them in that room,

752
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:42,846
we will get through this hump

753
00:35:42,846 --> 00:35:45,691
as soon as I get back.

754
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:48,760
Marty, you are their lobbyist.
You know what's best for them.

755
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,030
Save them from themselves.

756
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,099
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

757
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:58,510
Stamper.

758
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,780
Do not let Spinella
out of your sight

759
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,273
and lock the goddamn doors
if you have to.

760
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:05,032
You got it.

761
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,356
Here we go.

762
00:36:08,356 --> 00:36:10,051
I know you're a busy man.
I hope we're not keeping you.

763
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,969
No, no, no, I've got all
the time in the world.

764
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,430
This is ham
and these are turkey.

765
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,540
And there's some potato salad.

766
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,650
Shall we have a prayer?

767
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,993
Gracious loving God...

768
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,527
Have you had this before?

769
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,245
This is the third time.
I'm used to it by now.

770
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:26,578
Well, I'm not used to it,
but it beats malaria.

771
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,081
You've had malaria.

772
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:29,168
In Zimbabwe.

773
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,574
That took me out for a month.

774
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:33,803
You make a lot of sacrifices.

775
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:35,562
I don't see it as a sacrifice.

776
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:37,735
You turned down
a six-figure salary at Google

777
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:39,717
to start your own non-profit.

778
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:42,115
People don't get malaria
in Palo Alto.

779
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:46,591
You do your research.

780
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:50,970
When it's someone I care about.

781
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,934
Claire, I turned down that job
because I would've hated myself.

782
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,916
It was a lot of money,
but for what?

783
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:58,739
So they could fulfill
their diversity quota

784
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:01,392
with an Asian girl
peddling a Stanford degree?

785
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:02,575
Not just any Asian girl.

786
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:05,004
A valedictorian.

787
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:08,041
Let me offer you
what Google couldn't.

788
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,352
I know what it is

789
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,229
to be capable and beautiful
and ambitious

790
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:14,723
and be on people like Sergey
and Larry's checklist

791
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:16,417
of things that look good
to have on a shelf.

792
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,235
I'm not trying
to acquisition you.

793
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:25,720
What I see in you
is a woman I admire,

794
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,095
which doesn't happen often.

795
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:30,323
I want to enable you.

796
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:32,242
I want to clear the way for you

797
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:34,671
so that you can achieve
what you want to achieve,

798
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,046
on your own terms.

799
00:37:38,284 --> 00:37:41,289
Thanks for the tea.

800
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:44,613
And I will send a car to pick
you up for the doctor tomorrow.

801
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:46,020
When you're back on your feet,

802
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,098
do you think maybe we can work
something out?

803
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,195
Yes, I think we could.

804
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,766
That's her at junior prom.

805
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:02,931
Beautiful.

806
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:09,197
Here she is
in her letter jacket.

807
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:13,257
She made varsity as a freshman.

808
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,111
I remember the day
she found out.

809
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:16,646
Coach called.

810
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:19,299
Jessie starts jumping
up and down.

811
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,697
"Mom, guess what?"

812
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,995
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:30,168
Don't be.
It's fine.

814
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:32,502
Why are we doing this?

815
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:34,740
Honestly, what's to be gained

816
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,841
in dredging up all this stuff?

817
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,439
Remembering the good things
helps sometimes--

818
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,773
Not when it puts my wife
in tears.

819
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:44,458
I appreciate what you said
at the church,

820
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,833
but it doesn't do us any good.

821
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,272
Neither does this.

822
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:48,710
Well, what can I do to help?

823
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,277
You can't do anything.

824
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:51,875
She's gone.

825
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,848
You're right.
I can't change that,

826
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:56,574
but I can make sure

827
00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:59,579
the city offers you
a sizable settlement.

828
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,178
You mean buy us off?

829
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:04,854
No, I mean help you avoiding
years of court battles.

830
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,580
Jessica was going
to go to Furman.

831
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,658
Is that right?
On a volleyball scholarship?

832
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:10,449
Yes, a full ride.

833
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,878
Well, I spoke to the president
of the university this morning,

834
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,605
and we'd like to create
a new scholarship

835
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:15,691
in your daughter's name.

836
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:16,938
If you'd like that.

837
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,089
It's entirely up to you.

838
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,039
But, most importantly,

839
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,117
we have to make sure
that this never happens again.

840
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:25,090
We've got safety billboards
going up,

841
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,497
we're going to stop lighting
the tower at night,

842
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,127
and we're putting
the guard rails in.

843
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:31,516
Should've done all that
before she ran off the road.

844
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:34,649
Would you like me to resign,
Mr. masters?

845
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,718
Just say the word,
and it's done.

846
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:40,051
If it will bring you
any satisfaction.

847
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:51,816
I asked the reverend once,

848
00:39:51,816 --> 00:39:53,478
"What are we supposed to do

849
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:56,643
in the face
of so much senseless pain?"

850
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:58,529
And he said to me,

851
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,447
"what else can we do

852
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,781
but take what seems meaningless

853
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:06,553
and try to make something
meaningful from it."

854
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:08,216
He's right.

855
00:40:08,216 --> 00:40:11,636
That's how God works--

856
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,554
Through us.

857
00:40:13,554 --> 00:40:16,463
Will you let me work for you?

858
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,647
What you have to understand
about my people

859
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:26,438
is that they are
a noble people.

860
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:29,059
Humility is their form
of pride.

861
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,160
It is their strength,
it is their weakness,

862
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,316
and if you can humble
yourself before them,

863
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,777
they will do anything you ask.

864
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:44,276
Tell us more
about the scholarship.

865
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:10,714
- Hey.
- Hey.

866
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:11,993
What are you doing?

867
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:13,847
- Working.
- On what?

868
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,564
The, uh, BRAC commission stuff.

869
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:18,514
I'm behind on it.

870
00:41:18,514 --> 00:41:20,592
It's Sunday.

871
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:22,542
So?

872
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:25,036
You don't usually work
on the weekend.

873
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,634
Well, now I do.

874
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:29,160
There's, uh, coffee in the kitchen.
You want some?

875
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,795
Peter...

876
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,727
Peter.

877
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:40,956
If I decide to stay,

878
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,290
it's because it's what I want,
not what you want.

879
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,396
I understand.

880
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,118
Which draft are you reading
of the written testimony?

881
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:56,397
The one you sent on Thursday.

882
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,635
I actually changed it
on Friday.

883
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:00,073
Can I show you?

884
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:05,540
Yeah, I was thinking that we
could start with job numbers

885
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,362
and then go to
economic multipliers

886
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:08,417
instead of
the other way around.

887
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:10,015
What do you think?

888
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:12,317
Let's see what it looks like.

889
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:31,274
Picture this--

890
00:42:31,274 --> 00:42:32,553
A 17-year-old girl

891
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:34,120
traveling at 60 miles an hour

892
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,261
spins out of control
in no traffic.

893
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,476
She hits a guard rail.

894
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,682
But if she's wearing
her seatbelt,

895
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,961
which she was,

896
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,240
and her car doesn't roll
over three times

897
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,413
down a 20-foot ditch,
which it did,

898
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,331
then that young woman
is still alive.

899
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,049
But you know what?

900
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,894
The county administrator
didn't build those guard rails,

901
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:53,492
so now she's dead.

902
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:55,123
We looked up the statute.

903
00:42:55,123 --> 00:42:58,096
Guard rails are under
county supervision.

904
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:02,092
Are you trying to turn this
around on me?

905
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:03,115
That's not all, Orrin.

906
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:04,649
Your easement.

907
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,855
You see, every couple of years
the piedmont electric,

908
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:08,997
they apply to bring power lines
through Gaffney.

909
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:10,659
The route comes
right through your lot.

910
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,130
Now, gene and I
always fight them off,

911
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,464
but this year, if they
were to reapply, hmm...

912
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:15,838
Eminent domain.

913
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:17,277
It would be such a shame
to have to tear down

914
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:18,300
this beautiful home.

915
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,282
Fuck you, Frank.

916
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:22,104
You can't just roll up
on my property

917
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:23,287
and act like you own it.

918
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,288
Oh, but I can.

919
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:31,599
We just did.

920
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:37,257
I've won this district
11 times.

921
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:40,198
Do you think that's just luck
and a firm handshake?

922
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:43,012
But I'll tell you what.
I'm not a vindictive person.

923
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:45,569
I don't like for anybody
to lose if everybody can win,

924
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,807
so I'm going to help you
get elected in the fourth.

925
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:49,725
You get to keep your house.
I keep the fifth.

926
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:52,378
We put the Peachoid behind us,
and everybody's happy.

927
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:54,264
What do you say?

928
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,575
Well, that's all right.
You think about it.

929
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:57,525
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing.

930
00:43:57,525 --> 00:44:00,402
Oh, and I'm looking forward to
having you in congress, Orrin.

931
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:03,375
It's always good to have friends
on the other side of the aisle.

932
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:25,561
I've been offered a spot
on Nightline.

933
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:27,639
You want my advice?

934
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,494
I don't want it.
I need it.

935
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:31,060
Close your eyes.

936
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:34,417
Okay.

937
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:37,646
It's 11:25.
Nightline is about to come on.

938
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:39,692
Millions of people
are watching.

939
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:41,098
Where are you, home?

940
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,984
No.

941
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:44,327
At the studio?

942
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:45,734
Yes.

943
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:47,236
And what do you see?

944
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,090
I see lights.

945
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,305
I see a camera.

946
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:52,383
And that little red dot
goes on.

947
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:54,621
Tell me what you hear?

948
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,219
I hear my voice.

949
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:59,224
And those millions of people,
what do they hear?

950
00:44:59,224 --> 00:45:01,078
My voice.

951
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,677
And what do they see?

952
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:03,732
My face.

953
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:06,321
So you don't need my advice.

954
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:10,125
Hammerschmidt's going to freak.

955
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,660
You don't want to work anywhere

956
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,706
you're not willing to get
fired from, Zoe.

957
00:45:13,706 --> 00:45:17,222
Treading water's the same as
drowning for people like you and me.

958
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:18,533
Good luck.
I'll be watching.

959
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:20,164
- Hey, wait.
- Yes?

960
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,282
When do you get back?

961
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:24,543
When I get back, you'll know.

962
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,042
Hello, Nancy.

963
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:32,344
Welcome back, sir.
Linda Vasquez called for you.

964
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:33,846
Tell her I'll call her in a
couple hours with an update.

965
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:35,381
- Very well.
- Sir?

966
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:38,577
Unless you need anything,
Kyle has you covered.

967
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,240
No, go home.

968
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,614
You did well this weekend.

969
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,053
Thank you, sir.

970
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:45,770
Oh, and before you go home,
can you do me a favor?

971
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,985
Would you swing by my house

972
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:48,679
and make sure these get
to Claire?

973
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,182
Yes, sir.

974
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:52,452
And thank you, sir,
for being so patient.

975
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:00,540
Okay.
