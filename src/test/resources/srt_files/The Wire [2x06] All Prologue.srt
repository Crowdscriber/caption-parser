1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Ain't working out for y'all, huh?

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,380
-Mars is the god of war, right?
-Planet, too.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,680
I know it's a planet.
But the clue is "Greek god of war."

4
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,980
Ares.

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,580
Greeks called him Ares.
Same dude, different name, that's all.

6
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,180
Ares fits. Thanks.

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,780
It's all good.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,480
See, back in middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,580
That stuff was deep. Truly.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,480
You're up.

11
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,479
State calls Omar Little, Your Honor.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,380
Faggot.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,879
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...

14
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,680
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,979
I surely do.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,279
-State your name for the record.
-Omar Devon Little.

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,580
-Mr. Little, how old are you?
-About 29, thereabout.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,879
-And where do you live?
-No place in particular, ma'am.

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,580
-You're homeless?
-In the wind, so to speak.

20
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,579
-And what is your occupation?
-Occupation?

21
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,380
What exactly do you do for a living,
Mr. Little?

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,479
I rip and run.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,779
-You....
-I robs drug dealers.

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,980
And exactly how long has this been
your occupation, Mr. Little?

25
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,380
I don't know exactly.

26
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,880
I venture to say
maybe about eight or nine years.

27
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,379
Mr. Little, how does a man rob drug dealers
for eight or nine years...

28
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,480
and live to tell about it?

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,580
Day at a time, I suppose.

30
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,179
What do we know?

31
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,679
On Sobotka, very little.
He seems to live within his means.

32
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,379
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck, modest savings.

33
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,579
-Credit history is okay.
-There's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.

34
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,779
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.

35
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,379
-Or maybe he's hiding it.
-The union is also a little threadbare.

36
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,179
They paid the taxes on union hall
almost a year late...

37
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,679
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.

38
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,179
Looking at their books--

39
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,779
-You subpoenaed their books?
-You don't need to.

40
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,879
IBS books are open
to the Justice Department...

41
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:36,179
under the terms
of a federal racketeering case...

42
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,179
-that came out of New York five years ago.
-We called Washington.

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,779
They sent us a copy of everything
the Baltimore locals have filed.

44
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,579
The books show
that there's less than a 100 checkers...

45
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,879
still paying dues to 15-14.

46
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,779
And that's down from about 300 in the '70s.
They're hurting.

47
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,579
So where's all this money
Valchek is talking about?

48
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:58,379
The IBS hired Bruce DiBiago
to lobby Annapolis this session.

49
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,979
And through individual officers
and union members...

50
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,879
they've paid about $70,000
to various PACs...

51
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,379
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.

52
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,079
They show any of that on their books?

53
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,979
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance reports.

54
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,878
That's just what was in the names
of the union officers we cross-referenced.

55
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,579
-So, where's the cash coming from?
-Drugs?

56
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:22,379
So far, DNRs
on the union hall phones don't show much.

57
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,779
Union business and personal calls,
but no beepers...

58
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,278
and not much in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.

59
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,878
What's with those hand-to-hands?
Anything connect?

60
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,079
We're buying from a lot of white boys.

61
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,879
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.

62
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,279
-But any port connections feel random.
-The money comes from somewhere.

63
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,779
Maybe it's what the checkers do.

64
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,479
I mean...

65
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,779
they monitor what comes in
and out of the port.

66
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,979
-That's what they do, that's their value.
-They're bringing the shit in?

67
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,679
Or they're letting it happen.

68
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,779
Like that can full of dead girls.
They kept that out of the computer.

69
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:06,879
Which is why we're gonna quietly do
some work on that side of things.

70
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,179
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.

71
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,079
No problem.

72
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:16,679
If they're coming into Baltimore,
who's working them?

73
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:20,378
Are they club dancing, whoring?
We need to plug into that circuit.

74
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,379
As for the rest of you...

75
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,378
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail
and with the DNRs...

76
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,579
Iooking for connections to the union money.

77
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,778
Herc and Carver...

78
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:31,779
you guys keep working the drug corners
near the port.

79
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,179
Officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland
are assigned to Homicide...

80
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,178
but for the time being they'll be with us...

81
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:41,179
running the port database, looking
for any pattern involving contraband.

82
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:42,578
Questions?

83
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:55,679
Excuse me.

84
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:58,279
-I'm Thomas.
-Beadie.

85
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:01,878
Would you like to go to Royal Farms,
maybe get a cup of coffee?

86
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:04,979
Right.

87
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,879
Yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?

88
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:15,778
Listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties
to make some soup with...

89
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,479
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.

90
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,579
You were at the opposite end
of the parking lot...

91
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,278
-when the assailant drew his gun?
-Thereabout.

92
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,478
Do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant
anywhere in the courtroom today?

93
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,078
Yo, what up, Bird?

94
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:37,878
For the record, you are identifying
the defendant, Marquis Hilton.

95
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,879
It's just Bird to me.

96
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:44,178
And Mr. Little, you had seen him
many times before, had you not?

97
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:48,678
-Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut--
-Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?

98
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,078
Quite a witness, ain't he?

99
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:03,878
Word on the street is, Omar ain't
nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.

100
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:07,578
Street said little cocksucker
was over on the East Side...

101
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,078
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.

102
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,378
That's the word on the street, huh?

103
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,678
Trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
We're in a court of law.

104
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,678
Your Honor--

105
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,378
Objection is noted and preserved
for the record, Mr. Levy. Move on.

106
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,278
Thank you, Your Honor.

107
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:31,778
Jurors will disregard that last comment
from the witness in which he explained...

108
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,678
where he had last
encountered the defendant.

109
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:36,878
Yes or no, Mr. Little?

110
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:39,778
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?

111
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:43,378
I knew the man,
but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.

112
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:47,378
So you would have no trouble
recognizing him from a moderate distance...

113
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,978
say 20, 25 yards in daylight?

114
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,079
No problem.

115
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,178
Mr. Little, do you recognize...

116
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:57,878
this particular weapon?

117
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:59,978
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the .380.

118
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:02,778
-You've seen it before?
-Bird always flashing that thing.

119
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:05,878
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.

120
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,378
-And on the day in question?
-It was in Bird's hand.

121
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:14,578
-When he shot at Mr. Gant?
-Yes, ma'am.

122
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:18,978
-Bird covet them shiny little pistols.
-Objection, Your Honor.

123
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:22,778
And the boy too trifling to throw it off
even after a daytime murder.

124
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:26,878
You're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!

125
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:30,377
The defendant will regain control
or he will be forcibly restrained...

126
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:32,178
and I will clear the court.

127
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,178
The witness's last answer is to be stricken
and disregarded by the jury.

128
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:42,078
Niko.

129
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:46,878
Eton is my friend.

130
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,378
It's good to have friends meet, no?

131
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:52,778
Eton, huh?

132
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:55,578
That's from the Greek, meaning what?

133
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,778
No Greek. Israeli.

134
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:00,378
Yeah?

135
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,978
'Cause you look Greek, no offense.

136
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,977
Either way, I mean....

137
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:17,378
-You have the chemicals?
-I can get them, as much as you want.

138
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:20,178
When?

139
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:24,178
I was gonna do something this week.
There's been a problem, though.

140
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:27,578
-What problem?
-My cousin Ziggy.

141
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,677
He got into a beef
with these East Baltimore guys.

142
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,678
Drug dealer by the name of Cheese
took his car, burned it...

143
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:37,778
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.

144
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:43,678
Yeah, malaka, right.
Zig fucked up the package.

145
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,677
So, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.

146
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,078
Then you pay your debt.

147
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,678
It was $2,700, right?

148
00:10:56,977 --> 00:11:00,878
Now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5,400, you believe that?

149
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:02,877
First he takes the car...

150
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:05,377
and now he's jacking us around
on the money.

151
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:08,678
-You want, we kill him.
-No.

152
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,577
-That ain't it either, no.
-Why no?

153
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:17,778
'Cause first of all, Zig fucked it up.
He owes $2,700.

154
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,877
And second, you kill Cheese...

155
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:23,577
and we're gonna have a fight
with his people, right?

156
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:24,778
A year down the road...

157
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:27,477
some nigger sees my cousin
coming out the burger shop...

158
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:31,777
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue,
no questions, puts a cap in his ass.

159
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,677
He's smart, huh? Niko, smart.

160
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:44,278
We don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy, make things right.

161
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,177
I was hoping maybe you do.

162
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,177
Mr. Little...

163
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,777
can I ask why you came forward
in this case?

164
00:11:57,277 --> 00:12:01,477
-I told the police what I know.
-Were you offered anything in exchange?

165
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:05,677
-Like what?
-Were you arrested?

166
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,077
Were you going to be charged with a crime,
and by testifying...

167
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,677
did the police agree to drop those charges?

168
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,377
No, man, it ain't even about that.

169
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,677
How many times have you been arrested
as an adult, Mr. Little?

170
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:20,477
Shoot, I done lost count.

171
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:23,378
Enough, though, not to take it personal.

172
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,277
Possession of a handgun...

173
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,278
possessing a concealed weapon,
assault by pointing...

174
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:33,477
robbery, deadly weapon,
possession of a handgun again...

175
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,978
followed by violation of parole
on weapon charges...

176
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,877
followed by
one count of attempted murder...

177
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,677
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.

178
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,177
That wasn't no attempt murder.

179
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,277
What was it, Mr. Little?

180
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:51,477
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hind parts, that all.

181
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:55,277
Fixed it so he couldn't sit right.

182
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:59,677
Why'd you shoot Mike-Mike
in his hind parts?

183
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:04,178
-Let's say we had a disagreement.
-A disagreement over?

184
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:07,477
Mike-Mike thought he should keep
that cocaine he was slinging...

185
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,477
and the money
he was making from slinging it.

186
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:12,277
I thought otherwise.

187
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,277
So you rob drug dealers?
This is what you do.

188
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:20,377
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:23,477
You walk the streets of Baltimore
with a gun...

190
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,977
taking what you want, when you want it...

191
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:28,877
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.

192
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,677
This is who you are.

193
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:35,077
Why should we believe
your testimony then?

194
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:38,777
-Why believe anything you say?
-That's up to y'all, really.

195
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,577
You say you aren't here
testifying against the defendant...

196
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,876
-because of any deal you made with police.
-True that.

197
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:48,877
That you are here
because you want to tell the truth...

198
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:52,377
about what happened to Mr. Gant
in that housing project parking lot.

199
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:53,476
Yup.

200
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:56,677
When in fact you are exactly
the kind of person who would...

201
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:58,477
if you felt you needed to...

202
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,877
shoot a man down
on a housing project parking lot...

203
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:03,477
and then lie to the police about it,
would you not?

204
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,477
Look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.

205
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:09,777
You are amoral, are you not?

206
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:14,477
You are feeding off the violence
and the despair of the drug trade.

207
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:18,976
You are stealing from those who themselves
are stealing the lifeblood from our city.

208
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:22,177
-You are a parasite who leeches off...
-Just like you, man.

209
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,876
...the culture of drugs.... Excuse me? What?

210
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:29,477
I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase.

211
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:33,777
It's all in the game, though, right?

212
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,277
And with the economy, what it is...

213
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:42,377
you can really consider coming in
10% or 20% below asking...

214
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:43,676
and still feel competitive.

215
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,976
-Even on the Hamburg Street address?
-Absolutely.

216
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:49,777
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501 .

217
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:52,577
Although I didn't like the color
of the whirlpool tub...

218
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,576
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?

219
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,376
-That's cosmetic.
-If they want to make the sale...

220
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,177
they should have some amount
of couth to change the color.

221
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:02,677
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.

222
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:06,476
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just keep looking.

223
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:08,476
We shouldn't settle for just anything.

224
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:12,476
And you think that there will be
some new open houses this Sunday?

225
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:15,377
-I'm sorry, what were you saying?
-We're gonna keep looking.

226
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:18,877
-You'll take us around again on Sunday?
-Definitely.

227
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:22,477
-Okay then, see you Sunday, early.
-Great.

228
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:25,877
Thank you.

229
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:29,376
I'll see you then.

230
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,776
You are a child, you know that?

231
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,377
-What do you want?
-Dinner and a movie.

232
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:41,977
-Come on, stop it.
-Why not?

233
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,076
This isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.

234
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,576
Dinner and a movie,
then I'll walk you to the door...

235
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:49,976
and you tell me to go fuck myself
like you should've done way back when.

236
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:52,676
How about I tell you to fuck yourself
here and now?

237
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:54,777
Then you can save that money
for someone else.

238
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:58,177
Come on, Elena.
Come on, I signed all your damn papers.

239
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,376
Give me another shot.

240
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:05,276
Friday. You pay for the sitter.

241
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:21,176
-So how that D.C. game, man?
-Same as it ever was.

242
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:24,377
Chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.

243
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,576
Call it Drama City nowadays.

244
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:30,576
Otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.

245
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:34,276
Same soup, just reheated,
know what I'm saying?

246
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:38,576
If you need anything to make this happen,
you gotta get it yourself.

247
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:40,476
I can't go through my people.

248
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,876
If Stringer Bell reaching
all the way past Baltimore...

249
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,476
with this kind of work...

250
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:48,576
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?

251
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:53,676
Don't worry, no mistakes.
Nothing that might come back on you.

252
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:56,677
-You sure of your people?
-My cousin up in there...

253
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,876
-he on it.
-All right.

254
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,876
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.

255
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:05,376
Ain't heard it live, then.

256
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:08,776
I know a club in Oxon Hill
that would wreck y'all.

257
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:09,876
All right.

258
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,076
If I'm around the way.

259
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:17,576
So, how you doing?

260
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,976
-Nursing school right now.
-Good, that's good.

261
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,276
Lester's been pushing me, you know.

262
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,876
He does it, kind of without you knowing
that he's doing it.

263
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:29,776
Yeah, I know what you mean.

264
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:32,876
He said that you would be by today
to talk about the clubs.

265
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,976
About some girls, Russian.

266
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:38,676
-Or from that part of the world.
-The ones on the circuit, yeah.

267
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,776
You should try this place called Nightshift
down off of Holabird.

268
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,476
I have a friend who works there.

269
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:47,176
She worked with a bunch of Russian girls
last year for about three months.

270
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,076
-Think she'll talk to me?
-Only if I ask her.

271
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,176
Thank you, Detective, nothing further.

272
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:56,676
-Anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
-No, Your Honor.

273
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,476
Let's take 10 minutes
and then run the closing arguments.

274
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,676
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow...

275
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,376
with jury instructions.

276
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,676
-How'd Omar do?
-You didn't see it?

277
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,176
Not the cross. That bad?

278
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:09,475
-You have no problem.
-No?

279
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:13,476
To start, he wants you to pay $5,400.
Then we talk.

280
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:17,775
-He says, "No, you pay just the $2,700."
-Yeah, I saw how you talked.

281
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,976
But you will not pay the $2,700.

282
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,076
Instead you will get the money
for the car that burned.

283
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:26,475
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

284
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:32,175
Him we don't know.
But the one he calls boss, him we know.

285
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,875
You gonna sit there and pout?

286
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:49,275
I know you don't think I'm going down
to that club just to look at pussy.

287
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,376
I know you know me better than that.

288
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:57,975
-I ain't even looking.
-Everybody's looking.

289
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,875
-Most of them women are dykes.
-Cheryl, it's police work.

290
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,475
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?

291
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:07,776
Kima's out on the street
doing her detective thing?

292
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,375
All that hospital shit, all that rehab...

293
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,775
-all them promises--
-We talked about this.

294
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,375
No, you talked.

295
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:21,875
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

296
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,275
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

297
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,476
-Where you going?
-With you.

298
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,275
Excuse me?

299
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,875
Who knows? I might see a little something
I happen to like.

300
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,776
So all of that's on the table?

301
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,476
There's money in the transport budget
for the grain pier.

302
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:51,076
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging...

303
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,375
on the main shipping channel.

304
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,075
-But not the canal?
-Nope, not the canal.

305
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:58,475
For that we'll have to fight
a little longer and dig a little deeper.

306
00:20:58,576 --> 00:20:59,775
So says Frank.

307
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,075
I gotta say, for my money,
we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.

308
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:06,475
Be that as it may,
we spent the money and took our best shot.

309
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,375
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions...

310
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,775
paid for a consultant's report...

311
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,076
to argue against
some of the environmental stuff.

312
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:15,175
It cost, but we're starting to see it.

313
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:19,175
-So where y'all find the cash?
-I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.

314
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,075
Seriously.

315
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:23,675
We got some help
from the national office on this.

316
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:27,075
There've been some timely donations
from a few friends here and there.

317
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,075
The point is, at the very least...

318
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:31,776
we're likely to see
the grain pier back up by next year...

319
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,575
which means a couple hundred
more ships a year, at least.

320
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:36,675
-If.
-And it's a big fucking "if."

321
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,875
-If that Polack motherfucker--
-Hey.

322
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,875
No offense.

323
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:44,975
If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up
waterfront condominiums first, right?

324
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:48,875
Nat's right. The back door threat
is that Andy Kraw or some other developer...

325
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,375
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.

326
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,475
Those guys are looking at that location, too.

327
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:56,775
So we need everybody making phone calls.

328
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,575
Let your legislators know
that we're watching on this.

329
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:03,475
The money only goes so far.
Now we gotta make some noise, right?

330
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,075
-Make some noise.
-Okay, enough talk.

331
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:08,275
Some of youse got ships
to work in the morning.

332
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,475
-The rest of youse need to be drunk.
-I'll drink to that.

333
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:23,775
Help from the national office, huh?
Timely donations from friends?

334
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,275
Watch your ass, Frank.

335
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,475
-This is it?
-Yeah.

336
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:35,675
Just picked it up
from the port administrator.

337
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:37,175
So what am I looking at?

338
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,575
The Atlantic Light on the day
the can with the women was offloaded.

339
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:42,575
The boxes are containers.

340
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,675
This one's being offloaded
and set on a chassis.

341
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,275
Here's the time: 10:31 hours.

342
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,275
See? It was moved to Lane L,
Stack 6, Row 3...

343
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:56,475
by an RTG at 10:37 hours.

344
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,075
-RTG?
-Rubber tire gantry.

345
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:03,075
So from ship to stack took six minutes.

346
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:06,074
That's the way it's supposed to work, but....

347
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:08,475
"AQQZ," as in zebra...

348
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:11,374
"396594."

349
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,175
Check digit, seven.

350
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,975
That's the container number
of the can with the women in it.

351
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:19,075
See that?
It was never entered by the checker.

352
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:22,175
So as far as the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.

353
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:26,275
Sobotka says that that can happen
when the radio waves get knocked down...

354
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:29,174
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.

355
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:33,075
It came off Atlantic Light at 1 1 :26 hours.

356
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:36,575
And it doesn't show up
in the computer again until 15:1 2 hours.

357
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,775
I find it two hours after that.

358
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:43,574
So for nearly four hours,
it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.

359
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:46,775
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.

360
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:49,574
When they get found,
they get put back into the computer.

361
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,174
You believe him?

362
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,674
No, not this can.

363
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,274
So what's the plan?

364
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:58,675
The database on this computer...

365
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:01,175
has records for every ship
that berthed at Patapsco...

366
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,875
over the last two years.

367
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,574
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans...

368
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:07,175
might've disappeared like that.

369
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:10,575
-See if there's a pattern.
-How many ships we talking about?

370
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:13,775
Hundreds.

371
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,074
It ain't like I got a prayer of bringing
this case in otherwise.

372
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:27,174
-That's what I'm talking about.
-All right.

373
00:24:28,474 --> 00:24:30,675
-What the hell is your problem?
-Nothing.

374
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:33,674
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick
or something.

375
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,775
I just can't look at them.

376
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,275
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?

377
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:42,775
Yeah, sure. But not with women.

378
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:46,175
You're sure you're not gonna have
a problem for talking to us?

379
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:50,074
I don't give a shit.
You friends with Shardene, all that matters.

380
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:53,474
Besides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners straight-up...

381
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,274
I was here before them ho's got here...

382
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,674
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.

383
00:24:57,774 --> 00:25:02,175
-So how long ago did they came through?
-Six months back was the last batch.

384
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:04,974
Russians, I think,
but shit all sound the same...

385
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:07,174
when you can't understand
a damn word, right?

386
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,974
-Who brought them?
-Club owner pays extra for them.

387
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,774
There was a woman...

388
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,874
she was like the madam
who handled the cash.

389
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:17,575
-But I ain't get a name.
-She Russian, too?

390
00:25:17,674 --> 00:25:20,374
She was something. She had an accent.

391
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:24,074
So it's like, one day all Baltimore girls
are at the bar...

392
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,674
and the next, what?

393
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,274
-All foreign girls?
-That about right.

394
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,674
They was making so much money
with them new girls...

395
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:32,775
they let some of their regular dancers go.

396
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,475
Not me, 'cause I mean, I got clientele here.

397
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:38,674
-But some of the others....
-Where'd the girls stay?

398
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:42,474
Where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
They don't know shit.

399
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,974
They ain't got no family.

400
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:46,874
The men they got handling them
are always with them.

401
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:49,474
Right there to take them
from whatever motel they use...

402
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:50,874
to the club and back.

403
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:53,774
Right there when they need to get food,
or go to the Rite Aid.

404
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:57,475
Right outside the motel door
when they up in them rooms with the johns.

405
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,374
Anyone try to get away?

406
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:02,974
Shit, I seen one of them get lit up
with one of them stun guns...

407
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,074
for going down the block
to get some dinner.

408
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:08,374
They barely let them girls
go to the bathroom by themselves.

409
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:11,074
And if they see one getting
too close to the johns...

410
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:13,774
that's when they move the whole crew
to another town.

411
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:16,274
Keep it so they don't get no help.

412
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:19,374
You up after the next song.

413
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:22,574
Push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.

414
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:26,974
You need anything else, you can call me.
Help if I can.

415
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:29,474
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.

416
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,974
She must be doing good,
to be out for so long.

417
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:35,874
She must've landed a rich one, right?

418
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,974
-You her girl?
-Yeah.

419
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:43,474
I wouldn't let mine come in here either
without me.

420
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:46,374
These bitches in here are no joke.

421
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:04,973
Thirteen of them.

422
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:09,974
They had about a third of that space
hidden behind the fake wall.

423
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:14,273
A few flashlights, some junk food,
some water.

424
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,574
A portable toilet they had to share.

425
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:21,674
And not enough air.

426
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:42,874
I'm going to schedule sentencing
for the third week of next month.

427
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:44,474
Anything else today?

428
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,473
Your Honor, my client,
having preserved the necessary grounds...

429
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:51,474
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state unequivocally...

430
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,373
that regardless of this jury's verdict...

431
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:57,173
he is the victim of wholesale perjury
on the part of the state's key witness.

432
00:28:57,274 --> 00:28:59,174
We ask that an appeal bond be set...

433
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,773
so that he can participate fully
in this investigation.

434
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,373
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?

435
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:06,774
-Mr. Levy, get a grip on yourself.
-Your Honor--

436
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,673
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing...

437
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:11,373
but as far as I'm concerned...

438
00:29:11,473 --> 00:29:14,073
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.

439
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:18,173
Mr. Hilton has been found guilty
of killing a state's witness...

440
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,873
who testified in this very courtroom.

441
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:24,073
He did so in cold blood, and for pay.

442
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:27,473
Unless the pre-sentence report
indicates that he is, in fact...

443
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:29,073
the Messiah come again...

444
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:32,174
he will very likely be sentenced
to life, no parole...

445
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:34,873
by a Baltimore judge who,
for once in his life...

446
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,973
gets to leave his office feeling
that his job actually matters.

447
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:40,873
Mr. Hilton, are you the second coming
of our savior?

448
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:43,973
-Excuse me?
-Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?

449
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:47,973
See you at sentencing.

450
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:57,373
Was it good for you, too?

451
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:02,473
Mr. Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free
one time only...

452
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:05,073
on anything up to aggravated assault.

453
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,873
-Why thank you, ma'am.
-No, thank you.

454
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:10,973
A rare pleasure.

455
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,973
Time for the ceremonial eyefuck.

456
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:19,573
Come see me down the Cut,
you punk-ass snitch.

457
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:22,173
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksucking throat!

458
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:23,573
You think on it, Bird.

459
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:25,673
You think on Brandon
while you doing that time?

460
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:30,473
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
Fuck that, I'll do you like a dog.

461
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,673
You really see him shoot the man?

462
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:35,873
You really asking?

463
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:44,773
But it's fucked because the man
got to where he needed to be...

464
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:47,173
and she wasn't even worth it.

465
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:50,773
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch,
anyway, you know?

466
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:55,673
And he did all that for her and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.

467
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,373
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts in American lives.

468
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:03,473
-Do you believe that?
-Man, shit, we locked up.

469
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:06,273
We best not believe that, right?

470
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:09,673
He's saying that the past is always with us.

471
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,473
And where we come from,
what we go through...

472
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:15,873
how we go through it, all that shit matters.

473
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:20,573
-I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
-Go ahead.

474
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:27,073
Like at the end of the book, you know?
Boats and tides and all.

475
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:30,673
It's like you can change up, right?

476
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:34,373
You can say you're somebody new,
you can give yourself a whole new story...

477
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,873
but what came first is who you really are...

478
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:41,273
and what happened before
is what really happened.

479
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:44,872
And it don't matter
that some fool say he different...

480
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,273
'cause the only thing
that can make you different...

481
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,673
is what you really do
or what you really go through.

482
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:53,173
Like, you know,
like all them books in his library.

483
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:56,872
Now, he fronting with all them books...

484
00:31:57,773 --> 00:32:01,872
but if we pull one down off the shelf,
ain't none of the pages ever been opened.

485
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:05,773
He got all them books,
and he ain't read near one of them.

486
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:11,972
Gatsby, he was who he was,
and he did what he did...

487
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,473
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story...

488
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:21,073
that shit caught up to him.

489
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,173
I think, anyway.

490
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:42,873
Sorry, homey.

491
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:50,172
You done with your trial?

492
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:54,372
-All right then, let's take her on out.
-Tomorrow.

493
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,072
-I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
-You got something else to do today?

494
00:32:58,172 --> 00:32:59,973
Yeah, last bit of business.

495
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:04,373
-This is your business.
-This is retirement.

496
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:07,172
And after today, I'm retired.

497
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,872
Talk when I say, not before.

498
00:33:29,672 --> 00:33:33,373
-Tovarich.
-Serge, my nigger.

499
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,473
-You're losing weight.
-Shit.

500
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,173
You are down to nothing.

501
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:42,172
In this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.

502
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:45,472
-I worry for you, buddy.
-How your peoples, dog?

503
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:47,472
Same, good.

504
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:49,972
You talk to the man
about that other thing, right?

505
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:52,572
Because I can get behind
that business in a big way.

506
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:56,472
-We will talk later. Now, another business.
-Right.

507
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:59,872
This the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?

508
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,873
Wasn't mine, it was my cousin's.
It wasn't all that raggedy.

509
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,573
Sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin....

510
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,873
But family cannot be helped.

511
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:16,372
Who you telling?

512
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,772
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws
fucking all my shit up all the time.

513
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:25,173
And it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass
and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.

514
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,972
For real, I'm living life
with some burdensome niggers.

515
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:31,772
So what the fuck?

516
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:39,573
You ain't pay my boy Cheese,
and Cheese ain't paying me, right?

517
00:34:39,672 --> 00:34:42,172
I ain't talking
about all the money in the world.

518
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:45,372
But it ain't like Cheese be in a position
out on that corner...

519
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:48,372
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?

520
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:50,572
The man cut you some slack...

521
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,072
and soon every fucking-up white boy
be on his titty.

522
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:56,072
We wanna pay what we owe.
The $2,700 anyway.

523
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:59,372
-We're gonna have it soon enough.
-Your man doubled it, though.

524
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,072
He also burned the car.

525
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:04,772
Now the blue book
on that Camaro was $5,100.

526
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:07,172
Now, let me understand.

527
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,672
You gonna come up in here,
having fucked up a package...

528
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:13,872
asking me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on...

529
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:16,172
to pay you out $2,400.

530
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:19,472
He gets to keep the Camaro.

531
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:24,172
Just how good a friend
is this motherfucker to y'all?

532
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:31,072
The Cheese ain't gonna be happy
having to pay me back...

533
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:34,672
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.

534
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:38,472
Just so he don't come back on my cousin.

535
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,772
Anyway, thanks for being straight on this.

536
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:47,172
Fool, if it wasn't for Serge here...

537
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,772
you and your cuz both would
be cadaverous motherfuckers.

538
00:35:56,772 --> 00:36:00,672
I went through INS, customs,
even the State Department. Nothing.

539
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:05,772
It's time, Jimmy.
You did what you could, right?

540
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:17,772
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.

541
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:21,671
This one to the anatomy board
in the morning.

542
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:24,372
Jane Doe on the paperwork.

543
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,371
-Ain't right, Doc.
-What the fuck ever is?

544
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,272
You leave it to Avon...

545
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:40,872
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.

546
00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:42,672
No doubt, knowing Avon.

547
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,672
It's all good, D.

548
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,872
Just show up,
and say what Levy tells you to.

549
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:55,671
What the hell is wrong with you?

550
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,471
I'm asking you.

551
00:36:57,572 --> 00:37:01,172
Those hot shots, that was Avon.

552
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,972
I want you home, D.

553
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:10,372
You asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.

554
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:13,872
-This is mine, right here, right now.
-Boy, you ain't listening to me.

555
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,572
-I am telling you--
-Ma.

556
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:19,072
You remember we used
to lived on Linden Avenue?

557
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:20,672
Remember that house?

558
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:25,072
I was about 6 or 7 years old.

559
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:27,472
I was playing on the porch.

560
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:32,572
Them twins came by,
started picking on me, messing with me.

561
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,471
Remember that?

562
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:39,971
I'm banging on the door,
trying to get inside...

563
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:42,672
and you standing right there
to open the door...

564
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,171
except you ain't letting me inside.

565
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:48,872
You told me to go back out there
and fight them...

566
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:50,472
whether I lose or not.

567
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:52,671
Remember?

568
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:58,271
-They beat the shit out of you.
-Yeah.

569
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:01,171
Then you say to me:

570
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:05,071
"Boy, I might have brung you
into this world...

571
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:08,471
"but you the one
who gonna have to live in it."

572
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,971
Ma, I'm still here.

573
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:16,471
Me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.

574
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:21,671
You tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette...

575
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:24,572
all of them, to leave me be.

576
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:04,271
All right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.

577
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:07,471
-Come on, we're almost through 2002.
-No.

578
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:13,171
-Tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
-Yeah.

579
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:27,571
They look thirsty, a round on me.

580
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,371
Yo, Mr. Sobotka,
friend to the working man...

581
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,871
master of the game.

582
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,971
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?

583
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,971
-Been here long?
-Since my hair was brown.

584
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:40,471
I was telling Chess about Benny.

585
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,670
-Benny with the harelip?
-That's a good one.

586
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:45,771
See, Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.

587
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:48,670
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.

588
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:50,370
Not until he came in here.

589
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,271
That's when Little Nose told Benny
to call the union lawyer.

590
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:54,671
-Paul Sevel?
-Yeah.

591
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,171
God rest his soul.

592
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:57,571
So Benny calls Paul.

593
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:00,671
"Me been hit with a 'ackerel," Benny says.

594
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:02,171
"A mackerel?

595
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,171
"You working frozen foods again?"
Paul says.

596
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,771
"No, 'oddamn it, a 'ackerel."

597
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:10,671
Then he slams the phone down.

598
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,571
"'Other'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.

599
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:15,771
"Says he can't undertan' me."

600
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:18,871
Little Nose says, "Why he wanna do that?

601
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:21,671
"Benny don't talk
no fucking better in person."

602
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,971
So that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?

603
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:30,571
Yeah, you're straight.

604
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,670
That there's $2,400 for Princess.

605
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,971
She was worth more than that.

606
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:40,271
Dolo. One for the bar, hon.

607
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,671
You win the lotto?

608
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:46,071
If my old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?

609
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:53,471
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.

610
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,771
-We ain't gonna live forever, right?
-Next round's on me.

611
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,471
-Not for me, I'm gonna head out.
-Come on, Frank, belly up.

612
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:08,470
Take a rain check.

613
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:18,271
-And that one as well, huh?
-Makes 22.

614
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:21,971
All on the Talco line.
All with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.

615
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,770
-We're on it then.
-You gonna call Bunk?

616
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:30,171
Detective Moreland is indisposed.

617
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,571
-You with Daniels and them?
-No.

618
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:44,070
We just parked the computer down there.
We're orphaned, man.

619
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,170
-Orphaned?
-Yeah.

620
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,070
Rawls is talking like...

621
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,370
if I don't come home with 14 clearances...

622
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,171
I can't come home at all. Lester, too.

623
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:02,671
Where's the love, Jimmy?

624
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,070
Where is the motherfucking love?

625
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,470
-So what's up with you, man?
-Nothing.

626
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,270
Nothing, huh?

627
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:36,571
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird is my last piece of old business.

628
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,071
I got nothing new.

629
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,070
I was trying for an ID on this one...

630
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,470
and I can't even tell you why.

631
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,170
Just a way to pretend
I was still a murder police, I guess.

632
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,570
Who gives a fuck, right?

633
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,470
Elena and I are gonna try again.

634
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,970
Shit.

635
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:12,070
I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.

636
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:19,770
Come on, man, let's go home.

637
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,270
All right, man.

638
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,170
Over here, shitbird.

639
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,270
What the hell happened to you?

640
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,070
-I fell down.
-How many times?

641
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,570
Let's walk.

642
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,570
-Pop, I'm--
-Walk with me, Zig.

643
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,970
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back online by next spring.

644
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,970
-More ships, more work.
-Yeah, great.

645
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,870
-What the fuck are you about?
-What?

646
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,870
Is that my son lighting
hundred dollar bills like an asshole...

647
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,969
in a bar full of working stiffs?

648
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,170
-What the fuck is that?
-Just a smile.

649
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:29,170
-A smile?
-Yep, a smile.

650
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,070
You wanna hit me again, Pop,
go ahead, take a shot.

651
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,970
Where you come by that kind of cash?
You know you ain't had the days.

652
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,570
Definitely not.

653
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,470
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

654
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,970
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

655
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:49,470
Seniority prevails, Zig.

656
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,870
-It's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
-I know, I ain't complaining.

657
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,970
I wish I could give you more.
You don't think I want to throw you more?

658
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,870
-You throw plenty.
-It's just, Christ, Zig.

659
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:04,070
If I'd listened to your mother,
she's the one always talking about--

660
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,170
It's cool.

661
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,370
You should do community college
like your brother.

662
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,370
Pop, don't.

663
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,370
You wanna know what I remember?

664
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,469
Do you?

665
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,170
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry...

666
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:24,370
and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop...

667
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,570
all sitting around the kitchen table,
talking shit about this gang and that gang...

668
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,970
who's better with the break-bulk...

669
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,470
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.

670
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,269
-Always a fucking argument, right?
-Four Polacks, six opinions.

671
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:47,169
I remember when youse all
went down to picket them scabs...

672
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,970
at Covington Piers...

673
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,369
how Jackie Taylor got run over
by a police car...

674
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,170
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.

675
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,670
I remember when the Paceco
fell during that windstorm.

676
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:01,770
You remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.

677
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,570
Yeah, what else you remember?

678
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,469
Everything.

679
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,070
So tell me, Mr. "Back ln The Day"...

680
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:27,869
what are we doing down here
with the wharf rats...

681
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:30,369
in the middle of the goddamn night?

682
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:32,069
Beats the fuck outta me.

683
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,969
Every one of those Post-its
is a can that disappears...

684
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:44,269
when it's being offloaded.

685
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,669
The yellow slips, they show up again...

686
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:49,069
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered...

687
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:51,170
so you figure those are honest mistakes.

688
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,969
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.

689
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:55,769
They stay out of the computer for good.

690
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:58,169
And the pink one,
like the can full of dead girls...

691
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:00,469
they're all from
the same shipping line, Talco...

692
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,469
and on all of them, the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa...

693
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:06,470
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.

694
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:08,869
You went at him already, right?

695
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:12,269
We grand juried his ass,
but that motherfucker didn't blink.

696
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,969
You wanna hit the head?
Get yourself right, Detective?

697
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:28,469
No, I'm good.

698
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:35,769
The point is, we have a pattern here.

699
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:39,169
What they're doing eliminates
almost all of the paper trail.

700
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:41,969
As long as they can get
a truck past the outbound lanes...

701
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:45,569
and there's a dozen ways to do that,
the only thing they leave behind...

702
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,469
is a little telltale in the computer.

703
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:50,969
A box comes off the ship,
flashes for a few moments and blip...

704
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,569
then it's gone.

705
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:59,869
Our target
is supposed to be Sobotka, right?

706
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:01,669
I mean, on paper anyway.

707
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:05,569
What you're telling me is
that it's better than a fair bet...

708
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:08,269
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.

709
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:18,669
Maybe we can fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.

710
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:22,269
And put my ass in the air with
14 open homicides that might never clear?

711
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,969
-The bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
-I wouldn't shine either.

712
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,369
I'm using what we do with this detail
to get a major case squad going.

713
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:33,869
I come up out of here with all those
open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.

714
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:37,669
-So what's the next move on this?
-We clone the computer...

715
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:41,569
and start watching
what's happening on the docks in real time.

716
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:56,669
Shit.

717
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:05,668
Yo, D.

718
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,369
Just wine, huh?

719
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:35,468
I'm not drinking much anymore.

720
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:37,469
No Jameson's?

721
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:41,468
Maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.

722
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:43,968
Okay, I deserve that one, too...

723
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,168
even though I'm not doing
much of that anymore either.

724
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:49,668
-Anything else?
-I'm sorry.

725
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:52,969
I don't know where it still comes from.
It's been a year.

726
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:56,369
-You deserve to be angry.
-What's the point, though?

727
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,768
How's work?

728
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,869
What, so we talk about
everything in my life...

729
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,469
that pisses you off?

730
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:10,469
-Drinking, women, the work?
-Just trying to make conversation.

731
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:15,569
-I retired.
-Excuse me?

732
00:50:18,469 --> 00:50:20,669
It's boats, not bodies.

733
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,868
On a good day,
I catch crabs and count seagulls.

734
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:28,168
-That's not you.
-It wasn't me.

735
00:50:29,668 --> 00:50:32,669
It wasn't me not to drink,
or dog around either.

736
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:37,268
A lot of things weren't me.

737
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:43,368
I want another chance.

738
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:51,369
How about a fuck for the road instead?

739
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:30,569
-How you doing?
-Okay.

740
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:33,268
You unload this,
you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.

741
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:36,368
Make it look like it was a hijack, all right?

742
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:38,169
Niko.

743
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:43,568
If you want, I will pay you straight...

744
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:47,768
or Eton can pay in heroin.

745
00:51:49,468 --> 00:51:50,768
Wholesale.

746
00:51:54,468 --> 00:51:58,268
Turn it around,
you can make $60,000 or $70,000.

747
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:04,068
Nicky, he's offering, like,
three, four times the value.

748
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:08,068
I'm out on this.

749
00:52:08,768 --> 00:52:12,268
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike...

750
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:14,468
we can make $30,000 or $35,000.

751
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:18,468
Nicky, come on, man.

752
00:52:26,468 --> 00:52:28,568
Half in cash, half in dope.

753
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:41,967
Nicky, I can turn that package around,
no problem.

754
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,068
-No, Zig, I got it.
-Nicky, you don't know--

755
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:46,968
You hear me? I said I fucking got this one.

756
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:49,068
Stay at home and watch cartoons.

757
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:52,167
Let me handle this shit
for the both of us, all right?

758
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:02,668
You fucking walking home or what?

759
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:15,167
Hey, girl.

760
00:53:15,268 --> 00:53:17,568
-What do we do with the day?
-Me?

761
00:53:18,668 --> 00:53:22,368
-I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
-Okay, great.

762
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:26,468
They're gonna be coming back here.
Michael has piano this afternoon.

763
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:28,767
No problem, we'll do something after that.

764
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:31,668
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.

765
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:37,267
I don't want the boys to know
that you were here.

766
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:39,568
It's gonna get them hoping.

767
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:44,268
So you need to leave.

768
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:01,967
Look at this sorry shit.

769
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:05,968
Motherfuckers not appreciate
nothing that comes to them free.

770
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:10,968
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.

771
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:45,768
-D, right?
-Yeah.

772
00:54:45,868 --> 00:54:47,167
You can't be in here now, man.

773
00:54:47,268 --> 00:54:49,767
Yo, man, y'all get any final calls
this week, yo?

774
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:52,767
-Yeah, we got some.
-I didn't see any out there.

775
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:54,068
All right, give me a minute.

776
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:58,468
Let me finish up right here real quick,
and I'll go and get one for you.

777
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:34,967
-Hey, y'all.
-What's up?

778
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,867
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.

779
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:39,967
-You trying to curb me, yo?
-Come on.

780
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,567
What's in there?
