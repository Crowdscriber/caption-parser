Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,997 --> 00:00:05,763
If a bullet comes my way
tomorrow, it will not be an accident,

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,453
and I must be quick to duck.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:11,681
<i>Do you know how Grant
defeated Lee?</i>

5
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:15,045
<i>He had more men.
And he was willing to let them die.</i>

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,049
It was butchery, not strategy,
which won the war.

7
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,832
You used to be an alcoholic, correct?

8
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:22,428
- Not used to be.
- Do you miss it?

9
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:25,029
<i>You both disappointed me.
Greatly.</i>

10
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,387
<i>Raymond, are you still there?</i>

11
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:30,168
That's the first time
he's ever hung up on me...

12
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,111
Oh, I feel for you.

13
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:34,022
<i>I just got off the phone with
a guy named Seth Grayson.</i>

14
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,665
Did Dr. Marbury perform an abortion
for Claire Underwood?

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,588
- He kept a journal.
- That journal is my version of a résumé.

16
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,509
This is gonna work.

17
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:42,164
I don't have a choice,
but you still do.

18
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,464
<i>You wanted to see inside one, right?</i>

19
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:47,433
<i>This needs to be clean, Doug.
One fall of the axe.</i>

20
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,986
- On the ground.
- On the ground.

21
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:52,968
And the butchery begins.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,074

00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,633
<i>We've got an energy crisis, Frank.
And what the White House needs...</i>

24
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,011
The president chose
to remain tough on China.

25
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,530
- <i> No, you forced him to.</i>
- You chose Feng.

26
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,811
<i>You're the one who</i>
<i>put me in a room with him.</i>

27
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,650
<i>The cook can't blame</i>
<i>his ingredients</i>

28
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,250
<i>if he doesn't like</i>
<i>how they taste together.</i>

29
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,450
If samarium prices don't reduce,

30
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:32,530
the market will have no choice
but to compensate.

31
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,649
That's bad for everyone
who owns an air conditioner.

32
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,450
You should speak to the
president himself.

33
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,770
Well, the president hasn't placed
much value on my advice lately.

34
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,410
I'm in the same boat
as you, Raymond.

35
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,890
<i>Yeah, difference being</i>
<i>you've got an office</i>

36
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,089
three doors down from the Oval.

37
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,330
Let's work together,
for Christ sakes.

38
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,930
I'm willing to put Spotsylvania
behind us if you are.

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,130
- <i> I want nothing more.</i>
- Then you'll talk to him?

40
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,624
- Look, I'm late for a meeting, Raymond.
- <i> Yes or no, Frank?</i>

41
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,610
- I can't guarantee he'll listen.
- That's not a yes.

42
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,569
<i>But it's better than a no.</i>

43
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,851
Any pugilist worth his salt
knows when someone's on the ropes,

44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,011
that's when you throw a combination
to the gut and a left hook to the jaw.

45

46
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,090
Samarium is the last thing
they'll let go of.

47
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,930
As long as our energy prices
rise, they have the leverage.

48
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,530
Why don't we offer nothing?
Move toward attrition?

49
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,690
If China doesn't show
at the refunding auction,

50
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,090
- long-term interest rates will spike.
- - And in a week,

51
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,410
yields on our ten-year notes
will pierce the seven percent threshold.

52
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:07,890
That could happen. But if we
go soft now, that will happen.

53
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,090
- You mean go on the offensive.
- We should at least consider it.

54
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,530
The Chinese don't like carrots?
Let's see how they like the stick.

55
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,050
What might that look like?

56
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,130
We could raise inspection
rates on foodstuffs.

57
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,770
- Hold them in ports till they rot.
- How much of a raise?

58
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,490
Twenty percent
if we wanna draw blood.

59
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,170
Bury the move with increased
spot checks all the way around.

60
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,491
These sort of tactics don't
solve the immediate problem.

61
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,210
People are paying triple
the standard rate for electric.

62
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,530
We'll hit a fivefold increase
by August.

63
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:32,170
What if you, Mr. President,
by executive order,

64
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,569
purchase samarium
through a third party?

65
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,811
Cut the Chinese out, force them to
either raise their prices worldwide

66
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,811
or lower them
to keep direct flow with us.

67
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,330
We stockpile samarium
for defense purposes, of course,

68
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,411
and quietly sell what we don't
need to our friends in nuclear energy.

69
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:49,530
- At a discount.
- - A subsidy for nuclear power?

70
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,890
The richest of the rich?
How's that gonna play?

71
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,689
Dealing with a national crisis. We can't
get sidetracked with public opinion.

72
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,810
It would show China
we're willing to wait this out.

73
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,570
Do we have the resources?

74
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,289
I'd have to run the numbers,
anticipate fluctuations,

75
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:05,249
- consider different models...
- Your best guess.

76
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,450
We do, for a moderate stockpile.

77
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,210
All right. Draw up a request
from the Defense Department.

78
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,170
- Yes, sir.
- Linda, draft the executive order.

79
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,330
And, Cathy, make sure we have a third-party
conduit to purchase the samarium.

80
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,410
We'll go through India.

81
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,090
That won't fly well
with Pakistan.

82
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,129
I'll alert them in advance.

83
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,129
As long as they're in the loop,
we'll be all right.

84
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:31,209
- Not that we owe them any favors.
- All right, let's get to work.

85
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,571
<i>Come on, Betsy.
Three additional counts under Section E?</i>

86
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,210
Three is low. It reflects a narrow
interpretation of criminal intent.

87
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,689
- Your client broke into a data center.
- And what's the offer?

88
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,690
- I'm not doing a plea.
- Will you let me handle this?

89
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,130
They don't want a trial.
The questions I'll be raising,

90
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,850
loud and clear, in open court...

91
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,369
- Lucas, please.
- We have our own questions, Mr. Goodwin.

92
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,250
For example, what were
you doing with these?

93
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,610
- I didn't take these.
- They were in your apartment.

94
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,050
Underwood took them.

95
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,930
Do you really expect a jury
to believe that?

96
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,729
- He did. They were having an affair.
- Are they gonna see them

97
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,170
for what they are? Proof of
your obsession with Ms. Barnes

98
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,371
and the ludicrous conspiracy you have
concocted to explain her death.

99
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,050
Tell us what you're offering.

100
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,810
Client pleads to one
count under Section E

101
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,289
for breaking into a data center.
One count for fraud

102
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,329
<i>for stealing a password</i>
<i>from the</i> Herald.

103
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,890
Ten years under Section E,
ten years for fraud, served concurrently.

104
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,930
Eligible for parole in seven.

105
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,329
I'd like to speak
to my client alone.

106
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,209
Cameras and recording equipment
off, please.

107
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,650
I'll introduce the president.
Then he'll introduce you.

108
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,970
If he's there, we can't
mention the military.

109
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,329
- Just the endemic problem nationwide.
- Of course. I understand.

110
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,570
Good. So we should go
through these speeches

111
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,570
and make sure
that there's nothing...

112
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,210
- Hi, Mrs. Underwood.
- Hello, Christina.

113
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,490
- Mrs. Walker, you asked for me?
- We need to confirm

114
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,370
whether the president's
gonna make it to New Orleans.

115
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,970
- This Friday, correct?
- Yes.

116
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,849
But I know he had a cabinet meeting
this morning, so I imagine...

117
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,650
- I'll talk to Linda right away.
- Thanks.

118
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,930
I know you want Garrett there,
but with this energy crisis...

119
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,730
- No. It's not that.
- What?

120
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,529
- I shouldn't say anything.
- Well, now you have to tell me.

121
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,890
I've just never been
very fond of her. Christina.

122
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,330
- Why not?
- Peter Russo.

123
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,130
I just have a thing about women
who sleep with their bosses.

124
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,689
Anyway, I'm sure whatever
they had was genuine.

125
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,810
It's none of my business, 'cause
if she's doing a good job,

126
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,810
- that's all that matters, right?
- Garrett seems to think she is.

127
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,570
Then I should just keep
my feelings to myself.

128
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,249
So, if the president
is not able to be there,

129
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:34,650
that could be a silver lining for us. We
won't have to hold back with the military.

130
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,490
Phone taps, video surveillance,

131
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:42,130
premeditation, sustained intent.
They've got you cold.

132
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,210
If I plead out, that's it.
No one hears the truth.

133
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,409
You don't plead,
no one will hear you, period.

134
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,050
Not until you're
in your seventies.

135
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,489
Have you talked
to Hammerschmidt yet?

136
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,128
You're in no position
to make demands.

137
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:54,730
- It's not up to you.
- All you'll do is piss them off.

138
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,969
Look...

139
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,889
We've got a good deal here.
A great deal, considering what you did.

140
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,450
You should take it
before they change their mind.

141
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:09,130
Tom Hammerschmidt. I talk to him
or we're going to trial.

142
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,690
<i>Raise your arms, please.</i>

143
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,650
- You have something here?
- My neck chain.

144
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,410
- May I see it?
- Really? I gotta take off my tie.

145
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,050
I need to see it, sir.

146
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,090
- You're a good Christian, Remy.
- My mother's.

147
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,169
- She was the good Christian.
- Well, then you're just the good son.

148
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:40,570
- Thank you, sir.
- Hot out there, huh?

149
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,450
Ninety-six according to my car.

150
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,129
We had heat like that
back in Gaffney,

151
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,010
but we didn't know
what air conditioning was,

152
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,370
so we just accepted as fact that
summer was meant to be miserable.

153
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,529
- Neat or with water?
- Just the water.

154
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,850
You can hold the bourbon.
We need to find a solution

155
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,850
so that this one isn't miserable
for 300 million people.

156
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,889
I already have found a solution.

157
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,810
Oh, please, Frank.
A samarium subsidy?

158
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,130
- Is that your skepticism or Raymond's?
- Mine, anticipating his.

159
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,809
So you haven't
spoken to him yet.

160
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,170
I want to offer him
something he can agree to.

161
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,289
- Well, he doesn't have much of a choice.
- Why are you cornering him?

162
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,889
I'm cutting the rate by half.
I'd call that liberating him.

163
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,449
You know that's not
how he'll see it.

164
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,810
This trade war
is preventing the refinery

165
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,569
from being approved in Beijing.

166
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,569
His co-venture with Feng is not
our highest priority right now.

167
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,769
A rare earth refinery solves
this crisis permanently.

168
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,610
Three years from now.
Not this summer.

169
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,969
It's not just that. With the subsidy,
he'll break even, at best.

170
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,250
There's no point in doing business
to hover between red and black.

171
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,769
Raymond's profits are an even lower
priority to me than his co-venture.

172
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,210
Tell me what
you're up to, Frank.

173
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,409
There's nothing to gain
by locking horns with Tusk.

174
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,170
Ask your client. It's Tusk
who's locking the horns.

175
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:50,890
- He's not a man who likes conflict.
- Neither am I.

176
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,129
Then make the ask. 'Cause I know
you don't care about the subsidy.

177
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,690
This is about something bigger.

178
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:59,849
I'm a good Christian, Remy,
like your mother.

179
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,570
I would tell you the truth
if I wanted more.

180
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,330
- You trying to send a message?
- Perhaps.

181
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,650
- Which is?
- That stubbornness is far more costly

182
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,810
- than obedience.
- Thanks for the water.

183
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:18,250
- You're on the wrong side, Remy.
- Yeah, well, one of us sure is.

184
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,290
And when the bumblebee
flew home,

185
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,209
all his friends were waiting
with buckets of honey, right?

186
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,371
And he's got his worm friend, and
his mouse friend, and his spider friend,

187
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:31,449
and his snail friend,
and they all had tons of honey.

188
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:32,930
- I like his feet.
- - And he looks happier now, right?

189
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,970
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

190
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,369
- They're funny, right?
- So they all buzzed with happiness,

191
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,369
because life is sweet when
you spend it with your friends.

192
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,330
Right? Can you all buzz your
wings? Buzz your little wings.

193
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,130
Buzz, buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

194
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:51,529
I think it would make
a fluttering noise, like...

195
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,609
- I don't know.
- Your flutters.

196
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,810
It's too hot out here for you
to be doing this, Francis.

197
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,530
I'm keeping hydrated.

198
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,209
- That even regulation?
- It's only half,

199
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,650
but I don't want the press
to see me practicing on the street.

200
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,369
You remember when you threw out
that first pitch in Greenville?

201
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,530
I was wondering how long it
was gonna take to bring that up.

202
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,530
That wasn't even
on national television.

203
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,610
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

204
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:39,010
- What happened in Greenville?
- Oh, the Greenville Drive.

205
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,569
Single A team for the Red Sox.

206
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,288
It was a home game,
I get on the mound...

207
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,769
- You threw from the mound?
- Well, I wanted to throw a real pitch.

208
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:51,650
- Didn't make it.
- Not even close.

209
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,850
Halfway?

210
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,889
Ball slipped out of my hand
just before I released it.

211
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,809
Went straight up in the air
and hit me on top of the head.

212
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,290
The whole stadium
burst a gut laughing.

213
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,729
- Comic relief pitcher.
- Oh, that's very clever, Meechum.

214
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:15,129
- Don't tell Claire.
- I heard that.

215
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,370
- You're really good with them.
- Nah.

216
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,570
Did you see Robbie,
when they were finger-painting?

217
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,209
He pulled down his pants and
started painting himself blue.

218
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,210
- No!
- Yeah. I hope I got it all off.

219
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,010
I'm sure Alex and Daria
don't care.

220
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,609
They let him run around
naked all the time.

221
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,210
Yeah, but probably not
with his Smurf ass.

222
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,890
Probably not.

223
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,049
What do we want to do
for dinner tonight?

224
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,329
I've got some leftover chicken
or we could order pizza.

225
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,610
- Pizza. No dishes.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,370
I'm really sorry, I totally forgot I've
got a friend picking me up tonight.

227
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,970
- I completely blanked.
- That's fine.

228
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,849
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't sweat it.

229
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:59,090
- Is it your boyfriend?
- No, no... just an old friend.

230
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:04,209
- Can I meet him?
- Um... He's... kinda shy. I don't...

231
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,810
- ...know if he'd be up for...
- Totally cool. Don't worry about it.

232
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,490
- We'll just do dinner another night.
- All right.

233
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,330
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah. You know where I'll be.

234
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,569
- Yeah.
- OK.

235
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:25,209
- How long?
- Couple of months.

236
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,329
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I can't go to church?

237
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,169
Anywhere you interact with other
people opens us up to risk.

238
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,089
I'm just supposed to slave away
at the fucking call center

239
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,624
- and then lock myself in the apartment.
- Don't get dramatic.

240
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,689
I like the Fellowship, OK?
There's nothing to worry about there.

241
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:43,449
All it takes is one person's
cousin to visit from Lynchburg.

242
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,369
Someone you went to school with, or
some client that you spent the night with.

243
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,490
- Those guys would never end up here.
- You don't know that.

244
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,330
- Yeah, I do.
- You ended up here, didn't you?

245
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,410
What?

246
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,450
- I can't live like this.
- Yes, you can.

247
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,330
You're a strong girl.

248
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:12,610
That's it?
That's everything?

249
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,088
I know, you've heard it before.

250
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:17,529
As a friend, Lucas,
not as a reporter.

251
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,209
Now I dig.

252
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,569
I make the phone calls.
I do the legwork.

253
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,529
They treating you OK?

254
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:32,529
- It's fine.
- That's not what I asked.

255
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,649
They're pushing
the plea deal pretty hard.

256
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,210
How seriously are you
considering it?

257
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:40,610
I want to see how this
article impacts things.

258
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,169
- What does your lawyer say?
- He thinks that's a bad idea,

259
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,249
that I should take the plea.

260
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,649
- Maybe you should listen to him.
- No. I want the article.

261
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,849
<i>- </i> That I'm certain of.
- All right.

262
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:58,010
- I better get to it then.
- Thank you.

263
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,729
You need to know, I'm gonna treat
this the way I would any other story.

264
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,329
Whatever the facts bear.
You might not like what I write.

265
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,369
- I get that.
- I'll let you read it first.

266
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,449
- Then you can decide.
- That's all I'm asking.

267
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,569
Hang in there.

268
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:29,489
Can you wipe this shit off?
Please!

269
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,369
And the other nuclear
providers are on board?

270
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,049
Most. Except Raymond's
company and a couple of others.

271
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,688
Lakeport Nuclear, Wolf Springs.

272
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,370
Now, I can't prove it,

273
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,290
but I am absolutely sure
they're colluding.

274
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,889
Raymond wants to embarrass me.

275
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,449
I offer a solution,
nuclear lobby turns its back.

276
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,529
He has a right to refuse,
Mr. President.

277
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,650
What he cannot do is manipulate
the energy market.

278
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,888
You want to put pressure
on the distribution side.

279
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,369
More than pressure. Ban vertical
integration entirely.

280
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,289
We don't have that
regulatory power.

281
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:02,129
We add an antitrust agreement
to the emergency energy bill.

282
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:03,889
We break up the regional supply

283
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,249
and distribution monopolies
like the Bell System.

284
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,169
It'll be challenged immediately
in the courts.

285
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:12,969
We don't need it to pass,
we just need to threaten it.

286
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,810
See if he falls into line.

287
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:21,209
Is there a way to do that without
it making its way into the news?

288
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,969
I don't want the world's wealthiest
one percent on my phone sheet.

289
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,729
There is absolutely a way
to do that, sir.

290
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,649
Here you go.

291
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,249
- Crowded for a Tuesday night.
- We keep it at 65 degrees.

292
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,329
- And it's free.
- If you call 18 bucks

293
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:47,009
- for a vodka soda free.
- Still cheaper than a Pepco bill.

294
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:49,369
- Depends on how many you have.
- You trying to get us drunk?

295
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,249
Drunker you are, bigger you tip.

296
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,649
I don't have to be drunk
to appreciate good service.

297
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,130
- I'll get your change.
- No, you won't.

298
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:03,409
- Thank you.
- You're shameless.

299
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,889
Makes me a good lobbyist.

300
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,490
Cheers.

301
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:14,568
So, Jackie... bold move,
but it won't work.

302
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:17,209
You know we can pass this
amendment in a heartbeat.

303
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,369
Maybe, but no one will comply.
It'll get overturned.

304
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,729
- Big fuss for nothing.
- It might get overturned,

305
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,809
- but it gets ink along the way.
- One thing about Raymond Tusk

306
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,889
is he doesn't give two
bird shits about public opinion.

307
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,730
- His stockholders do.
- They'd jump in a pit of snakes

308
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,770
and light themselves on fire
if he gave the word.

309
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,489
All I'm asking is
that you convey our intentions.

310
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,369
Why me? Frank could
easily pick up the phone.

311
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,249
You still call him Frank?

312
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,769
Not to his face, which I try
to keep to a minimum.

313
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,729
Don't you appreciate having
an ear in the White House?

314
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:47,289
I would, if I had an ear.
But lately all I've got is a mouth.

315
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,689
Yeah. He's not
the best listener, is he?

316
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,209
- Try working for him.
- You were on his staff?

317
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,530
Eight years. Press secretary.
Before you joined Congress.

318
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,889
That explains a lot.

319
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:05,370
- Like what?
- Like a lot.

320
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,849
- I'll take that as an insult.
- You should.

321
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,290
That's it? You abandoning me?

322
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,529
No, I'm buying the next round.

323
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:15,769
I can't accept
gifts from lobbyists

324
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,369
without reciprocating.

325
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,529
Plus, I'm a good wingman.

326
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,609
This gets you more face time
with the barmaid.

327
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,369
You already got 'em ready?

328
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,689
Your guys gave me the
heads-up you were comin'.

329
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,169
Well, I hope that they didn't
wake you earlier than usual.

330
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,689
Fuck, man, with this heat,
I ain't sleepin' much anyway.

331
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:53,448
- What? No AC at home?
- I got a unit.

332
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,849
I just don't wanna pay
the damn bill.

333
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,889
It's not too bad in here,
all things considered.

334
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,050
That's 'cause we in the shade.

335
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:04,048
You get outside a couple hours
from now on that pavement,

336
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:06,449
fry your damn dick off
from three feet below.

337
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,129
Must be bad over that grill.

338
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,289
I can't tell the
difference no more.

339
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,689
I tell you what, though,

340
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,289
stuff goes down 'round here
when the mercury pop a hundred.

341
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:22,089
Man who beat his wife at home
will beat her right out on the street.

342
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,729
- Brings out the animal in us?
- That ain't no joke.

343
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,529
What used to wake me up?
Gunshots.

344
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,610
Now you know what does it?
People fuckin'.

345
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:36,648
Moanin' and screamin'
like goddamn cats in the alley.

346
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,728
You know what they say,

347
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:42,728
when you get hot and sweaty,
it make you ripe and ready.

348
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:50,169
- Hey.
- Hey.

349
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:56,610
- I drank too much.
- We both did.

350
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,768
- Last night didn't happen.
- I know.

351
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:05,409
When I walk out that door,
it's business as usual.

352
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:06,809
- No special treatment.
- Don't worry.

353
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,529
You won't need
a restraining order.

354
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,929
I'm surprised you didn't
go for the waitress.

355
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:18,529
- You're much sexier.
- Yeah, OK.

356
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,610
She works for tips.
You run Congress.

357
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,089
- Only half of it.
- That's half more than she does.

358
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,568
So it's not my body.

359
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:30,728
- Those legs don't hurt.
- You're so full of shit.

360
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:37,529
OK. It's your voice.

361
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:42,129
- My voice?
- Mm-hm. It does something to me.

362
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,728
Let me know what Tusk
has to say.

363
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,528
Business hasn't started yet.
You haven't walked out that door yet.

364
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:54,769
Watch me.

365
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,488
Thank you, Jackie.

366
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,168
We're going to the White House.

367
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:31,888
Little John on the move.

368
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,969
We raise the bet.
We get FERC involved.

369
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,889
- An investigation?
- We don't need Congress

370
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:39,929
- to activate the regulatory commission.
- But a price-fixing review?

371
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,529
- That would take months.
- Again, it's the threat,

372
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,328
- not the actuality.
- He'll employ the same logic.

373
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,049
Draw it out,
fight back with appeals.

374
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:48,889
But he'll have to divulge his
accounting if FERC takes action.

375
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:51,329
Now, no businessman
wants to open up his books,

376
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:53,809
especially one with $43 billion.

377
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:57,768
This is getting out of hand, Frank.
We shouldn't be duking it out with Raymond.

378
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:00,169
- Maybe we should talk to him.
- That's exactly what he wants.

379
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:02,809
To force himself
back into the mix.

380
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,490
What's to be gained
by shutting him out?

381
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:06,929
The simple lesson
that you cannot strong-arm

382
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,889
the president
of the United States.

383
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,409
We can't devolve
to a pissing contest.

384
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,729
I'm gonna call Raymond.
Invite him to Washington.

385
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,649
He won't accept anything
but total surrender.

386
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:21,088
- I'm making the call.
- Don't put yourself in that position.

387
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:24,168
I know how to maintain
the integrity of my office.

388
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,528
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

389
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:31,808
Two minutes with the president and
Tusk may be back in his good graces.

390
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,089
I need to disrupt the nuptials
and prevent a second marriage.

391
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,849
- Christina?
- Good to see you.

392
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:56,209
Oh, please.

393
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:59,129
- You look great.
- Thank you.

394
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:02,329
- How are things?
- Great.

395
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,609
Linda works me to the bone,
but that's what I signed up for.

396
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:08,008
Well, from what I've heard,
you're doing a great job.

397
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:09,689
Well, that's really nice
to hear.

398
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:12,608
Look, I wanted to talk to you
about Tricia.

399
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:17,169
I'm sure you've noticed that she's still
sort of adjusting to her role.

400
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,528
You mean her... confidence.

401
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:22,929
I think it would be great
if you reached out to her.

402
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,848
Just let her know that you're there
if there's anything she needs.

403
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:29,609
I don't really know her that well.
I mean, we've met, but I...

404
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,089
That's OK.
Maybe just tell her

405
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,809
that you enjoy
working for the president,

406
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:38,648
and you're there to be of help
to her in any way you can.

407
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,488
You don't think that's a little,
I don't know, brash?

408
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,769
- How?
- For me to just approach her like that?

409
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,889
No. Not at all.

410
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:35,449
<i>You've reached the Skorsky residence.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

411
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,849
Tom Hammerschmidt again. I'm
still trying to reach Janine.

412
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,209
Still important. Thank you.

413
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:49,249
<i>Hammerschmidt's been
calling our press office all day.</i>

414
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:51,608
I don't want a story to come out
any more than you do.

415
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:53,408
We lose a major asset
if it does.

416
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:55,129
Can you squash it
for security reasons?

417
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,849
Not once it's been shared with
the press. First Amendment crap.

418
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:03,048
Ward isn't making things any easier.
She wants a notch in her belt.

419
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,168
We're giving her one.

420
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:08,168
Not Goodwin. She wants Orsay.

421
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,489
Most-wanted list for six years.

422
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,088
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

423
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,688
You need to make sure Goodwin
takes the plea.

424
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,209
If 35 with no parole doesn't
scare the piss out of him,

425
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,129
- I don't know what will.
- Then don't try to scare him.

426
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:26,048
Remove hope from the equation.

427
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,449
I tried to keep this contained.

428
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:35,888
I didn't anticipate
Hammerschmidt.

429
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:39,768
- Is Ms. Skorsky cooperating with him?
- He's called her.

430
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:43,169
My guy at the bureau says
they haven't actually spoken.

431
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:45,969
At least not on the phone.

432
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:48,449
- If this goes to court...
- That won't happen, sir.

433
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:50,248
It will if he publishes.

434
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,968
I'm bringing this to you
because I can't control Hammerschmidt.

435
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:56,249
I don't know what to do.

436
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:04,568
We need to invite a full-frontal
attack. Then hold the line.

437
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:08,968
- You want to speak to him?
- Face-to-face. Just the two of us.

438
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,609
- I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
- You have a better idea?

439
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,449
- No, sir.
- We can't avoid the battle,

440
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,489
but we can choose
the battlefield.

441
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:21,768
Set up a meeting at the White
House. We'll intimidate him with formality.

442
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:23,728
Yes, sir.

443
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,929
Mr. Vice President?

444
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,689
I know you don't have patience
for apologies,

445
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:32,449
but I'm sorry if I've
let you down in any way.

446
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,809
Let's concentrate
on what's in front of us.

447
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:36,289
I'll let you know
when I have a time set up.

448
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:39,128
- As soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

449
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,248
So this is a sort of outline
to the larger piece?

450
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,929
With questions on the next page.

451
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:15,528
- We're off the record?
- Yes, off the record.

452
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:18,568
Now, Tom, I know that you care
about this young man,

453
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:20,648
and I respect you as a
journalist, but these questions?

454
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:24,850
Why don't you just ask me
when I stopped strangling people's pets.

455
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:26,448
Sir, the death
of Congressman Russo...

456
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:29,128
You mean my friend, Peter Russo,

457
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,409
whose suicide left two
small children with no father.

458
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:35,569
No, I will not answer
questions about that.

459
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:37,968
Yes?

460
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:41,488
I'm aware of that. No, tell her
I'll call her right back.

461
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:44,008
Two minutes. Secretary Durant.

462
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:46,408
- I can wait outside...
- No, let's finish.

463
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:50,969
Now, if you decide
to print any of this,

464
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:53,448
assuming you find an outlet
that's willing to, then yes,

465
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:56,168
it might cause me
a headache for a day.

466
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:57,569
But I will not engage.

467
00:28:57,689 --> 00:28:59,569
And I think it will only
prove to highlight

468
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:01,409
how ridiculous Mr. Goodwin's
claims are.

469
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:04,528
I pity him. I truly do.
I think he needs help.

470
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:07,008
I've interviewed many mentally
ill people. He's not one of them.

471
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:10,248
Well, I would suggest that you
read your own article again.

472
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:12,449
He's distressed.
There's a difference.

473
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:15,689
Look, I understand. It must be
a terrible blow to see him in prison,

474
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,849
- but Tom...
- Rachel Posner exists.

475
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:21,808
I haven't been able to find her,
but I've proven she's not a fantasy.

476
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,128
The same goes for Roy Kapeniak.
These people were born.

477
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:26,329
They have Social Security
numbers, past addresses.

478
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:29,848
So does everyone from California to Maine.
Have I conspired with all of them?

479
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,407
You have to admit there are some
troubling details regarding the DUI.

480
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:36,328
You know, people say the same
thing about Area 51.

481
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,729
You can conjure up little gray
men if you really want to.

482
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:44,329
- Did you kill Peter Russo?
- Tom, you're embarrassing yourself.

483
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,209
Did you kill Zoe Barnes?

484
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:48,569
I've given you more time
than this nonsense deserves.

485
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,928
- I have to ask these questions.
- The only question I would ask is:

486
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:53,329
does this sort of article
hurt or help Mr. Goodwin?

487
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:57,049
You have to do what you think
is right. But I hope you can understand

488
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,929
if I don't demean myself
by taking any of it seriously.

489
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,528
I appreciate your time,
Mr. Vice President.

490
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:21,488
- How'd it go?
- I did my part. Now put it to bed, Doug.

491
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,528
I won't submit myself
to this sort of exposure again.

492
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:25,889
- Yes, sir.
- Has Tusk met with the president yet?

493
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:28,208
- Linda said they're meeting at 4:30.
- Call Remy.

494
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,689
Make sure he doesn't get on
his plane before I see him.

495
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,168
I'm on it.

496
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:48,609
Oh, Mrs. Walker?

497
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:51,929
I just wanted to say how rewarding it's
been working here in the West Wing.

498
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:54,408
And I'm so proud to be working
for your husband.

499
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:58,728
Thank you. I know he
appreciates all your hard work.

500
00:30:58,848 --> 00:31:01,209
Well, now that I'm working
so closely with him,

501
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:03,208
if there's anything
I can do for you,

502
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:07,408
anything that would make yours
or his life easier...

503
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:11,327
- Just keep doing what you're doing.
- Truly, anything.

504
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:15,889
I want you to know you can
rely on me. Both of you.

505
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,368
I know that.
Thank you, Christina.

506
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:21,328
Thanks, Mrs. Walker.

507
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,129
- Oh, here. Let me.
- Oh, it's just my hands...

508
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:34,448
- Are they bothering you?
- Yeah, probably gonna get rain tonight.

509
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:36,769
I'll get it.

510
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:40,288
Um, no, just keep
the broth moving.

511
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,648
Agent Green, FBI. Do you have
a moment, Ms. Skorsky?

512
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,648
- Yeah, I...
- May we come in?

513
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:52,888
I just need to
turn the stove off.

514
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:56,488
- Stay in here, Mom.
- Who is it?

515
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:58,929
Just stay in here.

516
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,328
Only that once?

517
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:05,528
And I haven't seen him since,
or returned his calls.

518
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:09,048
- How many times has he tried to call you?
- I don't know.

519
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:13,409
Eight or nine times, maybe.
And then he stopped after a while.

520
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,888
Did he mention anything about
Heronymous Bot or Gavin Orsay?

521
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:19,289
You know, I think
I should talk to a lawyer.

522
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,848
Right now you're not suspected
of being an accomplice.

523
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:24,769
If you call a lawyer,
we might have to reconsider.

524
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:31,288
- He mentioned some hacker.
- Heronymous.

525
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,249
I told him I thought it
was a bad idea to contact him.

526
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,768
- Are you aware of what he's claiming?
- No.

527
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,608
That you and he
were working together.

528
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:41,249
That you believe
in this conspiracy theory.

529
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:45,808
That it was you who received
explicit photos of Ms. Barnes.

530
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:48,008
Is any of that true?

531
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:55,208
We need you to come back
to DC with us

532
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,888
and sign this statement in the
presence of the US attorney.

533
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,329
- You want me to call him a liar.
- Isn't he?

534
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,848
I can't do that to him.

535
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:07,528
We also need you to speak
with Tom Hammerschmidt.

536
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:09,849
You know what, please, can you
just keep me out of this?

537
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:11,768
I had nothing to do
with the hacker or the...

538
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:13,448
Ms. Skorsky, we want
to believe you.

539
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:16,168
And we will,
if you put all of it in writing.

540
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,329
He's not a criminal. You're
going after the wrong person.

541
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,649
And if you think
that you can intimidate me,

542
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:26,408
harass me like this in my
own home, I will file a formal complaint.

543
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,888
You're starting to sound
an awful lot like him.

544
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:34,689
You can't arrest me.
I haven't done anything.

545
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:36,568
I'd like you to leave.

546
00:33:36,688 --> 00:33:39,248
I have a right to legal counsel
and you haven't presented a warrant.

547
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:44,088
We can arrest you, Ms. Skorsky,
for abetting an act of cyberterrorism.

548
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,808
Who's going to take care
of your mother

549
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:51,008
while you're spending the next
three years in courtrooms?

550
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:53,688
Would you please
raise your arms?

551
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:55,728
- No, Meechum.
- Sir.

552
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:56,968
Meechum.

553
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,049
I know you don't want
to shake my hand,

554
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,048
so we'll just skip that part.

555
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,809
The president didn't
mention anything about it.

556
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:07,008
Why would he?
Better to catch you off guard.

557
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:12,329
- Then why would you?
- So we can avoid unnecessary conflict.

558
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,848
Garrett's not a good liar.

559
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:19,129
The gift of a good liar is making people
think you lack a talent for lying.

560
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:24,608
I know him far better than you, and so
I know what talents he has and lacks.

561
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,168
But let's assume he did lie.

562
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:31,369
I'm not intimidated
by a FERC investigation.

563
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,649
You'd have grid overload and brownouts
before you could even get a hearing.

564
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:37,048
You are deliberately keeping
electric prices at inflated rates,

565
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,408
- which is illegal.
- No.

566
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:44,327
- I'm responding to the free market.
- A regulated free market.

567
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:46,688
Why are you doing this, Frank?

568
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:50,488
Remy asked me the same thing.

569
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:53,729
- You're making this about me.
- This isn't personal, Raymond.

570
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:56,768
The integrity of our energy
markets is my only concern.

571
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:59,768
Of course it's personal.
I asked you, personally,

572
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:02,048
to convince Garrett to pull back
from China.

573
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,608
You personally chose not to.

574
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,768
You personally sabotaged
the summit.

575
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,888
- I have never once in my career...
- You personally advised...

576
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:11,969
- ...allowed personal...
- ...to push me up against the wall.

577
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:15,649
Do not try and spin me, Frank!
I am too old to tango!

578
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:18,928
Then I'll be blunt. Accept the
subsidies or deal with FERC.

579
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,568
There is no third way here.

580
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:24,128
Are you intentionally trying
to destroy the president?

581
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:28,848
I'm trying to protect
the president... from you.

582
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:33,262
This is about the secretary
of state nomination, isn't it?

583
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:36,607
I'm the vice president now. I don't cry
over what happened in kindergarten.

584
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:39,047
You're vice president
because I vouched for you.

585
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:43,208
Because you had no other
options. Political necessity.

586
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:49,728
- You have 24 hours to decide.
- I'll show myself out.

587
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:55,728
Hello.

588
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:59,608
Raymond, this is Claire.

589
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:02,368
Mrs. Underwood, it is an honor.

590
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:07,808
Jean... my wife, has been very
taken with your recent efforts.

591
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:09,289
Well, I'd like
to meet her one day.

592
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,088
She would very much
like that, I'm sure.

593
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:14,489
- And what about you?
- I'm sorry?

594
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:16,487
What are your thoughts
about our recent efforts?

595
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,448
Oh. I am in favor of anything

596
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:23,009
that prevents
unnecessary violence.

597
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:25,167
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Underwood.

598
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:29,849
And good luck with that
first pitch tonight, Mr. Vice President.

599
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,248
Make it to the plate this time.

600
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:34,529
Ma'am.

601
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:41,728
<i>♪ Gave proof through the night ♪</i>

602
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:47,568
<i>♪ That our flag</i>
<i>was still there ♪</i>

603
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:53,888
<i>♪ Oh, say does that</i>
<i>star-spangled...♪</i>

604
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:57,127
- This Kevlar is cooking me.
- We have to use it, sir.

605
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,928
Well, I didn't practice with it.
Now I can hardly rotate my arm.

606
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:01,808
I should have mentioned it.
I apologize.

607
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:04,008
If this ball doesn't make it
over the plate, it's your ass.

608
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,848
And what are you doing here?
Don't you have things to do?

609
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,168
Never been to Camden Yards.

610
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:16,327
<i>♪ And the home of the ♪</i>

611
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:22,848
<i>♪ Brave ♪</i>

612
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:26,607
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to throw out the first pitch tonight,

613
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:30,487
we are honored to introduce
the vice president of the United States,

614
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:35,207
Frank Underwood!

615
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:45,248
Boss, boss. Use his ball.

616
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,447
Thank you very much. Where's
the mascot? There you are.

617
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:56,008
Pleasure.

618
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:58,368
Beautiful job.

619
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:02,528
Good evening. Now, I know it's a hot night
and you all want to get to the baseball.

620
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:07,368
So as soon as I throw this sucker,
grab a drink, enjoy the game,

621
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:09,168
and best of luck to both teams.

622
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,368
Ah, scratch that.
We're at Camden Yards.

623
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:15,368
Go Orioles!

624
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,608
Let's go, sir.
We've gotta move!

625
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,408
Got him.
We're on the move.

626
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:03,304
I'm told the distribution line that
controls the pinch point

627
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:05,647
caused the outages.
BAPCO, one of your companies.

628
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,808
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>There was a capacity issue.</i>

629
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,928
<i>We're working as quickly</i>
<i>as we can to resolve it.</i>

630
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,407
I've got
three governors calling,

631
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:12,968
hospitals on emergency power,

632
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:14,048
so quickly better mean quickly.

633
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:15,768
<i>The latest estimate I got</i>

634
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:17,447
<i>was two to three hours,</i>
<i>maybe sooner.</i>

635
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,728
Raymond, was this intentional?

636
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:25,448
Sir, I know you don't hold me
in the highest regard at the moment,

637
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:28,007
but I am alarmed

638
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,248
that you could even
entertain such a thought.

639
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,767
<i>Well, the timing makes</i>
<i>coincidence hard to swallow.</i>

640
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,809
There is a heat wave. That always
pushes the grid to its limits.

641
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:40,848
Let's get the people out of the dark.
Updates every 30 minutes on your progress.

642
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:46,648
I should inform you, sir, that I may need
to take two of my plants offline tomorrow,

643
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:49,807
- <i> for unscheduled maintenance.</i>
- Why? Which ones?

644
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:51,488
<i>Georgia and Tennessee.</i>

645
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:53,768
<i>This blackout has put</i>
<i>a great deal of stress on them.</i>

646
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:58,648
My engineers are concerned
about the seals on the fuel rods.

647
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:00,968
So we're looking at outages
on the Southeast grid, too?

648
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:03,448
- <i> Could be, for a few days.</i>
- That's unacceptable.

649
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,168
Safety comes first.
We don't want an accident.

650
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:09,727
- Let's get a full report to Linda ASAP.
- <i> Yes, sir.</i>

651
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,288
Thank you, sir.

652
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,662
- He's toying with you.
- This could be a legitimate safety issue.

653
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,447
He wants a seat back at the
table. Those plants are fine.

654
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,447
Why is he doing this?
We've had our differences,

655
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:21,928
but something drastic like this?

656
00:40:22,048 --> 00:40:25,808
Well, I did tell him
about the possible FERC action.

657
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:29,007
- You did what?
- He called me, I answered the call.

658
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,288
Why didn't you inform me
immediately?

659
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:32,288
He told me you had
a productive talk,

660
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,168
that he was on board
with the subsidy.

661
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:36,488
I assumed everything was fine.

662
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,088
He was proposing renewed trade
talks. We didn't talk about subsidy at all.

663
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:42,288
He's playing both of us then.

664
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,608
If he told you he was on board,
why'd you bring up FERC?

665
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:47,928
I told him I was relieved, that we
could've taken action if he didn't comply.

666
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,008
You think he's fishing, to see
what our next move might be?

667
00:40:50,127 --> 00:40:54,288
I think so, sir. I mean, he is lying
about those two plants in the South.

668
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:56,288
But we can't guess.
We have to be certain.

669
00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:58,727
Do you want Raymond Tusk
to assess that risk,

670
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:00,448
or the United States government?

671
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:02,409
Are you suggesting
we take over his facilities?

672
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,088
There is precedent there.

673
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:07,008
Woodrow Wilson did it with the
railroads for three full years.

674
00:41:07,128 --> 00:41:08,527
In a time of war.

675
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:11,808
In a time of emergency,
which is what this is.

676
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:15,848
The country needs a leader,
Mr. President. Give them one.

677
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:18,967
Do not bend to Raymond Tusk.

678
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:29,848
I'm done.

679
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:35,009
- I said you might not like it.
- It makes me seem crazy.

680
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:37,928
This is the most
toned-down version.

681
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,927
I tried to be as kind as I
could without being biased.

682
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:44,488
I don't think you want this
going out into the world.

683
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:46,568
Can I talk to Janine?

684
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:56,527
Tell him to go.

685
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,288
He wants you to leave.

686
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:13,888
- You lied.
- Luca...

687
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:15,808
You lied to Tom.
You lied to the US attorney.

688
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:16,888
I didn't know what else to do.

689
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:18,128
Tell the truth.

690
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,487
They'll arrest me.

691
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,527
They'll discredit
everything I say.

692
00:42:23,648 --> 00:42:26,408
And nobody is going to believe
me more than they believe you.

693
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:29,167
But we can get the story out there.
Get people asking questions.

694
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:33,967
No. It'll just look like
two crazy people instead of one.

695
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,968
So you're saving yourself.

696
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:41,968
I'm trying to save
the both of us.

697
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:48,367
Please. Take the plea.

698
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:51,007
- I'm not guilty.
- You are.

699
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:54,127
You committed a crime.
Multiple crimes.

700
00:42:54,247 --> 00:42:56,807
Not murder.

701
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:03,408
Take the plea. Be good.
Get out early.

702
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,487
Everybody...
everybody's fucked me.

703
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:11,928
If I was trying to fuck you,
I wouldn't be here.

704
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:15,928
He's gonna get away with it,
isn't he?

705
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:21,287
Yes.

706
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:24,007
He is.

707
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:36,608
- I'll take an iced tea if you have any.
- We don't.

708
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:44,087
I wish I didn't have to keep coming
through back doors like this.

709
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:46,848
Well, we wouldn't want our
friends in the fourth estate

710
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,408
to know you were here, would we?
Especially since you've gone

711
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:54,128
to such lengths to remain
above the fray of politics.

712
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:56,687
You can't seize
the plants, Frank.

713
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:58,486
We haven't seized anything yet.

714
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:01,248
We're ready to, but we won't...
if you cooperate.

715
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,768
- It's illegal.
- It's not. You know that.

716
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:07,608
The president can issue an executive
order in times of emergency.

717
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,847
- I'll fight it in court. - Which will take even
longer than a FERC investigation would.

718
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:14,848
And in the meantime, you make
nothing from those plants.

719
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:18,888
We agreed, right here
in this room,

720
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:21,888
we agreed to work together.
We agreed as men of our word.

721
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:24,568
And I held up my end of
that bargain until you abandoned me...

722
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,327
I sent Remy to help you.

723
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:28,768
After I got it passed through
the Senate, with no help from you.

724
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:30,528
I had to protect my relationship
with the president.

725
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:33,208
And then you tried to use me
during the summit in Spotsylvania.

726
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:37,287
I was not put on this earth
to be your best friend,

727
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,967
or to share every piece
of information I have with you.

728
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:45,807
We agreed to a mutually
beneficial partnership,

729
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:47,166
that's all.

730
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:52,167
Yes, and what's
become very clear to me

731
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:55,367
is that I benefit in no way
from this partnership.

732
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:57,287
Let's not pretend to be naive.

733
00:44:57,408 --> 00:45:01,287
We both respect self-interest
above all else.

734
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:07,727
Our versions of that
no longer align.

735
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:12,848
You are on the verge of making an
irreversible mistake, Mr. Vice President.

736
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:18,328
I may well be making a mistake.
Who knows?

737
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:21,447
What I do know is that you'll be
calling Linda and telling her

738
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,848
that you'll accept
the subsidies.

739
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:28,968
You may have all the money, Raymond,
but I have all the men with guns.

740
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:31,326
It's a burner.
Pre-dialed. She's expecting.

741
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:35,567
Oh, and uh, yes...
from last night.

742
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:39,728
The ball's in your court,
as they say.

743
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,888
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

744
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:04,967
Are you supposed to take the
Lord's name in vain like that?

745
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,287
- Leave it on.
- Costs too much.

746
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,927
I'll take care of it.

747
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:17,287
Goodwin took the plea.
He's going away.

748
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:21,487
- So does that mean this is all over?
- No.

749
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:24,287
- We still have to be careful.
- Well, why?

750
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,447
If he's gone, then nobody's
looking for me, right?

751
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,487
Not that we know of.
Until we know, nothing changes.

752
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:31,407
So what, you just came over here
to get my hopes up?

753
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:35,087
I came here to make sure that
you don't go to church tonight.

754
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,888
Do you want to fuck me?

755
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:52,288
- Is that what this is all about?
- No.

756
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:55,567
- You've done it before.
- That was different.

757
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:06,487
Stop it.

758
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:13,607
If there's one thing I know,
it's when a man wants me.

759
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:30,727
I learned who Rachel
was in church.

760
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:34,767
She was young and beautiful.

761
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:38,447
Jacob fell in love with her
while she was watering a lamb and...

762
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:44,127
...she became his wife after he worked
seven years to earn her hand in marriage.

763
00:47:45,847 --> 00:47:51,168
Rachel had one son, Joseph.

764
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,927
He became a king.

765
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:00,607
Are you hungry?

766
00:48:09,132 --> 00:48:17,132
