This guys didn't come here for just
couple of used M-16s.

57
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:30,031
- Let's go, it's aborted.
- You're the one who taught me that the law and justice

58
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,431
aren't always the same thing.

59
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,830
We gotta stop 'em.

60
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,530
Oh Shit.

61
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:24,982
I wish, you hadn't seen this.

62
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,705
That's quite a resume you got there, Taco.

63
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,339
I mean, one might consider you'd be a bit of
an over-achiever when it comes to killing people.

64
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:17,117
I bet, you consider yourself-
a mean bobber scooter, Don't you?

65
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:22,427
Specially now, we got 24 Cartel boys
laid out in pieces all over my desert.

They're the red-headed Mongoloid runs.
<i>Los Querpos</i>.

70
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,222
<i>Los Querpos</i> don't take kindly
to strangers disciplining their own.

71
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:37,373
Can I get an 'Amen' on that, Clebourne?

72
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,255
- Amen, Sir.

73
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,738
See, here is the bad news for you Taco.

74
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,345
I never wanna place a vigilante on this parts.

75
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:49,785
Since, you just killed yourself
a federal officer..

76
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,236
I'm about to have me and mine,

77
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,383
A hog-killing good time.

78
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,980
I didn't kill her.

79
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:59,186
Tometo..tomato.

80
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:02,303
Let's not get hung up on the details.
Shall we?

81
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:04,223
Drop him, Clebourne.

82
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,273
I'll be god damned.

83
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,069
They say, he doesn't die..sir.

84
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,018
He's been shot..

85
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:43,247
Stabbed.

00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:45,407

Bull fucking shit,

This Pedro has got a thick neck, that's all.

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,050
Sheriff, it's for you.

00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,894
Damn sure ain't the governor.

Yeah?

93
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:17,052

Welcome to The White House.

Good thing we got you, when we did.

100
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,150
Southern hospitality can be a bitch.

101
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,264
- Why am I here?
- Right to the point.

102
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:45,417
I like that.

103
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:47,319
No, bullshit.

104

I'm a bit of a no bullshit guy, myself.

105
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,438
So..

106
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,130
all bullshit aside...

107
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,282

We need you, Machete.

We got a situation
in our hands.

110
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:07,384
There's a revolutionary south of the border
name, Marcos Mendez. You've heard of him?

111
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:10,403
He is..he's crazy.
He is out of his mind.

112
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,384
He's got a missile,
aimed at Washington.

113

He says, he is gonna blow us up,
if we don't invade Mexico

114
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,400
Clean up the Cartels.
Stop the violence spreading across the country.

115

- What's that gotta do with me?

116
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,420
The basic violation of Sovereignty aside;

117
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,572
We can't take the bait.

118
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:30,521
However, you know Mexico.
Hell, you are 'Mexico'.

I want you ahead, make cells..

120
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,203
Find Mendez..

121
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,160
and just, check him out.

122
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:39,609
But if, what he is saying is true...

123
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,058
Kill him.

124
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:44,677
- Not interested.

125
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,344
Motherfucker, i'm not asking
if you are interested.

128
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,345
I could just as easily, send you back to your pals.

00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,725
Hang you high in Arizona.

I'm making you 'legal'.

You don't have to sign on anything,
raise your hand and non of that shit.

I just stamp this bad motherfucker...

I just saved you from your noose.

141
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,026
Save me from mine.

142
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:49,936
Do it for your country.

143
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,646
Your new country.

144
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,957

Do it, for her.

Your contact is in San Antionio.

She'll brief you,
and get you across the border over the wall.

150
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,505
Your nation owes you a

I believe in a woman's right to choose.

158
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,711
Choose what? A snow cone
if that's what you're in the mood for.

159
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:49,111
I believe in a good barbeque, the two steps..

160
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:50,324
and the right to carry a gun.

161

World Peace?
Sure, why not?

162
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,590
But if you really wanna talk about World Peace..
we have to start by tearing down

163
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:57,990
that wall, that's seperating us from Mexico.
That wall -

164
00:14:57,991 --> 00:15:00,392
only enables us to ignore the violence and injustice

165
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:04,165
that is occuring down there. Thus, making 'World Peace'
nothing more than a beauty pageant pipe dream.

166
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:10,381
God Bless, Texas.

167
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,105
You must be Machete.

168
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,652
Blanca Vasquez, call me
Miss San Antonio.

169
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,523
I'll be hand delivering
the directions of your assignment.

170
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:47,662
You didn't do a stitch and i'll be the one
who know what's what? The who's who.

171
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:48,815
the where's where.

172
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,451
<i>entiendes?</i>

173
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,619
Try not to be distracted
by the cleavage and the hair spray.

174
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:55,879
It's part of my cover.

175
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:05,308
What happened to world peace?

176
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,461
Fuck world peace.

177
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:07,878
Import carbine long range.

178
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,460
With reflex sides ..

179
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:12,246
Customised trigger.

180
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,125
Fast enought to drop
jack rabbit on roller skates.

181
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:16,258
That is of course..

182
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:19,077
If you happen to come across jackrabbit on roller skates

183
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:20,559
or my personal favourite..

184
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,999
The grab fire.

185
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,559
Fires upto 30 yards. Good for when you've
got to scratch those hard to reach places.

186
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,916
- I like this.
- I like your style. Low tech.

187
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,587
But this ain't your mom's hand gun.

188
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,324
Consider this as Swiss Army knives Machetes.

189
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,613
Machete.

190
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,580
Tell me about Mendez.

191
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,026
Marcos Mendez is the most sicken twisted
fucking bastard

192
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,637
if've ever have to keep my tabs on.

193
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:53,183
People down south calls him
Marcos 'the mad man'.

194
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:54,129
He used to run with Los Quertos.

195
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,040
Till, one day..he wakes up and decides

196
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:59,285
he's gonna turn on the cartel.
Funding from the people.

197
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,894
We figure he is laying in the
jungles and marsh lands

198
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,046
but our Satellite cannot pinpoint him.

199
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:06,051
Our only lead is this prize winner.

200
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,683
Working girl.
Goes by the name of<i> Cereza</i>.

201
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:11,199
You find her..
you find Mendez.

202
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,351
Where can I find her?

203
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:13,503
In Acapulco.

204
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,672
With confirmation address linking her
to brothel in dust city.

205
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,120
Ah..uh ah.

206
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:18,475
First..

207
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:20,567
I might need something from you.

208
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:22,919
See..even here.
People talk about 'Machete'.

209
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,020
The man..

210
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:28,717
The Myth.

211
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:31,445
The Legend.

212
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,573
I just wanna know the legend,
inside and out.

213
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,733
I just lost someone.

214
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:44,079
Why don't you let me turn that bad
upside down, Papi.

215
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,027
A lot has changed since then.

216
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,391
Acapulco is the war zone.

217
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,609
I'm dropping you right
in the middle of it.

218
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:30,760
Here.

219
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:32,870
Direct line to yours truly.

220
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:36,304
If you need to you just press #
and phone home.

221
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:37,457
For calls, text..tweets.

222
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,473
Machete, don't tweet.

223
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,637
You do now.

224
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:44,833
Ready for this?

225
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:14,538
Alright!

226
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,690
For all of you new girls..

227
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,126
It's special 'Pussy Tuesday'.

228
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,474
Keep your panties dropped on your legs
spread and your snatch well oiled.

229
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,931
Cos your not walking
any straight lines tomorrow.

230
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:29,146
Cos you know,
every jerk off

231
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,546
low life from this side of your grande

232
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,610
is gonna barge through that door

233
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,425
as soon as the sun comes down.

234
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:38,660
So, get em off and get them out.

235
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,393
And ladies, every stiff

236
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:46,667
pecker partners pays to play.
No freebies.

237
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,775
Those are house rules.

238
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:52,175
Throw on something.
In five minutes.

239
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:55,488
You are early, handsome.

240
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,120
But then, again...

241
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,807
the early bird gets the fresh head.

242
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,421
I'm looking for a girl.

243
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:05,233
- And i'm looking at a guy
that came to the right place.

244
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:06,000
Pick your poison.

245
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:08,553
This is the one, I want.

246
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:13,642
Why this one?

247
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:15,465
The best in Mexico.

248
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,337
Have a seat on the couch, Sugar boy.

249
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,489
I'll go fetch her, for you.

250
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,050
Where is the girl?

251
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,634
Upstairs.

252
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,151
Room 6.

253
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:54,114
But don't go.
You'll miss the big show.

254
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,562
Kill him!

255
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:17,888
Who the fuck are you?
- Machete.

256
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:22,529
I've heard nice news of you.
You want me to get something?

257
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,586
Take me.

258
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:26,737
Now.

259
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,327
I said, No freebies.

260
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:44,983
You know, the first thing we are taught
is how to defend ourselves.

261
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:47,354
Anyone of us could've killed you.

262
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,705
You think my mom had fight?

263
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,731
Mendez is gonna cut you like a Gay man.

264
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:54,679
- That was your Mother?

265
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,300
You are here to kill him, aren't you?

266
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,872
Look, don't be a fucking hero man.

267
00:22:01,284 --> 00:22:03,722
Mendez is many things.
But, merciful is not one of 'em.

268
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:05,882
He will skin you alive,
if you lay your hands on me.

269
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,183
I am his <i>'Cereza'</i>.
His Virgin.

270
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,754
Mendez isn't who you think, he is.

271
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:15,985
The terrible things he did.
He did it for perfectly greater good!

272
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:19,021
What he truly wants,
is a better Mexico.

273
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,994
Mechete, you have to promise me.

274
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,892
Spare his life.

275
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:24,045
And help him.

276
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:26,327
Please, Machete?

277
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:28,978
If you've ever loved anyone.

278
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,774
You would understand.

279
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:42,605
Do nothing. Say, nothing.

280
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:43,609
I'll handle it.

281
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:48,678
Who is this?

282
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,252
He's a bodyguard.

283
00:22:50,627 --> 00:22:56,291
Mother's orders.
Go ahead, Zoren call it in.

284
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:15,554
See, here's the thing.
He's lost his mind.

285
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,265
There are two sides to him now.

286
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:22,496
Somedays, he is Mendez -
<i>The Revolutionary</i> fighting for the people.

287
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:23,648
In other days...

288
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:25,867
He is Mendez -
<i>The Mad Man</i>.

289
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,027
Relieving his Cartel glory.

290
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,540
Its a toss up, which one
you are gonna get.

291
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:34,137
So, he'll either hug you
or he will kill you.

292
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:37,115
His condition gets worst everyday.

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,225
Boss has a message for you, Machete.

294
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:53,994
End of message.

295
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:21,306
Look..what the little whore dragged in.

296
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,284
Machete Cortel!

297
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,087
Yes, i've heard your story.

298
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,099
People still sings songs about you.

299
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,159
Raise your hand...!
If you've sung a song -

300
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:37,002
about our friend, Machete here.

301
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,587
The only son of a bitch needs
praise a song around here,

302
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,484
is me.

303
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:53,637
Tell me, Mahchete..

304
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,047
What did you think of my Cereza?..heh

305
00:24:56,844 --> 00:24:59,984
It's a shame, I had to let her go.
But, by bringing you here...

306
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,643
She betrayed me.

307
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:05,141
She was trying to save you.

308
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,294
You know what this is?

309
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:11,959
This is the end of my I-plan to
fire off the ass of the united states.

310
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:13,086
Why Mendez?

311
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:16,782
Cos our people don't need
songs or stories.

312
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:18,923
They need 'action'!

313
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:20,709
There is other ways.

314
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:22,725
The motherfuckers run this country.

315
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:24,588
The corrupt politicians..

316
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,479
The media hiding the truths...

317
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,685
The Cartels..killing anything and anyone
who stands in their path.

318
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:31,442
The U.S -

319
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:33,457
is responsible for a lot of these.

320
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,015
Since, they will take care of their
part of the problem;

321
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:39,587
We will send our part of the problem,
to them!

322
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,512
You are crazy.

323
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,196
I know why, you are here, Machete.

324
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:49,729
You work for the enemy now, huh?

325
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:55,681
I got news for you, <i>Cabron</i>.

326
00:25:56,143 --> 00:25:57,533
Killing me ain't in the card.

327
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:00,779
Cos I am,
the king fucking wrath

328
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:02,929
of Mexico, Motherfucker.

329
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,991
Thanks to my good Doctor here.

330
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:08,180
The missile's launch system,

331
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,024
is linked...

332
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,748
right into my heart.

333
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,446
So, if my heart stops beating.

334
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:18,445
Washington will become
the bright shining light, we always thought it was.

335
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:21,889
I'll disarm it.

336
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,429
There is only two men in the world
who knows how to do that.

337
00:26:27,322 --> 00:26:28,321
Correction- One.

338
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,190
Who's the other one?

339
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,597
The one who created this beautiful device,
of course.

340
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:33,744
Since, he lives in the U.S

341
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,305
I'm afraid you are fucked.

342
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,406
You have failed.

343
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,861
Machete, don't fail.

344
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,815
What you gonna do?
You wanna kill me?

345
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:00,029
I ain't gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill your men.

346
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:02,616
Steal your chopper and
get you over the wall.

347
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:03,767
- Leave him to me.

348
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,433
Find the other one,
who can disarm you.

349
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:09,567
Shoot me!

350
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:18,269
Let me take care of him.

351
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:21,983
Please.

352
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:48,342
Even if we get out of here alive,
my men are instructed to put a bomb through my head.

353
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,039
Ten Million dollars.

354
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:54,659
The best part is...

355
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:59,581
Fail safe - my ticking heart.
We just went live.

356
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:02,003
We got 24 hours my friend.

357
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,310
That 10 million dollars,
if the assassins don't get it..the cartels will.

358
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,851
- Yeah?
- What's the status?

359
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:01,004
Is he dead?

360
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:03,638
I have Mendez in custody,
in the chopper.

361
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:05,934
He is alive.
- Wait a second.

362
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:10,901
Machete..

363
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,111
What's this i hear about you having
Mendez in custody?

364
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,072
- Thing's got complicated.
- No shit.

365
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:16,224
You were supposed to take him out.

366
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,226
not give him a joy ride,
and get him some lollipop.

367
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,756
Damn it!
I didn't recruit you for your sense of compassion.

368
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:22,000
Machete..Kills!

369
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,089
That's what he does.

370
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:25,242
He doesn't save..the bad guys.

371
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,127
Now, shoot that Motherfucker!

372
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,279
- If he dies, you die.

373
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:32,299
The Missile's wired to his heart.
- Come, come again?

374
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:35,102
- Machete, can it be disarmed?
- Only, where it was made.

375
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:41,074
- Voztech.
- Voztech is the biggest weapon supplyer to our military.

376
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:42,985
You wanna bring him back
all the way to the fucking manufacturer?

377
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:47,362
I need your help getting him across the border.
This part is upsetting me.

378
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:48,390
- I'm feeling it.
- Not happening.

379
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:51,999
The last time i sent a black ops team into Mexico,
they got dead and i got the Oval Ass fuck.

380
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:52,968
You are on your own, Machete.

381
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,821
We cannot help you, until you're
out of Mexico, You hear me?

382
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:57,601
Now, get the hell out of there,
As fast as you can.

383
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:01,154
Machete, double time it to the border.
I'll assist you as much as possible..

384
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,503
But you've got to
move your ass!

385
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:19,539
What happened?

386
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,147
You don't remember?

387
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:27,477
I'm in this condition, I am afraid..

388
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,437
I seem to switch my personality, unexpectedly.

389
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:33,736
- You tried to kill yourself.

390
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:37,010
You strapped a bomb to your chest.

391
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:41,014
The fail safe defense are

392
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,768
already in motion.

393
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:45,986
I am Marcos Mendez.

394
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,453
Leader of the revolution.
And you are?

395
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,651
- Machete.

396
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:55,802
- I've heard of you. People sings songs about you..
- We've had this talk already. C'mon, get up.

397
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:58,725
- I didn't hurt anyone, did I?

398
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,192
You had Cereza Killed.

399
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,456
aaah..

400
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:07,913
Then, i must..

401
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,255
i must die.

402
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:14,419
I'd lay down my life, for the cause.

403
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:16,005
And if you choose to be in my company,

404
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,290
I fear, you will become
a casualty as well.

405
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,935
Come on.

406
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,414
You should've kept up with your
spanish there, son.

407
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,081
Sounds like, we maybe able to string up
this <i>Pi�ata</i> after all.

408
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:15,370
Let's get on it, Clayborn.

409
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:29,997
You wouldn't happen to have
a popsicle to stick up my ass would you?

410
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:36,816
A martini...extra dirty.

411
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,531
..two olives..
- all we have is tequila and chango.

412
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:41,682
Right.

413
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,946
For a moment there, i forgot
i was in the blackhole of sophistication,

414
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,358
Chango it is.

415
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:52,916
Although, your new selection of mexican beer
is not what brings me here.

416
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,068
- So, what does?
- You do, Carlos.

417
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:02,904
But it can't be.

418
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:04,817
They say, you don't have a face.

419
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,087
They say, you don't exist.
- I may not exist...

420
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,166
But this gun, does.

421
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:10,318
You don't have to do this.

422
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,901
You can tell whoever hired you,
that i'll give back the money...

423
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,711
- This isn't about the money, Carlos.
It is about my employer...it's about ethics.

424
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:22,615
Now, if i don't shoot you square in the face,
I will be violating a...

425
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:24,354
contractual obligation and all that...

426
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:29,236
'Don't' beg emotional confrontation makes me
very uncomfortable.

427
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,281
How much for the chango.

428
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:35,329
- fifty cents.
-I'm gonna give you seventy five.

429
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,096
Do you have a change for a dollar?

430
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,793
I don't know where the hell
we are.

431
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,526
Excuse me?

432
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:11,007
We are a little lost..
any chance you could steer us to Leon?

433
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:12,976
I could.

434
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:16,504
The trouble is..
you've seen my face.

435
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:18,728
And I have just changed.

436
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:28,460
I'm truly sorry, Ma'm.

437
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,739
It's just a matter of time and place,
not being in your favour.

438
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,569
Man eater.

439
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,193
That's what they used to call me
when i was just little girl.

440
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,655
I didn't know what that meant.

441
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:04,959
That never stopped my daddy,

442
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,252
coming into my bed
after a night of drinking.

443
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:12,465
So, one night...

444
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,903
I gave him what he deserved.

445
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:21,539
I chewed his balls off with my teeth.

446
00:36:24,222 --> 00:36:25,452
The next day..

447
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:29,639
I went to school with pieces
of him, still in my braces.

448
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:34,488
I became what he always
said I was.

449
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:35,898
A Man eater!

450
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:43,723
I despise men,
I can't trust them.

451
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:47,330
And that pussy clouds their minds.

452
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:50,922
And now my little Cereza lays dead

453
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:54,081
Because of that reason.

454
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:59,127
And that's where you come in.

455
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,181
Just a random selection.

456
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:05,491
And that you might be,

457
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,008
You still remind me of my own Papi.

458
00:37:16,457 --> 00:37:17,428
Madam?

459
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,722
-Yes?
- We found them.

460
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,115
Mendez and Machete.

461
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,267
- Bring me my Double Ds.

462
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,430
Gather all the girls.

463
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,830
We are going to avenge..
my Cereza.

464
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:42,127
You read my mind, Machete.

465
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:46,390
Yes, yup yup.
This is the perfect place for my last meal.

466
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:55,006
Give me and my friend here,
a plate of your finest Cabrito.

467
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:55,923
And..

468
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:58,927
give us some bread and wine too.

469
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,079
Thank you.

470
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:25,774
See, Machete..

471
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:28,653
You are the only one,
who doesn't want me dead.

472
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,473
What the hell are you doing
back in Mexico?

473
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:46,705
Your federale brothers were very upset
that you abandoned us in the heat of battle.

474
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:50,546
I heard you moved to The U.S
cleaning rich people's pools huh?

475
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:51,696
Put the gun down.

476
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:52,849
He is a murderer.

477
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,974
He killed 13 Federales,
in cold blood.

478
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,172
13 crooked Federales.

479
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:58,359
Buried in Quertos pocket.

480
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,778
How the fuck would you know that, Puto?

481
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,955
- I was undercover.

482
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:04,100
- an agent.

483
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:07,681
There's no agents in Mexico.

484
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,866
- Last and only,
super agent.

485
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,331
Give me one good reason,  i shouldn't shoot
him like a dog that he is.

486
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:16,853
If he dies, thousands in Washington
would die with him.

487
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,914
- And if he lives..
how many more would die?

488
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,067
And why help the U.S?

489
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:22,541
- Cos, i'm the only one who can.

490
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:25,641
- You were always a sensitive one, Machete.

491
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:29,270
- Wow, hoah..bloody hell!
It's a Mexican Stand off.

492
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:31,988
I am taking him in.
- Oh, really where?

493
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:34,301
You will trade me,
straight to the Cartels.

494
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:39,168
Machete, this man is a dirty cop.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

495
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,321
Shut up,<i> Loco</i>.

496
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:41,471
- You shouldn't have said that, Amigo.

497
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:44,756
Because if you call me loco-

498
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:45,908
Than i'm afraid..

499
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,544
loco is what you get.

500
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,836
- Hello again, Machete.
- Say one more word...

501
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,704
Make sure you better make it, Machete.

502
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,934
All you have to do is
pull the fucking trigger, Come on.

503
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,799
See Machete..

504
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,419
Justice and law,
are not always the same thing.

505
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:32,446
What the fuck is going on here?

506
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,883
Look at me, top scores.

507
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,320
Forgive my excitement,
but i'm just learning to speak Spanish.

508
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:40,472
Not by choice.

509
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,065
But i can't get the CD to change
for the life of me.

510
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:44,628
Fuck it,
When in Rome, right?

511
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:48,288
I'm trying to find a place call..
Villa Gerrero.

512
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:49,786
Perhaps, you've heard of it?

513
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:53,090
You haven't heard of it?
or <i>No se</i>..you don't understand the question?

514
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:56,598
<i>Un momento?</i>

515
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:59,176
Allow me to use more
useful illustration.

516
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:00,716
I'm really trying here.

517
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:05,407
And if you say 'No Se' one more time,
i'm gonna put a bullet in your brain.

518
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,330
Out of sheer frustration.

519
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,911
Now, Villa Guerrero?

520
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:19,292
Your sense of direction doesn't inspire
confidence in you.

521
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:26,289
Allow me to translate.

522
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:36,850
Damn!

523
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,547
I was just starting to get used
to this face.

524
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:36,724
<i>El Doctoro?</i>

525
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:46,929
Get the fuck out of here,
I'm performing surgery.

526
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,015
Put him in the bed, there.

527
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,868
Where are they?
- Still inside.

528
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,152
Okay, i need you to check the rear.

529
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:17,832
Machete!

530
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:20,073
Come out and play.

531
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:41,834
What's the hurry, Lover boy.

532
00:45:02,642 --> 00:45:04,014
Ugh..disgusting.

533
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:18,557
So, i'm still alive.

534
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,749
Good for you Machete.
Good for you.

535
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:24,557
Is this the crazy you, talking?

536
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:28,648
I can't continue living my life like this.

537
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,715
- You used to be Cartel.

538
00:45:30,907 --> 00:45:33,630
And then, you became a revolutionary.

539
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:36,752
- Why?
- I was never Cartel.

540
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:41,596
I was a Secret Agent,
for the Mexican Government.

541
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:43,996
My mission,

542
00:45:43,996 --> 00:45:46,647
was to infiltrate Los Querpos.

543
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:47,798
I had to see things..

544
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,517
I had to do things.

545
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:55,985
Had to watch people die
in the worst way you can imagine.

546
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:58,727
Compromising the only thing
i believe in.

547
00:45:58,919 --> 00:45:59,880
I became one of them.

548
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:06,155
I remember, calling my supervisor;
telling him that i wanted out..

549
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,711
I wanted my life back.

550
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:11,358
But i didn't know he was dirty.

551
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,245
That he'd been bought by the cartels.

552
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:17,583
They took me to a killing room.

553
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,253
With my wife and daughter there, waiting.

554
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,288
They made me watch.

555
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:29,113
First they beat them.
Tortured them.

556
00:46:29,305 --> 00:46:30,264
Then, that's when..

557
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,504
The Mad Man took over for the first time.

558
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:40,221
My wife and baby girl died
b'cause i trusted our system that did not exist.

559
00:46:41,474 --> 00:46:44,255
I realised then, If i was to change Mexico

560
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,030
I must do it myself.

561
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,181
I started my own revolution
against same reason motherfuckers

562
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,969
responsible for this violence.

563
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,369
I will die to see it through.

564
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,769
The real tragedy of all this is that

565
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,891
people would never know the
real truth about me.

566
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:06,094
How about you?
Does anybody know the real Machete?

567
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:09,589
Where is your partner?
Every guy has a partner.

568
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:12,612
You couldn't give up the life, can't you?

569
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:13,857
Think about it.
How old are you?

570
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,936
In your line of work...

571
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,466
Why have you lived so long?

572
00:47:18,658 --> 00:47:19,617
Partners knew about self sacrifice..

573
00:47:20,398 --> 00:47:21,793
for the greater good.

574
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:22,945
Not you, though.

575
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:25,392
You know what you are?

576
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:26,543
Vengeance.

577
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:30,196
You are vengeance.

578
00:47:30,388 --> 00:47:31,348
A vengeance never dies.

579
00:47:40,452 --> 00:47:42,730
We will never make it to the border wall
with this piece of shit.

580
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:45,768
We need a stronger vehicle.
An armored vehicle.

581
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:47,860
I know where we can get one.

582
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:48,823
Small town near the border.

583
00:47:49,015 --> 00:47:51,452
There's a chop shop there.

584
00:47:56,714 --> 00:47:57,885
Once he crosses the border.

585
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,662
We can move in.

586
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:11,728
Come on.

587
00:48:13,543 --> 00:48:16,403
Come on, we gonna cross the wall or what.

588
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:22,201
This is a cartel turf,
you let us right to it.

589
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:23,353
Shhh.

590
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:39,980
Looking for a ride.

591
00:48:40,623 --> 00:48:44,199
Well, this lane..
you're best off fucking rent a car.

592
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:46,575
This is all custom works.

593
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:48,284
I will do as he says, Grasa.

594
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:50,693
Well, look at this.

595
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:52,834
Marcos Mendez

596
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:55,720
in the flesh.

597
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:56,872
This will do.

598
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:58,024
No shit. It will do.

599
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,919
That baby is my fucking masterpiece.

600
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:04,325
You could take it to a mine field
with flat tyre.

601
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,017
You aren't gonna shoot a man
in a wheel chair, would you?

602
00:49:22,757 --> 00:49:24,522
- No.

603
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:20,403
Hola, Motherfucker!

604
00:50:52,657 --> 00:50:53,977
Hey there, loverboy.

605
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:00,971
Hey there, give them hand.

606
00:51:02,554 --> 00:51:04,397
I've got a special package for him.

607
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:05,550
Killjoy...

608
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,692
give me my strap on.

609
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:28,580
Ho..ho ho! Fuck Machete..

610
00:52:28,973 --> 00:52:30,316
You're crazier than I am!

611
00:52:37,584 --> 00:52:39,000
Machete, what the hell are you doing?

612
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:43,114
- Is there other way?
- There's no other way..

613
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:46,095
that's why they call it a wall..
goddamn it.

614
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,890
Take 'em away.

615
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,109
See that frigging tag under the wall,

616
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,113
drive us straight through it.

617
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:53,263
The heat is to the other side..

618
00:52:59,506 --> 00:53:00,653
Hit it.

619
00:53:31,486 --> 00:53:32,505
We made it.

620
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:36,498
Well, sweet Isabel.

621
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,159
I think we just hit a fucking stroke...

622
00:53:38,879 --> 00:53:39,790
Beginner's luck.

623
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:41,889
Running into you again, Taco.

624
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:45,805
You know, you and your compadre are
going for about 10 million buck to rooster head.

625
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,604
I never understand anything about Algebra..

626
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,044
That is a..shitfire..

627
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:52,183
fuck me..Halleluijah lot of Money.

628
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:55,188
I think, we ought to take advantage of
your lucrative predicament.

629
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,165
Get ourselves to squares.

630
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:00,209
No distractions, this time.
Right, Clebourne?

631
00:54:00,401 --> 00:54:02,508
That's right, sir.
- Alright then,

632
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,087
Sayonara Taco.

633
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:25,607
Special Agent, Mendez.

634
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:27,486
How many of you are there?

635
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:28,639
- Sorry, that's classified.

636
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:33,628
And who is this?

637
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:36,871
My wanted party.

638
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,412
You didn't think, it would all be over
once we cross the border did you?

639
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:50,829
Who do you think got me into Mexico,
in the first place?

640
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:55,037
There's a great conductor
behind all this.

641
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:42,955
<i>Why re-elect President Rathcock?</i>

642
00:55:43,147 --> 00:55:47,171
<i>He dished out 6 Million dollars
on tax payers money to space technology company </i>

643
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:48,323
<i>like Voztech industries.</i>

644
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:52,295
<i>He build a wall to protect us
from the thread of illegals.</i>

645
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:54,823
<i>He took a stand and defended
our second ammendment. </i>

646
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:55,975
<i>with a vengeance.</i>

647
00:55:57,739 --> 00:56:00,181
<i>And to boost our national economy
to an all time high...</i>

648
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:02,979
<i>He made marijuana legal
in 48 states.</i>

649
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:04,234
My fellow Americans...

650
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:06,073
It's been a groovy four years.

651
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:07,674
There are still so much
left to accomplish.

652
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,697
For me, winning..
was only the begining.

653
00:56:10,698 --> 00:56:13,098
Re-elect Rathcock.

654
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:15,921
A name you like,
A face you can trust.

655
00:56:32,452 --> 00:56:34,102
Don't worry Mr.Cortez

656
00:56:34,756 --> 00:56:36,589
You haven't fail your Mission, Yet.

657
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:42,349
- Where am I?

658
00:56:42,704 --> 00:56:46,045
- Recuperating in my subjuest healing pool,
right now..you like it?

659
00:56:46,784 --> 00:56:49,183
As you can see,
our friend Marcos Cortez is still...

660
00:56:49,184 --> 00:56:53,466
very much alive and ticking.

661
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:55,616
Which makes him still very much,

662
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:57,446
a threat.

663
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,813
It needs to be disarmed.

664
00:56:59,572 --> 00:57:02,681
You don't know what you're dealing with.
- Well, Actually I do.

665
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:07,846
I invented it.
Allow me to introduce myself..My name is

666
00:57:08,498 --> 00:57:10,899
Luther Voz.
Let me admit..

667
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,434
i've been following your career for
quite some time now.

668
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:15,739
I am tremendous fan of
your work Mr.Cortez.

669
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:17,868
As an afficionado of ' The arts of War' myself;

670
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,880
I just gotta say that,
you're one genuine article

671
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:23,268
Genghis Khan of My caliber.
Fucker, people lover.

672
00:57:23,695 --> 00:57:25,318
You are a warrior Mr.Cortez.

673
00:57:27,017 --> 00:57:29,435
A killer. A survivor..
llike me.

674
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:33,516
Just try to relax.
I mean, if i wanted you dead..

675
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:35,320
you will be fucking dead.

676
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,020
Are you gonna disarm it or not?

677
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,122
I'm leaning towards not.

678
00:57:40,495 --> 00:57:42,319
But that all very much
depends on you, Mr.Cortez.

679
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:45,631
You sold Mendez the Missile.

680
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:47,368
No.

681
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,048
I gave it to him.

682
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:52,367
But then, i've given a lot of bad things
to a lot of bad people.

683
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,247
But that does not make me
one of them.

684
00:57:55,114 --> 00:57:56,728
Get dressed, Mr.Cortez.

685
00:57:58,196 --> 00:57:59,243
Allow me..to try and convince you.

686
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:03,170
I'll turn my back.

687
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,185
Welcome, to The Voztech.

688
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:13,584
The world's premiere space technology..

689
00:58:13,585 --> 00:58:15,984
and weapons manufacturer.

690
00:58:15,985 --> 00:58:17,934
You know, Time Magazine
once called me...

691
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:21,293
Merchant of dead.
With an assembly line.

692
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:24,201
But one very special  day,

693
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:28,148
I began to think bigger.
And now..i've turned science fiction

694
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:30,385
into science reality.

695
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:34,283
And this...this is where
we conduct our training exercises.

696
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:36,289
for what?

697
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:38,219
Our exodus.

698
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:41,569
When NASA asked me to build them
a new state of the art luxury space station...

699
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:44,086
I luxuriously told em,
to fuck themselves.

700
00:58:44,277 --> 00:58:45,237
Why you ask?

701
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:47,197
Well, i've already told one of my young,

702
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:48,350
It's already up there right now.
Just floating the fuck around,

703
00:58:48,413 --> 00:58:51,777
waiting for me and my people.
To inhabit it.

704
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:53,484
In fact, Mr.Cortez,
- Machete.

705
00:58:53,676 --> 00:58:54,636
Incidentally, Machete

706
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:58,859
I plan on moving into my new space pad,
very very soon. Im very excited.

707
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:00,357
Here, have a heart.

708
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:01,510
What about the heart?

709
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,713
Well, that's why i'm relocating.
Climb aboard.

710
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:10,967
Tanks, Missiles..
bread and butter.

711
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:16,245
These are simple things,
to fund my out of this world, enterprises.

712
00:59:16,437 --> 00:59:18,479
Why Mendez?
- Why?

713
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:22,607
Well, Bin Laden is dead.
And America has always needed it's boogy man.

714
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,962
So, i created a new one.

715
00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:30,411
Yes, I supplied Senor Mendez,
the fireworks.

716
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:32,803
But given Mendez aptitude
for the unpredictable.

717
00:59:32,995 --> 00:59:36,325
I left behind one of my man
to keep a press of his process or

718
00:59:36,516 --> 00:59:37,476
lack there of.

719
00:59:37,668 --> 00:59:38,629
What's your plan have to do with me?

720
00:59:38,821 --> 00:59:41,239
I have high hopes for you, Mr.Machete.

721
00:59:41,431 --> 00:59:43,867
Higher than you can mentally ascend to.

722
00:59:49,343 --> 00:59:52,863
Space ship?
- Technically speaking, space shuttle.

723
00:59:53,055 --> 00:59:54,802
Not to mention,
my legacy.

724
00:59:54,994 --> 00:59:56,975
It all started about
six years ago.

725
00:59:57,167 --> 01:00:00,076
I privately funded a sub orbital launch.

726
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:01,344
I went up, Myself.

727
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:04,426
Yeah, i'm something of a thrill seeeker
back then.

728
01:00:04,618 --> 01:00:07,190
Before, what i like to call
The Incident.

729
01:00:07,382 --> 01:00:09,755
I was up among the stars

730
01:00:09,947 --> 01:00:12,028
and something inexplicable happened to me.

731
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,764
I saw the future.

732
01:00:13,956 --> 01:00:14,916
I saw the world ending.

733
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:17,898
It unfolded right before my very eyes.

734
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:22,037
That's why,
i build this.

735
01:00:22,229 --> 01:00:23,188
We'll board it.

736
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,336
Me and anyone
who wants to join me.

737
01:00:25,528 --> 01:00:26,488
We will take the flight.

738
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,640
And when Kingdom comes...

739
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,792
as it truly will.

740
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:31,847
We will be safe amongst the stars.

741
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:34,242
Noah had his Ark..
i got mine.

742
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:36,622
You really believe that?

743
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:40,384
I believed what i've seen.
And luckily for you, sir..

744
01:00:41,248 --> 01:00:43,400
I saw you up there, with me.

745
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:45,520
I see glimpses of what lies ahead

746
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:48,948
this is a condition i was left with
after the incident.

747
01:00:50,752 --> 01:00:56,032
Speaking of which,
I'd take a step or two back if i were you.

748
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:57,875
Ever had a Deja Vu?

749
01:00:58,432 --> 01:01:02,426
Last a couple of seconds, right?
Me..it's been two years.

750
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:06,599
You don't believe me now,
but you will.

751
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:12,252
Now, if i couldn't see into the future.
Then, how could i've made all this?

752
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:16,066
Mr.Machete, I present to you...
the arms for tomorrow.

753
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:22,114
Pick your fancy.

754
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:26,761
You picked the only one
in the place that's faulty.

755
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:30,198
I'm sorry, my molecular blaster

756
01:01:30,803 --> 01:01:32,157
doesn't quite work right yet,

757
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:33,625
keeps turning shit inside out.

758
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:39,010
Perhaps, this is more your speed anyway.

759
01:01:39,885 --> 01:01:42,534
Retro..yet,
high tech.

760
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:44,280
Demonstration?

761
01:01:50,847 --> 01:01:53,397
You like it?
- Yes.

762
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:54,101
It's yours.

763
01:01:54,552 --> 01:01:57,954
Now, Mr.Machete..if i could cut to the..

764
01:01:58,146 --> 01:01:59,679
I'd like to recruit you.

765
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:03,797
You already have enough men.
-No, not the best. By any means.

766
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:06,924
How can they be?
When you've dominantly played em yourself.

767
01:02:07,116 --> 01:02:08,074
Demonstration.

768
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,786
Good luck.

769
01:02:43,568 --> 01:02:47,322
Ha..ha, Encore. Encore.

770
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,575
or three.

771
01:02:53,188 --> 01:02:58,007
Genetically engineered super soldiers, you see.

772
01:02:58,199 --> 01:02:59,160
Cloned.

773
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:05,910
Have at 'em.

774
01:03:38,217 --> 01:03:39,692
Just as I predicted!
No match..

775
01:03:40,697 --> 01:03:43,712
For the likes of you.

776
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:49,019
I've created my clones.

777
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,900
Because where I am going,
I'm going to need my army.

778
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,239
And that poor dead bastard you've met in Mexico.
Zaror? He was my prototype.

779
01:03:57,141 --> 01:03:59,715
But since you've fucked him up
like a special at science fair project.

780
01:04:00,894 --> 01:04:03,600
I'm left to regret my choice.

781
01:04:03,832 --> 01:04:05,659
You still haven't told me,
Why i am here.

782
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:08,850
I need a stronger speciment from
which to draw on new batch of clone.

783
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:11,696
So, i was hoping that you,
would be doing me that honour. Sir?

784
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:13,605
There is only one Machete.

785
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:15,745
But what if they were more?

786
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,887
What if there was an army with enhanced Machetes?

787
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:22,481
Machete. Machete, everywhere Machete.

788
01:04:22,673 --> 01:04:26,040
You and I, together?
Will be a force to be recon with.

789
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,163
I'm sorry. I may have over reacted.
But then,

790
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:39,724
numbnuts was about to spill a bottle
of 1787 Chateau LeFrig.

791
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,470
No more games.

792
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:43,395
Disarm him.

793
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:44,547
- Join me.

794
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:47,673
Surely, by now..
that i know how all this turns out.

795
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:49,480
Then, you know i'm taking this.

796
01:04:49,672 --> 01:04:50,554
Oh, and where will you go?

797
01:04:51,293 --> 01:04:53,764
You know, i am the only one
that can disarm it.

798
01:04:54,068 --> 01:04:55,613
I'll find someone else.

799
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:56,764
Oh, good luck with that.

800
01:04:57,256 --> 01:05:00,113
But i think, there's one more
little thing that you should know.

801
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:02,508
Mendez wasn't my only Boogey man.

802
01:05:03,092 --> 01:05:06,305
North Korea, Russia..
I have a Mendez everywhere.

803
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:09,198
And in a matter of an hour,
they're gonna launch on one another.

804
01:05:09,649 --> 01:05:14,162
Throwing the world into,
gargantual, unrecoverable anarchy.

805
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:17,653
The world is fucked.
- Why?

806
01:05:17,845 --> 01:05:21,458
This world must end,
in order for a more perfect one to emerge.

807
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,549
You like it or not, Mr.Machete.
You are coming with me.

808
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:51,456
Damn, you're good.

809
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,130
Get that bastard.

810
01:05:53,322 --> 01:05:56,198
Try not to get too many
of yourselves killed in the process.

811
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:37,701
My molecule blaster just doesn't work
right yet.

812
01:06:39,419 --> 01:06:41,707
Keeps turning shit
inside out.

813
01:08:14,478 --> 01:08:17,456
What took you so long?
- You're lucky, i came at all.

814
01:08:25,906 --> 01:08:28,046
Oh, we'll meet again Mr.Machete.

815
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:31,416
I have seen it.

816
01:08:34,498 --> 01:08:36,629
We've been tracking you
since the bounty hit the air-wave.

817
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:39,355
Quite a shit storm
you've stirred up down south.

818
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,685
I thought i'd tap in.
Can't let you have all the fun.

819
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:46,344
Hey, I'm sorry about Sartana.

820
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,408
We all are.

821
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:50,347
She was one of the good ones.

822
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:54,945
As you can see,
the network has gone full scale.

823
01:08:56,194 --> 01:08:59,764
New and improved.
All 500,000 extractions.

824
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,874
and counting.
When they put up the wall.

825
01:09:03,355 --> 01:09:06,644
We had to up our game.
Find funding...

826
01:09:06,837 --> 01:09:10,554
Now, our reach extends all the way
to Santi tower.

827
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:14,999
The rules are the same.
You get in, you gotta earn.

828
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:17,936
The monitor remembers
to make sure they're doing their part.

829
01:09:18,484 --> 01:09:19,684
If they are not..

830
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:21,585
I will deport their asses myself.

831
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,287
Missing..all of them?

832
01:09:27,978 --> 01:09:31,904
MIA - every last one of 'em.
One minute they are tearing ass for the border.

833
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:33,258
The next..

834
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:35,149
they vanished.

835
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:36,897
Disappeared,
without a trace.

836
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,457
It's like aliens..
abducted by god damn aliens.

837
01:09:41,379 --> 01:09:42,522
You gotta check this out.

838
01:09:43,366 --> 01:09:49,078
This is the surveilance footage
we got.

839
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:51,872
We think, the same douchebag that took you.
Took them.

840
01:09:52,544 --> 01:09:54,272
Seems llike he's building some sort
of secret weapon.

841
01:09:54,972 --> 01:09:57,439
Possibly, needing the mexicans labours to finish it.

842
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,589
It's in space.

843
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,321
He wants to get there,
before the missiles take off.

844
01:10:01,513 --> 01:10:03,239
What missiles?
What the fuck are you talking about?

845
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,907
The launch trigger is wired to a biological clock.

846
01:10:07,155 --> 01:10:08,855
We need to find someone
to disarm them.

847
01:10:09,286 --> 01:10:10,332
You got anybody in the network?

848
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:14,951
- Yeah. But you don't like him.

849
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,005
Osiris!

850
01:10:34,994 --> 01:10:37,055
Come on Machete..He's with us.

851
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:39,496
- Not with me.
- He's our only bomb guy.

852
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:41,252
Wanna choke him out, go ahead.

853
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:47,426
What's he doing here?

854
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,612
- He came to me about six months ago.

855
01:10:50,803 --> 01:10:51,756
Said, he's changed his tune.

856
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:53,618
Cabron ain't got no tune.

857
01:10:54,194 --> 01:10:58,336
I know that you'd prefer to see me,
with all sorts of dead.

858
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:00,433
But God has already cursed me
for what i did to Padre.

859
01:11:01,854 --> 01:11:03,170
That's why i am here.

860
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:05,512
To finish your brother's work.

861
01:11:05,982 --> 01:11:08,699
My only redemption is in
righting that wrong.

862
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:11,454
Please, give me mercy.
I swear...

863
01:11:11,828 --> 01:11:12,847
I will make it upto you.

864
01:11:14,017 --> 01:11:15,544
- or die, trying.

865
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:17,588
- i'll have it no other way.

866
01:11:19,527 --> 01:11:23,469
- This is your bomb guy?
- You could try the yellow pages.

867
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,901
You better be at somewhere with a shit
reception b'cos i've been trying to reach you all damn day.

868
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:33,053
Where is Mendez?
- Dead.

869
01:11:33,245 --> 01:11:35,599
But his heart still beats.

870
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:36,751
- You're joking, right?

871
01:11:36,701 --> 01:11:38,238
Machete, don't joke.

872
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:41,856
Humour me,
who's got the heart?

873
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,007
- Voz. He is bad news.

874
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,671
Been using Mendez to do all of his dirty works.

875
01:11:45,863 --> 01:11:47,369
- Machete, I'm gonna stop you right there, okay?

876
01:11:47,561 --> 01:11:50,410
Luther Voz may have his hand in
a lot of pockets. But he's harmless.

877
01:11:50,793 --> 01:11:52,464
He sponsors my damn pageant for Christ's sake.

878
01:11:53,002 --> 01:11:54,451
You need to alert the president.

879
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,183
Just calm down.
Tell me your location...

880
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,086
and we'll talk about this in person.

881
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:00,144
Better be somewhere else.

882
01:12:00,336 --> 01:12:01,296
Have it your way.

883
01:12:01,469 --> 01:12:04,651
I'm gonna text you a rendevous point
after my swimsuit competition.

884
01:12:10,204 --> 01:12:11,308
Who's the bitch?

885
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:12,682
Handler.

886
01:12:17,778 --> 01:12:19,398
You fucked her?

887
01:12:21,868 --> 01:12:22,694
Yeah, you did.

888
01:12:23,721 --> 01:12:26,493
You got a problem?
- Yeah, i got a problem.

889
01:12:26,685 --> 01:12:27,645
When you smell like pussy...

890
01:12:28,022 --> 01:12:32,298
It makes you a pussy whip.
When you are pussy whipped, your judgement is cloudy.

891
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,792
It's just a job.

892
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:36,249
Is that her?

893
01:12:38,265 --> 01:12:39,629
I thought Machete don't text?

894
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:44,535
Machete loves everybody.

895
01:12:49,025 --> 01:12:51,206
Where are you going?
- With you.

896
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:54,562
Takes a bitch,
to make a bitch.

897
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:56,523
And i smell fish taco.

898
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:58,097
Tito..Osiris?

899
01:13:00,258 --> 01:13:01,295
Taco time.

900
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:25,994
What'cha know?

901
01:13:27,309 --> 01:13:29,250
.. I won.
- Congratulations.

902
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:30,402
It's exciting right?

903
01:13:30,555 --> 01:13:32,005
You are looking at the new miss Texas.

904
01:13:32,561 --> 01:13:34,096
Who are they?

905
01:13:34,288 --> 01:13:35,247
Listen, Careno..
I would love to stay and chit chat with you.

906
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:39,374
But not when there's a live missile
inside state lines.

907
01:13:39,567 --> 01:13:42,944
Would you pretty please, get into the car
and debrief me on your mission.

908
01:13:45,675 --> 01:13:47,363
How did you know?
- Know what?

909
01:13:47,555 --> 01:13:50,100
The missile..that it was here?

910
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:51,253
Look at you...

911
01:13:53,268 --> 01:13:55,869
smart for an average mexican.

912
01:13:56,176 --> 01:13:57,693
- You work for Voz?

913
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:02,086
- I promised to turn you over to Voz
and Voz promised me the crown.

914
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,223
But i can win.

915
01:14:10,595 --> 01:14:13,120
Oh, Papi i'm sorry.

916
01:14:14,358 --> 01:14:16,095
You and I really could have something.

917
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:18,870
But i just love
killing a good romance.

918
01:14:21,663 --> 01:14:23,890
Make it count.

919
01:14:48,195 --> 01:14:50,489
I knew i smelled a bitch in there, tonight.

920
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,047
Payback is the only bitch
that you need to worry about.

921
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:56,442
This dress cost more than your fucking life!

922
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,617
I always dress to the nine.

923
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,446
I dress to kill.

924
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:48,781
How many man do we got?

925
01:16:42,022 --> 01:16:43,279
This is The President.

926
01:16:43,472 --> 01:16:45,409
Mr.President, this is Miss San Antonio.

927
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,742
Machete, never shown up to therendezvous.

928
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:50,385
I just hope that he is still alive.

929
01:18:26,004 --> 01:18:27,248
Fuck it.

930
01:18:28,387 --> 01:18:32,669
Who am I kidding?

931
01:18:34,857 --> 01:18:38,227
I really must hand it to you,<i> Mi Amigo</i>.

932
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:41,308
You are a difficult man to catch up with.

933
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:44,791
You have no idea,
what i went through to get here.

934
01:18:44,983 --> 01:18:47,827
Hours i spend stranded
on the desert highway.

935
01:18:48,019 --> 01:18:50,209
Till this holy rolly break came along.

936
01:18:57,072 --> 01:18:59,471
Lady, please help me.

937
01:18:59,472 --> 01:19:03,889
You and i aren't drug pushing compadres.
You'd just derail my pursuit..

938
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:07,756
so, frankly..i'm leaning on
the other direction entirely.

939
01:19:07,948 --> 01:19:08,908
Give me mercy.

940
01:19:09,032 --> 01:19:11,432
There's about three things i'd rather give you.

941
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:13,831
And they are all on the chamber of this gun.

942
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,767
Straight up or with some flare.

943
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:22,971
Straight up or flare.

944
01:19:23,489 --> 01:19:26,417
Whatever is the more interesting way to die.

945
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:33,358
Weirdo.

946
01:19:53,842 --> 01:19:57,061
You know, i rather enjoy
my new disguise.

947
01:19:57,454 --> 01:20:00,468
I must apologize for making you dig your
own grave.

948
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:07,034
But i'm not one for hard labour.
You on the other hand..being mexican and all

949
01:20:08,465 --> 01:20:10,596
You must be used to it.

950
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:16,000
Holy fucking...

951
01:20:31,695 --> 01:20:34,808
People, did you see a mexican guy?

952
01:20:35,556 --> 01:20:39,327
Drop it. Before i put this thing in your face..

953
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,860
You have it all wrong.

954
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:49,004
This is all a big mistake.
- The only mistake you made was dancing across the border muchacho.

955
01:20:49,456 --> 01:20:51,855
You don't understand.

956
01:20:51,856 --> 01:20:53,673
I am no mexican.

957
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:54,825
Don't move your hands, amigo.

958
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:59,001
Sir, really. Listen to my voice.

959
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:00,015
Do i sound mexican?

960
01:21:01,014 --> 01:21:02,386
I am from Ontario
for fuck's sake.

961
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:07,924
Canadian and Mexican...
Double whammy.

962
01:21:08,315 --> 01:21:10,001
Let's smoke this fool.

963
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,735
Doc Felix needs to see him right away.
- Machete.

964
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:01,617
You are back.

965
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,945
Sorry about the smell.

966
01:22:07,473 --> 01:22:09,748
Did you know an average person pass
a gas 14 times a day?

967
01:22:10,469 --> 01:22:11,332
It's true.

968
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,720
Our target..Luther Voz.

969
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:17,467
The same proper fuck who's been jacking our members.

970
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:21,661
As we speak, he's got a missile pointed
right up our ass.

971
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,165
And since it looks like
no one else is gonna stop him;

972
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,613
It's on us.

973
01:22:28,036 --> 01:22:31,570
Machete's mission with Voz
has nothing to do with us.

974
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:32,451
We are the network.

975
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:35,139
Our Mission is Mexico.

976
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:36,291
Our mission has changed.

977
01:22:36,483 --> 01:22:37,444
He is right.

978
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:41,511
I am going alone.
- You're not going anywhere, without me Cabron.

979
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:43,453
No time to argue.

980
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:44,603
Fuck that.

981
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,992
Let me explain something..Miherte.

982
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,210
This isn't about Mexico, no more.

983
01:22:51,959 --> 01:22:53,379
It's about the world.

984
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:57,807
No world...no Mexico.

985
01:22:57,999 --> 01:22:58,958
Count me in.

986
01:22:58,861 --> 01:23:03,073
Me too...me too.
- Ditto.

987
01:23:03,265 --> 01:23:05,418
VIVA MACHETE!

988
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:10,757
Looks like it's settled, Machete.

989
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:11,908
When do we hit him?

990
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,375
- Tonight.

991
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:24,684
-Network one in position.
- network two in position.

992
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:51,222
<i>Ladies and Gentleman, your host...
Mr.Voz.</i>

993
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:03,816
My fellow travellers, my friends...

994
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:07,422
I proudly present..
The Millenium One.

995
01:24:07,614 --> 01:24:09,674
Ready to launch right on schedule.

996
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:11,060
Now, before long...

997
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:15,204
We'll be transported to heavens
on a maiden voyage of a titanic proportions!

998
01:24:15,395 --> 01:24:16,954
And once, the world is purged.

999
01:24:17,664 --> 01:24:22,983
We'll return to bring about..
A new world..TOGETHER!

1000
01:24:27,553 --> 01:24:30,447
In a moment, the boarding process
will begin. But first, my friends...

1001
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:31,459
prepare for infinity.

1002
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:35,895
Reveal your new selves to me.

1003
01:24:45,802 --> 01:24:49,152
Why don't you tell them the truth?

1004
01:24:50,026 --> 01:24:51,284
Tell them, you orchestrated all this.

1005
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:53,069
The missiles, the heart...

1006
01:24:53,933 --> 01:24:57,666
Would someone please.. help the help.
He seems to be lost.

1007
01:24:57,858 --> 01:24:58,607
Tell them, if the world ends.

1008
01:25:00,106 --> 01:25:02,638
You are the one who ended it.

1009
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:05,351
How can this be?
This isn't supppose to be happening.

1010
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:06,691
I never saw this.

1011
01:25:08,342 --> 01:25:10,564
Machete happened.

1012
01:25:10,756 --> 01:25:13,365
Look, this is no time for second thoughts.

1013
01:25:13,574 --> 01:25:16,202
The end is near,
I assure you.

1014
01:25:16,394 --> 01:25:17,939
For you.

1015
01:25:18,674 --> 01:25:20,680
Let's do this.

1016
01:25:27,945 --> 01:25:32,121
Well, ladies and gents.. I had hope to have
an unhibited evening. But..

1017
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:34,867
now it seems..

1018
01:25:35,058 --> 01:25:36,019
Guard!

1019
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:10,747
What in the fuck is that?

1020
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:15,158
I'm more of a cherry bomb, matchstick kinda guy
you know.

1021
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,694
Semtex..TMT.
50/50 shot on a good day.

1022
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:20,155
But this..

1023
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:36,314
Never mind..
we are alive.

1024
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:40,939
It's a shame. I have to kill you now
Mr.Machete.

1025
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,755
You gotta go.

1026
01:26:45,931 --> 01:26:47,657
Go in style now.

1027
01:27:39,752 --> 01:27:41,090
Well now.. what can i say.

1028
01:27:41,283 --> 01:27:45,574
I suppose, we both
like getting our hands a little dirty.

1029
01:27:54,494 --> 01:27:56,045
You can't beat me, you know?

1030
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,197
I know your every move.

1031
01:27:58,334 --> 01:28:00,734
Even before you do.

1032
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,636
Nobody knows Machete.

1033
01:28:09,336 --> 01:28:11,208
That's true. Ever since, i've met you..

1034
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:14,059
the future has been more unclear. And that,

1035
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,140
that puzzles me.

1036
01:28:31,195 --> 01:28:37,125
I assure you i'm every bit
as merciless as what you are..

1037
01:28:37,318 --> 01:28:39,829
Demonstration

1038
01:29:32,154 --> 01:29:33,873
How poetic,

1039
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:37,501
Now you really are the blind,
leading the blind.

1040
01:30:26,814 --> 01:30:30,355
Alright folks, let's keep it moving.
Form a single file line, one after another.

1041
01:30:30,547 --> 01:30:31,507
Thank you.

1042
01:30:41,098 --> 01:30:43,921
Keep your hands in the strap and hold on tight.

1043
01:31:15,099 --> 01:31:16,445
Really?

1044
01:31:17,433 --> 01:31:18,547
You're gonna make me kill a blind chick?

1045
01:31:21,065 --> 01:31:22,572
The Press could her my crown for that.

1046
01:31:22,764 --> 01:31:26,460
That's alright, they will just give it
to the next bimbo, who spreads like virus.

1047
01:31:38,678 --> 01:31:40,377
Alright, darling.

1048
01:31:41,927 --> 01:31:43,058
You wanna tango...

1049
01:31:45,182 --> 01:31:46,284
let's tango.

1050
01:31:46,475 --> 01:31:48,779
Mano-a-mano Motherfucker.

1051
01:31:58,735 --> 01:31:59,841
Watch it now, pussycat.

1052
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:03,693
That's not a very lady like
kinda thing to say.

1053
01:32:03,884 --> 01:32:05,501
I don't do lady like.

1054
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:14,329
So, what is it?
You're just a regular old cranky bitch , with a PMS.

1055
01:33:27,934 --> 01:33:29,853
ah..it appears we have a stray.

1056
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:35,915
and where oh where might our
mutual aquaintance be at this moment?

1057
01:33:36,107 --> 01:33:39,085
Pissing on your study day,
you're fucked with the wrong mexican.

1058
01:33:39,278 --> 01:33:43,879
Indeed i have. However, in 20 second..
none of them would matter. But you..

1059
01:33:44,071 --> 01:33:46,745
you're still in pickle.
Anyway, you slice it.

1060
01:33:46,938 --> 01:33:49,185
I can't see,
but i can still kick your ass.

1061
01:33:49,377 --> 01:33:52,485
That's why i'm taking you with me.

1062
01:34:21,206 --> 01:34:22,885
This is your captain speaking.

1063
01:34:23,077 --> 01:34:28,106
I apologize in advance for the discomfort
you may experience during our travel.

1064
01:34:28,298 --> 01:34:30,944
But we are unforeseeably overbooked.

1065
01:34:31,404 --> 01:34:32,938
So, please hang on.

1066
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:35,359
And try to enjoy the flight.

1067
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:41,833
See you in space, Mr.Machete.

1068
01:35:31,222 --> 01:35:32,269
Machete, i got your message.

1069
01:35:32,461 --> 01:35:33,421
We were able to stop the other missiles.

1070
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,869
Where is that son of a bitch, Voz?

1071
01:35:37,928 --> 01:35:43,684
Are you telling me that ...
is out there flipping with weapons and shit?

1072
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:47,512
I got a wild idea.
Just hear me out.

1073
01:35:47,513 --> 01:35:52,228
I can put you, in a space A Rocket.
Top of the line.

1074
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:56,576
You go, up in the space...

1075
01:35:59,351 --> 01:36:00,890
I'll do it.

1076
01:36:01,082 --> 01:36:03,808
Your country thanks you.

1077
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:15,356
Good luck, Machete.
Get the Bastard.
