1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,900
Jay.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
- Jay?
- What? What's wrong?

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,200
You're snoring.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,900
Me? Oh, I'm sorry. I...

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,400
Look at her!

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,500
Come on. We said no
Stella in the bed.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Oh, but she's just
a little puppy.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,600
She probably got
scared and snuck in.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,400
Oh, really? How come
when Manny has nightmares

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,100
you don't let him
snuck in the bed?

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Gloria, it's 6:00 in the morning.
Can we talk about this later?

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
Answer the question, Jay.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You know, I'm gonna
check the lease,

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,100
but I'm pretty sure we're
not allowed to have a meth lab.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
You are a delight.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
So what are you doing?

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,300
I think you're gonna like this.
I'm going on a juice fast.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,100
Mmm. Love it.

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Hate it. Let's face it,

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,000
a well-fed Cam is hardly
a model of emotional stability.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Now deprive him of food,
and stage by stage,

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
it's a slow descent
into madness.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,800
Stage one-- the clean sweep.

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,000
Poison.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Poison.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,100
Poison.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,400
Do you think that this is
the best week to be doing this?

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,800
- Why not?     - Well, we have that
charity thing at my boss'  house.

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, so what, I'm supposed to
put off my quest for wellness

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
until we're no longer
socially in demand?

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
That will never happen.
I'm too charismatic.

32
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,000
No. No. Not the cookies.

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,000
Of course the cookies.

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,400
Why do you always
want me to fail?

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
Stage two-- attack Mitchell.

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,400
Because when his diet
crashes and burns

37
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,800
into a giant pile of Nutella,

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm the one he's gonna blame.

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,100
Well, no, not this time.

40
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,300
You know what? I'm gonna
do the fast with you.

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I think it's a great idea,
and we should do it together

42
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,600
so we're on the same team,
you know, us versus food.

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,000
I know what you're doing...

44
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,600
And I really appreciate it.

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,500
No, it'll-- it'll be good for me.
I've actually put on a few pounds.

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to say anything.

47
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,300
<i>As the stock market plummeted,</i>

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,000
<i>brave young men took to the skies,</i>

49
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,200
<i>ushering in the golden</i>
<i>age of the daredevil.</i>

50
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,000
How awesome are people?

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
So awesome.

52
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,000
You wanna get that,
buddy? I'll pause it.

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,100
- Hey, Luke. How's it going? I--
- Hey, Uncle Mitchell.

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,400
I really can't talk. I'm
trying to watch a movie.

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,600
Oh, okay, well, I just wanted
to drop off this bag of junk food.

56
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,700
- Go on.
- Uh, Cam and I are on a juice fast,

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,100
so having this stuff in the house--

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,300
- I connected the dots. See ya.
- Oh.

59
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,600
Seeing that weird,
wonderful little man

60
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,600
pursuing his dream of walking
on a tightrope made me think

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,200
maybe I could pursue my dream...

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
Here you go, buddy.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,900
Of walking on a tightrope.

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,200
come on, Dad! You got this!
You can do this!

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,400
- Stay focused! Stay hungry!
- You okay, buddy?

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
What? Yeah, hell, yeah, no.

69
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,300
Just proud of my Dad!

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,100
There was a lot of
chocolate in that bag.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Phil, honey, you gotta
take Luke to school.

72
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,000
Got it.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Okay, I haven't fallen three
out of the last four times.

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
This afternoon, we go airborne.

75
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,600
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Mm!

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Sitting all by
yourself at the table.

78
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Now where have I
seen that again?

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh, right. Every day
in the school cafeteria.

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,700
- I do that by choice.
- The school's choice.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Isn't that your nickname?

82
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,400
Haley, be nice to your sister.
Alex, good save.

83
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,200
- Mom, sign this.
- What is it?

84
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,200
They finally bumped me up
to the harder math class.

85
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,400
Third period, Mr. waters.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,300
What? No, Mom, you cannot
sign this. This is my class.

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,700
You're a freshman. What are
you doing in second-year math?

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,300
You're a senior. What are you
still doing in second year math?

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,900
Not "still!"... Again."

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Alex, be nice to your sister.

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,100
Haley, not a good save.

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
I knew it would suck
having you at my school.

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,500
Well, hang in there.
A couple more years,

94
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,500
you'll have it all to yourself
again. Come on, girls.

95
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,900
Jay, look at this.

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,500
It's ruined. Stella did this.
She chew on my shoe!

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400
You have to discipline
that stupid dog.

98
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,800
I discipline her all the time.

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,100
Oh, really? How? By buying
her little cupcakes?

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
They're not real cupcakes.

101
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,400
They're doggy treats in
the form of cupcakes.

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, you should have told
that to Manny before he ate one.

103
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Oh, come on. His coat
never looked better.

104
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
You wouldn't find it so funny
if she was destroying your shoes.

105
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,400
Well, I don't leave my shoes
laying around, so...

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,500
So it's my fault that she
chooses to chew my shoe?

107
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,900
I didn't say that.
You barely said it.

108
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,900
- You have to stop coddling her.
- I don't coddle her.

109
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
What?

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,300
She tries to drink
the water. It's funny.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,100
You don't look at me in class.
You don't text me.

112
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,500
Who would text during a class?

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,600
What are you?

114
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Hon, I realize that this situation
is not ideal for either one of you,

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,200
but sometimes we just
rise above things.

116
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Yes?

117
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Excuse me. Did you notice the
curb here is painted yellow?

118
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,100
Uh, no, I did not.

119
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,900
Wow. It means loading
and unloading.

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Okay, well, I was just
dropping off my kids.

121
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,300
And yet I see no kids
emerging from the vehicle.

122
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,900
Well, we were chatting.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wow.

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,200
At the risk of surprising
you a third time, officer,

125
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,800
I've been dropping off
here for years, and I--

126
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,400
- Move it.
- Okay. You betcha.

127
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
What was her problem?

128
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,700
Oh, you know what you
should have said to her--

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Nothing. I should have said
nothing would be the point.

130
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,500
I have to see her every day.
I mean, why make it worse?

131
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

132
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,200
Awkward, unpleasant situation--

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,600
Rise above.

134
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,900
Have a nice day.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,300
- Yeah.
- Love you!

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,100
Bye-bye!

137
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,900
"And yet I see no children
emerging from the vehicle."

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,500
How'd you like to see my
fist emerging into your face?

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh! Now I think of it!

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,600
Day four of the juice fast,

141
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,100
and I'm hungry, but I'm--
I'm feeling pretty good.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Cam, on the other hand,
has gone all...

143
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,200
"Girl, interrupted."

144
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,200
After one, throwing out
all of our food,

145
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,000
and two, blaming me,

146
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,500
he entered stage three--
soap actress.

147
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
I just wish my sister would
put herself out there more.

148
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,800
She has so much to offer.

149
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Why are men so superficial?

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,800
That was followed by stage four--

151
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
a rush of epiphanies...

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,700
I... don't... need... food.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,300
Look at this.
Architecture is everywhere.

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,100
Oh. Spaniards make
amazing athletes.

155
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,900
Into stage five-- despair...

156
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,800
Daddy, we hided,
but you didn't seek.

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,700
Cam?

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
Then came rage.

159
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,400
Oh. Ow.

160
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Oh.

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,800
Hey. Whatcha got there?

162
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
The good news is,

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Cam's never made it this far
into a diet before, so...

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Downside-- I have no idea what
the next stage is gonna be.

165
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,500
But I'm pretty sure it's not
charming party guest.

166
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,200
Cam, I-I was thinking, I'll take the
bullet tomorrow night at my boss' house.

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,100
You don't have to go to the party.

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,500
They're-- they're boring.

169
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,300
Silly cause, you know,
lots of people.

170
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Parking...

171
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,300
- Cam, say something.
- Why do you hate me?

172
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,198
I don't hate you.

173
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,200
Then why are you trying to
push me out of your life?

174
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,500
Because you--
you seem a little...

175
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,300
Unhinged.

176
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay, well,
you know what I think?

177
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
You should worry a little
bit less about me

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,500
and a little bit more about yourself
and what you're gonna wear tomorrow night,

179
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,300
because I saw what
you have laid out,

180
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,100
and I don't think you're gonna
like the way you look in photos.

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Well, I hadn't landed on that.

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,500
Her hand's in the air,
like, every five seconds,

183
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,500
and she actually reminded
Mr. Waters to assign homework.

184
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,000
The class loved that.
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

185
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,300
Not as embarrassed as I was

186
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
when she said 8 was
a prime number. 8, Mom.

187
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,800
Okay, fine. You know what?

188
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm gonna call the school today
and have your schedules changed,

189
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,200
but I want you to know a little
part of me died today, okay?

190
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,200
I thought the two of
you could understand

191
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,800
how being in the same class
would benefit you both.

192
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
Alex, you--
you could've tutored Haley.

193
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Haley, you could've helped
Alex with her social skills.

194
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,500
Come on. The two of you
could've been two Super Dunphys.

195
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,700
And instead, what are you?
Two bickering half-Dunphys,

196
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
and I'm the fool
that expected more.

197
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,300
No, I don't even want to hear it.
Just go upstairs. Go.

198
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Wow. What was that?

199
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,200
That was a master
class in parenting.

200
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,600
Right now our daughters are upstairs
making a decision they think is their own,

201
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,500
but really, it was an idea
that was skillfully implanted by me.

202
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Inception, Claire.

203
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,300
- Dangerous game, but I like it.
- Mm.

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,300
- What are those?
- Wire walkers.

205
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,300
You want to go to the dance,
you gotta wear the shoes.

206
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Luke, grab your camera.

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Luke.

208
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,900
I wasn't sleeping.

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,300
Honey, I-I think
those are... jazz shoes.

210
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
No. Tightrope shoes.

211
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,500
Got 'em at an estate
sale. Only worn once.

212
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
That-- that is not
a ringing endorsement for...

213
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh! Phil, honey.

214
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,900
Please be ca--careful. Right.

215
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,700
Watch the door.

216
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Hey, what'd you
get for number 3?

217
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,000
You're not going to learn
if I just give you answers.

218
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,800
Well, what if I gave you
something in return?

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,100
Like what?

220
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
You can talk to me in class.

221
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,600
I want lunch at the cool table.

222
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,300
Then I want all the answers.

223
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,500
Then I want a week at the table.

224
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
- That'll cost you two pop quizzes.
- A month.

225
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
- The midterm.
- Deal.

226
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,500
Looking great, Dad.

227
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,700
With these steps,
I break the surly bonds...

228
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Chicken in a basket!

229
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't look at me.

230
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
- Mom. Mom. Mom.
- What? What? What? What? What?

231
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,900
Mom. Did you call
the school yet?

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,900
Uh, not yet, but
I was just about to.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Uh, Bartles & Jaymes!

234
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,400
Good. Because we are thinking
we might want to stay in that class.

235
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,400
Really? Oh, girls,
I don't know about that.

236
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,400
- Oh, please let us try it.
- Super Dunphy?

237
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,200
I can't hold her!
I can't hold her!

238
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Well, maybe one more week.

239
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,000
Thanks, Mom.

240
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
I don't know. Uh, a cup
of soup, a Cobb salad.

241
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, it had bacon.

242
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Cam, I don't have all day to
describe all my meals to you.

243
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Stop eating all my things,
you stupid animal.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,100
No, Cam, not you.
I'll call you back.

245
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,900
Bad doggy!

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
You want to chew on something?

247
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay. Okay. Okay.

248
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
Look at this.

249
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,600
Look at this delicious
man shoe. Eat it.

250
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,500
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.

251
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Mmm! Yummy.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Eat the shoe.

253
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Eat his shoe. Come on.
Eat his shoe.

254
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Num, num, num, num. Num, num.

255
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah, like this. Look. Ah.

256
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,000
Delicious.

257
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,800
Mom?

258
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
Drop it.

259
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,400
- I--
- Please. I'm sorry you had to see this.

260
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,700
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Mrs. Dunphy.</i>

261
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
<i>This is Rose in</i>
<i>the principal's office.</i>

262
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,300
- <i>Can you hold for Principal Weller?</i>
- Yes.

263
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,600
- <i>Hi, Claire.</i>
- Hi, John. What'd she do this time?

264
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,900
<i>Actually, I've got</i>
<i>both of them in here.</i>

265
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,800
Both of them? Really?

266
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>Alex was letting</i>
<i>Haley copy her homework.</i>

267
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,100
- <i>Mr. Waters caught them.</i>
- I-I don't believe it.

268
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,800
<i>I'm about to have a little talk with them,</i>
<i>so they'll be out a few minutes late.</i>

269
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
Um, I'm so sorry,
John, and honestly,

270
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,000
I-I really am a better
mother than this. I promise.

271
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
<i>So you've said.</i>

272
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Mm-hmm.

273
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
Seriously?

274
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,600
Seriously?? Oh. You...

275
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,200
Excuse me.

276
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,400
Hey, um, what the hell is this?

277
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,100
This zone is for
loading and unloading,

278
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,300
not for talking on the phone.

279
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, I know, but I was
talking on the phone

280
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,500
to the school that my kids were
about to come out of, so...

281
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Are you aware this
zone has a time limit?

282
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,800
N-no, I'm not.

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,400
Wow.

284
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,700
You know what? I do want
to do some unloading.

285
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,000
I know your type.

286
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Life has been bad to you.
It has made you feel small.

287
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,500
And then one day somebody
gives you a fake cop outfit,

288
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,000
a toy badge and
a little spongebob tie.

289
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,200
Suddenly it's payback time, right?

290
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Well, I got news for you,
"Law & Order: Special Parking Unit,"

291
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,100
not my fault.

292
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,000
- I'm really sorry, Dad.
- Oh, it's all right.

293
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,200
Everybody throws up at school.

294
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,300
If I had a nickel for
every time I puked at school,

295
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,900
you know how much
money I'd have?

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,100
35 cents.

297
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Exactly. Now go get cleaned up,
and I'll call the doctor.

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wait, Dad, I don't need a doctor.

299
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,200
What's up?

300
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,200
The other day, Uncle Mitchell
brought over a bag of junk food

301
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,500
so he and Cam could
do a Jew fast.

302
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,100
- Juice fast?
- I'm pretty sure he said "Jew."

303
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,900
But anyway, I took the bag,
and I hid it, and I ate it all.

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,100
Oh, buddy.

305
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,800
I couldn't help myself.
I'm weak. Don't look at me.

306
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,300
It's all right.

307
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,100
It's okay. Hey, you
learned a lesson.

308
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,400
A painful lesson.

309
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,300
I guess we both have.

310
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,900
What do you mean?

311
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,300
I always saw myself as a guy who could
soar through the sky, dancing on a wire.

312
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,600
I can't even get across
1/6 inches off the ground.

313
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Well, maybe that's the problem.

314
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,000
Maybe you keep falling because part
of you knows that you can fall.

315
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Maybe if the wire was much,
much higher, you wouldn't fall.

316
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,900
Oh, Luke, Luke, Luke.

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,500
You are a genius.

318
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Come on. We got work to do.

319
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,600
- Yes! Can I have a doughnut first?
- Yes, you can!

320
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,600
Ah, there they are,
my Super Dunphys.

321
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,800
We're sorry, but we just--

322
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,200
Unh-unh-unh.
You don't get to talk.

323
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,900
You had a chance to be
better people today.

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
You, to be more well-rounded,

325
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,500
and you, to be
a better student.

326
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,500
You could have elevated the Dunphy name,
but instead, you chose to tarnish it,

327
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,700
so, congratulations, ladies,

328
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
you brought this
family to a new low.

329
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,200
- Mom, are you--
- Yeah. Yeah, I am,

330
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,700
and I would actually like to get
these loosened up, if I might.

331
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,300
- Are we gonna have any more trouble?
- No, ma'am.

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,100
Oh, Claire, do you need
me to drive the girls?

333
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
All good, Janet. All good.

334
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,600
Goat cheese Risotto ball?

335
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,500
No, thank you.

336
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Are you sure? They're so good.

337
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,900
Walk away.

338
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,700
It's tough enough to deal with
Cam when I'm at full strength,

339
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,200
but I have been fasting
just as long as he has,

340
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,900
and I do not have the energy to
deal with a big, needy brisketcase--

341
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,100
brass-- basketcase.

342
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,400
Cam! Don't be mad at me,

343
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
but I think that you really
need to eat something.

344
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,500
What?

345
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
You're supposed
to be my support.

346
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,900
Oh, away from me, temptress.

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,400
And I never thought I would call
you that in a negative way.

348
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,600
I've seen her do
a lot of crazy stuff,

349
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
but this is a whole new level.

350
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,200
Is this a people cookie?

351
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
You're good.

352
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
A definitive "yes" or "no"
would be appreciated.

353
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,900
Those cupcakes did a number on me.

354
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,700
Are you happy?

355
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
You have reduced me to
a person who eats a shoe.

356
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,000
- Gloria, sit.
- You think this is funny?

357
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,600
To talk to me like I am a dog?

358
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm not talking to you
like you're a dog.

359
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm just asking you to sit so we
can get to the bottom of this.

360
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
Okay, fine.

361
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,500
Good girl.

362
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,100
Come on. You set me up.

363
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Gloria, why are you
acting so crazy?

364
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,200
It's just a little dog.

365
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,100
It's not the little dog
that is making me crazy.

366
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,700
It's you that is making me crazy.

367
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
- Me?
- Yeah, you used to put me first.

368
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,000
You used to want
me in that shower.

369
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,200
Should I be here for this?

370
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,700
No, Manny. It's okay. I go.

371
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
But I want you to know this.

372
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,500
Where I come from,
men cherish woman.

373
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,500
It goes wife, mistress, dog.

374
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,700
Dog always at the bottom.

375
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,400
As you can imagine,
I get asked to help,

376
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,900
uh, with a lot of
these environmental causes.

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Usually, I buy a ticket,

378
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,600
uh, bid on
Shaquille O'Neal's big shoe...

379
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,400
And, uh, come home.

380
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,000
But then, something happened.

381
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,000
I love paddle surfing,

382
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,800
and each time I'd go out,
I'd see this one sea lion.

383
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
He'd pop his head up.
He'd check me out.

384
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,500
I got so used to seeing him,
I even named him-- Snorkels.

385
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh, God, I do not like
where this is going.

386
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,900
So one day, I, uh, I go
out and I see Snorkels.

387
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,700
But he's doing this weird
twisting thing in the water.

388
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,500
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Shh, shh.

389
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
So I paddle over, and I see
he's got a plastic grocery bag

390
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,500
wrapped around his neck
and one of his fins.

391
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,900
And I freaked, tried to get
it off with my paddle.

392
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It didn't work,
so I-I jumped in,

393
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,800
but he disappeared under
the water. And, uh...

394
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
Don't say it.
Don't you dare say it.

395
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,300
- And I never saw him again.
- Ohh.

396
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,100
This is the saddest
thing I've ever--

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,100
Mitchell, are you okay?

398
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Of course I'm not okay.

399
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
None of this is okay.

400
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,100
Okay, well, you need
to pull yourself

401
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,900
together 'cause we're
at your boss' house.

402
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,300
He drowned, Cam!

403
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Is he all right?

404
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,300
Yeah, yeah, I just think
he needs a little air.

405
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,800
You know who else needed air?

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Snorkels!

407
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,400
Excuse me.

408
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Snorkels?! Where
are you, Snorkels?!

409
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
- Mitchell, get back here!
- Oh, Snorkels!

410
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,800
Mitchell, what is
wrong with you?!

411
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
What do you think is wrong
with me? I'm starving!

412
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,200
Well, if you're starving,
then just eat something!

413
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,800
I can't eat something because
then you'll get mad at me,

414
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,400
and we're at my boss' house!

415
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm not gonna get mad at you!

416
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,900
I appreciate what
you're doing for me!

417
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm doing it for you.

418
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,900
Oh, you don't have to
do anything for me.

419
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,100
I love you just
the way you are.

420
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,500
I love you just
the way you are.

421
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,900
- I got you! I got you, babe!
- Okay. Okay. Thank you.

422
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,200
I got you!

423
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
- Cam, I can walk. I can walk.
- I got you!

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,100
I think Mitchell may just
be a work friend.

425
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,300
I let down my Mom and Dad today,
and... worse than that,

426
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
I let down my teacher.

427
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,400
It's all my fault.
Everything I touch turns to Detention.

428
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

429
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Me, too.

430
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Oh, I don't really have a whole lot
of moral high ground to stand on.

431
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,500
I wasn't exactly my
best self today either.

432
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,200
All in all, not a great
day for the Dunphys.

433
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,400
Come on, Dad!
Believe in yourself!

434
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,300
You're making the
impossible unimpossible.

435
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,000
Phil. Oh, my God.

436
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,500
Don't even bother.
He's in the zone.

437
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,800
- He can't hear you.
- Go, Dad!

438
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,300
You got this!

439
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,500
<i>All week long, I'd been telling my girls</i>
<i>how to act instead of showing them,</i>

440
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>but not Phil.</i>

441
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,400
<i>Phil could have said,</i>

442
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,200
<i>Or "Haley, challenge yourself.</i>
<i>Don't give up so easily."</i>

443
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,400
<i>But instead of talking the talk,</i>

444
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,400
<i>Phil walked the walk.</i>

445
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,100
<i>And isn't that what we're supposed</i>
<i>to do for the people we love?</i>

446
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,500
<i>It's definitely a challenge...</i>

447
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,400
<i>But Phil made it look easy</i>
<i>seven feet off the ground.</i>

448
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,500
You're awesome!

449
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Oh, my goodness!

450
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,500
Turns out, I've had my
Super Dunphy all along.

451
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
Yeah!

452
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,800
What was on my mind as I
was walking across that wire?

453
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,600
I kept thinking,
if I can do this,

454
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,800
then I've got two ways of
getting across my yard.

455
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,100
Did you have fun?

456
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,500
Yes. She's the cutest dog
in the whole world.

457
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

458
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,200
Let's go find your daddies.

459
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,500
We're in here!

460
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh, my God. These
cupcakes are so good.

461
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm so sorry.
We helped ourselves.

462
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
We were so hungry.
They are delicious.

463
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,100
I love that they're not
too sweet, you know?

464
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Mmm. Mmm. They
taste almost like pate.

465
