1
00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:03,796
<i>We're beginning our initial
descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</i>

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:04,995
<i>Thank you for flying United.</i>

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:06,875
Reckon we'll be landing soon.

4
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:09,961
Phil, honey, you promised--
not till we got there.

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,944
This year, we're going
to a dude ranch

6
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,115
with the whole family.

7
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:16,648
Mm-hmm. The family.

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,897
What if Dylan buys his own ticket?

9
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:21,425
We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.

10
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,877
What if Dylan and I share a horse?

11
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:26,350
Mm, I hate landing.

12
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,431
We'll get through this.

13
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,496
Wow! Oh, my goodness.

14
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:35,827
What are you doing?

15
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,847
I want my ears to pop.

16
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:39,808
Try putting a little Rouge on 'em.

17
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:41,436
Nobody gets me.

18
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,493
Wow. Isn't this beautiful,
little cowgirl?

19
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:45,783
You hate her sparkly outfit,
don't you?

20
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:46,885
No, I told you, it's fine.

21
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,903
I just didn't like you
wearing a matching one.

22
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,610
So we haven't told the family yet,

23
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,934
but we've decided to
adopt a baby boy.

24
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:53,897
From America this time.

25
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:55,586
You might say
we're "buying domestic."

26
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:57,323
In private...
You might say that in private.

27
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,477
Our adoption attorney told us
it would be a good idea

28
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,565
to make a photo book to
show prospective moms.

29
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:04,707
Ues, but he thought that Cam's
version was a little too "artsy,"

30
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,497
so we've decided to take

31
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,161
a few rugged shots at the ranch
to, you know, balance it out.

32
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:09,830
I don't think it need
balancing out.

33
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:11,001
Really?

34
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:14,349
It's called "Production value."

35
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:28,349

36
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,709
Horse.

37
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,714
Look, Jay! So beautiful!

38
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:37,476
Your ears haven't
popped yet, huh?

39
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,914
I'm like the horse whisperer.

40
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:43,053
But something is making
this one skittish.

41
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:46,063
Whoa. Look at the mountains.

42
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,304
They're amazing.

43
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,790
I've never been this far
from home before

44
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:54,167
now I've never been this far.

45
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:55,907
Where's a cliff
when you need one?

46
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,522
Look, kids!
A real life cowboy!

47
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:00,424
Oh. Come see. Come see.

48
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:06,042
- Uh-oh.
- What's he doing?

49
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,748
Oh, my.

50
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,898
My name is Hank.

51
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,919
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch,

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,497
you're gonna ride, you're gonna
rope, and you're gonna shoot.

53
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:23,140
You're gonna see a sky
so full of stars,

54
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:25,497
it'll put your city lights to shame.

55
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:28,971
And when it's all done,
you might just encounter

56
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,094
a piece of yourselves you
never knew was there.

57
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,670
Are there any questions?

58
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:36,387
Uh, do we book spa
treatments through you or...

59
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,296
I like you, kid.

60
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,409
I'm gonna call you "Hollywood."

61
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,626
That wasn't an answer.

62
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,356
And who's this cactus flower?

63
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:47,430
What?

64
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,815
That's my wife Gloria.

65
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:51,761
Well, she's "Cactus Flower" now,
old-timer.

66
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:54,602
These, uh, these nicknames--
are they set in stone?

67
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,428
Okey dokey.

68
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,550
You ready, gunslinger?

69
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,841
I heard word of trouble
in these parts.

70
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,620
Pull!

71
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:08,480
That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?

72
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:10,055
You got a piece of it.

73
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:12,481
I've been practicing like crazy,

74
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:13,670
all my cowboy skills--

75
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:16,076
shootin', ropin'.
pancake eatin'.

76
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,044
Why? Because sometimes

77
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,322
I feel like Jay doesn't
respect me as a man.

78
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,563
It's just that when you say,
"Phil is my son-in-law,"

79
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:25,334
it sounds like you're saying,
"Phyllis, my son-in-law."

80
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,383
- That's ridiculous.
- Okay, who's your son-in-law?

81
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:28,873
Phyllis.

82
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,164
I'm not asking for a hug.

83
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:32,251
I just want to get that
look of newfound respect,

84
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:34,197
like...

85
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:35,598
Or...

86
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,954
Or... mm.

87
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:41,153
Yeah.

88
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,139
Check it out.

89
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,919
Two birds, one leg.

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,219
Pull it!

91
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,934
Not bad, eh, Old-timer?

92
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:56,270
Uh, see, slappy only
had three fingers.

93
00:03:57,928 --> 00:03:58,923
What?

94
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:01,628
He only had three fingers.

95
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,023
Who's next?

96
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,296
Oh, me. Me.

97
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:06,586
Oh, this is good. This is good.

98
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,862
Tres macho.

99
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:12,110
No smile. Don't smile. Good.

100
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,455
You ready?

101
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,440
Wait. Do I say "pull"?

102
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,940
Sorry. Sorry.

103
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:21,053
Mitchell, why don't you
go find Manny at the spa?

104
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,788
Wouldn't that be more fun?

105
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:27,731
I realized that if
I was gonna raise a boy,

107
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,073
I needed to butch up my life.

108
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,972
You know, I wanted to
be able to teach my son

109
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:33,748
all the things that
my Dad taught Claire.

110
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:45,686
Hey, Hollywood.

111
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,102
I don't love that.

112
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:48,588
Wanna see something?

113
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:50,802
Oh, my gosh.
Is that a firecracker?

114
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,018
Shh!

115
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:55,176
Now I just need to find the
perfect thing to blow up.

116
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:56,492
Is that thing even legal?

117
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,746
Not here. It's from Germany.

118
00:04:58,747 --> 00:04:59,994
If they had this during the war,

119
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,659
right now we'd all be
knee-deep in strudel.

120
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:09,947
Watch it!

121
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,128
What you doing, eh? You readin'?

122
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,363
Trying to.

123
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:14,740
I'm not so good at it either.

124
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,028
- I'm not surprised.
- That was a joke.

125
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:18,491
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.

126
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,449
You want to see
me do a cannonball?

127
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,155
I'd rather see you
get hit by one, but...

128
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,384
Ha. Good one, gorgeous.

129
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,374
Jay! Is this like the lobster?!

130
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,696
Do I get to pick one for dinner?

131
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,197
Because this one
looks very tender.

132
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:44,573
Look alive, Old-timer.
One of your calves is getting away.

133
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,726
Hey, something's wrong with
my horse. She's veering left.

134
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:48,611
When this happened to my
Uncle, it was a stroke.

135
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,304
Oh, there's nothing
wrong with Buttercup.

136
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,585
You just gotta let her
know who's boss!

137
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,377
Beautiful form, Cactus Flower!

138
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,161
Beautiful!

139
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,663
You look like a dadgum conquistadora!

140
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,463
She's deaf, but I can hear ya.

141
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:01,699
Why are you riding that way?

142
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,018
I'm afraid that cow over
there might bite me.

143
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,854
Oh, yes, he's gonna
come up and bite you

144
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,029
because your leg looks so
desirable with those--

145
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,633
are those canvas?

146
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:12,262
Okay, Phil, ease that one
back over towards me.

147
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,452
- Got it.
- Ease him back this way.

148
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,508
Hey! Piece of cake, huh, Jay?

149
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,371
- Huh?
- Ease that one over to Bossy.

150
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:19,709
Which one's Bossy?

151
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,536
- That's my nickname for your wife.
- Hilarious.

152
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:25,965
Go, Mom! Whoo!

153
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,711
Yeah, Mom! You rock!

154
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,528
Oh, I wish I had a rock.

155
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:33,059
Hey. It wouldn't kill you
to be nice to Dylan.

156
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,732
It might.

157
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:37,663
But, honey, I don't know why
you always stick up for him.

158
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,487
Haley can do so much better.

159
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,107
Because I know what it's
like to fall for a girl

160
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,948
whose dad thinks
I'm not good enough.

161
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:45,925
All right, you're right.

162
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:48,318
I can make more of an effort.

163
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,567
That's the woman I love.

164
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,296
We taking a little break over here?
Laying some pipe?

165
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:56,831
- No. Sorry. I was just talking to Bossy.
- Uh-huh.

166
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:57,998
- Phil!
- I'm sorry.

167
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,180
Jay, look! I got this one!

168
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,973
I got this one!

169
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:04,515
She's veering left again.

170
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:05,668
When we get back,
I'm gonna see

171
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,821
if she can track
a pencil with her eyes.

172
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:11,589
Okay, Lily, I'm going to
push you one more time.

173
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,783
Now don't kick me, okay?

174
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,954
Aah! Oh! Lily!

175
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,441
I said don't kick me. Okay?

176
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,809
You know it's your own
fault that's happening.

177
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,094
Why don't you try
standing behind her?

178
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,333
You are an idiot.

179
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,617
Oh, really? I ain't the one
getting kicked.

180
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,554
- Why are you following me?
- Why are you fighting me here, gorgeous?

181
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,565
This works.

182
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:38,319
I really, really don't appreciate

183
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,820
you calling me "gorgeous."

184
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:41,703
I just want to enjoy
time with my family,

185
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:43,665
so if you don't mind-- mm!

186
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,970
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.

187
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,423
You kissed a boy!

188
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:54,296
No, the boy kissed me.
Okay, Lily?

189
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,542
The boy kissed me.

00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,729
Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.

194
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,139
I was wondering if we
could have a little chat.

195
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,280
Oh. You want me to go home.

196
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:15,493
No, no. It's the--
the opposite of that.

197
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,181
I want you to go home?

198
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:23,543
No, I, um, I want you to know
how glad I am that you're here.

199
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,752
Really?

200
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,892
'Cause sometimes I just get
this vibe you don't like me.

201
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,276
Oh. Dylan, no. I'm sorry.

202
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,719
I-I like you.

203
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,559
I-I like you a lot. I just...

204
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,974
It's complicated because
Haley's my daughter.

205
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,991
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

206
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:45,120
You are totally a hot mom,
but I can't do this.

207
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:47,819
Oh, my God. Okay, we--
there's--no, no.

208
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,725
I merely meant that I'm sorry
if I made you feel unwelcome.

209
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,716
Whew! That would
have been awkward.

210
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:56,233
So awkward.

211
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,368
You know, but for the record,
Mrs. Dunphy...

212
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,007
Yes?

213
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,945
- If Haley wasn't my girlfriend...
- Yeah.

214
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:04,459
- And Mr. Dunphy was out
of the picture...   - Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,554
I would be honored
to share your bed

216
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:09,242
and raise Luke, Alex,
and Haley as my own.

217
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,098
Okay.

218
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,151
Good talk.

219
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:23,483

221
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,400
the song ended two minutes ago.

222
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,203
Well, I'll tell you what.
She could play Evita.

223
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:36,132
Really? You notice
the crickets left?

224
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,041
Anyone want more water?

225
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,627
Oh, Dad, I'll take one.

226
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,980
Heads up.

227
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:42,654
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh.

228
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,665
Oh. It was--it was dark.
I-I couldn't see it. Thank you.

229
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,651
So did you set off
the firecracker yet?

230
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:50,386
When I do, you won't have to ask.

231
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,644
First, all the
electronics will go out,

232
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:55,044
then comes the heat flash.

233
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,003
Afterwards, the living
will envy the dead.

234
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,565
And yet I'm the one
on the "No-fly" list.

235
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,368
You know what? Maybe next time
I'll just catch it

236
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,381
and then hand it to you.

237
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,176
Oh, okay. Yeah, let's do that.

238
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,203
You--you do everything,
and I'll do nothing.

239
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:09,500
Something on your mind?

240
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:11,888
This isn't the right
place to talk about it.

241
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:13,097
Okay.

242
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,314
I-I'm s--

243
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:17,680
I'm not sure if we should
have another baby.

244
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,693
What? Are you serious?

245
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:21,168
I think that we might be
rushing into this.

246
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,992
Rushing into--
we've been working--

247
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,184
Everybody, it's me, Dylan.

248
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,936
I just wanted to thank you all
for bringing me on this trip

249
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:33,200
and making me feel
like one of the family,

250
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,545
uh, especially Bossy.

251
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,086
So I can't think of a better time

252
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:42,631
to ask something of
the woman that I love.

253
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,652
Okay.

254
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:48,917
No, no.

255
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,596
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy,

256
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,151
will you do me the honors of
being my lawfully wedded--

257
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,364
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No proposals.

258
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,633
Not now. Not gonna happen.
She's a child, so...

259
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,552
- Mom!
- You're still in high school!

260
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,900
- I meant after she graduates.
- Not then. Not now.

261
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:05,348
Not ever. Seriously, what are
you two gonna live off of?

262
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,023
The--the--the royalties
from the horsey song?

263
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,025
- Put it back in your pocket.
- Would you stop it?

264
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:12,609
- No, I won't. I won't.
- No, it's okay.

265
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,409
I guess I'll just turn in.

266
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,854
Just so you know,
there's a fan in my cabin

267
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:19,032
- that sounds like someone crying.
- Oh.

268
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,839
Dylan, wait! I hate you!

269
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,510
Oh, come on. Haley,
get back here!

270
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,173
Phil, anything?

271
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:27,958
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?

272
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,441
I can, you know.

273
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,371
For what it's worth,

274
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,715
my second wife
was in high school.

275
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,822
Sweetie, here. Here we go.

276
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:43,916
One, two, three. One, two, three.

277
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:47,413
- Gone.
- It's gone! It's over there!

278
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,414
It's not back there.

279
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,567
- We counted to three.
- Yes.

280
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,416
Hey.

281
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,410
Where have you been?

282
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,940
I-I slept on the couch
in the lodge.

283
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:55,737
I know you didn't want to
have a big fight last night.

284
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,201
Well, I'm ready now.

285
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:58,872
Cam, I'm sorry.

286
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:01,292
Look, what if I can't do
the father-son stuff?

287
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,252
The hunting, the--the sports,
the Three Stooges?

288
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,448
You know what happens in real life

289
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,037
when someone gets hit in
the head with a ladder?

290
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,558
They go to the hospital
and they get an MRI.

291
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:10,926
Never see that scene.

292
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,928
I think you're overthinking this.

293
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:15,127
You know, I love sports,
I love the Stooges.

294
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,253
We've got this covered.

295
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:18,000
No. No, you--
you got it covered,

296
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,772
but I'm just stuck on the sidelines,

297
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,057
pretending to understand
the rules, and...

298
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,542
You know, my dad was a
rough-and-tumble guy,

299
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,551
and I just--
I could never relate to him.

300
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,502
And I don't know.
I just don't think I could handle

301
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:32,675
disappointing...
two generations.

302
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,404
I think you're more masculine

303
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,445
than you give yourself credit for.

304
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,137
Who puts a birdhouse
next to a porch?

305
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,319
Claire, I know
that you're worried

306
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,084
that Dylan is gonna
break Haley's heart,

307
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,301
but I see in his eyes that he's
gonna stick with her forever.

308
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,084
No matter what, he's always
going to be with her.

309
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,202
On your deathbed--

310
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,477
Okay. All right.
I can't take this anymore.

311
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:56,402
I'm gonna go find her.

312
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:59,330
No. You push too hard, you
chase her right into his arms,

313
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:01,367
you'll end up with
a boob for a son-in-law.

314
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:02,639
Believe me, you don't want that.

315
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,815
What's that supposed to mean?

316
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,066
- What?
- Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?

317
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,124
- No. No. Why?
- I'm not talking to you.

318
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,741
He said he was going out
for a walk last night,

319
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:11,478
and no one's seen him since.

320
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,136
Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.

321
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:15,027
Maybe after last night,
he just went home.

322
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,765
Doubt it. He left his luggage.

323
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:17,968
We have to do something.

324
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:20,466
If he doesn't eat five times
a day, he gets spacey.

325
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,957
What would that even look like?

326
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,343
We'll find him. Hank?

327
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,080
We got a situation here!

328
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,929
What seems to be the trouble?

329
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,077
We need to talk.

330
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,293
What?

331
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,542
You stole my first kiss.

332
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:37,564
What are you talkin' about?

333
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:40,779
I had it all planned out.
It was supposed to be special,

334
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,686
someone with a high GPA
and a bright future,

335
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,186
not a Mario brother.

336
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:47,606
Fine. You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.

337
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,111
Here, you can have it back.

338
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,650
There. Now we're even.

339
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:54,227
Well, keep it.
I don't-- I don't want it anymore.

340
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:58,574
What am I doing?

341
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,295
Okay, people.

342
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:02,320
Looks like we have a walker.

343
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:05,146
Right now he is facing
treacherous terrain,

344
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:07,520
sudden drops, mountain lions,

345
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:10,331
hungry bears, oh, and wolverines.

346
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:13,119
That is, if the hypothermia
didn't already get him.

347
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,395
Why did we come here again?

348
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,247
So our best bet is to split up.

349
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,364
You two are gonna take
the North hiking trail.

350
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,441
- Can I go with my Dad instead?
- Negative.

351
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,238
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer...

352
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,725
To check the Snake River.

353
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,028
Buffalo Phil--

354
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:28,728
worth the wait.

355
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:32,017
Me and Cactus Flower will
ride on up to Destiny Ridge.

356
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,593
Maybe I should ride
up there with her.

357
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:37,307
Negatory. That trail is
for advanced riders only.

358
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,056
We don't need another dead body.

359
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:39,814
"Another"?

360
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,831
Let's go! Move 'em out.

361
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,895
Phil, help me saddle
my horse, will ya?

362
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:49,403
Well, look who's suddenly
needed by his father-in-law.

363
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:50,676
Phyllis.

364
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:51,986
Phil...

365
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:53,340
is.

366
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,213
Hey, Uncle Mitch. Whatcha doing?

367
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:58,412
Oh, hey.

368
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,341
Just--just thinkin'.

369
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:03,242
You know, I've been
meaning to tell you,

370
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:04,909
you're a super fun Uncle.

371
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,726
And I'm saying this as a boy.

372
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,645
Uncle Cameron sent you
over here, didn't he?

373
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,517
What? That's hilarious.

374
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:13,058
No, I love how you and
me can joke like this.

375
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,805
Okay, Luke, look, I don't
know how much Cam told you,

376
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,154
but I don't think
this is a problem

377
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:18,964
that you can help me with. It's...

378
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:21,830
Okay, good.
I've got my own problem.

379
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,142
What? What's that?

380
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:25,069
Can you keep a secret?

381
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,718
I kept a pretty big one
for 22 years, so...

382
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,945
I've got this new firecracker,

383
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,385
and I can't decide what to blow up.

384
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:33,049
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.

385
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,353
I know. That's what's fun about it.

386
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:36,452
I don't get boys.

387
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,820
What is so great about
destroying things?

388
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:42,355
It turns stuff into
flying chunks of stuff.

389
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,604
Okay, no. No,
g-give it to me. Come on.

390
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,337
Fine.

391
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:49,341
I take it back.
You're not that fun.

392
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,527
All right, hey, look, um,

393
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,868
we'll do it together, all right?

394
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:01,989
You just made the best
decision of your life.

395
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,502
Okay. Come on.

396
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:07,666
Damn it!

397
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,258
Buttercup! What the hell's
wrong with this horse?

398
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:13,308
Jay.

399
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:16,719
I want to talk to you about

400
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,153
that son-in-law crack
you made at breakfast.

401
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:21,160
- Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
- I think you did.

402
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,594
I get that I wasn't your first
choice to marry Claire,

403
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,553
but it's been 18 years, and
there hasn't been a day

404
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,143
when I wasn't a loyal
husband to your daughter

405
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:29,045
and a great dad to your grandkids.

406
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,605
So if we've still got a problem,
now it's your problem.

407
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,926
Phil, wait up.

408
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:43,626
Let me ask you something,
man to man.

409
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:45,540
Okay.

410
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,473
You notice anything
funny about the...

411
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,419
Hank character and, uh...

412
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,491
Gloria? Yeah,
he's hitting on her. Why?

413
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:52,571
I knew it.

414
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:53,794
Where are you going?

415
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,148
Destiny Ridge.

416
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:57,307
Buttercup, ha!

417
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,006
Buttercup, hiya!

418
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,744
Seriously?

419
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:05,859
Okay. Okay, it's clear.

420
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:09,758
- After this, we're gonna have
some angry birds. -Yeah.

421
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,207
It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie."

422
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,075
It's a big musical from the '60s.

423
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,772
No. Forget it. What you said.

424
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,071
Okay.

425
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,603
Okay, go.

426
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,081
That's it?

427
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm sorry, buddy.

428
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,601
- I brought that thing all
the way from-- whoa! - Whoa!

429
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:39,347
Cam, I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!

430
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:41,347
You should have seen it.
It was so awesome.

431
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:42,359
That's great!

432
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,294
Yeah. I think I can do this.

433
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,450
I mean, maybe not everything
and maybe not right away, and

434
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:48,514
- not the three stooges...
- No.

435
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,037
I do. I want a son.

436
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:52,533
I'm sorry I panicked.

437
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:54,057
Oh, that's great.

438
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,275
Now maybe we can go back to
taking pictures for the book.

439
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,298
Yes! Pictures of me
blowing up stuff!

440
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,828
Okay, I see we've overcorrected.

441
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,300
I know you think
I'm the mean mom

442
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,998
who wouldn't let you marry
your boyfriend,

443
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,117
but someday you're
gonna realize,

444
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,376
I-I did what had to be done.

445
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:11,400
No, you didn't.
I was never gonna marry Dylan.

446
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,699
I told him no.

447
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,193
Oh, you did? Thank God.

448
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,609
But it was my proposal
to turn down.

449
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:18,907
You know, you keep telling
me to act like an adult,

450
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,864
but then you don't
even give me a chance.

451
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:23,889
Oh. You sort of got me there.

452
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:26,437
But, sweetheart, I don't
expect you to understand this.

453
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,699
I certainly didn't
when I was your age.

454
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,548
I look at you as my baby,
and I always will.

455
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,062
It's--it's just what moms do.

456
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:35,593
I'm not a baby anymore!

457
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:38,829
Okay? And I am never
gonna see Dylan again!

458
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,306
Dylan!

459
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,915
Dylan!

460
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,180
What?!

461
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:44,881
Where are you?!

462
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,515
Wyoming!

463
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,606
You're okay!

464
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,613
I had the craziest night.

465
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,559
When you rejected me,
I felt lost and scared.

466
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,685
And then I went out on a walk,

467
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:59,360
and I felt a whole different
kind of lost and scared.

468
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,244
And then I fell
asleep in the stable.

469
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:04,201
And when I woke up, I met
this woman named Jake

470
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,894
who's strong like a man.

471
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:09,268
Then we had this long talk,
and he/she hired me.

472
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,977
Uh, what--
what do you mean, she hired you?

473
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,185
I work here now.

474
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,588
S-so you're staying?

475
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,976
Yeah. What about us?

476
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:20,289
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.

477
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,098
You're a high school student,

478
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,984
and I'm a ranch hand.

479
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,758
I'm just--I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.

480
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,044
I am. Thanks. But we're

481
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,357
not supposed to fraternize
with the guests.

482
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:32,501
Right.

483
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:37,347
Dylan!

484
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,639
Dylan!

485
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:44,588
You got a voice like a
meadowlark, don't ya?

486
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,854
Dylan!

487
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,047
Yeah, I sure am worried
about that kid.

488
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,945
Dylan!

489
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,136
He ain't down there.

490
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:58,826
Oh, come on now. You come up
here for the cowboy experience.

491
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,516
You're looking at him.

492
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:03,565
Do I look like the kind of woman
that would cheat on her husband?

493
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,781
Yes.

494
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,275
Really?

495
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:09,829
Hey! I think you better
move away from that woman.

496
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,601
Only we touch our women
when they don't want us to.

497
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,447
Easy. Easy there, friend-o.

498
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,504
I wasn't hitting on this filly.

499
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,927
This is all part of the package.

500
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:20,984
If I didn't play the bad guy,

501
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:23,236
he wouldn't get to ride
up and be the big hero.

502
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,177
He doesn't need you
to make him a hero.

503
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,574
He's a hero every day.

504
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:29,009
Why don't you do us all a favor?
Get back on your horse,

505
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,907
ride down to the lodge and tell 'em--

506
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:33,066
- Can you keep him still?
I'm trying to make a point. - I am.

507
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,363
Okay. Okay, I'm gone.

508
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:36,532
Ma'am.

509
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:40,181
Wait. Wait.

510
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:41,982
There's something
I wanna say to you.

511
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,912
I will only be checking
"somewhat satisfied"

512
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,305
on our comment card. Jeez.

513
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,616
I mean, he was great
with the kids.

514
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:53,920
I looked it up.

515
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,647
The distance between our
houses is 2,443 miles.

516
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,434
Yeah, but, you know,
on some maps,

517
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:01,073
it's like--pfft! This big.

518
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:02,835
God, you're stupid.

519
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:08,033
All in all, it was a great vacation.

520
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,937
We may have lost a man...

521
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:17,019
But out there on the range,
under that great big sky,

522
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,940
we found a part of ourselves
we never knew was there,

523
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:22,989
just like the horny
cowboy said we would.

524
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,257
No.

525
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:26,393
Fine.

526
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:35,093
