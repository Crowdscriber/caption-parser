1
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:05,557
Drink this, it'll
calm your nerves.

2
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:07,842
And when you're ready,

3
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:10,195
I'll cast a little
spell for you.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,982
Help you sleep
through the night.

5
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:16,318
I'm ashamed...

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,572
to show you my weakness.

7
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,024
I might have shed a
tear or two myself

8
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,576
if I'd lost everyone I had.

9
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:28,880
No, it's not that.

10
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:32,033
I'm over 300 years old.

11
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:36,004
Everyone I done ever met done
followed after the Grim Reaper.

12
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:38,724
Some willingly.

13
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,843
Others kicking and scratching.

14
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,312
I taught myself long ago

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,765
not to waste tears for the dead.

16
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:52,187
It's your kindness

17
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,740
that has touched my soul.

18
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,078
I feel like I've been
alone for so long,

19
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:03,782
it's a relief
to have found an equal.

20
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:07,569
Even if that person come
in the guise of an enemy.

21
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:15,293
We have so much to talk about.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,098
But not tonight.

23
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,684
Tomorrow we'll draw
the battle lines.

24
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:26,188
After you've rested.

25

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

26
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,281
Wake up. Your master calls.

27
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:56,585
Laveau.

28
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:02,340
Tonight's the night
you pay me my due.

29
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:04,009
Not now.

30
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,644
Please.

31
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:07,145
It's been a hard day.

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,847
Hard days...

33
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,983
deserve a harder night.

34
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,825
You drink my torment like wine.

35
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:26,481
Why you here
in the house of your enemy?

36
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:28,867
I've come to seek
a lasting truce.

37
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,985
Not before you deal
with my terms.

38
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,488
I want what's coming to me.
Tonight.

39
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,590
Once a year,

40
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,159
you must pay my price.

41
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:41,429
It's the bargain
you made so long ago.

42
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,555
Ma'am?

43
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,091
Ma'am? Ma'am, it's
the middle of the night.

44
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,426
You'll have to come back
during visiting hours.

45
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:31,897
Open the door.

46
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:25,734
I can't let you leave the
hospital with that baby, ma'am.

47
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:29,103
Mama's had a hard day.
Put the baby down on the ground

48
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,373
and step away from it.
Don't mess with me.

49
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,375
I need this baby.

50
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,610
Put the goddamn
baby down. Now!

51
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:39,113
I warned you.

52
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:52,961
Shut up.

53
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:56,264
I'll give
you something to cry about.

54
00:05:51,170 --> 00:06:01,817

55
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,697
The police have identified
a man seen here

56
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,685
in this video
surveillance footage.

57
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:07,642
- If anyone has any information...
- It's my fault.

58
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,944
All of it.

59
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,348
I told him I was filing
for divorce.

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,818
He was so angry.

61
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,120
He was determined to be a hero.

62
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,490
He had this look on his face.

63
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,859
I should've seen it.

64
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,411
It ain't on you.

65
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,579
It's on me.

66
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:30,465
I hired him.

67
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:33,084
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:36,537
Your husband

69
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,890
was a Witch Hunter.

70
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,559
Showed up at my place,
runnin' his mouth

71
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:42,760
'bout how he been
killing witches

72
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,379
his whole life,

73
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:47,982
'bout how he had
all this access,

74
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:49,817
how his mother-in-law
was the Supreme.

75
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:53,438
Ooh, he hated your ass.

76
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:56,607
But he gave me a
fair price, so...

77
00:06:56,692 --> 00:07:00,278
You <i>were</i>
my sworn enemy.

78
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:02,663
You hired him to kill me?

79
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:04,582
To kill my girls?
Uh-huh.

80
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,034
But he was too soft
on you, he couldn't do it.

81
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,669
He was tryin'
to protect you, all right.

82
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:10,088
From me.

83
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:13,091
Lucky for y'all
he was a stone fool.

84
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,751
You're not just blind,

85
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,970
you are willfully blind.

86
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:31,476
You married Hank to prove
some childish point

87
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,562
and brought a viper
into this sacred house.

88
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,815
It's all water
under the bridge now, mama.

89
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,101
Come on, come on, come on.

90
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:44,822
Hank was not some...

91
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,958
lone assassin with a grudge.

92
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:50,661
Witch Hunters never act alone.

93
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,581
They are part

94
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,333
of an ancient order of men

95
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,335
whose sole purpose

96
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,171
is to rid the world of witches.

97
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,790
Black or white.

98
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,059
Now w...

99
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,812
We don't have to waste our time

100
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,765
with worker bees,
what we have to do

101
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:14,018
is to find the hive.

102
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,941
Excuse me.

103
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,829
...while the search continues

104
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:28,449
for the newborn baby that was
kidnapped from St. Ignatius.

105
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:37,592
♪ And it all comes down
to you. ♪

106
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:44,515
What a lovely shawl.

107
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,351
You keep your distance.

108
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,438
I know your game, lady.

109
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:51,973
Oh.
Slit my throat like you did Maddy

110
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,774
or the stake like Myrtle.

111
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:56,477
Don't bother.
I've surrounded myself

112
00:08:56,528 --> 00:09:00,347
with the white spirit light
to protect me.

113
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,034
And even if you do
put me down...

114
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:06,487
I've already made plans
on how to bring myself back.

115
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,990
Well, now why would I...

116
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,242
want to hurt you?

117
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:12,793
Of all the girls in the house,

118
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:15,496
you are the only one

119
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,798
worth a damn, magic-wise.

120
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,033
Bullshit.

121
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,002
Your daughter, she...

122
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,254
she told me how it works

123
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,640
with the Supreme.

124
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:27,541
You can keep your powers.

125
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:31,262
But I don't think
you fully appreciate

126
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:33,397
the power of the throne.

127
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:39,186
It's a skeleton key.

128
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:42,240
Anything you wish for
in the world.

129
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:49,080
The Supremacy comes with a great
deal of power and influence.

130
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:52,750
You are going to know
the world, and what's more...

131
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:56,570
they are all
going to want to know you.

132
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,042
You know, I was talking
to an old friend of mine

133
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:03,177
the other day,
telling her all about you.

134
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:06,380
She just begged me to come
have a sit-down with you.

135
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:07,965
She's a White Witch.

136
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,719
And try as I may
I cannot get her

137
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,639
to play in the shadows with me.

138
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:25,432
Who are you?

139
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:29,787
You must be Misty.

140
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm Stevie Nicks.

141
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:38,612
Is she all right?

142
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,250
You owe me five bucks.

143
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:46,420
I told you she was
gonna do that. Mwah.

144
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,922
Well, that was
a morbid field trip.

145
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:49,674
Queenie's dead.

146
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:52,560
We don't know that. They
haven't released the names.

147
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,095
She could be at
the Souplantation.

148
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,314
You know how that bitch
loves a bottomless bowl.

149
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,149
Should we go to the morgue?

150
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,101
No.
No.

151
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:03,470

187
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,827
Thank you, honey.
She wrote it in ten minutes.

188
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,444
She heard the name Rhiannon,

189
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,456
and she got inspired, sat
down and wrote the song.

190
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:27,414
I know everything about you.

191
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,666
I'm honored, Misty.

192
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,117
Thank you.
Did I get

193
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,786
the shawl twirl right? I real...
I want to get it right.

194
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:35,306
Perfect. It was perfect.
Thank you.

195
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,142
But let me show you something.

196
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:39,260
One twirl.
Okay.

197
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,344
Oh.

198
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,397
That way.

199
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,432
Okay.
Whoo!

200
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,737
So...

201
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:51,822
this shawl has

202
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:55,075
danced across
the stages of the world,

203
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,476
and now it's yours.

204
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:58,377
And good luck

205
00:13:58,497 --> 00:13:59,887
with the Seven Wonders.

206
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,964
Thank you, thank you,
Stevie, thank you.

207
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:07,091
That swamp bitch can't even
spell her own name,

208
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:08,397
and now she gets
the keys to the kingdom?

209
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,280
I mean, I came back
from the dead.

210
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:12,380
Yeah, Misty brought you back.

211
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,821
I could be the Supreme.

212
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:19,390
Yeah, the mind reading's a real
party trick, Mumbles the Clown.

213
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,175
My powers are growing.

214
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,477
I can do mind control.

215
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,429
Prove it.

216
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:28,399
Put out that cigarette.

217
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,734
Now stick it in your vagina.

218
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:33,132
Nan, stop!

219
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,823
Both of you skanks, enough!

220
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,191
And by the way,

221
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:38,725
you can't be the Supreme--

222
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,360
you've got a heart murmur.

223
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,896
Hm. Not anymore, bitch.

224
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,870
My little trip
to the afterlife cured it.

225
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,359
I don't believe you.

226
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:56,760
It's true.

227
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,463
It was clearly my destiny
to die and be reborn,

228
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,465
just like our Lord and Savior.

229
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:02,949
So let's schedule
the Seven Wonders,

230
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:07,068
me versus Misty, and we'll see
who the next goddamn Supreme is.

231
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,259
Okay,

232
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,617
so who is he?
Harrison Renard.

233
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:27,568
CEO of the Delphi Trust,
an asset management company.

234
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:29,454
One of the richest
men in the country.

235
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:31,289
And...

236
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:33,825
apparently, my father-in-law.

237
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:39,747
I thought Hank
didn't have any family.

238
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,415
No.

239
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,702
What Hank didn't have
were any customers.

240
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,921
No real ones, anyway.

241
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:49,707
You're sure this man
is Hank's father?

242
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,375
<i>Renard.</i>

243
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:54,178
The French word
for "fox."

244
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:57,899
And this.

245
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:01,185
Important men
get their pictures taken.

246
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:03,604
His name really was Hank.

247
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:05,055
Well, Henry.

248
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:07,859
Henry Renard, the only son

249
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,560
of Harrison Renard.

250
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:11,496
So, tell me about
this company, Delphi.

251
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:13,197
It grew out of the Renard's

252
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,448
family business.

253
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,567
They used to be carpenters,

254
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:19,704
furniture builders,
dating back to the colonies.

255
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:21,339
Salem.
Now they specialize

256
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,740
in private equity.

257
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,125
Last year they managed

258
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,960
over $50 billion in assets.

259
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,129
So, where do we find them?
Corporate headquarters

260
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:31,048
are in Atlanta.
Hell, that ain't nothin' but a hop.

261
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,935
- So what we waitin' on?
- Well, before we hop

262
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,471
on our broomsticks,
let's think this through.

263
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:40,441
This is a multibillion-dollar
corporation.

264
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:43,260
We have to be smart about this.

265
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,729
They pray
to one god--

266
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,698
a green, merciless god.

267
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,368
Money. So we cut off
their supply,

268
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:53,404
bring them to their knees,

269
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,940
make them crawl to us
and beg for mercy.

270
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,042
Here, I can do that.

271
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,044
I want to help.

272
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,379
No.

273
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:02,997
You're tainted.

274
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,082
You let them get
inside your head.

275
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,634
We can fight about this
for the next ten years,

276
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:08,586
but right now I want
to help you.

277
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:09,921
No!

278
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,959
Don't you understand anything?

279
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,311
You can't help me.

280
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,730
You can't help anyone.

281
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:22,400
You're worthless, hopeless.

282
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,301
Get out of my sight.

283
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,599
Come to me, Hecate.

284
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,718
Mother of Angels...

285
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:01,138
Cosmic World Soul.

286
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:08,980

303
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,394
Bring them to me
in a weakened state.

304
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,031
Make me strong and cunning,
so that I may destroy...

305
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,201
Are you all right?

306
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:06,454
Yeah.

307
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:09,507
No.

308
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,408
I'm fine.

309
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:15,129
Madison can't be the Supreme.

310
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,214
She's selfish
and she's a whore.

311
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:20,017
I didn't realize this before,
but we can't survive on our own.

312
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,136
The sisterhood
protects each of us.

313
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,722
If I was the Supreme,
I would only do good.

314
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:28,592
I believe that. You don't have
a mean bone in your body.

315
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:31,228
Maybe you're the kind
of leader we need.

316
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,147
I think they moved Luke.

317
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,982
I can't hear him.

318
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,650
Can I help you?

319
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,120
Yes. Uh, we're here
to see Luke Ramsey.

320
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:44,658
I'm so sorry.

321
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,827
Luke died yesterday.

322
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:47,995
I want to see him.

323
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,797
The mortuary came

324
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,782
and took the body away.

325
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,801
I want to say good-bye.

326
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,340
What is that hideous smell?

327
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,342
Rattle viper sperm incense.

328
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,460
Clear all

329
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:05,730
the bad spirits out of here.

330
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,064
Get rid

331
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,433
of their evil intentions.

332
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:15,773
It's not evil intentions
that's making me sick.

333
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:17,108
<i>Jadoo toona.</i>

334
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,693
One of these girls is emerging

335
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:22,663
as the new Supreme,
and as her powers grow,

336
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:25,032
so does the cancer.

337
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,868
I ain't ready
to say good-bye to you.

338
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:31,172
We still got work to do.

339
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:37,211
Have you ever been in love,

340
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:39,597
Marie?

341
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,832
What has she done to you?

342
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:47,054
Long time ago.

343
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,442
I found love for the first time,

344
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:54,678
and it's given me the
passion to keep fighting.

345
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:57,731
You can help me live, Marie.

346
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,070
I wish I could.

347
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:05,322
You know the secret.

348
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:09,376
You gave it to that despicable,
torturing racist.

349
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:11,796
I gave her a vial of my tears.

350
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:14,915
If I gave it to you,
you'd still be bald and weak

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,003
and living out your last days
over and over for all eternity.

352
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,842
Who... gave it to you?

353
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:27,394
I don't think
you're ready for that.

354
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,764
Tell me your secret.

355
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:37,221
I sold my soul...

356
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:39,440
to Papa Legba.

357
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,861
You conjured him or...

358
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:46,330
he just appeared?

359
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:51,785
Mmm...

360
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,756
I thought I was
the <i>shit</i> back then.

361
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,678
I had just come into my prime,

362
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,964
and my magic was strong.

363
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:06,267
Shockingly strong.

364
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,804
<i>I was pregnant,</i>

365
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,757
<i>and I did not accept</i>
<i>the idea of death.</i>

366
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:15,943
<i>I was invincible.</i>

367
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:22,099
Papa must've heard me.

368
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,735
Showed up one night,

369
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:29,439
<i>said, "You can have</i>
<i>eternal life, Marie.</i>

370
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:31,876
<i>"I come to you once a year,</i>

371
00:22:31,943 --> 00:22:36,080
<i>and you give me what I want."</i>

372
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:39,833
<i>I thought he meant</i>
<i>some kind of sexual favors.</i>

373
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:43,220
<i>Seemed simple enough</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

374
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:47,091
<i>I wished for it;</i>
<i>it came true.</i>

375
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:50,644
<i>Unknowingly, I made a deal</i>
<i>forged in Hell.</i>

376
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,481
Papa...

377
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:57,434
Motherhood looks good
on you, Mambo.

378
00:22:57,485 --> 00:23:00,187
You'd make a beautiful mother.

379
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:02,656
But...

380
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,692
children ain't
in the cards for you.

381
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:15,035
N-No. No.

382
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,171
Not my baby.

383
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,840
Take it back, Papa.

384
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,127
Take it back.

385
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:24,678
Take the spell back.

386
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:27,164
I can be mortal again.

387
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:29,049
Take it back.
Now, you know

388
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:31,268
that ain't how it works, sugar.

389
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:33,270
Give the child to me.

390
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,889
I want my innocent soul.

391
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:12,209
Does he still come to you?

392
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,346
Mm-hmm. Once a year.

393
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:17,881
What does he want?
You asking for him

394
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,550
to come and see you?
'Cause the thing about him is,

395
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:25,272
if you want him bad
enough, he'll hear you.

396
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:29,076
Try and get some sleep now.

397
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,112
Just close your eyes
and forget about that for now.

398
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,801
Damn.

399
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:29,470
This kabob's
some kind of tasty.

400
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:33,140
Thanks for treating.

401
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:34,641
Get used to it.

402
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:36,560
If you really are
the next Supreme,

403
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:38,429
pretty soon,
you'll be drowning in merch.

404
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,630
Merch?

405
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:43,517
Merchandise. Swag.
The cookies.

406
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,486
You know.

407
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,489
No, I'm not sure I do.

408
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,140
Stevie gave you the shawl.

409
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,025
Fiona gave you Stevie.

410
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,361
Making you feel like
Supremely hot shit

411
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:55,863
when the fact is,

412
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:58,315
now you owe them both.

413
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,701
You are cynical.

414
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:03,420
And I don't think
the White Witch or

415
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:05,038
the Supreme need
my kind of help.

416
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:06,924
Maybe not today.

417
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:08,959
But a year from now,
you're on the throne,

418
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,496
they're in deep shit,
the phone rings, and,

419
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:14,498
"Hey, girlfriend,
it's Auntie Stevie.

420
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,101
Need some mojo. You still
looking like my album cover?"

421
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:18,668
Everything's transactional.

422
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,021
Guy buys you dinner,
he expects a blow job.

423
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:22,639
Welcome to earth.

424
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,359
Hey, are you trying to say
that Stevie was working me?

425
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:28,028
Players only love you
when they're playing.

426
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:30,013
No.

427
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,349
No, I know what
you're trying to do.

428
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,701
Mess me up,
make me doubt myself.

429
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:37,788
You think I'm stupid
because of where I came from.

430
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:40,741
Well, I'm not so easily bought,

431
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:43,127
and I ain't that easily fooled.

432
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:45,496
Thanks for the lunch.

433
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:51,084
You're right.
I <i>do</i> think you're stupid.

434
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,837
You want to change my opinion?

435
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:56,039
Let me show you something.

436
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:10,270
Enchant these guys, would you?

437
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:12,322
We just need a minute.

438
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:23,733
So, what did you
want to show me?

439
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,119
That I'm just
as powerful as you.

440
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:28,789
Prove it.

441
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,432
See?

442
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:57,067
You're powerful.
I'm powerful.

443
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,236
I don't need you.

444
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,572
I just want to be your friend.

445
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,657
Now lose that ugly shawl.

446
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:05,075
Are you insane?

447
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,543
This came direct from Stevie.

448
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:07,944
She probably has a bargain bin

449
00:28:07,996 --> 00:28:09,796
in her basement
with 20 more just like it

450
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,965
to hand out when she needs
to make someone feel special.

451
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,168
Stevie would never do that.

452
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,722
Lose the shawl.

453
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:21,425
Drop it in the casket.

454
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:23,393
Let the part of you

455
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:27,464
that's just an imitation
of some other witch die.

456
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:30,183
Give life to you.

457
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:33,604
The one...

458
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:37,074
true...

459
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:39,443
Misty Day.

460
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:10,840
Stupid bitch.

461
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,348
Coffee break's over, boys.

462
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,968
We're just going
to pay our respects.

463
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,936
You can't mention Luke's dad,
or anything like that, right?

464
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:49,821
- I'm not stupid. - We need to know the
name of the mortuary.

465
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:52,124
Once we find out, we can get
Misty to help us bring him back.

466
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,043
And I can be with Luke forever.

467
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,666
I think the fondest memory

468
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,119
I have of Luke was
when he was nine.

469
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,555
He had made the most

470
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,141
adorable little cross
out of driftwood.

471
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,642
Where's his body?

472
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,315
I think she meant to ask, where
do you plan to have the funeral?

473
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,766
Well, there will be a
service in our church, but

474
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,435
Luke is here... now.

475
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:27,159
I had him cremated.

476
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,694
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

477
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:31,163
You... bitch!

478
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,815
I think it's time for us to go.

479
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,418
You killed him
with that pillow.

480
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:39,204
What are you talking about? What
are you talking about?!

481
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,709
Nan, what are you doing?

482
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:44,676
Let her go!

483
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:47,329
Stop!

484
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:56,221
She has to pay!

485
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,005
Nan!

486
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:04,029
You have to be... cleansed.

487
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:07,983
Nan!

488
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:24,666
Could you please
stop playing for a minute?

489
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,135
I need to focus.

490
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:28,637
No, no, no. Sit.

491
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:31,673
Listen to the celestial tones.

492
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,731
What is that thing?

493
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,017
It's hideous and weird.

494
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,102
Don't be a hater, dear.

495
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:47,722
It's a theremin.

496
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,241
I cannot tell you

497
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,443
how playing this instrument
soothes my soul

498
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,078
in tempestuous times.

499
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,116
Nothing could soothe my soul.

500
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:00,919
I have nothing
to offer this coven anymore.

501
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,290
Who am I?

502
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,575
What do I do?

503
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:09,961
You buck up, is what you do!

504
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:11,930
Face reality headlong

505
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,433
and carry on.
But how?

506
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:18,937
I have no one,
and my powers are gone.

507
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,556
Your salad dressing
is absolutely magical.

508
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,025
Maybe you could bottle it.

509
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:24,759
Cordelia's Conjured

510
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:27,195
Coriander Condiment.

511
00:32:27,263 --> 00:32:29,264
Or if you'd like
a little getaway,

512
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,733
maybe a job as a hostess
on a cruise ship.

513
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,304
You've got a lovely personality,
and you're always well-groomed.

514
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,104
Myrtle,

515
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,573
are you trying
to push me over the edge?

516
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,410
I'm trying to give you <i>une demi</i>
<i>tasse de realite,</i> darling.

517
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,111
Let's be honest.

518
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,714
Living in Fiona's shadow
is a challenge.

519
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:49,134
What are your options when
your mother's Hillary Clinton?

520
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:52,220
Between us chickens, no matter
how hard I worked at it,

521
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:54,089
I never felt special, either.

522
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,291
But with my reemergence
from the flames--

523
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,343
look at me, I'm fabulous!
Reinvigorated!

524
00:32:58,428 --> 00:33:01,463
One never knows what the
universe has in store for us!

525
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,765
Oh, stop!
Stop talking!

526
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,185
You are insane! My God!

527
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,271
I am an absolute failure.

528
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,972
Everything that Fiona says

529
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,824
is true!

530
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,809
I don't belong here anymore.
I don't belong anywhere!

531
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,161
Oh!

532
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,616
Oh!

533
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,337
Oh!

534
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,173
They've just suspended
trading on our stock.

535
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,958
We lost 50%

536
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,344
of our value in ten minutes.

537
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,996
We've been in business
over 180 years.

538
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:38,350
Now... I give us a week.

539
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,720
Vultures are waiting to strip
the flesh from our bones.

540
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:43,772
SEC has nothing on us.

541
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,273
Nothing!

542
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:46,892
You get our people on the phone.

543
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:48,527
Call... call the senator.

544
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,145
Call... what's his name?
Bernanke.

545
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,646
I've been trying all day.

546
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,116
Nobody is coming near us.

547
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:57,018
It's like a tornado
ripped through this company.

548
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,287
There's nothing natural
about this.

549
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:04,826
It's time we finally
deal with those witches.

550
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:14,369
Papa Legba,

551
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,038
<i>ouvirier barrier</i>

552
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,341

553
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:25,013
Papa Legba,

554
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:28,049
<i>ouvirier barrier...</i>

00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:35,557
Papa Legba,

557
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,026
<i>ouvirier barrier pour moi</i>

558
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,745

559
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:47,536
Papa Legba, <i>ouvirier barrier</i>
<i>pour moi agoe.</i>

560
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:52,841
Oh... Papa Legba,

561
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:56,044
<i>ouvirier barrier...</i>

562
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:02,217
<i>...pour moi agoe.</i>

563
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,091
Papa Legba,

564
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:14,196
<i>ouvirier barrier</i>

565
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:19,901
<i>pour moi agoe.</i>

566
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,404
Papa Legba,

567
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:25,490
<i>ouvirier barrier...</i>

568
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:36,251
You broke out the good stuff.

569
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:45,560
I don't want to die.

570
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:47,512
Same as everyone.

571
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,600
I am not the same as everyone.

572
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:56,071
This could be a big-ticket night
for you, Papa.

573
00:35:56,138 --> 00:35:58,640
I'm queen of the witches.

574
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,478
I don't give a wet donkey's shit
about your title.

575
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:06,081
I shine to only one thing:

576
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:09,367
your soul.

577
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:14,873
Then let's talk business.

578
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:19,461
I give you my soul,

579
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:23,131
and what do you give me
in return?

580
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,633
Freedom from death.

581
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:32,390
I want terms defined.

582
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:35,443
Life everlasting.

583
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:37,145
No aging,

584
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,949
no decrepitude

585
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:42,651
forever.

586
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,736
Just like that.

587
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,121
Just like that?

588
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:50,241
In exchange, you
provide services.

589
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:52,794
One night a year, on the
date of my choosing.

590
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:54,746
No refusal ever.

591
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,582
What kind of services?

592
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,701
For instance,

593
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,219
would you cripple

594
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,371
your daughter?
Today?

595
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,390
Absolutely.

596
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,258
Murder an innocent?

597
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:09,644
Someone you love.

598
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:12,597
Whatever it takes.

599
00:37:12,682 --> 00:37:14,265
Then...

600
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,435
we have a deal.

601
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,738
Seal it.

602
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:43,378
The deal is off.

603
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:46,798
Why?
You have nothing to sell.

604
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:50,251
You have no soul.

605
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:10,271
Bum luck, baby.

606
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,157
No sale.

607
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,578
I'll get my immortality.

608
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,280
All we got to do is find

609
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:23,051
the young girl
that's taking you down.

610
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:25,086
Haven't you heard?

611
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:28,423
I have no soul.

612
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,128
I'll just kill 'em all.

613
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,074
Maybe you are the Supreme.

614
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,961
I mean, the way you
got inside her head,

615
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:53,080
only ever seen Fiona do that.

616
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,883
Fiona's a bitch.

617
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:58,753
I'm gonna be a nice Supreme.

618
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,558
I hear something.

619
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,347
Yeah. You always
hear something.

620
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,683
What you doing?

621
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,385
I heard it crying.
That's impossible.

622
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:50,521
That closet was...

623
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,756
Oh.

624
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:55,726
You the clairvoyant.

625
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:58,595
You stole this baby to kill it.
You don't know what you talking about.

626
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,763
Now give it here.

627
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,399
Eat my shit.

628
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,701
I'm the next Supreme.

629
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,937
I just killed the woman next
door with my powers just now,

630
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,908
and I will kill you.

631
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,576
What is going on here?
Oh.

632
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,995
She say she the next Supreme.

633
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,947
Say she done killed

634
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,050
the neighbor lady.
Oh, great.

635
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,285
Now we'll have more
cops on our trail.

636
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,671
Whose baby is that?
Mine.

637
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,506
Check the skin tone.

638
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,790
She stole it.

639
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:27,758
She's gonna kill it.

640
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:30,061
This girl is out of line.

641
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,962
Nan, hand the baby

642
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,264
back to her,

643
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:35,299
or I'll make you do it.

644
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,274
Now leave.

645
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,195
You have blood on your hands.

646
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,948
The both of you.

647
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,790
Now, that girl is dangerous.

648
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,375
Yes, she is.

649
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,294
So whose is it really?

650
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:05,662
It's for Papa.

651
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,332
Every year,
his requests get worse,

652
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,801
but you gonna come to find out.

653
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:13,554
No.

654
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,057
We couldn't come to terms.

655
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:25,449
I barely remember
my baby's face.

656
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:29,286
So when I look at this child,

657
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,523
I feel like she mine.

658
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,993
But Papa's coming.
He needs

659
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:39,296
the soul of an innocent.

660
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,535
Well,

661
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,587
perhaps we can...

662
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:51,041
kill two birds with one stone.

663
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,510
Oh, Christ.

664
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,511
I didn't think
she was this strong.

665
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:54,929
Never!

666
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:58,215
Stop making such a fuss.

667
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,317
You're not the first witch
to be drowned.

668
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,742
I was very clear.

669
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:14,281
No substitutions.

670
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,533
Papa,

671
00:42:15,584 --> 00:42:16,750
you asked for a soul.

672
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,118
I give you one.

673
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,254
You must provide an innocent.

674
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,872
She's innocent.

675
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:23,740
Mostly.

676
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,410
She killed the neighbor,
but the bitch had it coming.

677
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,297
Oh, come on, Papa, huh?

678
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,300
Be a sport.

679
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,754
You two together?

680
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,057
Big trouble.

681
00:42:42,277 --> 00:42:44,562
Come, child.

682
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:54,839
Do I have to wear this outfit
for all eternity?

683
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,374
Not at all.

684
00:42:57,442 --> 00:43:00,828
You will find the other side
is filled with treats for a girl

685
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,996
like you.

686
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,469
Anywhere is better than here.

687
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,706
That's so beautiful.

688
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,159
I've always loved that song,
Stevie.

689
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,550
The perfect ending

690
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,969
