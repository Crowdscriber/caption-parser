1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,137
(screams)

2
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:15,362
Help me.

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,830
No!

4
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:24,573
(grunting angrily)

5
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,876
(pounding)

6
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:34,022
(Teresa screaming)

7
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,303
(grunts)

8
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,371
(yelling)

9
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,006
Come on, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

10
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:04,341
We gotta get to the car.

11
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,043
Come on, baby, get up.
(groaning)

12
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:08,213
Ready?

13
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,249
Come on. Come on.

14
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:12,118
Let's go... let's go.

15
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:15,389
(dials phone, line rings)

16
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:16,624
WOMAN:
911, what's your emergency?

17
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:17,792
TERESA: What?

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,227
Oh, no.

19
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,064
No!

20
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:27,001
911 OPERATOR:
Are those gunshots?

21
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,070
Ma'am, what is your location?
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,305
You shot 'em, man.

23
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,140
Please answer me, ma'am...

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,311
That was so sick.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,666
Shit. Sh...

26
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,409
Did you see how they dropped?

27
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,112
It was like a sack of potatoes.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,248
It was like bang! Lights out!

29
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,417
That's what you get for stabbing Joe.

30
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:53,754
This ain't funny, man.
This shit went way too far. - Come on, man.

31
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,623
It went as far as it could go.

32
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:57,382
Now don't puss out on me, Cooper!

33
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,428
Devon... check it out.

34
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,064
His arm's been ripped off.

35
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,232
I mean, what the hell
could have done that?

36
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,536
(distant clang)

37
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,739
(footsteps approaching)

38
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:28,214
("The Favre Requiem" plays,
knock at door)

39
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,736
I have today's mail.

40
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,649
There's a storm coming, Sister Jude.

41
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,984
Big fat storm.

42
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,789
Oh... Where did this come from?

43
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,258
The mailbox.

44
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:56,228
No, you ninny,
I mean who brought it here?

45
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:57,429
The mailman.

46
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:08,171
ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt "The Favre Requiem"

47
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:09,879
to bring you a severe weather warning.

48
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:11,615
There's a nor'easter storm approaching

49
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,184
the entire Eastern seaboard.

50
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:15,905
The eye of the storm
is expected to hit Friday night.

51
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,121
Many areas have been evacuated,
but if you're still at home,

52
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:20,657
fill empty containers
with clean drinking water

53
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,326
and stay put.

54
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,929
We'll bring you another update
within the hour.

55
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,367
(panting)

56
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,044
(sighs)

57
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,146
(stifled sob)

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,568
THREDSON:
Everything all right, Sister?

59
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:49,812
Inclement weather
always upsets the natives.

60
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,208
They're fragile souls.

61
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,499
That's why you should stop
using corporal punishment.

62
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,867
I mean, at our meeting yesterday,

63
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,569
Mr. Walker couldn't
even sit down.

64
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,271
I realize you're likely unfamiliar

65
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,072
with the work of B.F. Skinner,

66
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,640
but positive reinforcement

67
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,442
has proven to be far more effective.

68
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,944
In lay terms, Sister,

69
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,679
a little compassion
would go a long way.

70
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:07,913
Me?

71
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,834
I'm a beacon of compassion.

72
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,215
In fact, I spent all morning
on the phone

73
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,680
with St. Angela Parish,

74
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,648
to borrow their movie projector.

75
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,918
I thought a movie could
distract our charges

76
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,286
when the storm hits.

77
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,367
I wouldn't have figured you
for a movie buff.

78
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,925
Even I can concede
that there are a few

79
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:27,661
exceptions to the usual
Hollywood dreck.

80
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,958
The Archdiocese is loaning us a copy

81
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,238
of <i>The Sign of the Cross.</i>
I'm impressed.

82
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:36,141
And if I can help in any way,
please don't hesitate to ask.

83
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:38,844
Oh... yes.

84
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:40,646
As attending physician of Jed Potter,

85
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,514
I'll need his autopsy
report for my files.

86
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,717
I'm very busy, Doctor.

87
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,400
But I'll try to locate it.

88
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:51,691
I'll bet it says he
died of natural causes.

89
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:54,260
If it's natural for
a 17-year-old boy

90
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,829
to die of a heart attack.

91
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,346
You have quite
a suspicious mind, Sister.

92
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,167
Bordering on delusional.

93
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,469
Or maybe it's just
a form of projection.

94
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,804
A defense to protect

95
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,505
your own guilty conscience.

96
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:14,344
It was you, wasn't it?

97
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:17,305
The newspaper, where did you get it?

98
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,850
What newspaper?

99
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:32,328
That office we gave you...

100
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,696
I need it back.

101
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:34,964
You've had more than enough time

102
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,465
to advise the courts.

103
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,467
You've got two weeks,

104
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:39,702
and you're out.

105
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:54,550
("Dominique" plays)

106
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,161
(music stops)

107
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,831
Sister Jude has asked me
to make an announcement.

108
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,666
There's a big storm heading our way.

109
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,601
And when it hits,

110
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,070
half of you are going to be
too afraid to move.

111
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,606
And other half won't
be able to stop moving.

112
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,576
It would be chaos.
And that won't do.

113
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:23,546
So, Sister Jude has
arranged for a distraction.

114
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:27,083
A movie, on Friday night, when
storm will be at its worst.

115
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,153
We're all going to be
together in the dark,

116
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,422
watching <i>The Sign of the Cross,</i>

117
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,993
a movie full of fire, sex,

118
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,428
and the death of Christians.

119
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,397
What fun.

120
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,173
(quiet hiss)

121
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:55,980
KIT: There won't be a lockdown

122
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,549
this Friday night if we're all
supposed to be watching a movie.

123
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:00,118
We were just caught trying to escape.

124
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,519
Which means they won't be expecting it

125
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:02,654
to happen again so soon.

126
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:08,860
You ruined our chance of
getting out of this place.

127
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:11,529
I'd do it again, if it means I can
stop him from killing any more.

128
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:14,465
Can't say I blame you. I'd have done the
same thing if I believed what you believe.

129
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,100
But I'm innocent. CARL: Walker.

130
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,103
Dr. Arden wants to see you.

131
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:27,144
He had lunch in his office...
tuna fish sandwich, by the way,

132
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:29,647
some oatmeal cookies.
Uh, then he made a phone call

133
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,849
to the doctor's office about,
uh, removing a mole.

134
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,951
Was anything suspicious, Frank?
Nothing, Sister.

135
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,387
Dr. Thredson seems like
he's on the up-and-up.

136
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,189
Well, I'll determine that.

137
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,491
You won't believe...
Hold your water, Sister.

138
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,893
I'm finishing up something here.

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,261
Keep watching, Frank.

140
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,595
Assume the worst.

141
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:46,898
Roger that, Sister.

142
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:51,103
What are you doing?

143
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,906
Someone's been drinking
the communion wine.

144
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:55,641
I think it might be Spivey.

145
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,876
I saw him sneaking out of the chapel.

146
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,312
Taste it, Sister.
I'm sure it's been watered down.

147
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,780
You know I don't imbibe.

148
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:03,615
Oh, of course.
How could I forget?

149
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:06,118
Since 1949, when you had a calling

150
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,487
from Jesus Christ our Lord,

151
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,555
which inspired you to renounce
alcohol, and turn your back on

152
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:11,823
all worldly pleasures.

153
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,725
I'll taste it.

154
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,195
What's that on your face?

155
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:20,531
On your mouth, to be exact?

156
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,066
Mm.

157
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,935
I might have been mistaken.

158
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,304
It tastes rich.
Put that wine down.

159
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:28,939
You look like a streetwalker.

160
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,607
Are you wearing lipstick?

161
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,009
Mm-hmm.

162
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,644
It's called "Ravish Me Red."

163
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,845
It suits my porcelain
complexion, don't you think?

164
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:39,048
Hand it over.
Oh, it's for you, actually.

165
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:40,583
I hope you don't mind
that I tried it first.

166
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:43,952
We don't wear makeup.

167
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,921
Mm. And I told him that.

168
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:47,489
But Dr. Arden insisted.

169
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:49,824
He said, "Red is Sister Jude's
favorite color",

170
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:52,193
and she'll understand just
why I want her to have it."

171
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,633
ARDEN: Do you recognize this,
Mr. Walker?

172
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,601
It certainly seems to recognize you.

173
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,338
It's what came out of you
during your last visit.

174
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:07,208
And so desperately
wants to get back in.

175
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,081
What are you doing?

176
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:14,450
I assume it works on some sort of

177
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,653
magnetic principle.

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,121
Have you noticed any other
lumps or protrusions?

179
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:19,523
No.

180
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,359
Who are you working for?

181
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:24,194
What?

182
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:25,996
Come, come, Mr. Walker.

183
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,931
Let us not play games.

184
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,202
This is not the first attempt
to infiltrate my labs.

185
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,470
I don't know what
you're talking about!

186
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,205
You were approached by someone.

187
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:37,276
Someone who knew you
were being sent here.

188
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:38,910
They implanted this technology in you,

189
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,645
in order to spy on me.

190
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,548
No, you're wrong.
Was it the Stasi?

191
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:46,117
The East Germans have a particular
talent for surveillance.

192
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,985
KGB?

193
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,555
I understand

194
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:52,958
there are even some elements
within the U.S government.

195
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:54,359
Oh, yes.

196
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:57,596
Jews, and fellow travelers.

197
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:58,931
Who was it?

198
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,432
It was no one.

199
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,600
I swear.

200
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:07,038
You can swear
all you like, Mr. Walker,

201
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:08,873
but I will get to the truth.

202
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:13,277
In here, we have all
the time in the world.

203
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,613
(screaming)

204
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:31,041
(gasps)

205
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,703
Why are you so fearful, my child?

206
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:49,120
I can't imagine
what you're so afraid of.

207
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,689
Get on your knees
and we'll pray it all away.

208
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:54,559
No... no.

209
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,013
(woman praying in Spanish)

210
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,525
(praying in Spanish)

211
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,483
(wind whistles, thunder rumbles)

212
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,597
(thunder crashes)

213
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:12,571
(raspy breathing)

214
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,810
(knocking on door)

215
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:27,711
Who is it? (Door opens)

216
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,313
(opera music playing)

217
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,382
You wanted to see me?

218
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,184
Little Sister.

219
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:35,320
My ray of sunshine.

220
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:36,521
Come in.

221
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,493
Please.

222
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,132
So, tell me...

223
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,133
how are you doing?

224
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,402
I did a feeding last night.

225
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,770
The creatures are getting hungrier.

226
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,571
I'm worried, Doctor.

227
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,573
What will happen when it's freezing?

228
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,576
And now this storm?

229
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,545
We only have to get them
through the winter.

230
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:05,117
I can't tell you
how much your compassion

231
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:07,152
for these creatures means to me.

232
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,588
Oh, please.

233
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,090
You know you got me in here

234
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,759
just so you can undress me
with your eyes.

235
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:17,162
Imagine sucking on my rosebud tits.

236
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,330
Don't talk like that.

237
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:20,532
Come on, big boy.

238
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,467
Show me what you got.

239
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:25,036
A little bride of Christ
has had an awakening.

240
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:27,772
Not to the Lord...

241
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,474
but to the power of sex...

242
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,508
lust...

243
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:31,642
desire.

244
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,910
Stop it.

245
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:36,047
Put your mouth where you want to.

246
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,281
Don't let it go to waste, Doc.

247
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:38,916
I'm all juicy.

248
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,920
(grunts)

249
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,922
Shut your filthy mouth.

250
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:50,361
(laughing)

251
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:54,532
I didn't know you were such
a sad little pantywaist.

252
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,967
Get out of my office!

253
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:57,101
(laughs)

254
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,618
THREDSON: A little lower
on the right there.

255
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:14,420
Perfect. Thank you, gentlemen.

256
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,722
("Dominique" playing)

257
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,430
Dr. Thredson?

258
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:25,564
My name

259
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:26,932
is Lana Winters.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,434
Can I have a word with you?

261
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,502
In private?

262
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:38,242
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

263
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,845
Thank you.

264
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,684
Miss Winters, I know a
little about your case,

265
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,853
but I'm not authorized
to discuss your treatment.

266
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,521
Unfortunately, I'm only

267
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,690
officially here
to evaluate one patient.

268
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,658
No, it's not about me.

269
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:56,060
I'm going to go out on a limb here.

270
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,762
But I've been watching you,

271
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,163
and I know...

272
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,098
you're not one of them.

273
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,566
I'm desperate.

274
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,735
I need to get a message to my friend

275
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,505
on the outside... Wendy Peyser.

276
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,775
Your friend... she's the reason
why you're in here?

277
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:16,348
She hasn't written or called.

278
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,583
I know Sister Jude is
keeping her away from me.

279
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,619
If I could just see her,

280
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:23,689
I could straighten this out.

281
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:25,992
Dr. Thredson...

282
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,828
you are my last hope.

283
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,997
Will you help me
give her this message?

284
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:34,367
You're asking me
to betray Sister Jude...

285
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:37,237
who is the administrator
of this sanitarium.

286
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,734
I saw you guys conspiring upstairs.

287
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:11,703
You're plotting your next escape.

288
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:12,871
I don't know what
you're talking about.

289
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:16,342
Are we talking to you?

290
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,677
I can help. I'm smart.

291
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,979
Smarter than that
stuck-up bitch reporter.

292
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:22,013
Come on, Grace.

293
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,616
I got to get out of here.

294
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:28,053
Why? So you can
screw more guys?

295
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,788
You think, as a little girl,
I dreamed I'd waste

296
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:31,156
my life away in the bughouse?

297
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,091
I want to go to Paris, France.

298
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:35,227
They're 20 years ahead of us.

299
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:37,296
Here, I'm a freak.
There I'd be celebrated.

300
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,399
Haven't you read <i>Delta of Venus?</i>

301
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:42,669
Anais Nin embraced her sexuality
without apology.

302
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:44,971
You're from there... you must
know what I'm talking about.

303
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,940
We left when I was nine.

304
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:49,776
But my mother and sister,
we speak French at home.

305
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:52,212
I'm gonna get out of here
with or without you.

306
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,548
We could help each other.

307
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,783
Please?

308
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:57,618
(man yells in distance)

309
00:17:57,686 --> 00:18:00,888
MAN: No, no. ORDERLY: Come on.

310
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:12,165
Feathering your love nest?

311
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,103
The radio said there was a danger

312
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:18,606
of the bridge being washed out
by the storm.

313
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,842
I thought it prudent
to spend the night.

314
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:26,581
Sister Jude, I've had a very long,

315
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,583
particularly strange day.

316
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:33,054
Whatever it is you wanted,
I'm sure can wait till tomorrow.

317
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,890
"Ravish Me Red"?

318
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,660
(thunder crashes)

319
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:41,296
Sister Mary Eunice told me everything.

320
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,610
I admired her purity.

321
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,379
Her innocence.

322
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:00,782
I never had any.

323
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,617
Even as a boy.

324
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:04,285
Now it's gone.

325
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,920
It's been taken from her.

326
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:09,123
Are those tears?

327
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,459
Sister Mary Eunice

328
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,927
has been corrupted.

329
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:16,130
It's this place.
Those patients.

330
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,832
That loathsome Shelley.

331
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,834
She's a wretched influence.

332
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:21,768
If she's been corrupted,
it's because of you.

333
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,671
Your leers are quite transparent.

334
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,241
She's a sensitive child.

335
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,877
Your perversion has
awakened something in her

336
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,712
that she can't begin to understand.

337
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,648
My feelings for her are nothing
if not entirely pure.

338
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,851
She came in here and propositioned me!

339
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,453
Exposed herself to me, like a whore.

340
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,921
I see through your game.

341
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,088
You're trying

342
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:43,924
to drive me from my position,

343
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,759
so you can take over.

344
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:48,262
First the newspaper...

345
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,698
and now, lipstick?

346
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:55,036
But it's not gonna work
because you don't know

347
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:57,239
what you think you know.

348
00:19:57,307 --> 00:20:01,110
You're coming apart
at the seams, Sister.

349
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:04,547
Perhaps it would be best
if you took a leave of absence.

350
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:08,617
(quiet laugh)

351
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm on to you.

352
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,427
Blessed are thee,
blessed are thou among women...

353
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:22,630
(phone ringing)

354
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:34,040
Briarcliff Manor.

355
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,743
Hello?

356
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:40,513
Hello? Who is this?

357
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:43,049
GIRL: You left me there.

358
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,322
Who...

359
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,226
who is this?

360
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,129
You never even bothered
to get out of the car.

361
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,933
(sobbing)

362
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,045
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,413
I'm so sorry.

364
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,249
(click, dial tone drones)

365
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:24,192
(sobbing)

366
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,827
No... (sobs)

367
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:19,690
(thunder crashes)

368
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,207
ANNOUNCER:
Travel warnings continue

369
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:37,276
for Freemont and Braintree Counties.

370
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,545
Flooding expected in Miranda
and parts of Cape Cod.

371
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:41,747
Stay indoors.

372
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,349
We have more on those strange
lights sighted

373
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,284
over parts of Wasagee County.

374
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,685
Residents continue to insist

375
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,321
these are not lightning strikes.

376
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:51,423
Fears of a possible downed
aircraft have put

377
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:53,525
local emergency
rescue workers on the alert.

378
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:56,929
So far, the cause of the strange
activity remains a mystery.

379
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:01,400
(patients clamoring)

380
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:12,210
(blows whistle)

381
00:23:18,552 --> 00:23:20,753
Take your seats!

382
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:23,556
Take your seats!
No more dillydallying!

383
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:24,324
Sit down!

384
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,160
Sit down!

385
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:32,532
Is everyone accounted for?

386
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
The Mexican wasn't in

387
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:36,269
her room, so I was
gonna go look for her.

388
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,171
No, I want you to stay here.

389
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:41,674
I'll go, after
I introduce the picture.

390
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:43,109
Okey-doke.

391
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,182
Welcome, one and all,

392
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,453
to Briarcliff Manor's
inaugural movie night.

393
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,321
(chuckles)

394
00:23:55,389 --> 00:24:00,661
Whether this evening marks the
start of a, of a beloved trend,

395
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:07,335
tradition, or just another
bitter disappointment,

396
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,504
is entirely up to you.

397
00:24:13,442 --> 00:24:16,644
Now...

398
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:21,282
settle in, relax,
and return with me now

399
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,319
to ancient Rome as we present

400
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:30,925
the 1932
Cecil B. DeMille classic,

401
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:33,161
<i>The Sign of the Cross,</i>

402
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:39,267
starring Miss Claudette Colbert
as the Empress Poppea...

403
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:40,969
or "Po-ppea,"

404
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:44,206
and as the Emperor Nero,

405
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:49,344
the incomparable
Mr. Charles Laughton...

406
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:51,880
who I understand
is an enormous whoopsie.

407
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,715
(thunder crashes, patients scream)

408
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,318
Now none of that!
None of that! None of that.

409
00:24:56,386 --> 00:24:57,919
Chin up! Chin up high! Hey!

410
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:03,993
Now don't be afraid of the dark.

411
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:10,499
At the end...

412
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:13,302
of a storm...

413
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:14,670
is a golden sky...

414
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:19,508
the bright silver song...

415
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,509
of a lark.

416
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:25,546
Walk on through the wind.

417
00:25:25,614 --> 00:25:28,216
Walk on through the rain.

418
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:30,952
(chuckles)

419
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,157
Though your dreams may be tossed
and blown...

420
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:40,229
walk on, walk on...

421
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:43,867
with hope...

422
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:45,402
in your heart.

423
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,441
And you'll never walk alone.

424
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,843
You'll never walk a...

425
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:54,912
But she was alone.

426
00:25:58,117 --> 00:26:03,255
A tiny, little fragile
thing out, out in the world,

427
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:06,391
in the gloaming.

428
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,328
And the storm that came...

429
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:16,167
was not rain and it was not wind.

430
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:20,438
It was something...

431
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,140
altogether else.

432
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,310
(gasps)

433
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,113
(thunder crashes, patients clamor)

434
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:36,754
Lights.

435
00:26:36,822 --> 00:26:38,823
I'm off to find the Mexican.

436
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,267
What the hell was that all about?

437
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,269
LANA: She's bats,
or hadn't you noticed?

438
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,271
MAN (in film):
Burn, Rome, burn!

439
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:57,975
(laughing)

440
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:00,344
Did you speak to Wendy? What?

441
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,647
I tried to phone you,
but there was no answer.

442
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:05,149
So I went to check on her.

443
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:06,951
(door creaks)

444
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:08,819
Hello?

445
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:10,621
<i>I rang the bell,</i>
<i>but the door was unlocked,</i>

446
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:11,856
<i>so I let myself in.</i>

447
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:20,197
(door creaks)

448
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:23,867
Hello? Is anyone here?

449
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,171
Miss Peyser?

450
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:32,943
Wendy?

451
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:34,845
(wind whistling)

452
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:40,917
Miss Winters, I know how
alarming this is, but I'm afraid

453
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,419
something might have
happened to your friend.

454
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,654
What do you mean?

455
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:48,191
(wind whistling)

456
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:52,061
THREDSON:
<i>There were certain similarities</i>

457
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,029
<i>between Miss Peyser's disappearance.</i>

458
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:56,065
<i>Shh!</i>
<i>And some of the other victims.</i>

459
00:27:58,201 --> 00:27:59,768
Shh! Other victims?

460
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:01,870
What are you saying?

461
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:03,438
MAN (in film):
Yes, Divine Caesar, these rumors

462
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:07,141
about my setting fire to the city...

463
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,576
That I have some... Shh!

464
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:12,079
Shh!

465
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:15,449
Couldn't we shift the blame to...?

466
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:18,052
The Christian?

467
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,720
(man yelling)

468
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:21,588
(film continues indistinctly)

469
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:28,629
That I have some concerns,

470
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,398
concerns which I've
related to the police.

471
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:33,701
But unfortunately, they're
so invested in the idea

472
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,102
that they've already
caught their maniac

473
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,604
that they won't even
entertain the idea.

474
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:40,440
But maybe they haven't.

475
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,509
(man yelling)
Sit down and watch the movie!

476
00:28:42,577 --> 00:28:45,245
Hey, Bernie?

477
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:49,916
(yelling continues)

478
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:52,718
But they have caught him,
haven't they?

479
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:56,521
Do you think I could use
the bathroom really quickly?

480
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,223
What is it with you people?

481
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:00,692
Haven't they?

482
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,763
To be honest, I'm not so sure anymore.

483
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,533
I'm having my period.
Ah, I don't want to hear it.

484
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,201
Don't make me come with you, okay?

485
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,303
Yeah. Thank you.

486
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:17,776
WOMAN (in film):
Which perfume, Empress?

487
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,312
EMPRESS:
The jasmine and the acacia.

488
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:24,783
(various patients wolf whistling)

489
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:28,920
There are so many beautiful
women in Rome.

490
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,656
It's really not appropriate
for me to be seeing this...

491
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:34,225
considering my condition.
Sister Jude will understand.

492
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:36,561
I'm going to the ladies'.

493
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:39,330
POPPEA: Dacia, you're a butterfly
with the sting of a wasp.

494
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:40,798
Take off your clothes.

495
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:45,002
Get in here and tell me all about it.

496
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,571
Hello?

497
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,140
(thunder crashes)

498
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,080
Where's that goddamn Mexican?

499
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:58,882
(distant clank)

500
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:05,657
Who's there?

501
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:12,062
Who's there?

502
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,239
We picked a hell of a night for it.

503
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:24,774
Yeah, it's good.
Perfect, in fact.

504
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:26,809
The storm will cover our tracks.

505
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:29,378
All we have to do is
go through those doors,

506
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:31,680
through the staff lounge
and into the boiler room.

507
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,948
And that'll take us where, Narnia?

508
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:35,150
There's an old tunnel

509
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:37,318
that leads into the woods...
assuming it's really there.

510
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:40,055
It's there. That touched nun
brought me through it.

511
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:42,557
I'll show you;
Just take me with you.

512
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:46,494
Screw you. You had your chance.

513
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:49,064
I was wrong about you.
I'm sorry.

514
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:50,799
But someone I love may be in danger.

515
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:53,168
I know you can understand that.

516
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:54,269
GRACE:
We have to take her down.

517
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:55,904
She'll raise the alarm.

518
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:57,639
No, she won't.
She's coming with us.

519
00:30:57,707 --> 00:30:59,074
GRACE: What?!

520
00:30:59,142 --> 00:31:00,375
We don't have time to argue.
Come on.

521
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,913
Shit.

522
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,048
Carl's out there.
What are we gonna do?

523
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,116
Whatever we have to.

524
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:08,485
We may not get another chance.

525
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:09,719
We're going through that door.

526
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:11,288
You're not taking down Carl.

527
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:14,191
He was a Marine.
He fought in Korea.

528
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,693
I'll make sure
you get through the door.

529
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,096
Just, just try and wait for me.
Wait for you?

530
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:21,431
If you can't, if I don't make it out,

531
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:24,301
make sure you write the story

532
00:31:24,368 --> 00:31:26,002
that blows the doors off this place.

533
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,804
Don't forget about me.

534
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,676
Shelley, what are you doing out here?

535
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:34,812
I got bored.
Yeah, you're always bored.

536
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:38,015
You need to be in that movie
with the others. Go on.

537
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:39,349
I've already seen it.

538
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,151
The Christians get eaten.

539
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:43,420
I'd rather be eating something else.

540
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:45,622
Shelley, I don't have time.

541
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,923
The Mexican's missing.

542
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:48,925
Jude's out here looking, too.

543
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:50,227
Did you check the hydrotherapy room?
What?

544
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:53,197
Come on, Carl...
I'll help you look.

545
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:55,133
You never know where
she might be hiding.

546
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:58,770
Shit, Shelley.

547
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:01,841
Come on.

548
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:09,583
Stop!

549
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,287
Damn it, I said stop!

550
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,835
There you are...

551
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,704
whore.

552
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:40,546
(groans)

553
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:49,322
I don't see a door. It's here.

554
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,328
Come on.

555
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:05,172
Whore.

556
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:07,876
Whore...

557
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,517
Whore!

558
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:22,024
(moaning)

559
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:25,695
Hey, why'd you stop?

560
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,432
I'm sorry, Carl.

561
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,334
I gotta get out of here.

562
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:34,170
(screams, gasps)

563
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:36,172
(thunder crashing)

564
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,042
Where do you think you're going...

565
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:45,280
...whore?

566
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:55,956
(rattling in distance)

567
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:00,160
(door clanks, screeches open)

568
00:34:00,228 --> 00:34:01,428
(thunder rumbling)

569
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,263
We waited as long as we can.

570
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:05,032
Something must have happened to her.

571
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,366
Any minute now, they're gonna
notice we're missing

572
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:07,768
from that movie,
if they haven't already.

573
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:09,703
We'll get her out.
Her and everybody else.

574
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:11,638
I'll expose every
sick thing going on here.

575
00:34:17,979 --> 00:34:18,912
Let's go.

576
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,781
(thunder crashing)

577
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,789
(whooping, laughing)

578
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:33,361
I didn't think I could feel
this good ever again,

579
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,595
and I hate the rain.

580
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:39,133
(thunder crashing)

581
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,301
Come on, we have to get
as far away from here,

582
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,103
while we still can.

583
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:43,671
From what I remember,

584
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:44,605
the road's a couple miles
north of here.

585
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,307
That way, through the trees.

586
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,142
I don't trust you.
Once we get to the road,

587
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,477
that's as far as you go with us.

588
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:55,650
(anxious whimpering)

589
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:57,551
(hissing)

590
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,120
(woman screaming in film)

591
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,392
It's our time! It's our time!

592
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,393
We're not afraid.

593
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:09,595
MAN (in film): Stand up there!
(whip cracks)

594
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:12,032
WOMAN (in film):
Go proudly! Singing!

595
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,736
There is no death, only
a crossing over to the Father.

596
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:19,039
(lions growling in film)

597
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:21,875
Excuse me. What?

598
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:23,510
There appear to be
some patients missing.

599
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:24,578
Have you been aware of that?

600
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:28,749
Oh, shit.

601
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,150
Pepper pee.

602
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:32,286
Yeah, go on. Go pee.

603
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:35,322
(Christian martyrs singing in film)

604
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:39,360
Excuse me, Sister.

605
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,761
I think we might have a problem.

606
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,463
Now?

607
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:45,333
But the Christians are
about to be eaten.

608
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:46,601
(thunder crashing)

609
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:52,007
(singing continues in film)

610
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,380
(thunder crashes)

611
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,149
I was just going to the infirmary.

612
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:00,783
(lock clicks)

613
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,287
I think I'm going to vomit.
That's fine.

614
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:08,524
Go ahead.

615
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:09,692
We can play doctor right here.

616
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,794
No, I'm not in the mood.

617
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:12,828
(chuckles)

618
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,630
You're always in the mood.

619
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,499
I must be the only guy in
here who hasn't had you yet.

620
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:19,401
That's not true.

621
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,604
What's more, I'm the one
who does the choosing.

622
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:23,406
Not tonight.

623
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,776
Turn around... and
spread your cheeks.

624
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:29,912
I thought I repulsed you.
Any port in a storm.

625
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,813
Now bend over! (Yells)

626
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:32,715
(thunder crashes)

627
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:34,150
I don't want to.

628
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:35,485
I want to go back to the movie.

629
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:36,420
(with mock sympathy): Oh...

630
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,189
(Shelley yells)

631
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:42,192
No...! No!

632
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:44,661
No! Help!

633
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:46,929
Rape!

634
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:47,997
(scoffing): Rape. Help!

635
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:50,332
That's rich, coming from you.

636
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,200
(screams)
Go ahead, scream your head off.

637
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:53,835
No one's going to hear you in here.

638
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,336
Help!

639
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:00,641
(laughing, then muffled snickering)

640
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:02,476
Don't you dare laugh at me.

641
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:05,446
(laughing): What happened?

642
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,414
Shut up!

643
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:08,449
Were you in an accident?

644
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,952
Oh, you're seven feet all,
I thought you'd be hung like...

645
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:11,752
Shut up! (Thud)

646
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:15,956
(thunder crashing)

647
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:19,826
(screams)

648
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:24,298
(screams)

649
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:26,133
I think we found the Mexican!

650
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,602
(eerie growling in distance)

651
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:40,182
KIT: Run! (Screaming)

652
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,126
What are they?
What's chasing us!

653
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:51,594
(screaming)

654
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:52,595
KIT: Don't look back! Just run!

655
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:54,764
(screeching)

656
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:56,165
(growls)

657
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,066
Come on!

658
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,303
KIT: Go! Run, run!
Into the tunnel!

659
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:14,416
(door clanks shut)

660
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:18,019
(knocking on door)
Sister Jude? Sister Jude?

661
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,488
Sister...

662
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:21,556
you need to wake up.

663
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,597
What's going on?
Frank said I had to fetch you.

664
00:38:27,664 --> 00:38:29,232
There's a big problem.
They're very worried.

665
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,434
Oh, my God in Heaven.

666
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:32,802
They've seen it, too.

667
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,338
Seen what, Sister?

668
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:39,042
What...?

669
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:47,418
Please explain to me
how three patients

670
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:50,655
could just get up and walk out
of here right under your nose.

671
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:53,124
I guess I was just watching the movie.
Yeah.

672
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:56,227
(crowd yelling in movie)

673
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,396
MAN (in movie):
...renounced his faith.

674
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,464
Movie night is at an end.

675
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:02,566
(audience protesting)
But the picture's not over.

676
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,702
Yeah, well, they all die.
Satisfied?

677
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,304
Now, listen up.

678
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,006
There will not be another movie night

679
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:11,242
nor any other special privileges

680
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:13,077
in the foreseeable future.

681
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,881
And for that, you can thank
the three scofflaws

682
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,849
who abused my good will.

683
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:21,385
(thunder crashes)

684
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:27,157
A sex-crazed deviant, a Mexican,

685
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:30,994
and a pinhead won't get far
in this storm.

686
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,596
I hope they all drown out there.

687
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,931
Lights out in ten minutes.

688
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,000
All right, let's go.

689
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:41,305
(raspy breathing)

690
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:45,342
(groans)

691
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:50,547
(gasping)

692
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:52,849
SHELLEY: Please...

693
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:54,351
let me go.

694
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,890
Sister Jude will look for me.

695
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,225
Oh, they are looking for you.

696
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:04,795
In the woods.

697
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,997
You see, they all think
you ran away last night,

698
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:09,767
along with several of the others.

699
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:14,739
In fact, Sister Jude thinks
you're the ringleader.

700
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:16,441
(anxious gasping)

701
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:18,643
Please...

702
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:21,179
if you let me walk out of here,

703
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:22,580
I won't tell them anything.

704
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:24,449
I promise!

705
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:25,683
I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

706
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,986
You were a very
naughty girl last night.

707
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:31,422
You tried to fly away,
so I had to clip your wings.

708
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,924
But not to worry.

709
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:35,293
My surgical training was impeccable.

710
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:39,364
(gasps)

711
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:43,335
(screaming)
