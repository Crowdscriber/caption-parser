00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:03,303
You think this was
a copycat?

3
00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:04,944
I almost feel like he's
mocking her.

4
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:07,591
Your name is Georgia Madchen.

5
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,045
You're not alone.

6
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,312
- Somebody told him we were coming.
- The man on the phone?

7
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:13,639
Did you recognize his voice?

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,518
How much would I get
if you wrote a book about me?

9
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,803
Nicholas Boyle was gutted
with a hunting knife.

10
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:20,179
- You knew how to do that.
- You think I did this?

11
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,074
You and I are just gonna have
to have a difference of opinion

12
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,243
- about who Will is, doctor.
- I'm worried about you, Will.

13
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:26,812
What if you lose time and hurt
yourself? Or someone else?

14
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,282
You look better.

15
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:05,701
Do I look alive?

16
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,838
You look pretty.

17
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,344
Must be all the oxygen.

18
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:20,616
They say what's
wrong with you?

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,636
No, just the fever.

20
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,955
They're trying to find out
what else.

21
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,641
They won't find anything.

22
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:32,177
They'll keep looking,
keep taking tests,

23
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:35,981
keep giving false diagnoses,
bad meds.

24
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,784
But they won't find out
what's wrong.

25
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:42,688
They'll just know

26
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:45,157
that you're wrong.

27
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,293
I hope you have
good insurance.

28
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:50,445
I do too.

29
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:53,632
They're going to give me
shock treatment.

30
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:57,686
Electroconvulsive Therapy is
what it's called.

31
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:01,257
Shock treatment sounds nicer.

32
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,560
People who have what you have can
recover with shock treatment.

33
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:07,529
You know how many times
I've been told

34
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:11,383
I could recover with treatment?

35
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:14,570
They said I might remember
what I did.

36
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,708
But I don't want to remember.

37
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,347
You know what you did,
Georgia.

38
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,652
But I don't remember it.

39
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:34,206
It feels more like

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,309
a horrible dream
where I killed my friend.

41
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:43,716
You dream about killing
anybody else?

42
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,136
I dream you killed
that doctor.

43
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:56,895
But I couldn't see your face.

44
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,427
Smells delicious.

45
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:14,947
Silkie chicken in a broth.
A black-boned

46
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,715
bird prized in China

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,718
for its medicinal values
since the 7th century.

48
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:23,455
Wolfberries, ginseng,
ginger, red dates,

49
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,791
and star anise.

50
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:29,078
You made me chicken soup?

51
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:32,715
Yes.

52
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:40,656
The nurses tell me
you've been wandering, Will.

53
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:46,245
I was awake... heh...

54
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:49,398
and wandering with...
purpose

55
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,550
and good intentions.

56
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:56,004
Visiting that unfortunate
young woman

57
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:58,240
suffering from delusions.

58
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,242
She's my support group.

59
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,544
And I hope you're hers.

60
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:05,030
Nothing more isolating
than mental illness.

61
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,861
The hallucinations,

62
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:24,083
the, um, loss of time,
sleepwalking...

63
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:27,586
Could that have all just been
the fever?

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,007
Fevers can be symptoms
of dementia.

65
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,110
Dementia can be a symptom
of many things happening

66
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:38,147
in your body or mind that can
no longer be ignored, Will.

67
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:45,670
Does Jack know?

68
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:49,057
That this could be more than
a fever? No. I haven't told him.

69
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,075
Shouldn't you?

70
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,061
Not until we know for certain.

71
00:04:55,965 --> 00:05:00,802
What we must do now is continue to
support and monitor your recovery.

72
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:04,573
This young woman
you were visiting,

73
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:07,208
how's her recovery?

74
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:10,929
I don't think she wants
to recover.

75
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:13,632
Afraid to remember
what she did.

76
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,602
Can't say I blame her.

77

79
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:23,765
Hospital speculates that it was
a short circuit that ignited the fire.

80
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:27,006
Unit looks well maintained.
No exposed wiring.

81
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:31,395
Horrible way to die.

82
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,348
There was a kid in Italy
who was in one of these things.

83
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:37,534
A spark of static electricity
from his pajamas set it off.

84
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,789
Two cubic yards of oxygen suddenly
became two cubic yards of fire.

85
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,724
Is it possible
that she set the fire herself?

86
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:45,676
She wasn't wearing
her grounding bracelet,

87
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,312
which prevents the build-up
of static electricity.

88
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:52,049
She took it off.
Suicide by immolation?

89
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,984
She was facing
two murder charges...

90
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,303
No. She wasn't
suicidal, Jack.

91
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,589
Sh-she was sick.

92
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:01,091
I was here.
I spoke to her.

93
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:06,613
Why did you speak with her?

94
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:10,034
Because I know how she felt.

95
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:12,987
She's a murder suspect.
She tried to kill you.

96
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,439
Your trying to be her friend
impacts the case against her.

97
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:17,891
Well, the case against her
doesn't really matter anymore,

98
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:19,376
does it, Jack?

99
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,904
We could use the articles
I wrote at the time

100
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,474
of each of the murders
as book chapter headings.

101
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,778
The chapters themselves would be
you telling your story...

102
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:40,764
Where you were and what you were
thinking when, one by one,

103
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:44,585
eight girls just like you
all over Minnesota were disappearing.

104
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,971
What are we gonna call it?

105
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:52,409
I thought about <i>The Last Victim,</i>

106
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,430
but there is already a book about
serial killers called <i>The Last Victim.</i>

107
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,766
Was it a bestseller?

108
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,350
Absolutely.

109
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:03,070
Especially after the guy
who wrote it killed himself.

110
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,808
Just as well.

111
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:10,994
Wasn't really my dad's
last victim anyway, was I?

112
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,117
Who was?

113
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,787
Marissa.

114
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:23,907
Marissa Schuur was killed
by the copycat.

115
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,609
So was Cassie Boyle.

116
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,995
I still blame my dad.

117
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:32,165
Blame him
for Nick Boyle's death?

118
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:36,603
I blame Nick Boyle
for Nick Boyle's death.

119
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:39,206
He killed Marissa.
He got what was coming to him.

120
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,058
Nick Boyle did not
kill your friend.

121
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,609
Then who did?

122
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:48,132
who killed Nick?

123
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:54,588
Nick Boyle was just
a dumb kid

124
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:59,510
who was really messed up
because his sister was murdered.

125
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:02,196
He wasn't a killer.

126
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,783
I've interviewed enough killers
to know one when I see one.

127
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:10,821
What gives them away?

128
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:17,010
A very specific brand
of hostility.

129
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,332
I see it every time I look
at Will Graham.

130
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,285
He did kill my dad.

131
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:29,640
As far as I'm concerned,
he killed Nick Boyle.

132
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:35,295
He and Jack Crawford told
everyone Nick was the copycat,

133
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,132
and then someone
murdered him for it.

134
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,552
You really don't think
he did it.

135
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:47,958
Whoever killed Nicholas Boyle
killed an innocent man.

136
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,088
See?

137
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,545
See?

138
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,602
What are you doing
here?

139
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,184
Checked myself out of
the hospital.

140
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:26,682
Well, check yourself
back in.

141
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,415
- The fever broke.
- I don't care.

142
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,166
Georgia Madchen didn't
commit suicide,

143
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,775
and whatever happened
to her wasn't an accident.

144
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,031
I'm gonna have Z come down here
and stick a thermometer in you,

145
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:36,832
and if you've got a
temperature higher than 99...

146
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:38,414
She was murdered, Jack.

147
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,654
By who?

148
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:47,625
By whoever killed
Dr. Sutcliffe.

149
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:51,912
His blood was all over
Georgia Madchen. Her DNA was

150
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,914
- all over him.
- She told me there was

151
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:57,735
somebody else there.
She couldn't see his face.

152
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,438
There was somebody else there.
It was Dr. Sutcliffe.

153
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,873
She couldn't see his face
because she cut it

154
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,658
in half! Will,

155
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,727
I understand. You're looking
for an explanation,

156
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:08,829
an explanation
that makes all of this ok.

157
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,415
No! No, no, no. I don't.
That is not what I want. Listen,

158
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,768
something went wrong, and
we will never know what that is,

159
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:18,038
but for all the doctors she saw,
for all of the help she received,

160
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,157
she was fighting
that wrong alone.

161
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,143
There is nothing you could do
about that.

162
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,845
All her adult life
this woman was misunderstood,

163
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:26,330
and what I can do

164
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:30,718
is make sure that her death
isn't misunderstood.

165
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,971
She didn't kill herself.

166
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:36,824
And this wasn't an accident.

167
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:58,562
So, we dismantled the oxygen chamber... see
if anyone tampered with the wiring,

168
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,664
or even like a short circuit.
But nothing.

169
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,082
So what sparked the fire?

170
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,551
Inconclusive, but...

171
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:07,354
Not conclusively inconclusive.
Found this.

172
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,657
Thought it might've been part of
the bed or monitoring equipment,

173
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:12,626
but mass spectrometer said
it was celluloid plastic.

174
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:14,611
They don't use plastic
in those things.

175
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,381
Right, right. It generates,
uh, static electricity.

176
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,885
Her hair was melted right in there.
It's preserved like it was in Amber.

177
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:27,141
Could it have been
a plastic comb?

178
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:29,276
Well, static charge
from a plastic comb

179
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,245
in a highly oxygenated
environment

180
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,800
would be a powerful accelerant.

181
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,446
Anything combustible
in there would combust.

182
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,517
You're holding
the murder weapon.

183
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:39,220
Or whatever she used
to kill herself, yeah?

184
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,739
- Will...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

185
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,407
Whoever killed Sutcliffe

186
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:45,576
wanted to kill him
how Georgia Madchen

187
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,597
killed her victim, but...
but not exactly how. Correct?

188
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:52,816
Georgia Madchen carved up
her victim's face.

189
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,370
Sutcliffe was, uh, nearly
decapitated at the jaw. I mean...

190
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:58,339
So she went further
the second time.

191
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,342
- Serial killers often do that.
- She was copied. Like, uh,

192
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:04,778
whoever killed Marissa Schuur
and Cassie Boyle wanted to copy

193
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,798
how Garret Jacob Hobbs killed
his victims.

194
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:17,825
But not exactly how.

195
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,077
Wait a minute.
Are you saying

196
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:24,531
that Dr. Sutcliffe was killed
by Garret Jacob Hobbs' copycat?

197
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:30,254
So was Georgia Madchen.

198
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,009
Because he thinks
she saw his face.

199
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,127
You said Nicholas Boyle was
the copycat.

200
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,564
His blood was on one of the victims.
Nicholas Boyle is dead.

201
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:44,001
Well, then he isn't
the copycat.

202
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,254
<i>Could this be more</i>
<i>than just a fever?</i>

203
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:50,874
Will is connecting murders that
previously had no connections.

204
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,376
Beyond his involvement

205
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,029
- in the investigations?
- That's right.

206
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,448
So you're wondering if the lines are
blurring, or if he's on to something.

207
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,484
I'm wondering
all sorts of things.

208
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,573
What's Will's relationship
with Abigail Hobbs right now?

209
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:14,682
- You think he's protecting her.
- He has been

210
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:18,252
ever since he shot her father.
I just don't know from what.

211
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:21,088
I can't imagine he would hide
anything criminal from you.

212
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:24,825
I've only ever known Will as a man
striving to be his best self.

213
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,412
You haven't known him
that long.

214
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,031
But we both know him well enough
to know he hasn't been himself.

215
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,351
He needs our support,

216
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,503
whether or not
mental illness is involved.

217
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,190
Mental illness...

218
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,359
Is it really mental illness,
doctor, or is it just that

219
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,695
his mind works so differently
from most people's

220
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,331
that we don't know
what else to call it?

221
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,886
There are days when even Will doesn't
understand his own thinking.

222
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,096
Dr. Dumaurier.

223
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,398
I'm Special Agent Jack Crawford
with the FBI.

224
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:07,084
I'd like to talk with you
about a patient of yours.

225
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:15,026
Do you have a court order?

226
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,080
Well I'd rather not get one,
if I don't have to.

227
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,691
So it's not an
official inquiry.

228
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,397
Not yet.

229
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:26,533
I'd hate to damage
anyone's reputation

230
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,468
unnecessarily.

231
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:31,154
Whose reputation
would that be?

232
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,540
I suspect that Dr. Hannibal

233
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,725
Lecter may be withholding
pertinent information

234
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,446
involving a murder
investigation.

235
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:42,432
No, thank you.

236
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:46,619
So... he hasn't confided
in the FBI.

237
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:50,657
You are hoping he's confided
in his psychiatrist

238
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,692
and that I'll tell you.

239
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,361
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,615
It's not that I think
Dr. Lecter's dangerous. I don't.

241
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,534
I am concerned
about a relationship he has

242
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,636
with one of his patients,
a man named Will Graham.

243
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:06,756
Without consent
or a court order,

244
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:09,426
I'd be in breach
of confidentiality.

245
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,178
That's correct.

246
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:14,564
So, if we can't discuss
Dr. Lecter,

247
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:17,117
perhaps we can discuss you.

248
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:21,438
You were attacked by a patient
not too long ago.

249
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:23,356
I read the report.

250
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:26,726
I know that there was
a statement given by Dr. Lecter.

251
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,896
The patient who attacked me

252
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,216
was a former patient
of Dr. Lecter.

253
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,819
And he was referred to you
by Dr. Lecter?

254
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,772
- Yes.
- And this patient almost killed you.

255
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:43,927
He swallowed his tongue
while he was attacking me.

256
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:46,463
That's the only thing
that saved my life.

257
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:50,133
Well, thank God
for small favors.

258
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,285
Yes, thank God.

259
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,190
You should know there was
another attack recently

260
00:18:57,224 --> 00:19:00,460
in Dr. Lecter's office.
It involved another patient.

261
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:03,463
Two dead, including the patient.

262
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:08,051
That's not bad psychology,
Agent Crawford.

263
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,603
Putting me in a position
to have to defend

264
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:13,239
- or not to defend Dr. Lecter.
- You have to admit

265
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:16,259
he's had some pretty strange
relationships with some of his patients.

266
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:22,064
Complicated patients are conducive
to complicated relationships.

267
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,917
All right.

268
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,953
How far do you think

269
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:30,824
Dr. Lecter would go in his therapy
to treat a patient? Specifically,

270
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,525
Will Graham.

271
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,613
Hannibal refers to Will Graham

272
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:40,183
more as a friend
than as a patient.

273
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:43,386
How far do you think
he would go to treat a friend?

274
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,805
Well, he doesn't have
many of them,

275
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,209
so I imagine he'd be loyal.

276
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:52,679
I know that he's concerned
about Will Graham

277
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:56,483
and I know that he wants
to help him.

278
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:59,502
Well, I consider Will a friend,

279
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,855
and I'd like to help him too.

280
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:05,108
It seems to me
that Will Graham would do well

281
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,277
to have more friends like

282
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,479
Dr. Lecter.

283
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,355
Will Graham theorized
that the copycat killer

284
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,059
and Garret Jacob Hobbs were
somehow connected...

285
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:25,027
That he had insight

286
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:27,497
into Hobbs' personal life,
that they may have met,

287
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,966
known each other,
perhaps even killed together.

288
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:32,902
See, I would call that less of
a theory, more of a hypothesis.

289
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:35,371
- Hm, theories require evidence.
- Hm.

290
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:38,875
Let's play jeopardy, shall we?
The answer is that

291
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,277
these people were killed
by the copycat, who's connected

292
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:43,279
to Garret Jacob Hobbs.
You tell me how.

293
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:45,248
You mean beyond the application

294
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:47,217
of supposition
and unexplained leaps?

295
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,903
- Yes, that's right.
- I've been yearning

296
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:52,071
for a return to the fundamentals
of investigation.

297
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:53,623
Right?

298
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:55,592
Where is Beverly?

299
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,728
- Jury duty.
- It's... she's deposed in court.

300
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:02,048
Get her out of court.
Then here's what we're gonna do.

301
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:06,636
I wanna look at train station,
airport, toll road, hotel details.

302
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,407
I wanna track Garret Jacob Hobbs using
license plate capture from security footage.

303
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:15,962
I also want to know every phone call
he made and where he made them from.

304
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:19,232
I'll see if I can get R & I to loan us a
couple of clerks to help us cross-match.

305
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,485
Good. I also want to know every place
that he went that wasn't home.

306
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,837
I want to know how long he was
there, I want to know who he was

307
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:28,258
there with, and I want to know the
travel time to the nearest missing girl

308
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,226
in the Minnesota Shrike Case.
You got it?

309
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:32,395
- Yep.
- Ok.

310
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:36,716
You told me
that killing someone was

311
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,718
the ugliest thing in the world.

312
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:45,124
One of them.

313
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,126
I finally get it.

314
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,898
I thought there was
something wrong with me

315
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:55,585
because I didn't feel ugly
when I killed Nick Boyle.

316
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,470
I felt good.

317
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:02,492
That's why it was so easy
to lie about it.

318
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:06,679
Like you didn't do
anything wrong.

319
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:10,149
Feel like you'd done something
wrong when you killed my dad?

320
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,920
I felt terrified.

321
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:18,474
And then...

322
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:20,476
I felt powerful.

323
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,682
It felt good...

324
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:29,369
to get to end it,
to stop it all.

325
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:33,306
- I thought I got away from him.
- Oh,

326
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,476
I don't think either of us have
gotten away from your father.

327
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,296
I wish I'd killed him.

328
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:44,117
For killing my mom,

329
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:47,153
for killing all those girls,
for making me...

330
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:49,872
Making you what, Abigail?

331
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,625
Part of it.

332
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,296
Part of any of it.

333
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,798
This wasn't supposed
to be my life.

334
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,705
It feels like my dad's
still out there.

335
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:08,691
In a way, he is.

336
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:12,879
You mean the copycat.

337
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,933
I think I can catch him.

338
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,694
But I'm gonna need your help.

339
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:46,412
An agent from the FBI came
to see me.

340
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:52,835
He asked me questions about your
relationship with Will Graham.

341
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,622
Jack Crawford was here?

342
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:58,825
Mm.

343
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,843
He had enough doubt

344
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,063
in whatever it is you told him
about your patient

345
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:06,399
to feel the need to verify.

346
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:10,119
He believes Abigail Hobbs was
involved in her father's crimes,

347
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:12,405
and he suspects Will is
protecting her.

348
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:16,242
And evidently he suspects
you are protecting Will.

349
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:19,462
Are you?

350
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:22,899
Are you asking
as my psychiatrist?

351
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:27,987
I'm stepping out of my role
as your psychiatrist

352
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:30,957
and I'm speaking to you now
as your colleague.

353
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:35,411
Whatever you're doing
with Will Graham,

354
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:37,930
stop.

355
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:40,683
Will needs my help.

356
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:44,153
You've crossed
professional lines.

357
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:46,322
By making a friend?

358
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:49,625
You cannot function
as an agent of friendship

359
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:52,762
for a man who is disconnected
from the concept

360
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,165
as a man who is disconnected
from the concept.

361
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,419
I'm protecting Will
from influence.

362
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:03,055
He has flaws in his intuitive beliefs
about what makes him who he is.

363
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,191
I'm trying to help him
understand.

364
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,560
You may not be able to.

365
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:10,730
I'm not comfortable
telling Will

366
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:13,015
that my very best attempts
to help him may fail

367
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,352
and that my loyalty to him and his
treatment could be compromised.

368
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:19,739
Then tell him something else.

369
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:24,410
Agent Crawford also asked me
about my attack.

370
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:29,732
I see.

371
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:33,903
What did you tell him?

372
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,723
Half truths.

373
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:45,181
That a violent patient swallowed his
tongue while he was attacking me.

374
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:50,937
I didn't tell him how or why

375
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,606
or who was responsible.

376
00:25:56,426 --> 00:26:00,780
You protect your patient from Jack
Crawford, but I can't protect mine.

377
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,348
Not anymore.

378
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:05,318
Even the very best
psychiatrists

379
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:09,572
have an inherent limitation
to their professional abilities.

380
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:13,109
You may find that difficult
to accept.

381
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:15,444
You're right. It is.

382
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:18,915
You have to maintain
boundaries, Hannibal.

383
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,019
When the pressures
of my personal

384
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:26,672
and professional relationships
with Will grow too great,

385
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:29,342
I assure you...

386
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:31,727
I'll find a way
to relieve them.

387
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:42,339
Much better now.

388
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:46,058
I feel clearer.

389
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,924
It had to be the fever.

390
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:53,845
I am finally thinking clearly
about the copycat.

391
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,033
The murders you're attributing
to the copycat have suspects

392
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:02,470
- whose DNA was found on the victims.
- So what?

393
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:05,773
You're choosing to ignore that?

394
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:08,459
Both of those suspects are
dead. I'm choosing

395
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,679
to factor that into my
psychological profile of a killer.

396
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,665
Georgia Madchen followed me
to Sutcliffe's office,

397
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,500
she witnessed his murder,
she saw the copycat.

398
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,468
Why not kill her
then and there?

399
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,238
Well, maybe h-he didn't have
the time. You know, she was

400
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,824
an unreliable witness,
so that bought him time.

401
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:26,127
So he framed her
for the murder.

402
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,282
But he wasn't planning
on framing her.

403
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,287
He was planning
on framing me.

404
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,005
You believe this is personal?

405
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,061
If it wasn't before,

406
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,063
it is now.

407
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,131
This could be someone
at the Bureau,

408
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,484
someone in the police
department, someone who knows

409
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:52,620
the crimes and has access
to the investigations.

410
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,789
Someone like you.

411
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,893
There will be evidence.

412
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:02,279
I found a pattern and now I'm
gonna reconstruct his thinking.

413
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:05,066
How do you intend to do that?

414
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,034
By taking Abigail
back to Minnesota.

415
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,620
Start where the copycat started

416
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,589
when he called
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

417
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,358
Will, this is venturing
into the paranoid.

418
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,345
I can't allow you to pull
Abigail into your delusion.

419
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:19,313
This isn't a delusion.

420
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:21,833
I'm not hallucinating.
I haven't lost time.

421
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,852
I am awake and this is real.

422
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:38,282
<i>We found</i>
<i>train tickets</i>

423
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,585
- purchased by Garret Jacob Hobbs.
- Tickets?

424
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:41,448
Two.

425
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:44,205
For the same train line that
one of his victims was using.

426
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,070
Elise Nichols?

427
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,859
Found more instances of Hobbs
crossing with victims.

428
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,328
Dinner receipts for two,
and two hotel rooms

429
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,280
- near the same campuses.
- We know

430
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,931
- he wasn't traveling alone.
- He was traveling with his daughter?

431
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,201
They were both registered
for the same orientation program

432
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,987
at St. Cloud State
on the Mississippi,

433
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:00,988
which is where the Nichols girl
was going to school.

434
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,608
Abigail Hobbs attended
orientations at every school

435
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:07,111
where a girl was abducted by the Minnesota
Shrike within days of the abduction.

436
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,881
She was with him when he was
choosing these girls.

437
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,749
She was the bait.

438
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:15,520
She was helping him
choose the girls.

439
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:19,307
The connection between the copycat killer
and Garret Jacob Hobbs might be family.

440
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,793
She kills Cassie Boyle
to impress dad?

441
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,878
She kills Marissa Schuur
in memoriam,

442
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:26,314
then she kills Nicholas Boyle
to cover her tracks?

443
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,834
Then why kill Dr. Sutcliffe?
Or the Madchen girl?

444
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,953
Because she's got a taste
for it now.

445
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:37,291
Or she wants to impress
someone new.

446
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,131
Hello, Agent Crawford.

447
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,267
Freddie Lounds.

448
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,503
You look like you came here
to arrest somebody.

449
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,488
Is it Abigail Hobbs,
or Will Graham?

450
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,039
Will Graham was here?

451
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,809
- Oh, then it was Abigail Hobbs.
- Where is she?

452
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,212
One of the other girls said Special
Agent Graham snuck her out.

453
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:00,331
I don't know why he would
feel the need to be sneaky.

454
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:04,619
He is registered as one
of her guardians. The irony.

455
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,838
Give us a minute here.

456
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,582
How's the book coming?

457
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,034
There's plot holes.

458
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,052
Tell me how you're
filling them in.

459
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,374
Did Abigail Hobbs kill
Nick Boyle?

460
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,860
Why do you say that?

461
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:33,898
Abigail is one
of those very smart girls

462
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,034
who hasn't quite figured out
that very smart girls grow up

463
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,320
and know all the moves
they're making

464
00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:42,423
when they're trying
to hide something.

465
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:44,959
What is Will Graham trying
to hide?

466
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:53,517
Sorry to barge in on you,
doctor. Couldn't wait.

467
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:58,428
You want to tell me what the hell is going
on between Will Graham and Abigail Hobbs?

468
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:04,228
Will has been victim of many
unusual and irrational thoughts.

469
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:07,598
- Has he acted on these thoughts?
- Not that I'm aware of.

470
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,568
Or he's aware of,
for that matter.

471
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,704
But he has experienced periods
of lost time.

472
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,756
Yes, I've seen him confused
at crime scenes.

473
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,192
I've seen him disoriented.

474
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,761
He may have been confused
because he was waking up.

475
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,631
Might not have known where
he was or how he got there.

476
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:25,116
Waking up?

477
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,118
From a dissociated
personality state.

478
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:31,606
He would appear perfectly normal
and not remember a thing.

479
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,774
But a fractured part
of him would.

480
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,277
And how long have you been
aware of this?

481
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,262
He's only recently started
to discuss these episodes.

482
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,715
Well, unless recently means
just before I walked

483
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,717
into your office, you failed
to mention any of this to me.

484
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,886
Because I was trying to determine if it was
trauma and stress from the work he's doing

485
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:48,572
for you, or mental illness.
I thought it wise

486
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,109
to be sure before making any kind of
claim about Will Graham's sanity.

487
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,229
He's taken Abigail Hobbs.

488
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,448
You have any idea
where they might be going?

489
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,284
- No.
- We have evidence

490
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,436
that she was involved
in some of her father's crimes.

491
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:05,406
We just don't know how involved.
Is it possible that Will knew

492
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,942
what Abigail was doing?
Is that why he's protecting her?

493
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,469
There's something
you should hear.

494
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:27,912
<i>How did you feel seeing Marissa
Schuur impaled in his antler room?</i>

495
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,714
<i>Guilty.</i>

496
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,849
<i>Because</i>
<i>you couldn't save her?</i>

497
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,151
<i>Because I felt</i>
<i>like I killed her.</i>

498
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,993
Where was Will the night
that Marissa Schuur was killed?

499
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,414
He was supposed to be
in his hotel room.

500
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:50,134
I knocked on his door.
He didn't answer.

501
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:54,422
We know he was in Dr. Sutcliffe's
office the night that he was killed.

502
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:57,925
And Will was the last person to visit
Georgia Madchen before she died.

503
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,768
This dissociative personality
state you say he goes into...

504
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,804
whose personality is it?

505
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,025
He said he got so close
to Garret Jacob Hobbs

506
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,044
and what he had done...

507
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,031
that he felt he
was becoming him.

508
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:24,235
And now he has Hobbs' daughter.

509
00:33:28,724 --> 00:33:31,475
Who Hobbs intended to kill.

510
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,067
I'm so sorry, Jack.

511
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:02,368
You look a little pasty.

512
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:04,429
Maybe you shouldn't have checked
yourself out of the hospital.

513
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:05,947
I feel fine.

514
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:17,359
It would've been
my mom's birthday next week.

515
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:21,646
We were gonna climb
Eagle Mountain to celebrate.

516
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,134
Highest point
in Minnesota, but...

517
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,070
it's not really that high.

518
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:31,923
Less than three hours
to summit. You can see

519
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:34,776
- Lake Superior from there.
- I could take you

520
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,495
if-if you wanna go.

521
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:43,051
I think it would
just make me sad.

522
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:46,838
Some places are
stained now.

523
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,957
Some people too.

524
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:53,545
I know I am.

525
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:37,122
The copycat knew your father well
enough to know about this place.

526
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:39,591
You felt like you knew
my father?

527
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,699
I wanted to understand him.

528
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:52,153
I felt like I had
to understand him.

529
00:35:56,725 --> 00:35:59,577
Do you ever hunt?

530
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:02,514
- I fish.
- It's the same thing,

531
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,482
isn't it?

532
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,468
One you stalk,

533
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:08,470
the other you lure.

534
00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:19,814
Were you more a fisherman
or a hunter?

535
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,417
My dad taught me how to hunt.

536
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:24,552
No, that's not
what I'm asking.

537
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,509
All those girls your dad

538
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:34,145
killed...

539
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:37,081
Did you fish,

540
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:39,534
or did you hunt, Abigail?

541
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,924
I was the lure.

542
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:49,878
Did Hannibal tell you?

543
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:53,781
No, he didn't.

544
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:58,119
He said you'd protect me,
that you'd keep it a secret.

545
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:09,447
There is something wrong
with you.

546
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:11,732
I think you're still sick.
Oh, God,

547
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,184
oh, God.

548
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:16,154
Jack Crawford was right
about you.

549
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:19,140
He knew.

550
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:21,059
You killed Nick Boyle,

551
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:23,745
and you helped your father kill
all of those girls.

552
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:26,498
No. I didn't help my dad
kill anybody.

553
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:29,300
No, you lured them.
You killed them.

554
00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:31,269
How many other people
have you killed?

555
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,703
Do you think I'm the copycat?
You think I killed Marissa?

556
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:38,042
If you didn't kill her, Abigail,
then somebody you know did.

557
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:40,879
Ever think that somebody
could be you?

558
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:43,198
You were there,
you saw Marissa.

559
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:45,166
You knew about this place,

560
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,887
and there is something
wrong with you.

561
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:47,900
What?

562
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:57,946
Sir. I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave.

563
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,615
We're preparing the cabin
for the next passengers.

564
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,571
I'm sorry, where...

565
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:10,972
- Where are we?
- Dulles international, Virginia.

566
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,394
Was there a young
woman traveling with me?

567
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:17,031
All the other passengers are
disembarked. It's just you, sir.

568
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:58,823
Abigail.

569
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:06,114
- What are you doing here?
- I was so worried about you.

570
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,634
Will told me he was taking you
to Minnesota,

571
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:12,070
and I strongly advised
against it.

572
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:15,390
Where is Will?

573
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:18,059
I left him at the cabin.

574
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:23,414
I didn't feel safe with him,
so I left him.

575
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:28,920
He knows everything.

576
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:31,973
So does Jack Crawford.

577
00:39:37,546 --> 00:39:40,214
If I run, they'll catch me,
won't they?

578
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:44,268
You can't protect me anymore.

579
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:46,721
They'll arrest you
when they find you, yes.

580
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:48,573
And Will.

581
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,428
Did he kill Marissa?

582
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:58,099
They will believe he did.

583
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:02,537
They will believe he killed
others too.

584
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,546
Will always said whoever
called the house that morning

585
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,531
was the serial killer.

586
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:19,354
Why did you really call?

587
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:22,073
I wanted to warn your father

588
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:25,143
that Will Graham was coming
for him.

589
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:27,729
Why?

590
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:34,002
I was curious
what would happen.

591
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:39,340
I was curious what would happen
when I killed Marissa.

592
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,345
I was curious
what you would do.

593
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:50,334
You wanted me
to kill Nick Boyle.

594
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:52,686
I was hoping.

595
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:55,322
I wanted to see how much
like your father you were.

596
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,974
Oh, my God.

597
00:40:57,009 --> 00:41:00,978
Nicholas Boyle is more
important for you gutting him.

598
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:02,947
He changed you, Abigail.

599
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:06,084
That's more important
than the life he clamored after.

600
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:11,723
How many people
have you killed?

601
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:20,498
Many more than your father.

602
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:31,008
Are you going to kill me?

603
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:35,246
I'm so sorry, Abigail.

604
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:41,219
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you
in this life.

605
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,267
