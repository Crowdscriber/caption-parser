2
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,198
Professor!

3
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:44,374
Catherine.

4
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:53,794
Watch your step. OK.
- We have found something beautiful!

5
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:59,685
I don't believe it. Big, big surprise!
- Yeah? I can hardly wait.

6
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:09,608
Over here!

7
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:16,910
Dr. Langford.
- Hello.

8
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,447
What have we here?

9
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:21,243
Cover stones.

10
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:24,580
It's fantastic.

11
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,751
Catherina, come!

12
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:22,173
What in God's name is that?
- I wish I knew.

13
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,309
...there are symbols painted everywhere.

14
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:25,324
Names, titles of owners, list of offerings.
Every other major architectural structure

15
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,158
at the time
was covered with detailed hieroglyphics.

16
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:31,409
When is the academic community
going to accept the fact

17
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:36,702
the pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty
did not build the Great Pyramid?

18
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:41,664
Inside the pyramid, the most
incredible structure ever erected,

19
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:45,586
there are no writings whatsoever.
- Dr. Jackson,

20
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:48,297
you left out the fact that Colonel Vyse

21
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:51,553
discovered quarrymen's inscriptions

22
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,854
of Khufu's name within the pyramid.

23
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,640
His discovery was a fraud.

24
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,603
Well, I hope you can prove it.

25
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:02,275
Who do you think built the pyramids?

26
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,617
I don't have any idea who built them.

27
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:12,031
Men from Atlantis?
Or Martians perhaps?

28
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:16,327
The point is not who built them,
the point is when they were built.

29
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,169
I mean we all know,

30
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,835
new geological evidence
dates the Sphinx back to

31
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,041
a much earlier period. Knowing this,

32
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:29,926
I think, we have to begin to re-evaluate everything
we've come to accept about...

33
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,590
I've been able to show
a fully developed writing system

34
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:38,223
appeared in the 1st two dynasties.

35
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,600
Almost as if it was based on
an even earlier prototype.

36
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,647
Is there a lunch or something,
that everybody...?

37
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,996
Dr. Jackson!
- What? Yes?

38
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,506
Someone wants to speak with you.

39
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:12,302
The Air Force? What is this?
- Could you step over

40
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:14,258
to the car?

41
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,270
We goin' somewhere?
- You're gonna be fine.

42
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,566
We'll take care of these.

43
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,824
Those your parents?

44
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,493
Foster parents.

45
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,537
What is this all about?

46
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:45,117
A job.

47
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,296
What kind of a job?

48
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:49,086
Translation.

49
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,092
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

50
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,174
Interested?

51
00:09:58,558 --> 00:09:59,934
I'm gonna go now.

52
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:02,008
Go where?

53
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,518
You've just been evicted.

54
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:06,815
Your grants have run out.

55
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:10,401
Everything you own
are in those two bags.

56
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,697
You want to prove
that your theories are right?

57
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,901
This is your chance.

58
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,575
What's this?

59
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,327
Travel plans.

60
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,197
Mrs. O'Neil?

61
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,193
Come on in.

62
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,544
Mrs. O'Neil, is your husband home?

63
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,835
Yes.

64
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,716
Do you think we might be able
to speak with him?

65
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,676
You can try.

66
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:59,504
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neill,
we're from General West's office.

67
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:10,643
We're here to inform you
that you've been reactivated.

68
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,641
That guy's a mess.

69
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:27,409
How'd he get like that?
- His kid died. Accidentally shot himself.
- Jesus.

70
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,130
Cleared.

71
00:12:58,274 --> 00:12:59,270
Cold?

72
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,230
Allergies.

73
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,985
Always happens when I travel.

74
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,320
There you go.

75
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:14,366
Dr. Jackson, Dr. Gary Meyers.
- Hello. - How are you?

76
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:17,074
What is this place?
- Nuclear missile silo.

77
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,994
Now don't worry, it's been
completely converted. Barbara Shore.

78
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,025
OK, Jackson, welcome to the well.
- Hello.

79
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:50,107
Where did you find this?
- Giza Plateau, 1928.

80
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,867
I've never seen anything like this.
- Of course you haven't.

81
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,332
No one has.
- Now there's two lines of hieroglyphics.

82
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,370
The inner track has
the classic figures.

83
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:04,540
But the outer track is like
the cartouche in the center.

84
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:09,050
It's got writing unlike we've ever found before.
- Those aren't hieroglyphics.

85
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,009
It might be
some kind of hieratic or cuneiform.

86
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,550
Well the translation
of the inner track is wrong.

87
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,055
Must have used Budge.
I don't know why they keep reprinting his books.

88
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:26,935
Excuse me. What are you doing?
We've used every known technique.

89
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:28,980
That's a curious word to use eh, "Gebeh?"

90
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,646
Yeah.
- Then an adverbial, "sedjem-en-ef."

91
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:35,733
Then "sealed and... buried."

92
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:38,362
Excuse me, what are you doing?

93
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,869
It's not "coffin."

94
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:43,914
"For all time."

95
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:47,834
Who the hell translated this?

96
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,003
I... I did.

97
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,210
Well this should read "A million years

98
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:57,129
into the sky is Ra, Sun God,
sealed and buried for all time."

99
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,176
It's not "door to heaven,"

100
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:01,136
it is...

101
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,225
"Stargate."

102
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,528
Well, so, why is the military so interested
in 5,000 year-old Egyptian tablets?

103
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,066
My report says ten thousand.

104
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,898
Afternoon, Colonel.

105
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,245
Do I know you? - I'm Colonel Jack O'Neil,
from General West's office.

106
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,788
I'll be taking over from now on.

107
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:37,709
This figure, 10,000, is ludicrous. Egyptian culture
didn't even exist until...

108
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:42,757
We know, but the sonic and radiocarbon tests
are conclusive. - Well these are cover stones. Was there a tomb underneath?

109
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:48,599
No, no, no, no. But we found something a lot
more interesting. - Excuse me.

110
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,016
This information
has become classified.

111
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,155
From now on, no information
is to be passed on to non-military personnel

112
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,650
without my express permission.

113
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,664
What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

114
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,121
Colonel O'Neil.

115
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,504
I think you owe me an explanation.

116
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:16,170
I was told I had complete autonomy.

117
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,425
Plans change.

118
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,508
Why are you here?
Why did they bring you

119
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:24,011
on this project?

120
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:29,511
I'm here in case you succeed.

121
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,983
TWO WEEKS LATER
Completed search of cuneiform

122
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:38,903
and other pre-dynastic hieroglyphics.
No matches whatsoever.

123
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,030
I've exhausted all reference material in
comparing the symbols on the cartouche

124
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:47,027
against all known writing samples
from the period, pre and post.

125
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:50,413
Still no similarities.

126
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:52,914
I'm never gonna get paid.

127
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:29,360
Can I borrow this?

128
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,298
Orion.

129
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,091
Right here, Daniel.
- Jackson,

130
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:37,768
I'd like you to meet General West.
- Oh hello. Oh! Right, General.

131
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:43,768
So you think you've solved in 14 days

132
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,085
what they couldn't solve in 2 years?

133
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:49,086
2 years?

134
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,485
Any time.

135
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,202
I have some stuff to look at.

136
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,370
If you'll just pass 'em down.

137
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:07,043
You'll have to share them, cuz I,
I'm sorry I don't have enough.

138
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,674
Anyway...

139
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,961
We're obviously looking at the
picture of the cover stones.

140
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:19,225
Now, on the outer track, these figures that
you had believed to be words to be translated

141
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,226
were in fact...

142
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:30,278
were, in fact, star constellations.

143
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:37,065
These constellations were placed in a unique order,
forming a map or address of sorts.

144
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:41,367
Seven points to outline
a course to a position.

145
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:48,252
To find the destination within

146
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:54,918
any three-dimensional space
we need six points

147
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:59,715
to determine an exact location.

148
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,592
You said you needed seven points.

149
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,219
Well no,
six for the destination.

150
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:11,062
but to chart a course
you need...a point of origin.

151
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,143
Except

152
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,236
there's only six on the cartouche.

153
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,648
The 7th isn't actually
inside the cartouche. It's just below,

154
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,612
designated by...

155
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:24,115
a little pyramid with...

156
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,489
two...

157
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,621
funny...

158
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:34,586
neat little guys and a funny line
coming out of the top.

159
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:39,882
Anyway, uh...

160
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,510
He did it.

161
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:43,930
No.

162
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,842
That symbol isn't anywhere on the device.

163
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:48,936
Uh what device? I don't...

164
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:57,309
Show him.

165
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:42,937
What is that?

166
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,735
It's your "Stargate."

167
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:52,706
Come, Jackson.

168
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:03,000
Monitors up!
- Monitors are up.

169
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:07,929
Mitch, you wanna bring up the details
on the center monitor, please?

170
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:12,102
I've got details...on.

171
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:31,693
Hold it.

172
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:32,863
Wait.

173
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:35,992
Do you have a, uh...

174
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,498
...oh, here. Sorry.

175
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:41,666
Hey hey hey don't!
- Two figures...

176
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,170
on either side,

177
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:48,298
praying beside a pyramid
with the sun directly above it.

178
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:52,805
He's right.
It was in front of us the whole time.

179
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,381
General West,

180
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:58,260
Jackson has identified the 7th symbol.

181
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,934
Go ahead. - Programming
7th symbol into computer.

182
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:07,606
Chevron 1 is holding.
Chevron 1 is locked in place.

183
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:12,022
Power output at 23 percent.

184
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,453
Chevron 2 is holding.

185
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,162
Engaged. - Chevron 2 is locked in place.
- We're at 35 percent.

186
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:31,465
All right we've got a condition red
in the gate. Evacuate all personnel.

187
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,887
Area secure.
Heading back. Seal the door.

188
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:42,690
This was under the cover stones?
- Yes. My father found it. 1928.

189
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:46,269
Made out of a mineral
unlike any found on Earth.

190
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,861
Chevron 5 lock in place.

191
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:50,729
79 percent.

192
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:56,031
Chevron 6 is holding.

193
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:59,156
Chevron 6 is locked in place.

194
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:02,868
This is as far as we have
ever been able to get.

195
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:16,596
The breakers aren't holding.
Override manually.

196
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,559
Chevron 7 is locked in place.

197
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,332
Send in the probe.

198
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,161
Let's go!

199
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,875
Yes, sir.

200
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,669
Record all information from the Stargate.

201
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:12,268
Clear inner silo for approach.
- Everybody outta here. - Let's go!

202
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,184
It's guiding itself.

203
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:55,600
Can you believe that?

204
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:16,667
The beam
has locked itself onto a point

205
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:19,875
somewhere in the Kaliam galaxy.

206
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:23,129
It has mass. It could be a moon
or a large asteroid.

207
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:25,007
Where are we on that map?

208
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,381
The blue dot.

209
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:36,440
That's right, Jackson.

210
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:40,817
It's on the other side
of the known universe.

211
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:45,448
We're losing the signal.

212
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:53,910
This is the information the
probe sent back to us.

213
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:56,584
Freeze and enhance.

214
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:59,828
You can clearly see
the gate on the other side.

215
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:03,631
Both gates must have functioned
as a doorway between our worlds.

216
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:08,221
These readings tell us
it's an atmospheric match.

217
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:12,176
Barometric pressure,
temperature...

218
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:14,267
...and most importantly, oxygen.

219
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:18,431
These markings are different.

220
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:22,766
They don't match the symbols on our gate.
- That's why we may have to abort.

221
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:27,104
This project is for naught
without a reconnaissance mission.

222
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,324
Once there we would have to
decipher the markings on their gate

223
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:36,073
and, in essence, dial home, in
order to bring the team back.

224
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,246
Based on this new information,
I don't see how we can do that.

225
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:41,539
Well, I could do that.

226
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:49,382
Are you sure?

227
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,684
Positive.

228
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,062
He's full of shit.

229
00:28:08,697 --> 00:28:09,942
You're on the team.

230
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:58,572
You understand,
this complicates things.

231
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:03,324
That's why I wanted you, Jack.

232
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:09,163
We've opened a door
to a world we know nothing about.

233
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,354
I have something for you.

234
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:29,811
No, I...
- Yes.

235
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:34,403
I found it with the Stargate
when I was a child.

236
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:36,691
It has brought me luck.

237
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:43,287
You can bring it back to me.

238
00:29:58,804 --> 00:30:00,713
Back-up storage.

239
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,841
Reserve power, on.

240
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:05,514
We're secure. Clear the area.
- Move it, let's go.

241
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:11,647
Surveillance and monitoring.
...equipment, reserve power...

242
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:22,446
If anybody has anything to say,
now's the time to say it.

243
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,001
Vector tracking set.

244
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:09,137
Molecular deconstruction in progress.

245
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:28,752
Jackson, it's all right.
It's over. Stay with him.

246
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,461
Jackson just listen to me.
Keep moving.

247
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,883
It wears off in a minute.

248
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,094
What a rush!

249
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,219
Prepare to move out.

250
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,260
It's all here, yeah.

251
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,615
Three teams, let's go.

252
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:03,616
White team, go!

253
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:34,774
Team 2 Move up!

254
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:47,701
Clear, no contact.

255
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:04,760
O2 ratio stable.
- Conditions are similar to inside.

256
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:08,372
I wanna take a look around.
Kawalsky, Feretti.

257
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,473
Let's rock 'n roll.

258
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:52,806
Move up there, good.

259
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:24,545
I knew it.

260
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:30,712
One - three - three - two.

261
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:33,348
Report.

262
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:37,014
Our quarter mile perimeter survey
is just about complete, sir.

263
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:44,526
Wrap this up, get
everybody back inside.

264
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,440
I want you all people back
through the Stargate within the hour.

265
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,115
You're coming with us
aren't you, Colonel?

266
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,951
Jackson,
start working on the Stargate.

267
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,080
What's that all about?
- I don't know Feretti.

268
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:01,620
I'm gonna need more time.

269
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,466
There's bound to be more structures,
or some other traces of civilization.

270
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:10,089
Not this trip. Just get back in there
and re-establish contact.

271
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:13,224
Well it's not that easy. This is a replica
of the great pyramid of Giza.

272
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:17,266
We're not gonna find any
hieroglyphic inscriptions or carved relief.

273
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:20,017
We...really...we really need to
look around more.

274
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:24,479
Your job is to re-align the Stargate.
Can you do that or not?

275
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:27,983
I can't.

276
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,276
You can't, or you won't?

277
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:37,576
I can decipher the symbols on the Stargate,
but I need an order of alignment.

278
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,956
Now those co-ordinates
were marked on tablets back on Earth.

279
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,357
And there must something like that here.

280
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:44,955
And I just...I just need
to find it.

281
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,965
Find it?  What do you
mean, "find it?"

282
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:54,090
You didn't say anything about finding anything.
- Well, I assumed the tablets would be here.

283
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:55,719
You assumed?

284
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:57,803
You're a lying son of a bitch!

285
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:01,010
You didn't say a word about finding anything!

286
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,108
Set up a camp down here.
Organize our supplies.

287
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:08,509
Sir?

288
00:38:08,528 --> 00:38:11,019
You've got your orders.

289
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:22,536
This is hot.

290
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:26,210
You know, I can't believe we're stuck here.
- Don't be such a doomsayer Faretti.

291
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,790
Yeah, give it a rest.
- Yes, please.

292
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:33,209
If we're not back soon, they'll just turn
on the gate from the other side.

293
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,705
Oh no.
It doesn't work that way.

294
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:39,841
You see, if you don't turn it on
from here, we're screwed. Ok?

295
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:44,970
So I'm tellin' you guys, we're
not goin' anywhere. - Shutup.

296
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:47,518
This is a nice tent.

297
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:51,318
Oh, we each get a tent. That's nice.

298
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:18,294
...the hell is that?

299
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,088
A thermal blanket, don't need that.

300
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:27,809
I got everything here but sun-block.

301
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:28,410
Hey!

302
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:29,711
Hi.

303
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:31,112
Hey.

304
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:34,399
Isn't there something you
should be doing right now?

305
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:38,030
Like getting us outta here!

306
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:48,156
Foot powder. Great.

307
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,246
That's cold, man.

308
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:21,270
Base camp is up, sir.

309
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,418
Where's Jackson?

310
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:38,888
It's OK. No, It's OK.

311
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,389
Shh. Shh. Shh...

312
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:42,686
That's a good boy...

313
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:53,327
What do you want?

314
00:41:53,788 --> 00:41:55,694
You want some of this?

315
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:57,895
Here ya go.  Ya like that?

316
00:41:58,896 --> 00:41:59,396
There ya go.

317
00:42:00,397 --> 00:42:01,197
There ya go.

318
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:02,855
I wouldn't feed that thing!

319
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:05,873
It's got a harness.

320
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:08,625
It's domesticated!

321
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:13,926
Dammit.

322
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:17,345
Let go of it!

323
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,194
Do something!

324
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:35,275
Come on!

325
00:42:36,496 --> 00:42:38,204
Help me!

326
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,195
You OK, Jackson?

327
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:29,497
Kawalsky.
- You dropped these. - Brown.

328
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,796
Get away from me.

329
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:47,492
Easy.

330
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,890
All right, Jackson.

331
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:16,435
You're on.

332
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:17,897
Me?

333
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:22,483
You're the linguist.
Try to talk to 'em.

334
00:45:30,584 --> 00:45:31,384
Hi.

335
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:06,240
What the hell did you say to him?
- Nothing.

336
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:22,741
Hey.

337
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:26,043
It's OK.

338
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:30,093
It's OK. See?

339
00:46:51,993 --> 00:46:54,864
Quartz, primary element.

340
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:51,962
I can't make it out...

341
00:47:52,468 --> 00:47:55,173
It sounds familiar,
a bit like Berber.

342
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:57,595
Or maybe it's Chadic or Omotic.

343
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:25,662
Thank you.

344
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:12,920
What's that mean?

345
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,040
I have no idea.

346
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:19,252
He's inviting us to go with him.

347
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,878
How can you be so sure?

348
00:49:22,806 --> 00:49:25,972
Because he's
inviting us to go with him.

349
00:49:28,561 --> 00:49:32,476
We were looking for signs of
civilization.  Obviously we've found it.

350
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:36,144
You want me to get us back home, this is
our best shot. - Colonel he's right.

351
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:39,944
I took some readings
on what they're mining.

352
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:43,027
This is the same
material as the Stargate.

353
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:48,953
Radio base camp.

354
00:49:50,082 --> 00:49:54,578
Tell them to keep that area secure,
until we get back. - Yes, sir.

355
00:49:56,964 --> 00:49:59,289
Base camp, come in.
- Feretti, I've got 'em.

356
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:01,003
Come on.

357
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:03,404
Yes Sir?

358
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:07,092
What...can you repeat that, sir?

359
00:50:07,557 --> 00:50:11,475
...Col. O'Neil has requested that you secure base camp.
Looks like we're gonna be here for awhile.

360
00:50:11,645 --> 00:50:14,349
OK, sir.
- Understand? - Yes, sir.

361
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:21,647
So what's the story?
- They're not coming back. OK, this is not good.

362
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:42,657
The eye of Ra.

363
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:47,959
It's the Egyptian Sun God.

364
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:51,581
They think he sent us here.

365
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:56,172
I wonder what could have
give them that idea...

366
00:52:57,914 --> 00:52:58,660
Ra.

367
00:53:00,661 --> 00:53:01,661
Ra?

368
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:10,815
Where they all going?

369
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:14,977
Come in. Come in.

370
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:18,117
Feretti I can't hear you.
Sir, I can't make this out.

371
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:21,407
Feretti, say again.

372
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:28,167
We have to abandon base camp!
Repeat, we have to abandon base camp!

373
00:53:28,627 --> 00:53:30,833
It's useless. It won't work in this.

374
00:53:31,296 --> 00:53:32,838
Freeman, let's go! Let's move!

375
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:34,329
Everybody back inside!

376
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,011
C'mon just take what you can carry!
- Battery! Get the battery packs!

377
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,847
We're going back right now.

378
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:54,814
Wait!

379
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:22,015
Get over here.

380
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:48,117
Stay here.

381
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:08,720
What is it, Colonel?
- Sandstorm. Coming this way.

382
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,717
That would have been an excellent
reason to shoot everyone.

383
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:16,346
We'll stay until it's over.

384
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:29,275
Sorry.

385
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:44,293
We've gotta get back to the pyramid!

386
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:49,503
Where the hell'd that come from?

387
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,057
Kawalsky, Brown, do you read?

388
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:17,158
Hey Jackson.

389
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,972
I don't think we should eat any food here.

390
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,248
I don't know.
They might consider that an insult.

391
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:36,348
Well, we don't want
to offend them now, do we, Daniel?

392
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:52,655
Tastes like chicken.

393
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:54,056
Tastes like chicken.

394
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:55,155
It's good.

395
00:56:58,163 --> 00:56:59,539
It tastes...

396
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:05,498
Tastes like chicken.

397
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:07,710
Good!

398
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:12,511
Jackson.

399
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,004
You said that was an Egyptian symbol.
- Yeah. The eye of Ra.

400
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:19,632
Would you say then it might stand to reason that...

401
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:22,557
if they know one Egyptian symbol...

402
00:57:23,313 --> 00:57:24,688
Yes.

403
00:57:50,589 --> 00:57:51,834
What the hell's going on?

404
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:57,675
It seems like
writing is forbidden to them.

405
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,718
What?

406
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:18,070
They want me to go with them.
Should I stay? I'll go with them.

407
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:21,156
I'll be fine.

408
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,914
OK, that's good.

409
00:58:31,504 --> 00:58:34,588
What is that smell?

410
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,424
I think that's good.
My hands are clean. Thank you very, very much.

411
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,725
Thank you, very, that was very nice.

412
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,183
Thank you. That was great.
I smell much better now than...

413
00:58:49,584 --> 00:58:50,384
Yes, thank you.

414
00:58:52,357 --> 00:58:56,437
O Christ, I smell like a yak.

415
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:00,902
No, no please, no more, please.

416
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:03,503
Please no more.

417
00:59:03,785 --> 00:59:06,368
I'm fine.
I'm clean...I'm...

418
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:08,069
I'm...
Oh.

419
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,417
I thought
you were one of the other cleaning...

420
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:31,595
No, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

421
00:59:32,104 --> 00:59:37,145
Maybe you should go. OK?
It's OK. Maybe you should go.

422
00:59:38,026 --> 00:59:42,024
No, no. It's OK. It's OK.
It's all right. Here, let me grab this

423
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:56,953
No, no, no no, it's me.

424
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,955
I wanted to uh, th-thank you.
I'm very, I'm very happy.

425
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:04,356
Thank you.

426
01:00:14,353 --> 01:00:15,267
Daniel.

427
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:26,233
I'm Daniel.

428
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:39,995
We came... uh

429
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:45,629
This pyramid.
See, we came from...

430
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:49,295
We came from the pyramid.

431
01:00:51,264 --> 01:00:53,007
It's OK.

432
01:00:53,474 --> 01:00:55,633
Never mind.

433
01:00:57,562 --> 01:00:58,937
It's OK.

434
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:30,255
The Earth.

435
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:34,380
You know the symbol?

436
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:36,509
You know the symbol?

437
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,884
You've seen the symbol?

438
01:01:43,481 --> 01:01:44,430
Show me.

439
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:46,726
You show me.

440
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,736
Kawalsky, this is base.
Do you copy?

441
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:56,149
You're wasting the battery.

442
01:01:56,827 --> 01:02:01,039
We'll never get anything in this storm.
You'll have to wait till it passes. - Yeah, right.

443
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:04,412
IF it passes.

444
01:02:05,294 --> 01:02:08,129
You know I was stationed in the Middle East.
I've never seen anything like it.

445
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:10,665
Yeah, yeah...
- I don't understand.

446
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:12,841
Why don't we just
turn the gate back on ourselves.

447
01:02:13,603 --> 01:02:16,628
yeah, how hard can it be?
- That would be great!

448
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:21,675
We could turn the thing in the wrong order and
materialize the vacuum of outer space.

449
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:27,185
Do you have any idea how many
possible combinations there are?

450
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:28,265
No. How many?

451
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:32,190
Shut up.

452
01:03:35,715 --> 01:03:37,542
What the hell is goin' on?

453
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,853
All right, spread out.

454
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:24,854
Let's move out!

455
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:32,423
It's OK. It's just a lighter.

456
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:38,891
See?

457
01:06:42,896 --> 01:06:43,892
Here!

458
01:06:56,242 --> 01:06:58,034
Yeah, it's pretty fabulous.

459
01:07:51,085 --> 01:07:54,668
You're right. It's pretty stupid.

460
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:02,968
No, you keep it.

461
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:07,510
It's yours.

462
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,145
No!

463
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,444
It's dangerous!

464
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:51,222
What is this place?

465
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,118
I'll be damned.

466
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:23,377
What?

467
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:58,175
No signal at all?
- Nothing.

468
01:11:01,519 --> 01:11:03,726
More interference?

469
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:05,184
No.

470
01:11:06,024 --> 01:11:08,016
They're simply not there.

471
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:35,000
...no sign of him?
- I haven't been able to locate Jackson, sir.

472
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,193
I'm lookin' for Jackson.

473
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,864
Jackson. The guy that wears this jacket.

474
01:11:59,534 --> 01:12:03,818
He's uh, he's got like long hair that
comes down...no, no.

475
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,519
No, no, no, no it's...

476
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,951
He wears glasses, so he can see.

477
01:12:16,842 --> 01:12:20,792
I guess the word "dweeb" doesn't mean anything
to you guys, does it? Why not?

478
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:22,805
I'm on Planet X lookin' for a dweeb,

479
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:27,632
He wears green fatigues. He wears this jacket.
He's got long hair. It comes over his eyes.

480
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:29,681
He wears glasses,

481
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:31,345
and...sneezes.

482
01:12:38,905 --> 01:12:41,112
Chicken, chicken!

483
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:44,907
Chicken man. You got it.

484
01:12:53,211 --> 01:12:55,038
You want this?

485
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,576
I thought
you couldn't speak their language.

486
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,495
Huh? Hi... scared me.

487
01:13:33,967 --> 01:13:39,162
It's an ancient Egyptian dialect. I mean in like the rest of
their culture it's evolved completely independently.

488
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:41,089
But uh, once you know the vowels...

489
01:13:41,549 --> 01:13:43,672
Just answer the question.

490
01:13:44,969 --> 01:13:47,045
I just had to learn how to pronounce it.

491
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:50,384
It hasn't been a living spoken
language for more than one thousand years.

492
01:13:52,393 --> 01:13:56,307
I mean look at this. It says,
"A traveler from distant stars

493
01:13:56,772 --> 01:14:01,399
escaped from a dying world looking
for a way to extend his own life.

494
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:04,731
His body decaying and weak,
he couldn't prevent his own demise."

495
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:08,032
Apparently his whole species
was becoming extinct.

496
01:14:08,492 --> 01:14:10,781
So he traveled or

497
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:15,538
searched the galaxies,
looking for a way to cheat death.

498
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:21,876
Look here: He came to a world
rich with life where he

499
01:14:22,339 --> 01:14:25,340
encountered a primitive race.
Humans.

500
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,221
A species which, with all his powers and knowledge,
he could maintain indefinitely.

501
01:14:31,681 --> 01:14:35,304
He realized, within a human body,
he had a chance for a new life.

502
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:39,395
Now, he apparently, found a young boy.
It says

503
01:14:40,023 --> 01:14:44,352
As the frightened villagers ran,
night became day,

504
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:47,903
curious and without fear,
he walked towards the light.

505
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:56,694
Ra took him and possessed his body,
like some kind of a parasite,

506
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:59,406
looking for a host.

507
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,535
And inhabiting this human form

508
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:04,873
he appointed himself ruler.

509
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:09,194
He used the Stargate to bring
thousands of people here to this planet

510
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:11,418
as workers for the mines.

511
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,464
Just like the one we saw.

512
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:17,430
This mineral is clearly the building block
of all his technology. With this

513
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:19,268
he can sustain eternal life.

514
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:23,388
Now uh, something happened, where is it,
back on Earth...

515
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:26,775
A rebellion, or uprising,
and the Stargate was buried there.

516
01:15:28,152 --> 01:15:32,399
Fearful of a rebellion here,
Ra outlawed reading and writing.

517
01:15:32,865 --> 01:15:34,775
He didn't want the people
to remember the truth.

518
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:38,028
Jackson, I think you better take a look at this.

519
01:15:46,462 --> 01:15:49,167
That's it.
That's what we're looking for.

520
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:54,128
They must have hidden it here, in hopes that one
day the gate on Earth could be reopened.

521
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:57,299
I knew they'd have it
written down someplace.

522
01:15:58,432 --> 01:15:59,428
Wait a minute.

523
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:01,761
Where's the 7th symbol?

524
01:16:02,227 --> 01:16:03,390
It must have broken.

525
01:16:04,104 --> 01:16:07,271
It's gotta be here somewhere...

526
01:16:07,732 --> 01:16:10,021
Got it. I got it here.

527
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:15,363
It's worn off.

528
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:18,985
I can't make it work without the 7th symbol.

529
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:24,949
All right, that's it. Kawalsky, Brown.

530
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:40,337
Come on, Jackson.

531
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,472
What the hell is that?

532
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,691
Here. You might need this.

533
01:18:56,604 --> 01:18:58,015
Look out!

534
01:19:00,775 --> 01:19:02,269
Where are we going?

535
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,567
Why are we going to the Stargate?
I can't make it work.

536
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:13,909
Stay right here and shoot at anything
that comes down that ramp.
- What are you doing? - Just cover me.

537
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:22,583
What is that?

538
01:19:25,549 --> 01:19:27,874
What are you looking for?
- It's gone.

539
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:03,333
Put it down, Jackson.

540
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:11,541
You have come here to destroy me.

541
01:22:14,254 --> 01:22:15,962
What is that?

542
01:22:21,678 --> 01:22:24,963
It's a bomb isn't it?
That's what you were looking for.

543
01:22:25,431 --> 01:22:27,258
What the hell were you thinking?

544
01:22:27,725 --> 01:22:29,469
What'd you come here for?

545
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:21,436
Wait! Don't!

546
01:23:22,153 --> 01:23:23,018
No!

547
01:23:23,738 --> 01:23:25,066
No! No!

548
01:24:24,213 --> 01:24:26,004
Colonel, it's me.

549
01:24:27,049 --> 01:24:28,841
You all right?

550
01:24:39,561 --> 01:24:41,470
Where's Jackson?

551
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,800
Sha'uri, what happened here?

552
01:26:46,392 --> 01:26:48,266
Ra punished us.

553
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,514
Why?

554
01:26:51,147 --> 01:26:52,890
What happened to Daniel?

555
01:26:55,068 --> 01:26:57,440
What happened to Daniel?

556
01:27:18,674 --> 01:27:22,292
Son, we should not
have helped the strangers.

557
01:30:10,757 --> 01:30:12,168
I was dead?

558
01:30:16,387 --> 01:30:19,305
That is why I chose your race...

559
01:30:19,807 --> 01:30:23,093
your bodies, so easy to repair.

560
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:30,309
You have advanced much...

561
01:30:30,776 --> 01:30:34,359
harnessed the power of the atom.

562
01:30:34,822 --> 01:30:36,861
What are you going to do?

563
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:44,951
You should not have reopened the gate.

564
01:30:49,503 --> 01:30:53,880
Son, I will
send your weapon back to your world,

565
01:30:54,633 --> 01:30:59,211
with a shipment of our mineral,

566
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:04,971
which will increase your weapon's
destructive power a hundredfold.

567
01:31:05,435 --> 01:31:07,760
Why would you do that?

568
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:10,686
I created your civilization,

569
01:31:11,274 --> 01:31:14,725
now I will destroy it.

570
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:37,084
But before
my workers question my authority,

571
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:41,175
you will prove
that I am their one God,

572
01:31:41,637 --> 01:31:45,586
by killing your companions.

573
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:48,342
If I refuse?

574
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:51,432
Then I will destroy you,

575
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:55,063
and all who have seen you.

576
01:31:56,401 --> 01:32:00,862
There can be only one Ra!

577
01:32:20,257 --> 01:32:23,377
Sha'uri, Ra has called an assembly.

578
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:26,212
An execution.

579
01:32:26,764 --> 01:32:29,681
Skaara, Nabeh, I want you to listen.

580
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:38,347
We can't let this happen.

581
01:32:38,817 --> 01:32:41,059
I want you to know
what Daniel told me,

582
01:32:41,528 --> 01:32:45,111
about where our people came from,

583
01:32:46,408 --> 01:32:50,322
and why
we can no longer live as slaves.

584
01:34:33,523 --> 01:34:34,023
C'mon!

585
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:50,606
Freeman!

586
01:34:52,907 --> 01:34:54,607
Freeman! Freeman!

587
01:34:58,369 --> 01:34:59,993
Jackson!

588
01:35:00,454 --> 01:35:02,779
Follow me! Come on! Kawalsky!

589
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,480
C'mon!

590
01:35:56,216 --> 01:35:57,212
Jackson!

591
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:56,141
To our victory!

592
01:37:00,278 --> 01:37:03,066
We recovered your weapons.

593
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:06,273
Here, Colonel.

594
01:37:10,372 --> 01:37:12,578
So, what do you think?

595
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,164
They're not exactly special forces, but

596
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:17,710
they sure were eager to join up.

597
01:37:18,171 --> 01:37:21,587
Take these guns away, Lieutenant,
before they hurt themselves.

598
01:37:23,688 --> 01:37:24,088
Sir?

599
01:37:24,093 --> 01:37:28,589
You heard me. Send 'em all home.
- There's no place for these kids to go.

600
01:37:29,599 --> 01:37:31,924
Anyway we could sure use their help right now.
- For what?

601
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:34,025
Huh?

602
01:37:34,937 --> 01:37:36,396
To do what?

603
01:37:46,657 --> 01:37:48,733
Why don't you just tell 'em everything?

604
01:37:51,753 --> 01:37:52,779
Why don't you tell 'em about the bomb?

605
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,238
What's he talking about?

606
01:38:01,838 --> 01:38:04,376
My orders were simple.

607
01:38:06,593 --> 01:38:11,551
Track down signs of any possible danger.
If I found any, blow up the Stargate.

608
01:38:13,433 --> 01:38:15,093
Well, I found some.

609
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,723
Well, your bomb is his now, and
tomorrow he's going to send it back to Earth,

610
01:38:20,147 --> 01:38:22,354
along with a shipment
of that mineral they mine here.

611
01:38:22,942 --> 01:38:28,814
And when that thing goes off, it's gonna cause an explosion 100 times more destructive
than that bomb alone is capable of.

612
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,607
I'll intercept that bomb
before he can send it through.

613
01:38:34,078 --> 01:38:35,621
Why wasn't I told of this?

614
01:38:35,922 --> 01:38:39,022
Because there wasn't any reason to tell you Kawalsky.
You weren't even supposed to be here

615
01:38:39,082 --> 01:38:41,205
You were all gonna go
right back through with Daniel.

616
01:38:42,419 --> 01:38:46,333
I was gonna stay behind alone
and blow up the Stargate and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

617
01:38:46,798 --> 01:38:50,333
It's the gate on Earth that poses a threat
that's the one we have to shut down.

618
01:38:50,802 --> 01:38:55,134
You're absolutely right. But since
you don't know how to get us back,

619
01:38:56,725 --> 01:38:59,050
we don't have that option, do we?

620
01:39:18,204 --> 01:39:20,113
Where are they?

621
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:25,161
Answer!

622
01:39:26,295 --> 01:39:29,415
We looked everywhere.

623
01:39:30,299 --> 01:39:32,920
Some kids are helping them.

624
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,236
You had accepted the fact that no matter what
happened, you would not be going home?

625
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,707
Don't you have people who care about you?

626
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:11,626
Do you have a family?

627
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:13,882
I had a family.

628
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:20,464
No one should ever have to
outlive their own child.

629
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:22,932
I don't wanna die.

630
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:28,888
Your men don't wanna die. And these
people here don't wanna die.

631
01:40:30,265 --> 01:40:32,390
It's a shame you're in such a hurry to.

632
01:41:18,946 --> 01:41:20,938
How could you let them escape?

633
01:41:32,751 --> 01:41:36,001
I will not accept failure!

634
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:18,408
Why are you laughing?
- Husbands don't do this work.

635
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:22,585
Husbands?

636
01:42:50,993 --> 01:42:52,368
Married?

637
01:42:54,413 --> 01:42:58,956
Don't be angry. I didn't tell them.

638
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:01,741
Tell them what?

639
01:43:08,218 --> 01:43:11,302
That you did not want me.

640
01:43:52,553 --> 01:43:54,379
What are you drawing?

641
01:43:57,641 --> 01:43:59,680
The day of our victory.

642
01:44:20,246 --> 01:44:22,488
Connect the moons...

643
01:44:26,351 --> 01:44:28,078
This is the symbol for this planet.

644
01:44:28,462 --> 01:44:29,458
That's it.

645
01:44:31,966 --> 01:44:33,674
The point of origin.

646
01:44:36,929 --> 01:44:38,672
What are you doing?

647
01:44:39,223 --> 01:44:40,088
I've found it!

648
01:44:41,016 --> 01:44:41,846
What are you talking about?

649
01:44:42,726 --> 01:44:44,351
The 7th symbol.

650
01:44:46,688 --> 01:44:49,523
We're goin' home.

651
01:45:13,715 --> 01:45:15,672
Let's go.

652
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:20,336
You'll bring disaster
to all of us, son.

653
01:45:20,805 --> 01:45:23,889
Father, we will not live as slaves.

654
01:45:29,855 --> 01:45:30,602
Kasuf!

655
01:45:33,859 --> 01:45:36,017
Take a look at your Gods.

656
01:45:43,952 --> 01:45:45,031
Take a good look.

657
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:11,183
The caravan is approaching.

658
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:17,227
Send the bomb down to the Stargate.

659
01:47:19,086 --> 01:47:20,877
What's happening up there?

660
01:47:45,612 --> 01:47:47,770
How you doin'?

661
01:48:00,835 --> 01:48:02,993
Damn! Come on, Feretti!

662
01:48:14,389 --> 01:48:15,469
Come on!

663
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:18,973
Get that door!

664
01:48:44,752 --> 01:48:46,946
Hey, you OK? You all right?

665
01:48:54,512 --> 01:48:55,176
Spread out!

666
01:49:03,479 --> 01:49:04,558
Let's go!

667
01:49:09,985 --> 01:49:13,685
We're dead! - Quit talking like that man!
- Well what're we gonna do? - Cover me.

668
01:49:14,156 --> 01:49:14,772
Cover you?

669
01:49:16,867 --> 01:49:17,981
Kawalsky!

670
01:49:29,045 --> 01:49:31,085
C'mon Feretti, help me push this thing over.

671
01:49:43,017 --> 01:49:44,891
Send the bomb to Earth now.

672
01:49:45,603 --> 01:49:48,141
I will send it myself.

673
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:09,123
What are you doing?
- Completing this mission.

674
01:50:10,377 --> 01:50:14,291
We agreed to dismantle the gate
on the other side. - And you will.

675
01:50:14,756 --> 01:50:19,584
That's your job now. I'm gonna stay here
and make sure this goes off.

676
01:50:28,644 --> 01:50:30,304
You've got seven minutes.

677
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,647
Daniel.

678
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:24,646
What are you doing?

679
01:51:26,742 --> 01:51:29,364
Jackson!
- Wait for me.

680
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,798
Nabeh!

681
01:53:36,952 --> 01:53:41,697
You got any rounds at all, Feretti?
- We're all out of ammo. - Incoming. - Get down!

682
01:54:10,776 --> 01:54:13,481
Kawalsky, we gotta do something.

683
01:54:14,488 --> 01:54:15,899
Damn.

684
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:21,945
Stop!

685
01:55:14,296 --> 01:55:16,335
I am no longer amused.

686
01:55:36,901 --> 01:55:39,024
You will die together.

687
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,995
Give my regards
to King Tut, asshole.

688
01:59:16,447 --> 01:59:18,938
How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.

689
01:59:19,408 --> 01:59:24,200
He's leaving. Turn it off.
- I'm trying to I can't disarm it. - What?

690
01:59:24,663 --> 01:59:26,573
I can't stop it they got it rigged.

691
01:59:42,222 --> 01:59:44,013
I got an idea.

692
02:02:08,155 --> 02:02:13,659
I always knew you'd get us back.
- Yeah, right. - Later.

693
02:02:14,286 --> 02:02:15,946
Thanks, Daniel.

694
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,794
You sure you wanna do this?

695
02:02:26,339 --> 02:02:27,620
Yes, I'm sure.

696
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:30,378
You gonna be all right?

697
02:02:34,305 --> 02:02:35,930
I'm gonna be all right.

698
02:02:36,724 --> 02:02:38,053
How about you?

699
02:02:42,271 --> 02:02:43,386
Yeah.

700
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:48,273
Yeah, I think so.

701
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:58,071
Tell Catherine
this brought me luck.

702
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:03,953
I will.

703
02:03:09,298 --> 02:03:11,207
I'll be seein' you around,

704
02:03:13,218 --> 02:03:14,463
Dr. Jackson

705
