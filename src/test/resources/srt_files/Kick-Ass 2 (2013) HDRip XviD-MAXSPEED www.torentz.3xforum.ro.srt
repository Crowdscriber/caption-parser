00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:53,430
A handgun bullet travels at
more than 700 miles per hour.

3
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:58,516
Hey, woah,
absolutely not. No.

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:03,345
Look, if you don't wanna do
it, you don't have to do it.

5
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:06,691
- Okay, good, I don't want to do it.
- Fine.

6
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,109
Goddamn!

7
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,862
I'm alive!

8
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:16,280
That's amazing!

9
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,410
I know, right?
So...

10
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,080
- You ready to go again?
- Absolutely not.

11
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,041
Fine.

12
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:32,169
Don't just say "fine", and then shoot
me in the chest. 'Cause it's not cool.

13
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,837
Like, at all.

14
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,339
Okay! Jeez.

15
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:44,429
.: KICK - A S S 2:.

16
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,431
I always wondered why no one
tried to be a superhero before me.

17
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:51,934
It turns out somebody had.
Mindy Macready.

18
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:57,564
After her dad died, his old partner on
the force, Marcus, became her guardian.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,484
- Nice backpack.
- Thanks.

20
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:02,735
Steal it from a
six-year old?

21
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:05,196
Marcus dropped her
off everyday.

22
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:08,908
And as soon as he was gone,
so was she.

23
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:12,534
No one in school found out 'cause
she hacked into the server

24
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:15,788
and gave herself the
award for perfect attendance.

25
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:19,790
Hit-Girl and Big Daddy
had been the real deal.

26
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:25,046
Mindy was gonna keep wearing the mask, as
long as there are criminals to take down.

27
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:30,674
But no matter how many drug
dealers she's stopped...

28
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:33,302
She couldn't stop
feeling alone.

29
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:38,473
Me? I've given up being a superhero
'cause it was way too dangerous.

30
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:41,350
The only problem?
I was dying of boredom.

31
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:44,937
Like most high school seniors, I had
no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

32
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:47,522
Hell, I didn't know what
channel I wanted to watch.

33
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,689
It's just TV, Dave, not peace
in the middle east.

34
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,691
My best friends Todd
and Marty have no clue

35
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,860
I was the first superhero
to go public.

36
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:56,946
Did you guys watch
Spider-Man last night?

37
00:02:56,948 --> 00:03:00,783
- Is it weird that Aunt May gets me kinda hard?
- Not if you're a granny slammer.

38
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:04,952
They may wear costumes but it isn't Halloween.
They're real life superheroes.

39
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:09,040
In the two years since the first ordinary
citizens donned capes and masks,

40
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,291
the movement has
started to spread.

41
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,543
I became a superhero
because of Kick-Ass.

42
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:17,379
Yeah, you just come home from work, you
grab your gear and you go out on patrol.

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,673
Help us make the streets safe.

44
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,758
I inspired all those people
to get off their asses.

45
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,844
And now I was stuck on mine.

46
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:29,640
So that night after dinner, I
decided to get my own costume out.

47
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,226
- I'm sorry.
- Woah! Can't you knock?

48
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:39,189
- Y'know, buddy, it's perfectly normal for you to touch yourself.
- Jesus, Dad, get out!

49
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:45,527
If I was even thinking about a
Kick-Ass sequel, I had to get serious.

50
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:47,236
Hey!

51
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,363
Hey, can we chat?

52
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:50,907
Please, Mindy.

53
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:54,785
Get in the cab. The
meter's running.

54
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,788
I wanna team up,
like Batman and Robin.

55
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:03,292
- Nobody wants to be Robin.
- What's wrong with Robin?

56
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:07,128
- Weren't you like Big Daddy's Robin?
- Robin wishes he was me.

57
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,841
What I'm trying to say is, we should be
partners. You and me, like the Dynamic Duo.

58
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:17,261
- I'm in the NFL, Dave. You play B-League.
- So, train me.

59
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:22,266
I wanna walk the walk, and you're the
closest thing I know to a real superhero.

60
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,811
Aren't you tired of
being on your own?

61
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:29,438
Don't you wanna know
someone's there for you?

62
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,858
Someone who's got your back.

63
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:42,282
- And you'll do anything I say.
- Anything.

64
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,159
Hit me.

65
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,578
You're a fifteen-
year-old girl...

66
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,037
What the hell?

67
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,332
Act like a bitch,
get slapped like a bitch.

68
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:58,755
Oh, God.

69
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:04,883
Mindy beat me like morning wood,
every day for three weeks.

70
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:06,760
Come on, guard up!
Left, right.

71
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,638
Guard up!

72
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:16,435
Even with my damaged nerve
endings, it hurt like hell.

73
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:21,355
In a weird way, I kinda liked it.
It gave me a sense of purpose.

74
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,398
- What's happened to your face?
- Nothing.

75
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,861
Like we were driving
towards something.

76
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,363
That's amazing!

77
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:34,366
All the other people putting on
masks were just playing superhero.

78
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,160
We were training
to really do it.

79
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:40,537
I couldn't tell my girlfriend
Katie, or Marty and Todd.

80
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:43,624
But I didn't care. We're
having too much fun.

81
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,502
Left, right, left.

82
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:54,466
Our own superhero team.

83
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,427
This is gonna be balls.

84
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,681
What the hell, mom? Did
you delete the news off the DVR?

85
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:08,769
- Yes, yes, I did, Christopher.
- That was the one with Kick-Ass!

86
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,146
Christopher, you've got to stop
obsessing over this superhero!

87
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:15,857
He's not a superhero,
Mom. He's a murderer.

88
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,276
He blew up Dad with a bazooka,
for fuck's sake!

89
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,361
Your father died in a fire.

90
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:23,198
A fire?
What is your problem?

91
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,449
You! You are
my problem.

92
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,828
I am trying to raise you
to be a, a normal boy.

93
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,747
That's why we moved to Long Island
after your father's accident.

94
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:37,417
A bazooka is not an accident,
you delusional bitch.

95
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:42,588
- This conversation, is over.
- Great! Then I'm leaving.

96
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,674
Come on, Javier, be cool.

97
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:49,262
Sorry, Chris, but your mom
pays me not to be cool.

98
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:56,933
I hate you! You home-school
me like I'm a prisoner!

99
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,977
You threw away my
Red Mist costume, God!

100
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:06,066
I am not the problem, you are!
I-wish-you-were-dead!

101
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:12,697
Mommy?

102
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,870
- Don't touch that.
- I'm sorry, what is it?

103
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:26,457
It's a last resort. Like, if all else
fails and you're about to die.

104
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:33,254
Are you not
scared? To die?

105
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:35,798
Are you scared you're never gonna
grow into your big boy pants?

106
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:39,758
I'm serious. What if Spider-Man or Batman
got killed one night? It could happen.

107
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,139
If you're scared of dying, one thing
is certain. You are going to die.

108
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:47,809
My Daddy was never
afraid of dying.

109
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,768
Look where that got him.

110
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:54,814
He knew he might have to make
the ultimate sacrifice one day.

111
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:00,193
And that's why he made me promise
I'd never stop defending this city.

112
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:04,156
Cross my heart.

113
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:06,407
Hope to die.

114
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:12,911
Your dad was insane.
You know that, right?

115
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:18,082
You're wrong, Dave. My Daddy
was the first real superhero.

116
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,628
Not you or Red Mist.
It was my Daddy.

117
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,382
And it was an honor to
serve by his side.

118
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,392
- Hey, Mind, how was school?
- Super crazy.

119
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:45,270
Miss Mullins was out today so we had
Mr. Cooper teach us Biology. Such a grump.....

120
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,023
Oh, really, that's weird, because
Principal Emhoff called me yesterday.

121
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:52,569
Yeah, you were supposed to get an award for
perfect attendance but, you didn't attend.

122
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,112
I followed you this morning.
I saw you get into a cab

123
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,906
with some boy and I lost
you guys over the bridge.

124
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:01,619
So now you wanna tell
where you really were today?

125
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,708
I'm really sorry,
Marcus, I don't wanna make...

126
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,420
Cut the waterworks, Mind.
You're fifteen, not five.

127
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,631
Okay.

128
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:22,885
Look, he asked me to cut class and
go to the mall. So, yeah. Yeah, I did.

129
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:25,178
This has nothing to do
with you being Hit-Girl?

130
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:29,848
I'm not gonna find any, ninja blades,
or throwing stars under your bed?

131
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:33,894
No. I just wanted
him to like me, okay?

132
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:36,687
Sweetie, you know skipping school is
not a way to get boys to like you.

133
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:38,398
- I'm so stupid.
- Hey, hey...

134
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,025
You're one of the smartest
little girls I know.

135
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:43,402
Let's go get some pizza.

136
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:47,823
- Why, you mean I'm not grounded?
- Well, just, consider this a warning.

137
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,700
Hey, you sure you wanna give
all your mom's things away?

138
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,328
What the hell am I supposed
to do with all her stuff?

139
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:58,163
Damn, she had a
nice pair of guns.

140
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,332
Dude, she's dead! Don't
talk about her tits!

141
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:06,338
- I was talking about these.
- Oh, those. Those were my Dad's.

142
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:09,924
Why don't you keep them?

143
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,759
- You sure?
- Yeah. I mean they belong to you, right?

144
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,262
Come on, Chris. You're
your own man now.

145
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:19,557
- Just, just be careful, alright?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:27,730
- Definitely, definitely, don't wanna keep those!
- No, no, I'll take care of it!

147
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,322
Take the day off.
Later!

148
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,200
- Hey.
- So...

149
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,161
You ready for your
first field test?

150
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:50,540
- What am I supposed to do with these?
- Put them on, and, uh, go fishing.

151
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:03,884
- I'm the whitest pimp ever.
- That's the idea!

152
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:08,054
- Take your next right, comes out on Flatbush.
- Are you sure I should be doing this without my gear?

153
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:12,098
<i>That's the point. Kick-Ass isn't a costume.
Kick-Ass is who you really are.</i>

154
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,934
<i>Dave Lizewski is the mask.</i>

155
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:17,605
Well, my mask is about
to get its' teeth kicked in.

156
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:22,024
Hey, queer bait. Where you
going with those bags, man?

157
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:25,359
<i>Tell him you're on your way to fuck
his mother with a Tobin strap-on.</i>

158
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,361
I'm just taking a walk.

159
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:30,239
Really isn't what I do,
I usually just call the cops.

160
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,032
Who are you talking to, man?

161
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:37,494
I'm just trying a call. There's,
no, uh, service around here?

162
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,746
This sucks, man.
Give me the bags, faggot.

163
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,374
Before I make you suck
my fat cock, huh?

164
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,376
Come on.

165
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,902
Can you believe I let Mindy beat
the snot out of me for weeks

166
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,030
just so I can get my ass kicked again?
So much for a team.

167
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,160
You ready to die, faggot?

168
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:32,624
You know, all the homophobic shit
makes you sound super gay.

169
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,027
If I ever catch you
robbing again, shitburger,

170
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,987
I'mma go Saudi Arabia on your ass
and cut your hand off.

171
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:14,742
- Promise me you're done with the life of crime?
- I promise.

172
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,286
Pants on fire.

173
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,957
- What did you think?
- I think you almost got me killed!

174
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,168
No, what did you think of my line? "Pants on fire".
I wrote a whole bunch full...

175
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:31,837
Run! I'll tell them you
saved me. Go!

176
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:37,678
<i>Female suspect fleeing Flatbush. Under five
feet, masked, armed with nunchucks and a sword.</i>

177
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,605
- Hey, Mind.
- Hey, Marcus, what's up?

178
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,940
<i>I see you answered your phone.
That means you're not in school.</i>

179
00:13:55,941 --> 00:14:01,735
I was, but I wasn't feeling so good.
And so, the nurse decided to send me home.

180
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:05,574
Poor thing. Well, I'm almost home. I'll make
you some soup and we can watch Jeopardy.

181
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:09,619
- Alright, I'll see you soon, okay?
- All right.

182
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,223
Shit!

183
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,540
You got my soup?

184
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,084
Let me take your
temperature first.

185
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:13,712
- You're really clammy.
- I'll feel better after a nap-nap.

186
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,133
Close your eyes. Then I'll
make you that soup.

187
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:23,639
Is that blood?

188
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,222
Damn it, Mindy.
I can't do this anymore.

189
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:30,768
Your father was like a brother to me.
He was a great cop and a hero.

190
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:36,397
But Big Daddy, that was not your father, okay?
That was someone who robbed you of your childhood.

191
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:38,273
And this...

192
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:42,570
Hit-Girl. That's not
who you are.

193
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:47,156
You are Mindy Macready.

194
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:49,908
You're just starting
high school.

195
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,162
I understand that you don't know who that person
is, yet, but you will. You just gotta try.

196
00:15:55,163 --> 00:16:00,124
- I don't want to...
- You don't know what you want. You can't. You're not an adult, not yet.

197
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,796
Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years
than most adults have in their lifetime.

198
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,965
That note that your father gave you, the one you were
supposed to open if anything ever happened to him.

199
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,968
- What did it say?
- That you would take care of me.

200
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,429
And that you were supposed
to listen to me, right?

201
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,475
Well, listen up. I want you in school, I
want you to stop talking to that boy

202
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:23,812
and I want you to promise me that
this is never gonna happen again.

203
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:39,156
Cross my heart.

204
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,034
Hope to die.

205
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:44,537
Good.

206
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,925
Mindy. What
the hell?

207
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:04,718
- First, you almost get me killed, then you stand me up.
- Dave, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:08,515
- You are?
- I am.

209
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:11,600
For everything.

210
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,642
Okay, great.

211
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:17,563
I mean, apologetic isn't a
word I'd use to describe you.

212
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:22,316
- How many times do I have to tell you?
- Look, let's get out of here.

213
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:26,404
- You gotta ease up, I think I might've broken a rib.
- Dave, I'm done....

214
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:30,115
- With training?
- With everything.

215
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,786
Wait, you mean everything?

216
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:39,455
You can't. You're Hit-Girl.
We were gonna start a team.

217
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,292
You can't just quit,
this is who you are.

218
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:45,378
Not anymore, Dave.

219
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:49,255
I'm sorry, but
it's over. I'm done.

220
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,173
Just leave me alone.

221
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:53,175
Would you stop apologizing!?

222
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:58,597
I don't know what's worse. That you're fucking a
ninth-grader or that you just got dumped by one?

223
00:17:58,598 --> 00:17:59,722
Pedophile freak!

224
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,558
- It's not like that!
- What is it like? Please, tell me.

225
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,519
I can't. It's to do
with the "Kick-Ass" thing.

226
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,352
I've got a secret for you.

227
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,772
- You remember Malick?
- Dude who volunteers at your needle exchange?

228
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,775
His baton is so much
bigger than "Kick-Ass'"

229
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,862
- No.
- Yeah.

230
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:20,948
- And by "baton", I mean penis.
- Yeah, I got that, thanks.

231
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,575
15 ditching 20, pervert.

232
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:27,411
A freshman, Dave!
You salty dog.

233
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:32,582
- What's the problem? Grass in the field, play ball, right?
- No, Todd.

234
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,044
Chris, your tutor's
here. Chris!

235
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:38,421
Chris, your tu....

236
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,379
Holy shit!

237
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,425
- What the hell is that?
- My Destiny.

238
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:47,470
Chris, just, just 'cause your Mom
like to get a little freaky, now...

239
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:49,472
I know what my
role is in this, Javier...

240
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:53,141
My dad was a crime boss,
so it just makes sense...

241
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:57,061
I'm a supervillain.
It's evolution.

242
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:59,730
Come on, c'mon, just put those things
down before you hurt somebody, Chris.

243
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:03,441
- Nah, that's my name.
- Okay, okay, uhh, Red, Red Mist...

244
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:09,029
Red Mist was my superhero name.
Henceforth, I'll be known as...

245
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,906
The Motherfucker.

246
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:17,410
After Mindy quit, I decided to stop hitting
the heavy bag and start hitting the streets.

247
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:20,706
- Hey, Kick-Ass! Welcome back!
- Yeah!

248
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:22,873
You're the best, man!

249
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:26,459
Only problem? I was
still on my own.

250
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,963
So I went online and found a Physics
professor calling himself "Dr. Gravity".

251
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:34,215
Sure, he wasn't Hit-Girl,
but I had to start somewhere.

252
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,926
This is the Zero-G
device I invented.

253
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:40,180
- It can levitate any object up to a ton.
- For real?

254
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:45,558
Hell, no, man! This is a baseball bat
wrapped in tin foil! But it fooled you!

255
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,560
Hey, can I get a Diet
Mountain Dew, please?

256
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,773
I'm not even a Physics professor. Just a copyright I put,
an ad thing, you see. But that's why I love this stuff.

257
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,650
You can be anyone you want.

258
00:19:55,651 --> 00:20:00,153
- You done many team-ups before?
- Kind of. Yeah. No, not really.

259
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:02,489
I was getting kinda nervous
about being on my own.

260
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,283
Yeah, me too. I've never
even been in a fight.

261
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,912
Well, hopefully, you
won't have to.

262
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:13,039
Hey, I printed a guy talking about
forming a team if you're interested.

263
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,916
I don't know how serious he is,
but his picture was pretty hardcore.

264
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,252
Are you kidding me?
That's why I contacted you.

265
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,879
I didn't wanna freak you out by
bringing it up too soon, y'know?

266
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,008
I'll show you his profile
after I hit the men's room.

267
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,760
You're uncle Ralph's not gonna
be happy about this, Chris.

268
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,721
- That's not my name.
- I'm not calling you that, forget it.

269
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:36,474
Javier, you worked for my Dad. Then you
worked for my Mom. Now, you work for me.

270
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:39,476
I'm probably the richest
kid in New York City.

271
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:44,524
But if you don't like that, find yourself
another motherfucking job, okay?

272
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:47,275
Yo, Kick-Ass!

273
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:51,027
- Man, am I glad to see you.
- Is there anything I can do to help, sir?

274
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:54,615
Yeah, I was hoping you can help
me get a million hits on YouTube!

275
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:01,872
Come on.
Come on!

276
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,678
- God!
- Run, Kick-Ass! Run!

277
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:25,807
Jersey Shore, motherfucker!

278
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:30,060
What, not interested in
a fair fight, huh?

279
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,604
That is not a fair fight.

280
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,899
Team meeting tomorrow!
I'll e-mail you the address.

281
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,942
Beware Dr. Gravity!

282
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:41,319
You have to admire
the Doctor's enthusiasm.

283
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,656
I couldn't wait to
meet his friends.

284
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:55,498
Hands in the air, spud roll. Empty the
register and don't do anything stupid.

285
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,917
Come on! Hey, where are
your security cameras?

286
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,543
- We don't have them. Too expensive.
- Seriously? What the fuck!

287
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:04,254
- How is this gonna go viral?
- You want to be filmed?

288
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,173
Shut up and just
get on the ground!

289
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:09,176
And you better tell people
The Motherfucker was here!

290
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,968
What's wrong with you, boy?

291
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:14,220
Get on the floor too, Gandalf,
or I will bust a cap in your ass!

292
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:17,682
You're gonna bust your own face when that
gun kicks if you don't hold it properly.

293
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:20,769
Just, get on the ground!

294
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:26,189
God! Will you
hurry up?

295
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,858
I told ya!

296
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,244
Go! Go,
go, go!

297
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:45,330
Start the car! Go, go,
go, go, go! Fuck!

298
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:49,875
That was amazing!
I feel so alive!

299
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,085
I know who I am,
I know why I'm here.

300
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:56,922
I'm gonna fuck, this world, up! They will
know The Motherfucker's name!

301
00:22:56,923 --> 00:23:00,175
You got to find me some badass
MMA types to train me, okay?

302
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:02,427
Like a, like a Chuck Liddell,
or whoever.

303
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:08,141
Fuck, I don't care how much it costs. I just wanna
be able to kill Kick-Ass with my bare hands.

304
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:13,520
I gotta Tweet about this.

305
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:14,459
(Kick-Ass texting)

306
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,715
(Mindy responding)

307
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,162
You ready?

308
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:40,333
- I don't know. Am I?
- Yes, you are. You look great.

309
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:44,670
- And Barbara's daughter, Brooke, is really nice.
- What am I supposed to talk to them about?

310
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:47,172
I'd rather be waterboarded than
listen to Justin Bieber.

311
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:49,757
- You're gonna be fine.
- I'm gonna be a disaster.

312
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:53,844
- How do you know that?
- Because it's a slumber party, for fuck's sake?

313
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:56,681
Dollar.
Jar.

314
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,684
(Swear Jar)

315
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:04,103
You're gonna need a bigger jar.

316
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:10,525
Pretty cool, huh? This is
how the beer gets delivered.

317
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:15,778
Dude, you got a secret elevator
through underground headquarters.

318
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,114
Yeah, the guy I told you
about owns this place.

319
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:22,910
- Just like a real-life Batcave.
- I know, right?

320
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,083
This is the single greatest
thing I've ever seen.

321
00:24:33,668 --> 00:24:37,255
Welcome to "Justice Forever".

322
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:45,802
- Hi, Detective Williams! This must be Mindy.
- It is. Hi, Brooke.

323
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:48,889
So, you girls have some fun, and I'll
pick you up in the morning, okay?

324
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:53,058
- I'll be the one with the slit wrists.
- No, you're gonna be the one that gets the awesome manicure.

325
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,895
- I am?
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:59,188
- Say "hey" to Mindy, ladies.
- Hey.

327
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:03,066
I know you. You're that freshman who took
a ride on Dave Lizewski's disco stick.

328
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,361
- I did not ride his...
- If you just blew him. You're totes a virgin, right?

329
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:09,864
- She didn't blow him. Look at her.
- Then what? Rimjob? Handjob? Fingerbang?

330
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:13,700
Sweet Ryan Seacrest. You
at least kissed him, right?

331
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,285
Totes.

332
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:17,703
You've never kissed a
boy, have you?

333
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:20,372
- Oh, my God, that is so adorbs.
- Maybe, she's a dyke.

334
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:23,250
Maybe, I'll jam my foot
up your snatch!

335
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:27,045
- Oh, she's super-bitchy, I likes!
- What's the big deal, anyway?

336
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:29,630
What could be so great about
gagging on some douchebag's tongue?

337
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:34,675
It's pretty fucking great! You know how you
feel when you watch that video by Union J?

338
00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:37,052
Holy shit, you don't know?

339
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:40,974
This, will change, your life.

340
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:51,899
- You guys love this shit like the fanboys
love Stan Lee, don't you? - Who's Stan Lee?

341
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,677
- What the fuck was that?
- I know, right? I'm soaked.

342
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:31,389
That is who you are, Mindy. You
may not dress like us, or talk like us,

343
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,849
but when it comes to
boys, we're all the same.

344
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,853
Twilight, Channing Tatum,
Union J. It's biology, bitch.

345
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:41,064
Don't fight it.

346
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:48,444
- I gotta go.
- But we were gonna go get high on bath salts at Logan's house.

347
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:53,115
Mindy, I wanna give you a chance that, the
rest of the girls in our class would kill for.

348
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:57,202
Don't you wanna walk out the door
everyday in skin-tight clothes,

349
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:59,412
knowing that everyone
worships you?

350
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:04,249
Don't you wanna sneak out at night, raise
a little hell and show the world what

351
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,337
a strong, independent
woman is capable of?

352
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:11,505
Don't you wanna belong?

353
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:18,303
- Can I wear this to Logan's?
- Yay! It's gonna be so much fun.

354
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:23,557
So, we tried the cops.
And tried the newspapers.

355
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:30,814
And even set up a, y'know, a thing, on the
internet for people to help us find Tommy.

356
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:35,607
But we got nothing.

357
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,318
We never saw our son again.

358
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,866
I came up with the name "Remembering Tommy",
and we've been doing this 3 nights a week.

359
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:47,993
Colonel Stars and Stripes
found us online.

360
00:27:47,994 --> 00:27:51,329
That's terrible, guys.
I'm really sorry.

361
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,415
I became "Night Bitch" after my sister was
murdered and found in a dumpster.

362
00:27:55,416 --> 00:28:00,043
- Shit. - Doesn't bring her back, but at
least I'm doing something positive about it.

363
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,380
Insect Man?

364
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:06,090
I've been bullied my
whole life for being gay.

365
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:08,968
So, now I stand up
for the defenseless.

366
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:11,012
That's why I don't wear a mask.

367
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:13,346
Too much like being
back in the closet.

368
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:16,891
Long as your heart is in the right place,
we don't care what you put in your mouth.

369
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:19,185
- Fist bump.
- Thank you, sir.

370
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:25,231
Well, I became "Battle Guy" after my parents were
mugged and killed coming home from the opera.

371
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:28,734
Did I tell you guys that that sick bastard
maxed out their credit cards on porno sites?

372
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,611
I just hope that we get the
chance to say hello to this guy

373
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:33,739
someday so I can personally
levitate his soul from his body.

374
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,240
Oh, my God, Marty?

375
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:40,660
- I know I recognized your voice.
- No, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about.

376
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:43,288
I don't know a Marty.

377
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:48,374
- Hey, asshole, it's me. Dave.
- Dave?

378
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:52,337
- Why are you dressed like Kick-Ass?
- Because, I'm Kick-Ass!

379
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:56,340
- You two know each other?
- Yeah, like, since we were five.

380
00:28:56,341 --> 00:29:00,301
- What's all this bullshit about your
parents getting killed? - Language!

381
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:05,974
- What?
- Battle Guy? Care to update your resume?

382
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:11,060
I'm trying to figure out how to explain this
without sounding like a complete idiot right now.

383
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:15,273
- Yeah, I'm not sure that's possible, Batman.
- I'm not, either.

384
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:18,107
Okay, well, when I
found you guys online,

385
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,777
you were all swapping these
awesome origin stories.

386
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:23,987
- I mean, Colonel, you're ex-Mafia, for Christ's sake.
- Yo!

387
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:27,741
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
- I'm sorry.

388
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:32,995
I just, I didn't think you guys would let me
join the team unless I had a good story, too.

389
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,083
All right. We'll let you off the
hook this time, Battle Guy.

390
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:41,626
- Want to see something cool?
- Yeah!

391
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:44,171
I thought this could
be our meeting room.

392
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:48,633
- Woah! This is so cool!
- Now this little renovation was totally clandestine.

393
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:50,509
Which means nobody
knew about it.

394
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,054
I know it's not much, but
this is just the beginning.

395
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:57,850
Together, we can make
a real difference.

396
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,396
If you'd consider it, Kick-Ass, we'd
be honored to have you join us.

397
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,440
Hell, yeah!

398
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,734
That's what I'd like to hear!

399
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:15,613
Alright! Time for initiation.
Turn around and I'll unzip ya.

400
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:19,450
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm just joking. Let's get down to business.

401
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:26,204
There you are. We saved you a seat
in the caf, but you never showed.

402
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:29,791
Yeah, I usually head over to
the Olive Garden to carb-load.

403
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:33,293
- I haven't had white sugar since my first birthday.
- Do we need an intervention?

404
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:36,504
Come on. The best way to tighten up
a tummy is the varsity dance team.

405
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:39,591
The signing sheet just went up.

406
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:44,136
It's still blowing
my mind, "Kick-Ass".

407
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:47,556
It's like finding out your best
friend's always been Will Smith.

408
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:51,934
- Hey, guys. What you talking 'bout?
- Nothing.

409
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,228
- Nothing?
- Yeah, Todd, nothing.

410
00:30:55,229 --> 00:31:00,566
- All right, see you around, guys.
- Todd, wait!

411
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,945
- Watch it!
- Watch me end your life!

412
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:07,237
C'mon, forget it. He's just one of those dickheads
that follows The Motherfucker on Twitter.

413
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:10,991
- Who? - The Motherfucker. He's some guy
planning to be the world's first supervillain.

414
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:15,079
- He's got like a thousand followers already.
- What an asshole.

415
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:17,495
Get some!

416
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:19,582
You got this, Motherfucker!

417
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,792
- You really think he got a shot?
- I wouldn't take his money if I didn't.

418
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:27,755
MMA is like chess, it's all about the moves.
And your boy really knows his stuff.

419
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,385
Time to die, asshole.

420
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:37,012
- Are you alright?
- I'm cool.

421
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:39,890
Good jab!
Nice jab, buddy!

422
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:42,768
Come on, stay loose, baby.
Walk it off, walk it off!

423
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,814
Shit! Oh, you
broke my leg!

424
00:31:47,314 --> 00:31:50,689
- Come on. Do something. Yeah, let's take a break guys.
- Let's take a break!

425
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,152
Street rules, bitch!

426
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:58,654
Chuck!
Get this girl off me!

427
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:02,073
Hey, what are you doing, man? You
all right, Chris? You all right, buddy?

428
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:06,077
- Get off me, I was winning!
- No, you were crying.

429
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:08,496
You know what?
Screw this.

430
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:12,583
My superpower, is
that I'm rich as shit.

431
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:16,880
Hey, you wanna work for me, huh?
You wanna beat people up for me?

432
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:23,342
- Sure. - Alright! Let's get you a mask
and a costume and we will call you...

433
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,718
"Black Death".

434
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:28,096
Woah, you don't think that's just
a little bit incredibly racist?

435
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,805
I don't give a shit! I want
you to put the word out.

436
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:33,933
That I'm willing to pay top-dollar
for every hired hitter in town.

437
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,311
- Come on, let's just talk about it first.
- The money talks.

438
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:41,147
You wanted me to be my own man.
This is what it looks like.

439
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:46,194
- Alright, alright, I'll make some calls.
- Yes! Anybody else who wanna be a supervillain?

440
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:49,112
I promise I'll pay better than
Chuck "Little Dick" Liddell!

441
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:53,201
- What did you call me?
- No, no, man. He took a hit to the head, he doesn't know what he's saying.

442
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:56,243
I've been studying privately
with Coach Podell.

443
00:32:56,244 --> 00:33:00,497
And by studying, I mean my mom
paid her off to make me varsity.

444
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:04,083
So, if you're half-decent I'll make
sure she puts you on the team.

445
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:07,669
- At least as an alternate.
- You'd do that for me?

446
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,798
Besties stick together.

447
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,257
If Brooke wants a pet, she
should just get a dog.

448
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,634
She's just trying to recreate
Mindy in her own image.

449
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:18,638
All right ladies, have a
seat, let's get started.

450
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,421
Mindy Macready.

451
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:08,010
As long as you don't fall
on your face, you're in. Go.

452
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:21,939
Four attackers...

453
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:24,973
No escape.

454
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:24,907
- Oh my God! You'd totally make captain.
- So much better than Brooke's.

455
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:29,118
A bunch of people
with made-up names,

456
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,453
standing around in
homemade costumes,

457
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:34,455
searching the web
for unsolved crimes?

458
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:38,626
Comic book heroes all have billion-dollar
bases and headquarters on the moon.

459
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:40,419
But this is the real world.

460
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,296
- Scales, like red, white and blue.
- Ist's awesome!

461
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:44,297
Brick.

462
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:49,717
- What do you think?
- I think it does the job.

463
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:51,679
People should get
what they deserve.

464
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,596
A family living in the street
deserves a hot meal.

465
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:58,058
An inebriated college girl deserves
to make it home safe at night.

466
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,646
And a pervert, a pedophile...

467
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,231
Deserves a visit
from Eisenhower.

468
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:12,361
Now you don't wanna hit with your closed fist. Because
you might break your hand, then you're defenseless.

469
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:14,280
You wanna hit with open palm!

470
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,948
Open palm!

471
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,995
I never made varsity football,
or got cast in the school play.

472
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:24,163
Hell, I never even
made honor roll.

473
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:25,871
Dropped like a bitch!

474
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:30,335
But if I had, I kinda believed it
would've felt a lot like this.

475
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,671
"When the cops can no
longer, protect and serve,

476
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:36,338
be warned, mugger,
heads up, perv!

477
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:38,967
We got the strength,
we got the nerve,

478
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:41,635
to give those in need,
what they deserve!"

479
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:44,555
Justice Forever!

480
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:47,181
We were in the ultimate clique.

481
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:50,601
It didn't matter that no
one else knew. We knew.

482
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,603
We felt like rockstars.

483
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:55,564
Doctor, good job.
Battle Guy....

484
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:58,690
Good night, Colonel,
Thanks for everything.

485
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:01,151
No, son, thank you.

486
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,695
You showed us that every
man can make a difference.

487
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:07,115
Without Kick-Ass, none
of us would be here.

488
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:11,036
That's from the heart. Don't
let it go to your head.

489
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,497
So...

490
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:18,583
I'm not really that tired.

491
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,928
- Okay.
- Let's leave the masks on.

492
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:38,183
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

493
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,020
First big mission is tonight.
And it's not community service.

494
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:47,355
We're taking out
some real bad guys.

495
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:51,859
- Can't your team handle it?
- They're not you, Mindy.

496
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,446
Remembering Tommy owns a dry fruit
business and Night Bitch teaches ballet.

497
00:37:55,447 --> 00:38:00,116
Night Bitch? What is she, a
superhero or a softcore porno?

498
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:02,117
Maybe a little bit of both.

499
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:05,161
Oh, God! You're
frogging her?

500
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,289
I'm gonna vom.

501
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:12,043
Hey, you're like a ninja. Can't you just
sneak out? After Marcus goes to sleep?

502
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:14,920
You don't get it, Dave.

503
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:20,883
- I made a promise to Marcus.
- So break it. You're a superhero, remember?

504
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,511
Mindy Macready is
just a disguise.

505
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:27,055
Yeah, I don't know what kind
of superhero "Night Whore" is,

506
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:31,433
but if you really think I'd ever break my
word, you obviously have no idea of who I am.

507
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,644
I know that making dance team doesn't
make you stop being who you are.

508
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,979
I know Hit-Girl couldn't give a shit
about what high school girls are into.

509
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,399
I know that you wouldn't go on a
date if your life depended on it.

510
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,486
- Go to hell, Dave.
- What? You know I'm right.

511
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:49,489
- Hey, roid-rage. Yeah.
- Me?

512
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,952
- You wanna take me on a date sometime?
- Yeah! Sure, umm...

513
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:56,830
My name is, umm, Simon.

514
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:00,541
Great, "um,
Simon."

515
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:02,417
It's a date.

516
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:06,086
- Mindy! I'm sorry.
- Is there a problem, Mind?

517
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:10,258
Good. 'Cause I
don't like problems.

518
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:16,010
Dave, you've been sneaking out at night? Mrs. Napier said
she thought she saw you leaving at 2 in the morning.

519
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:21,308
Miss Napier's crazy, dad. She
tried to teach her dog Spanish.

520
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,268
Are you on drugs?

521
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:30,898
- Seriously?
- I gotta ask. You're my best bud and you're growing up so fast.

522
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:34,026
Promise me you're not
doing anything foolish?

523
00:39:34,027 --> 00:39:36,736
I promise.

524
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:39,530
Good enough for me, pal.

525
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:42,117
You're too smart to
do anything stupid.

526
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:46,578
Justice Forever!

527
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:49,956
I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

528
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,333
Todd texted
me. Again.

529
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,045
Dude, how badass is
Colonel Stars and Stripes?

530
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,630
Yeah, I still can't believe
he's an ex-mob enforcer.

531
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,799
I mean, how do you go from
that to being a superhero?

532
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,094
- He's a born again Christian. Yeah!
- Shut up!

533
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:09,138
Let's hope he
can handle tonight.

534
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:14,684
I guess we're about
to find out.

535
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:23,149
Hey, where's the
rest of the team?

536
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,986
Dr. Gravity has the flu and Remembering
Tommy got Book of Mormon tickets, so...

537
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:30,904
That's okay. The
five of us should do.

538
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:33,740
How did you say this guy made
his money, sir? Prostitution?

539
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:37,662
Not just girls. Kids. Ships them
in from villages back home.

540
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:42,247
- Boneheads in blue take a blind eye.
- How do you know he's here tonight?

541
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:44,666
Because Thursday night
is poker night.

542
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:49,128
Same five lowlifes every week.
They're not even hard to find.

543
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:53,382
- So what's the plan? Are we sneaking in?
- I thought we'd knock.

544
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,425
- What?
- More polite.

545
00:40:55,426 --> 00:40:57,927
Stay frosty, team.

546
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:01,431
I used to eat punks
like this for breakfast.

547
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:05,641
Jehovah's Witness!

548
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,148
(Speaking Chinese)

549
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:15,692
(Speaking Chinese)

550
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,860
(Speaking Chinese)

551
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:22,948
I'm sorry, I just zoned out for a second. Did you
say that we're going up against five gangsters?

552
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:25,742
The bouncer makes six.

553
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:32,247
- And three quarters.
- What the fuck do you want?

554
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:35,374
Good evening, young man.
We'd like a word with Jimmy Kim.

555
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:38,211
If it's not too inconvenient.

556
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:45,050
Get the fuck out of here before I
tear your head off, you old fuck.

557
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,135
- I'm sorry.
- I think we're in trouble.

558
00:41:49,136 --> 00:41:53,807
I just don't understand why people feel
the need to use that kind of language.

559
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:05,608
Oh, sweet Jesus.

560
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,859
Battle Guy?

561
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,570
- What did I tell you about taking the Lord's name in vain?
- Sorry, sir.

562
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,864
Eisenhower, at the ready.

563
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:18,493
Insect Man, I want you right behind me.
Everybody else, spread out, catch some strays.

564
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,829
And try to have fun.

565
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,624
Otherwise, what's the point?

566
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,917
Nice party. Anybody
wanna dance?

567
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:29,919
(Curses in Chinese)

568
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:36,884
Where are you going?

569
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:45,349
Very nice!

570
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,185
Watch the bunny!

571
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:01,319
Night Bitch!
Behind you!

572
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,835
I got his right arm.

573
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:29,593
You know, you shouldn't talk with
your mouth full. It's very rude.

574
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:31,595
Come on!

575
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:34,263
Who the hell are you?

576
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,393
- We're the good guys.
- No, you're the fucking dead guys.

577
00:43:41,145 --> 00:43:44,314
Eisenhower.

578
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:56,406
- Where are the girls?
- Come on, man. I've got a heart problem.

579
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:58,366
Oh, yeah?

580
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,203
You want me to
solve that for you?

581
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,622
Okay. The girls are upstairs
in the apartments.

582
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:10,377
My little brother, he's only a kid.
He's just a college kid.

583
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:13,003
- Kick-Ass, Night Bitch.
- On it!

584
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:16,505
Ralph D'Amico is gonna
end you for this.

585
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:20,593
- It hurts!
- Yeah, there's a dog on your balls.

586
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:25,803
You want money? There's
fifty grand in the table.

587
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:28,141
Please, just make
him stop! Please!

588
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,268
You think you can buy us?
Is that what you think?

589
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:36,646
We're not here to steal from you.
We're here to send a message.

590
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:39,525
To all the other
bottom-dwellers.

591
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:45,696
- We're shutting you down.
- C'mon. There's a van waiting outside from the women's shelter.

592
00:44:45,697 --> 00:44:48,365
It'll take you someplace safe.

593
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:52,494
Wait, we can't leave.
We have no money.

594
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:56,579
- Battle Guy, how much did they have on the table?
- I'd say fifty grand.

595
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,833
- You got plenty now.
- Thank you.

596
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:12,675
Good job, guys.

597
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,429
Very tidy.
Very tidy.

598
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:19,973
I can't believe you pulled a gun on that guy.
Were you really gonna shoot him?

599
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:22,518
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

600
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:26,313
Empty. Don't tell
the bad guys.

601
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:30,565
Pardon my language, Colonel, but
you have got some serious balls.

602
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:33,192
Certainly more
than Mr. Kim.

603
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:35,946
"There's a dog
on my balls!"

604
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:41,616
- Goddamn it! Javier!
- What happened?

605
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:46,453
Some douche just posted a link to a story about a whorehouse.
Says that Kick-Ass' team took them out.

606
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:50,332
- What the hell, where's my crew?
- Chris, everybody's just...

607
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,960
Could you ladies excuse
us for a second?

608
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,171
No, they're my sidekicks, they can
listen to what we have to...

609
00:45:57,172 --> 00:46:00,632
They're not your sidekicks, Chris.
They're prostitutes and witnesses. Come on.

610
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,343
Sorry. No
offense.

611
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,428
Everybody's just too afraid of your
uncle Ralph to take the job.

612
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:09,848
- But he's in prison.
- Doesn't matter. He runs the family now.

613
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:12,099
And he wants
everybody to lay low.

614
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,853
But fortunately for you, Big Tony doesn't
know how to lay low so he's here.

615
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:19,605
- I don't remember a Big Tony. Is he huge?
- He's ironic.

616
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:23,025
Five-foot-four,
but mean as shit.

617
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:29,738
He's got such a hard-
on for killing people.

618
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:33,075
- He's little, and he kills.
- Right.

619
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:36,327
Call him "The Tumor".
Who's next?

620
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:39,747
Alright. We got an ex-Triad
member, looking for work.

621
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:42,749
Easy! "Genghis
Carnage"! Come on!

622
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,461
- You gotta quit with the racist stereotypes, Chris.
- Archetypes. Keep going.

623
00:46:47,462 --> 00:46:51,299
- Alright, we got a Katryna Dubrovsky. Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait, a chick?

624
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,258
- You're saying you hired a chick?
- Yeah.

625
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:58,430
Former KGB. She was locked up in
the gulag until she ate her cellmate.

626
00:46:59,638 --> 00:47:01,931
"Mother Russia".

627
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:05,143
Mother Russia and Motherfucker both on
the same team? That doesn't work, Chris.

628
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:07,477
I am not asking for
suggestions, asshole.

629
00:47:07,478 --> 00:47:11,188
Just get them costumes
and get them ready.

630
00:47:11,189 --> 00:47:14,526
Shit. Javier,
thank you.

631
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:17,486
I couldn't do this without you.

632
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:21,948
You're pretty much like the
only real family I have left.

633
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:24,617
Not a problem, man.
I got your back.

634
00:47:24,618 --> 00:47:28,036
It's kinda like you're the Alfred
to my evil Bruce Wayne.

635
00:47:28,037 --> 00:47:32,831
- Did you just call me your fucking butler?
- Yeah, is it not a compliment?

636
00:47:32,832 --> 00:47:35,210
Shit. My bad.

637
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:40,630
There wasn't much
action those nights.

638
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:44,259
I mean, there was always a
little action, with Night Bitch.

639
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,472
The reality of being a superhero,
is lots of patrols.

640
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:54,392
But that didn't stop people
from begging to join up.

641
00:47:56,769 --> 00:48:01,189
With all our new members, it
seemed kinda shitty not to ask Todd.

642
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,484
Stop peeking man,
you're gonna ruin it.

643
00:48:05,485 --> 00:48:06,486
Check, it, out!

644
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,029
You can't fight crime in that.

645
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,448
You're pants are so tight,
you got frog eye.

646
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:16,451
- What the hell's frog eye?
- Male cameltoe.

647
00:48:16,452 --> 00:48:19,243
I'm not really sure about these names
you've come up with, either.

648
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:22,747
Whoop-ass, Kickass-Man,
Doctor Kick-ass?

649
00:48:22,748 --> 00:48:26,501
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they all kinda seem, derivative?

650
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:31,338
Let me translate that: you can't just
copy Dave's name, you nobgobbler!

651
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:34,050
Okay, umm...

652
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:35,883
Oh, wait.

653
00:48:35,884 --> 00:48:39,262
Oh, I got it. I
got it. I got it.

654
00:48:39,846 --> 00:48:40,597
"Ass-kicker".

655
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:46,350
- Seriously?
- You're such a dick, Marty.

656
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:49,061
I know this is why you guys don't text
me back. I'm not an actual idiot.

657
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:52,272
Well, you could've
fooled me, "Ass-licker".

658
00:48:52,815 --> 00:48:55,482
- You know what, screw you guys. No, really.
- Todd.

659
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:57,901
Fuck you guys. I'm gonna
form my own team.

660
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,488
Todd, wait, come on!

661
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,198
Todd was right. We
are being dicks.

662
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,868
But the truth is, the only person who
I really wanted on the team was Mindy.

663
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:12,248
But she was too busy trying
not be a superhero.

664
00:49:12,497 --> 00:49:15,249
Okay, Mind, he's here.

665
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:24,047
Your first big date.
How are you feeling?

666
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:29,093
Like the first time Big Daddy sent me into
a crack den with nothing but a pen knife?

667
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,847
I've got some butterflies.

668
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,889
You just be yourself and
you let me be nervous.

669
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,476
Don't worry about me. I can kill
a man with his own finger.

670
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,897
A word of advice:
I wouldn't open with that.

671
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,068
Thanks for letting me
finally take you out.

672
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:53,573
How else was I gonna get
you to stop calling?

673
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:56,574
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

674
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:11,961
- Where are we going?
- To a party.

675
00:50:11,962 --> 00:50:15,006
Why is this party in
the middle of nowhere?

676
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:18,550
Because that's where keg
parties are usually are, right?

677
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,856
- I guess we're the first ones here.
- This isn't where you have a party, moron.

678
00:50:35,857 --> 00:50:39,149
- This is where you dump a dead body.
- What's your problem?

679
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,236
I'm sorry.

680
00:50:41,528 --> 00:50:43,862
I'll stop being such a bitch.

681
00:50:43,863 --> 00:50:47,157
You actually seem
like a nice guy.

682
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:49,784
So, umm...

683
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:51,243
You wanna hook up?

684
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:53,454
I'm not a total idiot.

685
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,916
Simon, get back in the car.

686
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:58,959
Now!

687
00:51:09,217 --> 00:51:11,426
Yay! You made it.

688
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:16,514
- Brooke?
- This, is to celebrate you.

689
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:18,306
Celebrate?

690
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,767
What a total
loser you are. And...

691
00:51:21,768 --> 00:51:24,645
We ditch losers.

692
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:28,023
Poor Mindy.
What did you think?

693
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:30,817
The cool kids saw something
special in you, and,

694
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:33,735
invited you to
your first party?

695
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:38,490
Where you'd sip your first beer and,
finally suck face for the first time?

696
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:42,744
Newsflash:
You're not special.

697
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:48,792
Fuck with the queen bee and,
you're gonna get stung.

698
00:51:49,876 --> 00:51:51,836
Date ditch.

699
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:56,047
Party at my house!

700
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:45,420
Dave?

701
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:48,589
Oh, my God, Mindy?

702
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,300
Holy shit. What
are you doing?

703
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,343
It's just...

704
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:56,470
I needed to see
my Robin, I guess.

705
00:52:58,097 --> 00:53:00,474
Are you okay?

706
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,938
I don't know what to do.

707
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:12,108
Those girls, they're...

708
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,402
They're evil.

709
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:16,695
It's just high school.
Who gives a shit.

710
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:19,112
You should be out there
in the real world.

711
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,199
Making it a better place.

712
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,703
- Dave, I can't.
- I know, you promised your dad.

713
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,914
But he's not here anymore.

714
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,460
This is your life.
You got to live it.

715
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:38,380
How am I supposed to
face them tomorrow?

716
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,713
I'm so embarrassed.

717
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:46,554
Why? You're smart, you're
beautiful, you're funny.

718
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:51,390
You're the strongest person I've
ever met. You can do anything.

719
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:52,183
And you're
Hit-Girl!

720
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,894
It doesn't matter if you're
wearing a mask or make-up.

721
00:53:56,895 --> 00:54:00,146
That's who you really are.

722
00:54:00,147 --> 00:54:03,273
So what should I do?
Cut their tongues out?

723
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:06,736
- No, definitely not.
- I'm fucking with you.

724
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:12,698
Just beat them at
their own game.

725
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:15,494
By being yourself.

726
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:27,919
Well, if you really wanna be
popular, consider two little words:

727
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,047
Sex tape.

728
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:49,271
Lois, you don't need
these assholes.

729
00:54:49,272 --> 00:54:52,357
If I can dress like them,
so can you.

730
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:55,901
It's a gift. From some drug
dealer who went missing.

731
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:01,530
Just because you dress like us, doesn't
mean that you can be like one of us.

732
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,907
It doesn't matter what costume
I wear, yours or mine.

733
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:07,910
I'm a superhero.
That's who I am.

734
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:11,998
Okay, Captain Muffin-muncher.
Have fun playing make-believe.

735
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:14,458
This, is all make-
believe, Brooke.

736
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:17,501
The reality is,
you're an evil bitch.

737
00:55:17,502 --> 00:55:20,461
Who's just as bad as
the worst criminal scum.

738
00:55:20,463 --> 00:55:24,048
You wanna get real, Mindy?
In the real world, I win.

739
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:27,092
I go to an awesome college,
I marry a hot guy,

740
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:29,553
and I make adorable babies for
my nanny to take care of

741
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:31,805
while we vacate in Paris.

742
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:35,600
My life is gonna rock.
And yours is gonna suck.

743
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:37,977
And no matter how
slutty you dress,

744
00:55:37,978 --> 00:55:41,605
no boy is ever gonna wanna
kiss that hole you call a mouth.

745
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:45,274
So why don't you spare us all
the whining and slit your wrists now.

746
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,736
'Cause the only thing that's gonna ruin my
day is looking at your face one more second.

747
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:50,488
Told her.

748
00:55:53,574 --> 00:55:56,451
What's that? A
ghetto cellphone?

749
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,785
Gonna call for help
with a comeback?

750
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:03,623
Actually, my daddy bought this
from a disgruntled darpo employee.

751
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:06,666
You see it was designed for crowd
control but deemed too severe.

752
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:10,670
It emits a pulse that creates
spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

753
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:13,964
He called it the "sick stick".

754
00:56:13,965 --> 00:56:18,343
Well, either your dad got ripped off, or
you're back in make-believe land, sweetheart.

755
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:20,553
Because we feel fabulous.

756
00:56:20,554 --> 00:56:22,680
Not for long.

757
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:33,231
Oh, my God!

758
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,941
You get away from me.
Please. You win.

759
00:56:36,942 --> 00:56:41,528
I don't want to win. I just want to
make the world a better place.

760
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:07,174
Is this what you've been up to while I'm out working
nights saving for your college? You've been,

761
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:11,804
dressing up and fighting people?
There is blood on these stick-things.

762
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,429
What are you doing in my room?

763
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,472
Dad!

764
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,306
Are you at home?

765
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,683
I was looking for drugs.
I was worried about you.

766
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,936
- Okay, well now you can stop.
- No. Now I'm even more worried.

767
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:25,106
Jesus, Dave. Drugs would have been
better. This is deranged.

768
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:27,899
- Some people do a lot worse.
- Oh, the people you hang out with?

769
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,277
No, the people I hang out
with are superheroes.

770
00:57:31,278 --> 00:57:36,364
There is no such thing, Dave. This
is the real world, with real consequences.

771
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:39,575
- When are you gonna grow up?
- If it means turning into you, never.

772
00:57:39,576 --> 00:57:43,288
I don't wear that mask 'cause I'm
ashamed of who I am. Not like you.

773
00:57:44,663 --> 00:57:48,124
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're out of work. You're here doing crunches.

774
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:52,670
Why? So you'd look like someone else? Maybe
get a few more years of doing nothing?

775
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:56,422
Your life has no meaning, dad.
When you're gone, who's gonna notice?

776
00:57:56,423 --> 00:58:01,344
- Where the hell are you going?
- Oh, I'm leaving. That's what you do when you grow up.

777
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,767
Did he say why
he wanted to see me?

778
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:14,397
When your uncle Ralph
calls, don't ask questions.

779
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:19,441
That's the kid?

780
00:58:20,068 --> 00:58:23,947
Chris, just be cool
and you'll be fine.

781
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:31,117
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good, Uncle Ralph.

782
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:35,956
Listen, Chris things have been tough
all around since your dad, you know....

783
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:44,670
- Uncle Ralph, they record these things.
- It's fine. The warden's a pal.

784
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:49,924
Now listen to me. It's okay to have a bit of fun.
But you can't go hiring a gang of heavy-hitters.

785
00:58:49,925 --> 00:58:53,511
- Javier should have told you.
- It doesn't matter.

786
00:58:53,512 --> 00:58:57,389
Uncle Ralph, I am gonna make Kick-Ass
pay for what he did to us.

787
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,641
Chris, you need to
forget that punk.

788
00:59:00,642 --> 00:59:05,939
It's more important that you stay out of this.
You're not like me, or your dad. You're, uhh...

789
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:08,817
Special.

790
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:15,155
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

791
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:21,408
- I know who I am now.
- Oh, yeah? And who's that?

792
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:22,452
The Motherfucker.

793
00:59:28,248 --> 00:59:31,584
You think you're the
big bad guy, huh?

794
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:36,255
Let me show you what
real evil looks like.

795
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:47,180
<i>Hello?</i>

796
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:51,224
- Javier, what's going on?
- Chris, what's up?

797
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:56,313
What are you doing on Lou's phone, huh? You dropped
yours in the toilet again? Everything okay?

798
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:23,793
Thank you for that.
I needed it.

799
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:27,754
- For what comes next.
- Don't be stupid, Chris.

800
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:30,632
Just get out of town for a while.
Go to college or something.

801
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:36,053
Why? You just taught me
everything I needed to know.

802
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:46,894
Voila! Presto and
alaca-damn!

803
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:50,482
Them boys designed a
very tasty logo.

804
01:00:53,777 --> 01:00:56,402
What's the matter, girl?
Do you hear something?

805
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,781
Come on, let's go
see. Come on!

806
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:08,204
Anybody out here?

807
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:11,748
I don't see anything.

808
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:16,003
You'll have to stay in there until
you calm down, you lunatic.

809
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:22,632
I wonder what's bothering you.

810
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:27,427
I know. Tonight,
you die.

811
01:01:27,428 --> 01:01:31,055
- Ladies first.
- You will not shoot me.

812
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:36,102
You are superhero. You help
people. You do not hurt them.

813
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:38,645
That's supervillain territory.
Or as I call my little gang,

814
01:01:38,646 --> 01:01:43,733
- The "Toxic Mega-Cunts".
- Hi.

815
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:51,865
Yeah, like your head.

816
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,836
That's gotta hurt.

817
01:02:18,637 --> 01:02:21,555
I did my homework
on you, Colonel.

818
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:28,603
You used to be Sal Bertolinni, didn't you? Did a few jobs
for my dad back in the day before you got born again.

819
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:32,564
I used to hang with,
a lot of losers.

820
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:37,611
Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?
Dressed like an idiot?

821
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:43,114
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm The Motherfucker!

822
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:46,577
And I'm here to end Kick-
Ass. Not just kill him,

823
01:02:50,955 --> 01:02:54,082
Let's trash this place, guys.

824
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:02,673
Miranda Swedlow.

825
01:03:03,174 --> 01:03:07,677
Who's that, Sal? She one of
the whores on your team?

826
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:24,357
Night Bitch. All snuggled
up to Kick-Ass.

827
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:28,194
Looks like our boy's
got a new hot pocket!

828
01:03:28,778 --> 01:03:31,029
Want me to kill his dog?

829
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,657
The dog? Jesus Christ,
I'm not that evil.

830
01:03:35,866 --> 01:03:39,869
Cut the old man's head off.
Are you guys hungry? I'm starving.

831
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,329
- Come on.
- Pizza, can we get pizza?

832
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:43,747
We're getting pizza.

833
01:03:43,748 --> 01:03:47,626
Don't worry.
I kill you first.

834
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:53,797
Justice, Forever...

835
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:57,049
A Brooklyn resident was found
decapitated last night.

836
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:00,386
According to Twitter, a man claiming
to be the world's first supervillain...

837
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:03,971
I told you, no TV. You're
grounded, remember?

838
01:04:03,972 --> 01:04:06,140
Marcus, I know I
made you a promise.

839
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:09,893
But I can't keep being someone I'm not.
When I see evil, I have to stop it.

840
01:04:09,894 --> 01:04:12,896
Mindy what you did to those girls
at school, was unacceptable.

841
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:15,190
- You could've really hurt them.
- You're right. I could have.

842
01:04:15,191 --> 01:04:19,442
But instead, I sent them home
with tummy aches. Boo-fucking-hoo!

843
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:22,445
This obsession that you
have with revenge is not healthy.

844
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:25,823
If you don't let me, and the police do our jobs,
then there's gonna be nothing that I can do for you.

845
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:29,033
You're never gonna have a normal life, and
you'll probably end up like your father.

846
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:32,452
Marcus, they cut a guy's head off.
Who else is going to stop them?

847
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:35,330
Kick-Ass?
You?

848
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:38,251
You go to your room
and do your homework.

849
01:04:47,424 --> 01:04:49,176
Now!

850
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:56,515
Hey, guys. We're signing a sympathy
card for the Colonel's sister.

851
01:04:56,516 --> 01:05:00,893
You wanna go 5 bucks each so we
can send flowers from the team?

852
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:06,439
- Did you guys see The Motherfucker's Twitter page?
- Who is this guy? And what's his problem with us?

853
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,275
I don't know, man, but he
has got some elephant-sized balls.

854
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:12,068
He's been bragging on the web
about what they did to the Colonel.

855
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:16,156
- Can that be traced?
- I tried. His IP address is masked.

856
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:21,286
Alright, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna organize a fight.
There're a lot of guys online who's said they're in if we need them.

857
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:23,911
Are you kidding me? This
isn't West Side Story.

858
01:05:23,912 --> 01:05:27,038
We didn't join up to be in a gang.
We did it so we could help people.

859
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,457
Sharon's right. We need to
leave this to the cops.

860
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:34,504
Well we better start walking in pairs. The Motherfucker's
tweeted that the Colonel was just the beginning.

861
01:05:35,129 --> 01:05:38,258
Anybody seen Night Bitch?

862
01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:54,019
- You sure she's on their team?
- Stupid gash. It's posted on a superhero page that she's dating Kick-Ass.

863
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,897
So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

864
01:05:59,984 --> 01:06:02,360
Hello, Night Bitch!

865
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:06,988
I think she wants to
take the party upstairs!

866
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:09,073
We're gonna have a party.

867
01:06:09,074 --> 01:06:12,327
She closed the door!

868
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:21,251
Don't worry, darling. I'm not gonna kill you. I
want you to give a message to your boyfriend.

869
01:06:24,546 --> 01:06:25,962
Let go!

870
01:06:25,963 --> 01:06:28,631
You're done banging
superheroes, baby!

871
01:06:28,632 --> 01:06:32,761
It's time to see what
evil dick feels like.

872
01:06:39,015 --> 01:06:40,974
Shit!

873
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:43,226
What's wrong?

874
01:06:44,729 --> 01:06:46,938
What are you doing?

875
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:50,816
Come on!

876
01:06:51,776 --> 01:06:55,403
God, okay, I'm just...
I'm not in the mood!

877
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:57,905
I guess evil dick feels limp.

878
01:06:57,906 --> 01:06:59,158
Hurt her.

879
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:04,327
Cops are coming.

880
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:07,830
Leave it to Mother Russia.
She makes ten times what we do.

881
01:07:07,831 --> 01:07:12,751
Fifty thousand per
week, plus expenses.

882
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:15,295
Watch out!

883
01:07:35,103 --> 01:07:37,396
Reverse it, reverse it!

884
01:07:38,481 --> 01:07:40,149
Damn!

885
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,656
Don't move!
Freeze!

886
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:57,538
Fifty thousand.
She's worth it!

887
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:09,381
Why is he backing up? Why's
there a lawnmower on the trunk?

888
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:23,099
We need back-up!
Eight men down!

889
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,311
I think you mean ten.

890
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,569
Let's bounce!

891
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:41,072
Put the word out. I'm building an evil army.
All psychopaths and ex-cons welcome.

892
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:44,826
I don't think you can have a problem,
when people hear about this.

893
01:08:48,955 --> 01:08:51,038
They just disappeared?

894
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:55,625
All they have to do is take off their masks. No one's gonna
recognize them once they're back in their street clothes.

895
01:08:55,626 --> 01:08:57,460
Your attention, please!

896
01:08:57,461 --> 01:09:01,589
Feds traced the IP addresses for
all those other costumed freaks.

897
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,551
Now we got every law enforcement agency
in the state working to hit them at once.

898
01:09:05,552 --> 01:09:08,469
Why is Kick-Ass on this list?
His crew does community service.

899
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:11,847
I don't give a shit! Anyone wearing
a mask, is getting detained.

900
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,350
We're putting an
end to this tonight!

901
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:17,978
A lot of people have said the cops
were too heavy-handed that night.

902
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:21,772
But you gotta
put it in context.

903
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:24,984
The police didn't mind our
real-life superhero stuff

904
01:09:25,276 --> 01:09:28,902
as long as we were picking up litter,
or helping old ladies cross the street.

905
01:09:30,195 --> 01:09:32,991
But suddenly, it was serious.

906
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:37,827
Suddenly we represented everything
that was wrong with society.

907
01:09:39,245 --> 01:09:43,540
Dad had warned me that the
real world had real consequences.

908
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:47,669
Once they pulled up, he must've been
feeling pretty damn vindicated.

909
01:09:49,252 --> 01:09:53,256
Shit, Dave, what have you done?

910
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:58,720
Police, open up!

911
01:10:02,096 --> 01:10:04,931
- Hey.
- Hi.

912
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:05,683
Me, Kick-Ass?

913
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:16,066
You're actually pretty
cute under that mask.

914
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:19,069
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

915
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:19,946
Don't be.

916
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:26,491
- It's my own fault.
- We're gonna find these assholes and make this right.

917
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:29,495
What's the point?

918
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:34,039
I mean we're really superheroes
but as much as we're really dating.

919
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,959
We don't even know
each other's names.

920
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:41,420
I think it's time to get
back to the real world.

921
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:45,049
I thought we were trying to
make it a better place.

922
01:10:45,673 --> 01:10:48,511
Then why is it worse?

923
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:54,515
Maybe Night Bitch was right.
Which means Dad was, too.

924
01:10:54,848 --> 01:10:58,267
I mean, things have
gone out of hand.

925
01:10:58,268 --> 01:11:02,606
Maybe it was time for me to stop crashing
at Marty's, and start apologizing.

926
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:14,739
Dad?

927
01:11:15,406 --> 01:11:17,491
- That's my Dad!
- Your dad's Kick-Ass?

928
01:11:17,492 --> 01:11:20,452
- What?
- Yeah, he just gave himself up.

929
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:25,790
You don't understand. He's
doing this to protect me. Dad!

930
01:11:26,165 --> 01:11:28,000
Dad!
What...

931
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:46,973
- Mindy? I need your help.
- Dave?

932
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,393
My dad's been arrested. They think he's
Kick-Ass. Can you talk to Marcus?

933
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:51,894
- I'm grounded.
- So?

934
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:54,105
So that means I
can't get involved.

935
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:56,148
- Okay, look.
- I wish I could help.

936
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:58,149
Mindy, are you on the phone?

937
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:02,112
- Look, I got to go, okay? I'm sorry, Dave.
- Mindy, wait, wait.

938
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:18,874
- Hey, what the hell are you thinking?
- Yeah? I can ask you the same thing.

939
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:22,335
- I can't believe you lied to them.
- I'm not supposed to do nothing while you went to jail.

940
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:25,881
I chose this. You should let me
deal with the consequences.

941
01:12:25,882 --> 01:12:30,884
- I thought you wanted me to grow up.
- Well when you get a kid of your own one day, you'll understand.

942
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:34,262
- I'mma tell them the truth.
- No, hey, it'll just make things worse. Look,

943
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:38,016
I spoke to my attorney, and he said
they gotta let me out by tomorrow.

944
01:12:38,017 --> 01:12:41,268
No actual crimes committed.

945
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:46,896
There are people out there
who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

946
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:48,983
Well, the cops are
out there looking for them.

947
01:12:48,984 --> 01:12:52,986
So the safest place for Kick-
Ass is right here, locked away.

948
01:12:52,987 --> 01:12:55,571
Dave I don't know how
you got into all this shit but,

949
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:59,825
you got to promise me that you
will never dress up in that outfit again.

950
01:12:59,826 --> 01:13:02,785
You hear me?

951
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,542
I promise.

952
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:22,301
This evil lair owns!

953
01:13:22,302 --> 01:13:26,429
- Do people still say that? "Own"?
- Yeah, of course.

954
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,974
- Your shark, something's wrong.
- I think it's the wrong kind of water.

955
01:13:29,975 --> 01:13:32,475
- What the hell, Eyal?
- It's fine, Chris.

956
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:37,062
They're supposed to lie at the bottom of the tank. It's just
their way of, how you say, settling into their environment.

957
01:13:37,063 --> 01:13:41,733
Don't screw me on this, okay? You said we'd be running
in two days, we don't even have a men's wing yet.

958
01:13:41,734 --> 01:13:43,025
Don't worry.

959
01:13:43,026 --> 01:13:46,862
- What's with the bags of shit?
- It's fertilizer for the bombs!

960
01:13:46,863 --> 01:13:49,948
You're not a supervillain if you don't
have a plan to destroy the city.

961
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:52,951
It will not work. You
need the chemical kind.

962
01:13:52,952 --> 01:13:56,161
Do I have to do everything
myself? Just fix it.

963
01:13:56,162 --> 01:13:59,916
You must relax. Everything
is going as planned.

964
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:02,958
No, no, no. Except
that it's not, okay?

965
01:14:02,959 --> 01:14:07,756
That sad sack is not Kick-Ass.
I've seen Kick-Ass, he's at my age.

966
01:14:08,089 --> 01:14:12,300
- That guy is old enough to be his father.
- No shit, right?

967
01:14:12,301 --> 01:14:14,886
I'm sorry, who are you?

968
01:14:14,887 --> 01:14:17,970
I volunteered for your army,
like the others.

969
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:21,724
Right, I appreciate that. Thanks
for joining the cause.

970
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:25,311
This is the VIP area
for the core group.

971
01:14:25,312 --> 01:14:29,564
I just thought it's funny you said that.
Because he is Kick-Ass' father.

972
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:33,152
- Who?
- Mr. Lizewski, he's Kick-Ass' dad.

973
01:14:33,444 --> 01:14:37,487
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

974
01:14:37,488 --> 01:14:40,572
- You're not telling anyone?
- No!

975
01:14:40,573 --> 01:14:45,452
But you, my friend, have just
earned lifetime access to my VIP area.

976
01:14:45,453 --> 01:14:47,912
Go take a
seat. Alright?

977
01:14:47,913 --> 01:14:52,501
Hey, get the kid a Frappuchino. Let me
put his little punk ass back to work.

978
01:14:56,546 --> 01:14:58,213
Okay.

979
01:14:58,922 --> 01:15:00,840
Come on.

980
01:15:13,268 --> 01:15:17,271
- Can I help you?
- The Motherfucker wants us to take a picture with you.

981
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,272
Helps that my dad is
a really good lawyer.

982
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:24,526
I don't think my beautiful ass would
last too long in prison.

983
01:15:24,527 --> 01:15:28,612
That's weird. Chris D'Amico
just texted me a picture.

984
01:15:28,613 --> 01:15:32,783
Red Mist? Whatever
happened to that guy?

985
01:15:38,162 --> 01:15:40,038
What is it?

986
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:42,416
Dude, what's wrong?

987
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,891
The next few days
passed in a fog.

988
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:09,730
It didn't matter that I told
the police about Chris.

989
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,982
They couldn't find him.

990
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:16,109
The cops did show up
at dad's funeral.

991
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:20,239
Not out of respect, but because they
were scared that something would happen.

992
01:16:21,197 --> 01:16:23,573
My dad was a decent man.

993
01:16:23,574 --> 01:16:27,452
All he ever did was
try and give me a good life.

994
01:16:27,453 --> 01:16:30,412
And I told him no one would
notice when he was gone.

995
01:16:30,413 --> 01:16:32,958
I love you, pal.

996
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:36,043
I love you too, Dad.

997
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:43,965
You guys came.

998
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,717
We would love to help you track
down this Chris D'Amico d-bag, but,

999
01:16:47,718 --> 01:16:50,219
we just got out on parole.

1000
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:54,349
No, it's fine. I'm not
looking for revenge.

1001
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:58,060
The last thing I promised my dad,
was that I was gonna give this up.

1002
01:16:58,061 --> 01:17:00,728
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1003
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:03,106
But you started this.

1004
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:05,984
And now I'm ending it.

1005
01:17:13,616 --> 01:17:15,741
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1006
01:17:15,742 --> 01:17:18,117
Do you hate me for not helping?

1007
01:17:18,118 --> 01:17:22,455
No, not even a little bit.
You were right.

1008
01:17:22,456 --> 01:17:24,706
You gave it up.

1009
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:29,378
If I had too, my dad
would still be alive.

1010
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:33,465
The only person I
blame is myself.

1011
01:17:47,768 --> 01:17:49,644
That's him!

1012
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:53,856
Get down!

1013
01:17:57,025 --> 01:17:57,776
Mindy!

1014
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:15,457
- Over here!
- Dave!

1015
01:18:22,587 --> 01:18:24,130
Come on!

1016
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:25,757
Oh my God!

1017
01:18:29,594 --> 01:18:31,261
Get him!

1018
01:18:31,262 --> 01:18:34,389
Get that car over here.

1019
01:18:39,435 --> 01:18:41,186
Mindy!

1020
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,603
Mindy!

1021
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:52,987
Mindy!

1022
01:18:58,993 --> 01:19:01,536
You're gonna put this on.

1023
01:19:05,831 --> 01:19:06,707
I'm not gonna do it.

1024
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:12,629
There's nothing that you
can do to hurt me.

1025
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,965
You wanna bet?

1026
01:19:22,178 --> 01:19:25,723
Game on, cocksuckers.

1027
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:29,976
There's a girl on the roof!

1028
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,239
She's still up there!

1029
01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:04,504
- I think I got her.
- Go check!

1030
01:20:13,304 --> 01:20:16,264
Get out there!

1031
01:21:00,716 --> 01:21:03,969
Pull over, pukeface.

1032
01:21:06,597 --> 01:21:09,681
We know Chris D'Amico's The
Motherfucker. Where is he hiding?

1033
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:11,974
- Eat a dick!
- You're gonna eat yours if you don't start talking.

1034
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:14,227
Go ahead and shoot me,
you little bitch.

1035
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:17,562
There's nothing you can
do that'll make me talk.

1036
01:21:17,563 --> 01:21:22,024
Hold on. I can't do this right
now. It's my dad's funeral.

1037
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:25,237
Dave, your father loved you.

1038
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:29,907
Just like my daddy loved me.
And I know it hurts.

1039
01:21:30,116 --> 01:21:34,994
But maybe-maybe that's the
real meaning of being a superhero.

1040
01:21:35,328 --> 01:21:39,582
It's taking that pain and turning
it into something good.

1041
01:21:39,874 --> 01:21:42,334
Something right.

1042
01:21:42,335 --> 01:21:45,210
Remember what you told me?

1043
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,506
"This is your life.
You got to live it."

1044
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:54,759
Now help me find some pliers.
I'm gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1045
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,636
Seriously?

1046
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:00,431
- Hello?
- Marcus?

1047
01:22:00,432 --> 01:22:02,933
Mindy, what's going on?
Are you okay?

1048
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:05,977
I'm fine. We know where
The Motherfucker's hiding.

1049
01:22:05,978 --> 01:22:09,021
He recruiting an army of supervillains
and making homemade bombs.

1050
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:10,815
Marcus, he wants to
burn the city down.

1051
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:15,025
- You promised me.
- I know you see me as this little girl.

1052
01:22:15,026 --> 01:22:17,778
But I'm not, and I never was.

1053
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:21,239
You're right. Daddy did
take my childhood away.

1054
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,408
But I'm not so sure
that was a bad thing.

1055
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:28,328
Marcus, he gave me a gift. A gift that
I can't escape no matter how hard I try.

1056
01:22:28,329 --> 01:22:32,749
Allow me to spend the next four years
of my life trying to figure out who I am.

1057
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:35,544
Because I already know.

1058
01:22:37,628 --> 01:22:38,379
I'm Hit-Girl.

1059
01:22:40,006 --> 01:22:43,884
(updating status)

1060
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:48,970
Posted the address. You think
they'll show? Chris has an army.

1061
01:22:48,971 --> 01:22:53,809
These real-life superdweebs have been waiting
their whole lives for a call like this.

1062
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:07,361
- You okay?
- Wha-Yeah. No, I'm-I'm fine.

1063
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:10,739
Here, take this.

1064
01:23:11,072 --> 01:23:13,490
Last resort really
isn't my style.

1065
01:23:13,491 --> 01:23:16,201
Dave, this isn't a comic book.

1066
01:23:16,202 --> 01:23:21,080
Real people are gonna die tonight.
My Daddy was prepared for anything.

1067
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:23,666
Are you?

1068
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:28,953
Yeah.

1069
01:23:31,088 --> 01:23:31,870
I am.

1070
01:23:40,805 --> 01:23:43,473
They should be back by now.

1071
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:47,602
It's definitely dead. It says on the internet,
you're supposed keep it on freshwater.

1072
01:23:47,603 --> 01:23:52,523
It is just hungry.
We must feed it.

1073
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,940
Why are you looking at me?

1074
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:57,444
Oh, we gotta get
this shit started!

1075
01:23:58,987 --> 01:24:02,323
Have I got a show
for you, bitches!

1076
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:06,242
(Motherfucker!)

1077
01:24:10,455 --> 01:24:15,499
Alright, party people!
We are gonna kill Kick-Ass,

1078
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:19,252
the very first superhero.
Together.

1079
01:24:19,253 --> 01:24:24,506
We are gonna cut him up into little
pieces and feed that shit to MC Shark,

1080
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:28,761
and post it all over YouTube.
For reals!

1081
01:24:29,804 --> 01:24:32,388
- He's kidding, right?
- Motherfucker don't kid.

1082
01:24:32,389 --> 01:24:38,726
That's not it. I'm gonna give each and every
one of you, party favor fertilizer bombs.

1083
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:42,146
And we are gonna get our riot on!
That's what it means to be evil.

1084
01:24:42,147 --> 01:24:45,439
We, my friends, are
the real one percent.

1085
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,193
And tonight we're gonna fuck
this city up, or my name is not...

1086
01:24:49,194 --> 01:24:52,614
Chris D'Amico!

1087
01:24:52,947 --> 01:24:55,406
That is not my name!

1088
01:24:57,075 --> 01:24:59,159
No, you're right.

1089
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,872
Your new name's Little Bitch.

1090
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:07,543
Oh, this is perfect.

1091
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:10,669
Are you really that stupid?

1092
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:16,091
There's two of you, and
a whole army of us.

1093
01:25:17,049 --> 01:25:20,678
Do you really have
such a hard-on to die?

1094
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:24,807
No, that's why we
brought our friends.

1095
01:25:55,749 --> 01:25:59,250
What's the matter, Chris?
Shit hit your shorts?

1096
01:25:59,251 --> 01:26:03,880
Yeah. And I'm gonna wipe
my ass with your face.

1097
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,509
You're gonna pay for what
you did to my dad.

1098
01:26:08,801 --> 01:26:10,384
Your dad?

1099
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:13,887
You blew up my dad
with a bazooka!

1100
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:48,624
Are you ready to
die, little girl?

1101
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:53,420
I might be, if I have to keep looking
at that shit stain you call a face.

1102
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:03,749
Hold him down! I want to see
what his guts look like.

1103
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:11,129
That's enough from you boys.

1104
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:15,675
Nicely done, sweetheart.

1105
01:28:23,973 --> 01:28:25,015
That all you got?

1106
01:28:25,016 --> 01:28:27,851
No, I got my lethal
Zero-G device.

1107
01:28:27,852 --> 01:28:30,145
Bullshit.

1108
01:28:30,811 --> 01:28:33,230
No shit.

1109
01:28:48,243 --> 01:28:49,869
Are you okay?

1110
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:54,456
Yeah, thanks.
"Ass-kicker".

1111
01:28:56,416 --> 01:28:58,543
Nice.

1112
01:30:04,575 --> 01:30:07,244
Jesus, you're such a pussy.

1113
01:30:07,245 --> 01:30:11,123
What is the point of wearing a mask
if you can't do what you want?

1114
01:30:16,669 --> 01:30:18,671
I wanted to do good.

1115
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:21,923
No, people want
to win the lottery.

1116
01:30:21,924 --> 01:30:25,342
People want, to fuck
Scarlett Johansson.

1117
01:30:35,309 --> 01:30:40,021
You think you can kill
me, with little needle?

1118
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:01,163
That's not what it's for.

1119
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:06,586
It's called adrenaline, bitch.

1120
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:09,128
What was that?
A cheap shot?

1121
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:12,172
That, was for the colonel.

1122
01:31:17,636 --> 01:31:20,178
That's for Night Bitch.

1123
01:31:26,684 --> 01:31:29,645
And that's for my dad.

1124
01:31:59,128 --> 01:32:00,066
(speaking Russian)

1125
01:32:04,257 --> 01:32:08,718
- What the hell are you doing?
- Saving your whiny ass.

1126
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,763
No, I won't let you foul this.
I'd rather die!

1127
01:32:12,764 --> 01:32:17,225
What is wrong with you, dude?
This is not a comic book, it's real-life!

1128
01:32:17,226 --> 01:32:20,728
When you're dead, it's done!
There's no sequel.

1129
01:32:20,729 --> 01:32:25,731
You made this real. You started
it! Now I'm gonna finish it.

1130
01:32:25,732 --> 01:32:30,111
I'll be immortal,
like an evil Jesus.

1131
01:32:39,535 --> 01:32:41,621
Wait!

1132
01:32:55,464 --> 01:32:58,676
Dave! I'm
so sorry.

1133
01:33:06,182 --> 01:33:08,974
The feeling was, indescribable.

1134
01:33:08,975 --> 01:33:11,812
Chris D'Amico, dead.

1135
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:15,731
His wanna-be supervillains,
defeated.

1136
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:20,527
But did we make the
world a better place?

1137
01:33:21,069 --> 01:33:26,657
Or did we just finish something that began,
when I first put on this mask?

1138
01:33:28,534 --> 01:33:31,118
The cops are coming.

1139
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:35,832
They'll take care of the bad guys.
We better skedaddle before they get here.

1140
01:33:36,957 --> 01:33:38,499
- We did it.
- Fuck, yeah.

1141
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,750
Hey, language.

1142
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:46,214
You're right. If we're gonna dress like
heroes, we should act like heroes.

1143
01:33:46,215 --> 01:33:48,508
He'd be proud of you, Dave.

1144
01:33:49,258 --> 01:33:51,636
He'd be proud of all of us.

1145
01:33:53,054 --> 01:33:56,014
You know we can never
do this again, right?

1146
01:33:57,975 --> 01:33:59,934
It's over.

1147
01:34:02,686 --> 01:34:05,647
One last time.

1148
01:34:08,692 --> 01:34:11,109
What do you say,
Hit-Girl?

1149
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,986
You in?

1150
01:34:13,653 --> 01:34:14,654
Why the hell not?

1151
01:34:17,657 --> 01:34:20,741
Justice Forever!

1152
01:34:32,293 --> 01:34:36,338
Thanks for the ride.
I'll see you at school.

1153
01:34:38,299 --> 01:34:41,091
I'm leaving New York, Dave.

1154
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:45,345
I can't go home. I can't put
Marcus in that position.

1155
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,473
Why, he won't arrest you.
You've just saved the city.

1156
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:50,975
Yeah, well, I also killed 6
guys with a cop's gun.

1157
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:54,269
Vigilantes don't
get a free pass.

1158
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,937
You can't go.

1159
01:34:56,938 --> 01:35:02,651
- People need you.
- They've got you now.

1160
01:35:03,277 --> 01:35:05,111
I'm not like you.

1161
01:35:05,112 --> 01:35:09,324
You don't have to be a badass
to be a superhero, Dave.

1162
01:35:10,576 --> 01:35:13,493
You just have to be brave.

1163
01:35:25,003 --> 01:35:27,255
What was that?

1164
01:35:28,798 --> 01:35:31,842
That was my first kiss.

1165
01:35:32,635 --> 01:35:36,429
Be nice or I'll rip your ass
out through your mouth.

1166
01:35:43,061 --> 01:35:45,143
When Mindy left,

1167
01:35:45,144 --> 01:35:48,689
that's when I finally understood
where my life was going.

1168
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:52,232
Just like it had to
eventually happen.

1169
01:35:52,233 --> 01:35:56,069
When real people try
to be superheroes,

1170
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:59,406
eventually, it had to end, too.

1171
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:18,755
Superheroes can't exist in
the real world for a reason.

1172
01:36:19,047 --> 01:36:23,841
It's because the real world,
needs real heroes.

1173
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:27,137
And not some punk in a
wetsuit playing dress-up.

1174
01:36:27,638 --> 01:36:30,222
But a genuine badass...

1175
01:36:30,224 --> 01:36:33,351
Who can really kick ass.

1176
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:22,627
No! Please.

1177
01:42:22,628 --> 01:42:24,396
Don't go!

1178
01:42:24,397 --> 01:42:27,146
Don't go!

1179
01:42:27,402 --> 01:42:30,070
Is anybody there?

1180
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,142
Hello?

1181
01:42:38,476 --> 01:42:40,598
Some help, please!

1182
01:42:40,599 --> 01:42:44,804
A shark bit my fucking dick off,
