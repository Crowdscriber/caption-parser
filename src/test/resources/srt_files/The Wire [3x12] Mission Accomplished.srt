1
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,072
- Who's got the scene?
- Massey and Crutchfield are working it.

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,079
Norris is on his way to the morgue.
He'll beat the bodies there.

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,876
- How about the crime lab?
- Can he get enough oxygen here?

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,951
He's getting the full treatment, boss.

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,713
We're good there.

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,315
Just one witness so far.

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:29,328
And you know what that means.
Right now, it's all BNBG.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,487
It's Andy Kraw's big adventure.

9
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,329
Mayor's office already called twice,
worried sick about the man.

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,800
You're kidding me.

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,071
That's a whole lot
of campaign contributions...

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,662
sitting on the back of that ambo.

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:45,905
- So, what's the scene say?
- Two shooters. Shotgun, semi-auto.

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,841
One vic is a West Side soldier
with a pretty healthy sheet.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,886
The other is a major player
in Daniels' wiretap case.

16
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,921
So, a hit. Drug related.

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,384
But a big-time developer in the middle?
What's the fit?

18
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,824
Second vic, Russell Bell.

19
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,319
Owner and co-developer of this here.

20
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,165
And other downtown real estate.

21
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,261
Well-propertied man he was.

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,469
But you were aware that Russell Bell was
regarded as a major narcotic violator?

23
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,609
How do you think he made his money?

24
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,215
I didn't inquire.

25
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,682
So, you never got a look
at either of the gunmen?

26
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,481
I told you, I saw only the one of them.

27
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,446
He was black, big, I thought...

28
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,422
with a large weapon.

29
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,523
BNBG.

30
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,504
Big negro, big gun.

31
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,120
Two more like it upstairs.

32
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,054
Yeah.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,162
Have ballistics rush comparisons.
Drug-relateds for the last six months.

34
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,232
I caught him, Bunk.

35
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,272
On the wire. I caught him.

36
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,715
And he doesn't fucking know it.

37
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,318
Boxing, yeah.

38
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:28,924
I know you loved that. I hated it.

39
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:30,861
I hated watching it.

40
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:34,159
Yeah, I know you did.
So you're doing good, huh?

41
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:40,067
- Day to day, I am.
- Because I was thinking, <i>maybe...</i>

42
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:50,041
I'm proud of you, Dennis. Be well.

43
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,824
Shut that fucking door.

44
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,268
Man, fuck it.

45
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:22,778
Whatever, I'm ready for this shit.
These niggas is snapping on us.

46
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,315
You see? Do you believe this fucking shit?

47
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:29,049
Some shit like this would've
never happened <i>with...</i>

48
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:33,818
Yo, Slim, man. Just say the word.
Say the motherfucking word.

49
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,625
Shit is on.

50
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,602
What's up, B?

51
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,481
You all right?

52
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,845
We gonna bounce back
on the motherfucker, no question.

53
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,717
- Bounce it back on who?
- Marlo, boss.

54
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:08,486
- Oh, he gonna fall.
- Marlo. Marlo ain't got shit to do with it.

55
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:12,529
Marlo couldn't get String like that.
String died 'cause of some other shit.

56
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,357
What?

57
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,731
He died because of some other shit, nigga.

58
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,999
I couldn't fix it. I tried.

59
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,032
That nigga, String,
was right about this shit, man.

60
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:29,139
That nigga was right. Fuck Marlo.

61
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,272
Fuck this fucking war.

62
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,477
All this beef over
a couple of fucking corners.

63
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,754
Don't matter who did what to who
at this point.

64
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:42,349
Fact is, we went to war,
and now there ain't no going back.

65
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:45,855
I mean, shit, it's what war is, you know?

66
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:49,290
Once you in it, you in it!

67
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,299
If it's a lie, then we fight on that lie.

68
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,396
But we gotta fight.

69
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,576
Got this out of his pocket.

70
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,187
I got no idea.

71
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,918
- It's a cell chip from a phone.
- Oh.

72
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,759
- What else did you get off him?
- $200 cash, set of keys, license.

73
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,798
President Street address?

74
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,959
I got Landsman banging out
a warrant for the place.

75
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,300
Fuck the politics for a minute.

76
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,269
- What if the man happens to be right?
- Legalizing drugs?

77
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:37,109
Crime is down in his district and people
on that side of town, they're okay with it.

78
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,877
Look, if you don't exist,
what happens here?

79
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,852
If there's no Tommy Carcetti in this thing,
what's likely to happen?

80
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:45,013
The Mayor and Burrell,
they shut this thing down.

81
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:48,217
I figure the Mayor's trying to find a way
to shut it down to make it look like...

82
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,726
it was an enforcement plan
in case it goes public.

83
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,730
Otherwise he'd have moved
to end it already.

84
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,065
Makes sense, but no matter what...

85
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,295
Colvin's little experiment is finished.

86
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,499
Come on, Tommy.

87
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,402
They dealt you a winning hand and
you're acting like you forgot how to play.

88
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:13,343
Mr. Mayor, call it legalization
and my office can't live with it.

89
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,248
Agreed. No one can.

90
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:16,377
But harm reduction?

91
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:19,252
That could sell, provided there's
a reduction in the crime rate.

92
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,990
Harm reduction. Sounds good.

93
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,086
Steven, what if we were able to suggest...

94
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:28,097
limiting our street-level enforcement?

95
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:32,067
We were concentrating our resources
on high-level traffickers.

96
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,194
How would that play?

97
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,898
Well, if I could show off
that kind of casework, yeah, maybe.

98
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,807
But they've been doing street rips for so
long now, I don't think a high-level exists.

99
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,778
What if we were able to say
that no major traffickers were allowed...

100
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,974
in the free zone, that all <i>major...</i>

101
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:49,579
That the major violators were
still being targeted, huh?

102
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,918
Well, are you suggesting some kind
of admissions criteria for the zones?

103
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:54,855
- How would that work?
- I don't know that it would.

104
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,484
I'm just saying that for the sake
of public perception, huh?

105
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,722
Come on, people,
work with me on this thing!

106
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,657
<i>Fucked up, ain't it?</i>

107
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:04,234
<i>Marlo need to get his ass dropped,</i>
<i>him and all his crew.</i>

108
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:07,827
<i>- Oh, they gonna fall, son. You'll see.</i>
<i>- All right, let me know.</i>

109
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:10,767
That's the word on the wire anyway.

110
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,673
Every mention puts it
on Marlo Stanfield's crew...

111
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,269
which means the war's gonna ratchet up,
no question.

112
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,373
Where's Jimmy?

113
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,782
He went with Bunk Moreland to rifle
Stringer's spot downtown.

114
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,919
- How'd he take it?
- Like Stringer was kin.

115
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,553
- Yeah?
<i>- Bushy top.</i>

116
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,557
<i>- Need to pull on your coat, boy.</i>
- Hey, what's up, Major?

117
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,025
<i>I got something for you all.</i>

118
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,361
<i>Mount Vernon Square in about an hour.</i>

119
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:37,526
I'm there.

120
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:04,625
This is Stringer's?

121
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,356
Yeah.

122
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:37,684
Who in fuck was I chasing?

123
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:07,255
What's done is done.

124
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,571
Gay-ass gangsters. Please.

125
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,445
I took it for as long as I could.

126
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,853
Let's go, man.

127
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:44,852
Let's go.

128
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:07,817
It being your town,
I trust you to do it proper.

129
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,561
- You off today, boss?
- Every day at this point.

130
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,862
I told them over at COMSTAT
about my little experiment.

131
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,572
Bosses went crazy, huh?

132
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,806
Anyway, that's why I called you.

133
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:35,306
That there is a wartime lay-up
for your man Barksdale.

134
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,780
My sources tell me the man's there
most of the time with a lot of muscle.

135
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:41,443
Sawed-offs, semi-autos, MAC-11s.

136
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,878
Whole lot of good shit if you hit it right.

137
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,489
- That's a hell of a tip.
- Shit.

138
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,756
That right there might be the last bit
of police work in a long and storied career.

139
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:55,389
All right, I'll talk to you, bushy top.

140
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:03,963
Which one is Ali?

141
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,804
In the white trunks, boy.

142
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,775
- Damn, he look young.
- He was. This the Patterson fight right here!

143
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:13,976
- Old school.
- Who Patterson? He soft.

144
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,714
- Ali whipping his ass.
- He was a champ, too.

145
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:22,255
Look, any man still standing at the end
of a round, you can't call him soft.

146
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,521
That's a rule, all right?

147
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,897
From Stringer's place downtown.

148
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:35,632
B&B shit, college papers, real estate stuff.

149
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,732
There's no phone extension in the place,
just these.

150
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,471
Cell phone chips. About 100 of them.

151
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,611
So that's why he wasn't taking any phones
from our man, Bernard, huh?

152
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,876
Stringer had his own phone...

153
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,042
he just changed the number
every time he changed the chip.

154
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,677
Shamrock, too, probably,
with whatever phone he used to call Bell.

155
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,085
Cautious man.

156
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,184
- Yes and no.
- Have a look in here.

157
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,285
All different manufacturers.

158
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:00,488
Thank you.

159
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:07,364
Before Stringer Bell got aced...

160
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,167
he went out of his way to put in
his good friend, Avon Barksdale.

161
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,568
That's a Barksdale safe house.

162
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,213
Where'd you get this?

163
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:22,916
Colvin.

164
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:26,880
- Calls to the Western.
- Where's Daniels?

165
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,419
He's got this thing downtown.
It's for his wife.

166
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:31,756
You should raise him.

167
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:36,365
It's not enough to make up for Stringer.

168
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,164
It'll do for now.

169
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,870
<i>Because the neighborhoods</i>
<i>and the residents in this district...</i>

170
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,136
<i>are among the poorest in our city.</i>

171
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:50,874
<i>And it is these residents</i>
<i>who most need a strong voice at City Hall.</i>

172
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,011
<i>Time has come for a change.</i>

173
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:56,182
<i>And I believe</i>
<i>I can bring about that change...</i>

174
00:15:56,454 --> 00:16:00,413
<i>by providing a strong voice</i>
<i>for the new 11th District...</i>

175
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,720
<i>if you will do me the honor...</i>

176
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,955
It's kind of cool, the Lieutenant's wife
running for office, you know.

177
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,626
<i>Well, as you just heard...</i>

178
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,497
<i>West Baltimore City Councilwoman</i>
<i>Eunetta Perkins...</i>

179
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:15,094
<i>is going to have her hands full</i>
<i>in next September's Democratic primary.</i>

180
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,269
Stringer Bell. Damn.

181
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:23,705
Who could've gotten to him?
I mean, if it wasn't you all on it.

182
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,076
You know Avon's gonna put it
on you, right?

183
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:29,812
Shit, let him take it on my jacket.
Don't make me no never mind.

184
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:33,082
I'm thinking it might be what you call
one of them good problems.

185
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,151
Yeah.

186
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,596
I heard Colvin's in deep shit downtown.

187
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:45,760
Looking at this right here...

188
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,603
he might not be the only one.

189
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,933
Anything comes up, I'm on the radio.

190
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:55,979
My man, my man, my man.

191
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,846
Yo, you think I could get like $5?
I need like $5 to get on the bus.

192
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,442
- I look like a tourist to you?
- Man, I swear to God.

193
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,078
Looking like that,
walking into an open-air drug market...

194
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,215
why the hell would I think you'll spend
my $5 on bus fare?

195
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,757
Shit, because I already got my blast, man.

196
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:09,512
All night, you been drinking
like your ass is candy.

197
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,151
That's shameful shit.

198
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,488
Twelve-gauge pumpkin balls.

199
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:27,199
Last time I saw that kind of load was
the Pimlico double.

200
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:31,638
And I fucking know that motherfucker was
in the middle of that mess.

201
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:37,476
And if I remember your boy,
he had no love for the Barksdale people.

202
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,517
Execution style,
that don't play like Omar Little.

203
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:45,618
Besides, the word on our wire is
that Marlo's people did Stringer.

204
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:48,748
- Marlo Stanfield?
- The heir apparent.

205
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,858
This city's going to hell, man.

206
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:56,033
We're gonna push past 300 murders
before New Year's.

207
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,365
Shit is fucked.

208
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,271
Hey, Cheryl.

209
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:09,643
No? My guess is she's picking up
a prisoner.

210
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,874
Yeah, I spoke to her about 10 minutes ago.

211
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,674
Yeah, well, they don't <i>allow...</i>
They make you check your stuff.

212
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,149
Cell phone, money, weapon.

213
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:21,183
Well, she'll call when she gets the message.

214
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:23,287
Not at all.

215
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,419
I need more, Jimmy.

216
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,574
More!

217
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:48,447
- Motherfucker.
- I'm tired, Bunk.

218
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,427
Let's go.

219
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,824
I heard the vanguard met.

220
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:07,733
Heard they voted to have
a civilian review board look at it.

221
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:11,638
It wasn't unanimous, and there were
people there speaking for you.

222
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,141
I heard that, too.

223
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:18,907
So six out of 10 black officers think
I'm just an asshole racist.

224
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:24,052
On the other hand,
four out of 10 think you're just an asshole.

225
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,589
It's an administrative charge.

226
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,990
You can fight it and win if you want.

227
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:36,999
Failure to properly identify myself
as a police officer.

228
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:41,470
Sounds like what I was guilty of
most of my career, actually.

229
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,035
I'm not sure I was supposed to be a police.

230
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:49,941
Not really.

231
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,043
What were you supposed to be, huh?

232
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:05,188
This is from Major Colvin's CI?
What's the corroboration?

233
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,121
Well, the source knew that Barksdale had
a waterfront condo in his own name.

234
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:12,896
Gave the accurate location and title info
down to deed of transfer.

235
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,396
Well, that's good, but it puts him
on the legitimate side of things.

236
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,268
What corroboration is there
for illegal activities?

237
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,103
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop in at a friend.

238
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:26,479
The source knew that Barksdale was shot
last month, wounded in the shoulder.

239
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:29,553
- Emergency room?
- No, no hospital reports.

240
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,413
We're gonna need better.

241
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:34,821
Either Colvin goes back to the CI,
or we sit on this address for a while.

242
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:37,655
- See what we can see.
- Well, fuck it then.

243
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,821
Let's name the source.
Put him right in the affidavit.

244
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,091
- It's Colvin's call, isn't it?
- It's Stringer Bell.

245
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,794
Lester figured it out from the DNRs.

246
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,531
Bell was snitching out Barksdale.

247
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:52,542
- You're sure of this?
- Maybe that explains the murder.

248
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:53,769
What's in the wire?

249
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:58,145
Loose talk about how it was
Marlo's people, but nothing past rumor.

250
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:59,238
You know, with Bell gone...

251
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,319
Barksdale might have to come down
a notch to oversee the day-to-day...

252
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,911
and maybe that puts him in contact
with some of our monitored cell phones.

253
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,691
If he's as cautious as Stringer, maybe not.

254
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,227
My guess is Barksdale never touches
a cell phone.

255
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,628
Safe house might be our best shot.

256
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,228
All right.

257
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,095
We stay on the wires
until this batch of burners...

258
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:22,297
goes dead, hoping we have Barksdale.

259
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:25,738
But meanwhile, we get a warrant
for that safe house and wait on him there.

260
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,751
Thanks for the cover last night.

261
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,290
This is Greggs, Major Case Unit.
Who's the shift leader?

262
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:19,759
Holy Christ.

263
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:36,980
<i>- They're all over it, Commissioner.</i>
- Right.

264
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,687
That was Foxtrot.
The cameras have found our little shit pile.

265
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:46,813
Finally, your fucking councilman took
his sweet time, didn't he?

266
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,793
Everyone's a critic.

267
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:53,689
If this doesn't go,
what line of work are you gonna try next?

268
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,524
We're here in West <i>Baltimore...</i>

269
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,766
<i>For more than a month,</i>
<i>police from Baltimore's Western district...</i>

270
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,479
<i>It's just an outrageous development.</i>

271
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:17,918
<i>It's something I never thought I'd see</i>
<i>from this or any other administration.</i>

272
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:21,252
<i>Frankly, this is one of the reasons we need</i>
<i>a change in leadership in this city.</i>

273
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,383
Did the Mayor know?
What about the Police Commissioner?

274
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,758
These are questions
for the Mayor and the Police Commissioner.

275
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:27,626
On central issues
of crime and safety...

276
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:29,460
<i>the Royce administration is</i>
<i>simply bankrupt.</i>

277
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:31,295
You still gonna announce
for mayor next month?

278
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,766
I was gonna wait,
but standing here today looking at this...

279
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:36,704
<i>I can't see how I can do anything else</i>
<i>but put it out there right now.</i>

280
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,207
<i>All I can tell you is</i>
<i>that for more than four weeks now...</i>

281
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,244
<i>the Baltimore Police Department</i>
<i>surrendered portions...</i>

282
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:44,576
<i>of the police district to the drug trade,</i>
<i>and the Council was not informed.</i>

283
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:45,706
Fuck me.

284
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:49,279
I fucking had this story all
to myself a week ago.

285
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,386
<i>Police officers for weeks have turned</i>
<i>a blind eye...</i>

286
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:54,684
What the fuck was I thinking?

287
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:58,320
<i>... apparently sanctioning</i>
<i>open-air drug markets.</i>

288
00:24:58,696 --> 00:24:59,993
- Excuse us.
<i>- While uniformed police stood by...</i>

289
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:04,600
<i>... in the so-called free zones,</i>
<i>drug dealers routinely ply their trade.</i>

290
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,003
Mr. Mayor, Commissioner Burrell is here.

291
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,766
Tell the Commissioner
the Mayor will be with him shortly.

292
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,273
<i>... and young children run the streets alone.</i>

293
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:16,378
<i>The inhabitants of what has come</i>
<i>to be known as Hamsterdam...</i>

294
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,471
<i>had little to say for the camera.</i>

295
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:20,812
<i>But Channel 5 has learned</i>
<i>that the police were...</i>

296
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,951
- Yeah?
<i>- What are you seeing?</i>

297
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:28,081
Couple of people in and out.
No sign of Barksdale, though.

298
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,319
<i>- It's quiet here, too.</i>
- Okay.

299
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:32,726
Need to look at the back.

300
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,031
Our friend Carcetti's gonna run wild
with this.

301
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,798
And from the sound of things,
Gray is gonna run with him.

302
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:42,895
Tony Gray thinks he's gonna get my chair
behind this bullshit.

303
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,973
We're throwing you out of the boat, Ervin.
This shit is on you alone.

304
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:51,371
Not necessarily.

305
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:55,179
Not if I talk about how we were
under pressure to keep the crime down.

306
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:58,777
- To juke the stats district by district.
- We never said that.

307
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:01,858
About how Colvin, under pressure,
lost his way.

308
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,655
- About how I came to you weeks ago...
- Days ago.

309
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,959
Weeks ago to tell you what he had done
and to assure you that...

310
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:11,330
we were on top of the situation,
that Colvin would be relieved...

311
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:12,925
and his plan aborted.

312
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,766
You lying motherfucker.

313
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,841
But you heard about the drop
in Colvin's felony rate...

314
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,869
and you sent me packing.

315
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:24,977
Brought in your liberal-ass do-gooders
to seriously consider this horseshit...

316
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:28,514
while Colvin's mistake grew and grew.

317
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:31,678
My hands were tied, Mr. Mayor.

318
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:34,257
My department thwarted.

319
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:38,323
I was a prisoner
of the goddamn politicians.

320
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:40,021
Or...

321
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:48,430
I leave your office right now
willing to say a lot less than that.

322
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:51,766
I put what I can on crazy-ass Bunny Colvin.

323
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,601
And I take the hit.

324
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,441
And if Carcetti or Gray holds hearings...

325
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:01,542
I'm the wall between them and you.

326
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,616
In which case...

327
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:08,184
I am your commissioner
for the full five-year term.

328
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:22,862
- Unit one to unit two.
- Unit two standing by.

329
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:24,267
Deal's made.

330
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:30,345
Unit two to sector three,
move on the Winchester Homes.

331
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:32,142
<i>Ten-four. We're moving.</i>

332
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:35,683
Unit two to sector two,
move on the Koppers Plant.

333
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,048
<i>Roger that.</i>

334
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,025
Over the top, gentlemen.

335
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:04,908
About fucking time.

336
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,720
Yo, man.

337
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:18,886
We gonna run out if we don't got no re-up.

338
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:21,396
- Where's Tuckie at?
- I don't know.

339
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:27,996
- Yo, where Tuckie at, man?
- He rolled out.

340
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,902
- What?
- He said the police coming.

341
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:37,541
Here they come. Let's roll.

342
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,295
Hold it right there, white jacket!

343
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,198
Get the fuck off me!

344
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:00,436
Stop!

345
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,177
Stop right there! Stop!

346
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:25,417
Freeze! Freeze! Don't move!
Hold it right there. Freeze.

347
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:31,434
<i>Outstanding, red team, outstanding.</i>
<i>Give you a case of beer for that one.</i>

348
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:56,389
Son, this nigga, Stringer Bell, man,
was begging Chris, yo, for real.

349
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,686
Like, know what I mean?

350
00:29:57,794 --> 00:30:01,195
Digging in his pockets, talking about
how much cheese he gonna give us...

351
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,163
I mean, if we just let him walk.

352
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,361
My man, Chris, hollering,
"Man, bitch, you gonna die."

353
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,099
This nigga just dropped to his fucking
knees like a little cocksucker, man.

354
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:11,408
Start crying.
That shit was worse than fucking pathetic.

355
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:13,501
Start crying.
That shit was worse than fucking pathetic.

356
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:19,905
- Yo, that's Marlo.
- Get on your burner, man.

357
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:30,118
<i>- Got a line on him.</i>
<i>- The number one? Where at?</i>

358
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:33,526
<i>Tall man says to tell you all to soldier up.</i>
<i>They up at the rim shop.</i>

359
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,597
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

360
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,132
Boss, you okay?

361
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:42,597
- What you want?
- Slim said they got their eye on Marlo.

362
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:47,869
I'm just saying, you know, all the boys,
they all waiting on you.

363
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:52,144
Go ahead, man. I'm behind you.

364
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:17,204
What else you need from us, Deputy?

365
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:19,434
City Hall wants the bulldozers
through here at dawn...

366
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,408
and then fencing all around the site.

367
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:24,002
Winchester Homes
and the Koppers Plant as well.

368
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:25,610
We got it.

369
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:31,583
Come tomorrow, the television reporters
get nothing they can stand in front of.

370
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,420
Excuse me, Deputy, sir, we found a body.

371
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:49,933
- Any trauma?
- Can't tell for sure with all the rat bites.

372
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:53,107
Take him to the OCME in a jail wagon.

373
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,077
I don't want the fucking reporters seeing
any ambos.

374
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,442
Shit!

375
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,027
He just landed.

376
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:12,095
<i>Him plus one.</i>

377
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:15,529
- Got it. Sit tight.
- That makes how many?

378
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:21,335
Including Barksdale, Sydnor counted
10 in and none coming out...

379
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:22,871
so that's 10 at least.

380
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:31,078
- 2301 to KGA.
<i>- Go ahead, 2301.</i>

381
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:35,516
We need QRT to meet us at our 20
for a search and seizure.

382
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:39,111
Location has multiple suspects
and may contain automatic weapons.

383
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:40,620
<i>Ten-four.</i>

384
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:52,829
- Word travels fast, huh?
- Shit.

385
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:57,835
Burrell called Johns Hopkins personally
this morning.

386
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:05,379
Dragged your name into the gutter.
Johns Hopkins doesn't need the notoriety.

387
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:08,645
The chief academic officer
of a major research university...

388
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:12,347
doesn't want to hear that some new hire
makes up the rules as he goes along.

389
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:21,422
- Yeah, Colvin.
<i>- Yeah, Major, you're on first.</i>

390
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:27,501
COMSTAT tomorrow.

391
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,268
I'm up.

392
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:44,143
- You all taking the door?
- Where's tactical?

393
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:47,682
- I called for QRT.
- You ain't heard?

394
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,851
They're a little busy tonight tearing down
Bunny Colvin's fuck-up.

395
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,794
With all that going on,
you're lucky you even got us, man.

396
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:56,889
- Who we hitting on this?
- Avon Barksdale and crew.

397
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,201
I fucking told you he was out.
Didn't I fucking tell you?

398
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:02,603
I fucking told her.

399
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:05,402
<i>For more than four weeks now,</i>
<i>the Baltimore Police Department...</i>

400
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,000
<i>surrendered portions of the police district</i>
<i>to the drug trade.</i>

401
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:11,171
By tomorrow, the story goes national,
and Washington reacts.

402
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:15,347
Save the best questions for Tony Gray.

403
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:17,644
He needs to shine even more than you.

404
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:31,264
- I can't believe he wants us to knock.
- Well, you can't flush guns now, can you?

405
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:32,995
Well, fuck that.
What about if they open up on us?

406
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,128
These guys are at war with another crew.

407
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:38,002
We go charging in there,
chances are we will get lit up.

408
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:54,021
Yo, B.

409
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:57,155
Sham saying that Charles saying
they still up at the rim shop.

410
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,252
Marlo, his boy Chris and Vinson,
they still eating.

411
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:02,888
But the rest of the muscle, they rolled out.

412
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:15,478
No.

413
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:19,076
- Not the police.
- Narco's out back, too.

414
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:20,308
Shit.

415
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:23,946
Let us in! We know you're in there.

416
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,556
Shit.

417
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:30,857
- Open the door, you fucking cocksuckers!
- Fucked up, man.

418
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:34,725
You all ask me, you all ugly ass niggas
shouldn't be in here fucking around...

419
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:37,527
with all these guns and shit,
you know what I'm talking about?

420
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,263
Open it.

421
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:47,936
Come on, Avon. Enough with this shit.
Open the fucking door.

422
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:53,575
Open the fucking door, you cocksuckers!

423
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,216
- Police!
- Police! Police!

424
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:02,023
- On the floor!
- Search warrant!

425
00:36:07,497 --> 00:36:09,795
- I'm clean, man.
- Get down!

426
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:12,732
- Lace them shits tight.
- Greggs, I'm opening up.

427
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:23,372
That'd be mine. In fact, all that's mine.

428
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,072
You got a law degree?

429
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:29,409
Take him.

430
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,446
You fall on the parole violation.
No matter whatever else happens...

431
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:36,855
you do every day of what's left
of your seven without seeing a jury.

432
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,723
Maybe even conspiracy to murder.

433
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,831
We take this federal,
see if we can't get you 10 to life.

434
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:43,592
- No parole.
- Whatever.

435
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:49,472
Shit, you only do two days no how.
That's the day you go in...

436
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:51,335
And the day you come out.

437
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,443
Yeah, well, here's the warrant.

438
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:02,046
You read it slow.

439
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,518
In between them two days,
give you something to think on.

440
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,837
Damn. Missed our shot.

441
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:31,971
Roll, man.

442
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:37,913
You bend over for us or, I swear to God,
I will spend what's left of my career...

443
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:40,216
shitting on every last supervisor
in your district.

444
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:43,121
From shift commanders down
to sector sergeants, not one of them...

445
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:46,821
will have any rank at all
if we hear so much as a bark out of you.

446
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,660
Look, my people saw this
as a tactical deployment only!

447
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:53,530
- The responsibility is mine alone!
- Well, you won't fall alone...

448
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:57,739
unless you're willing
to fall exactly as we want you to.

449
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:01,777
After COMSTAT, you go
to retirement services and drop papers.

450
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:05,143
Going out at a lieutenant's grade.
That's right, you're busted back.

451
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:08,775
We can't take your EOD away,
but you're not going out on a major's pay.

452
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:11,353
I can retire with my 30 right now
before you bust me!

453
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:16,048
- I got vacation time enough to make my 30!
- Fuck your vacation time.

454
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:19,418
You're out today, at the lower grade!

455
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,724
That's against the goddamn contract!

456
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:24,095
What part of "bend over"
didn't you understand?

457
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:30,667
- Avon locked up?
- With most of his muscle, yeah.

458
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:33,207
Good day to get back out on them corners,
ain't it?

459
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,572
- Make some money.
- You bet.

460
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,652
It's not just the $17 million
in federal funding...

461
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,126
for Baltimore Law Enforcement
that you've jeopardized.

462
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:56,198
Take off another $200 million
of federal money in your operating budget.

463
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,767
Another $75 in capital expenditures...

464
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:02,635
plus untold millions in pass-through
federal dollars from Annapolis.

465
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:05,370
All told, we're talking about...

466
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:08,505
half a billion a year
that Baltimore will be doing without.

467
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:11,341
Furthermore, the US attorney here
will use all the resources...

468
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:14,507
of the Justice Department to interdict
and destroy any attempt...

469
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:19,350
to establish a geographic entity
where drugs are legal.

470
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,752
Washington should know...

471
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:23,485
that what happened in West Baltimore
in no way reflects...

472
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,561
the policies of my administration.

473
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:29,688
That was an aberration, Mr. Thomas,
the work of one misguided police official.

474
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:32,996
We understand your concerns,
but, you know...

475
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:37,300
for the Deputy Drug Czar to take
the time out to drive 30 miles north...

476
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,671
to deliver that message, hardly necessary.

477
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:43,142
Rest assured.

478
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,011
What up, G? Where the older ones at?

479
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,281
Marlo got his package back out.

480
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:09,767
Fire Burrell. This nonsense began
in his shop without him knowing it!

481
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,668
- Fire the man and move on.
- Odell.

482
00:40:12,942 --> 00:40:16,469
I respect your opinion, but right now...

483
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:21,477
Tony Gray, Carcetti maneuvering,
now is not the time.

484
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,885
No. We get past the primary,
then I'll drive a stake in his heart.

485
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,959
But right now I need him where he is,
if for no other reason than to...

486
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,018
well, to take the hit for this thing right here,
but I tell you what I'm gonna do, though.

487
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,690
I'm gonna shine on that new girl you like
in the 11th.

488
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,766
Yeah.

489
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:41,701
Give her a spot on the ticket.
Cut Eunetta loose. Eunetta's had her day.

490
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:45,767
I respect the fact
that you stood by me, Odell.

491
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,540
I respect loyalty.

492
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:52,970
<i>... and did so without properly informing</i>
<i>his superior officers...</i>

493
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:56,719
<i>and without regard to the criminal statutes</i>
<i>he was sworn to enforce...</i>

494
00:40:56,853 --> 00:41:00,118
<i>thereby disgracing himself</i>
<i>and his command.</i>

495
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:05,221
Is any of that subject to any contradiction...

496
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:07,489
or argument whatsoever, Major Colvin?

497
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,963
<i>- No, sir.</i>
<i>- No argument at all, Bunny?</i>

498
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:13,258
<i>Not much you can say, is there?</i>
<i>Not to real police.</i>

499
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,130
<i>- Get on with it, motherfuck...</i>
<i>- Excuse me, Major?</i>

500
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,308
Is the admin-lieutenant present?

501
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:25,005
Major Colvin is relieved of duty.

502
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:28,550
You are now the acting commander
of the Western District.

503
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:59,676
Damn, Bernard,
didn't I tell you about these guys?

504
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,210
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, Freamon.

505
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:10,652
- Who's that, Crutchfield?
- No, Norris. Sleeping on a stakeout.

506
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:16,733
Yeah, that's everyone we heard on the wire.

507
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,758
Yeah, that's everyone we heard on the wire.

508
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:21,894
McNulty's over there in Number One
with Pearlman. Why don't you say "Hey"?

509
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:22,972
All right.

510
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:30,702
You got to be the stupidest motherfucker
that I've ever gone out with.

511
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:32,474
I can't wait to go to jail.

512
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:37,716
What? What'd you say?
What the fuck did you say, Bernard?

513
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:50,591
Hey, Donald.

514
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:56,805
You heard the tapes.

515
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:00,342
Look, he came to me and said we could sell
drugs if we move down to Vincent Street.

516
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:01,501
And that's where I moved my crew.

517
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,808
And you know I did. Because you
the one that popped me with the G-pack...

518
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:07,439
on my way to the spot
and let me go, remember?

519
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,143
You were selling drugs
in Major Colvin's free zone?

520
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,651
- You can prove that?
- Ask him. He know.

521
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:15,817
You know, <i>this...</i> This must be
one of them contrapment things.

522
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:18,917
- You mean entrapment?
- Kid's got a point.

523
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:29,302
Nineteen in bracelets
from Barksdale on down...

524
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:30,997
another eight wanted on warrants.

525
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:35,066
Any way you can tie your case
to this mess with Colvin?

526
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:37,874
Make it like what he was doing
led to your thing?

527
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,173
I don't see it.

528
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:43,714
Well, it's good work nonetheless,
Major Daniels.

529
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:51,693
Call came in from the Mayor's office
half-hour ago approving your promotion.

530
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:54,920
And now with Colvin,
there's a new vacancy.

531
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,700
- What about my wife?
- What about her?

532
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:01,667
The Mayor. Eunetta's seat.

533
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:04,762
- Why would the Mayor...
- Good police work maybe.

534
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:10,708
Not everything is politics.

535
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:18,682
- Hey, I'll take two. Western alumni.
- All right, you got it.

536
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:20,948
Major.

537
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:24,184
I heard.

538
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:27,756
How's your family take it?

539
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:37,429
Lolita done dropped herself 30 pounds
and got herself a real estate license, so...

540
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,198
I guess she's fixing to leave me.

541
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:53,412
I just wanted you to know that
last tip you gave me was a winner.

542
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,353
Yeah, I heard. That's good work.

543
00:45:00,796 --> 00:45:01,854
Also, I don't know if you know...

544
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:04,899
Stringer Bell was shot to death
two days ago.

545
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:11,072
So, anyway, I put his name on the paper
to tighten the PC.

546
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:16,077
I figured, what the fuck.
Once he's aced, right?

547
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:21,208
You always did cut them corners,
didn't you?

548
00:45:27,123 --> 00:45:29,683
Seems like you cut a few yourself, Major.

549
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:37,532
- However it ends, you're good police.
- Look, I just did what I did.

550
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:40,333
It felt right.

551
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,005
I'm fine with that.

552
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:08,188
Tony, where's my vest, man?

553
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,548
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

554
00:46:27,283 --> 00:46:28,841
I don't understand.

555
00:46:31,787 --> 00:46:33,152
Drink your wine.

556
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:41,720
You and me in public.

557
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,730
- But your wife...
- She wins without me.

558
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:53,400
- On the Mayor's ticket, she wins.
- And you make major?

559
00:46:56,245 --> 00:46:59,112
I think she was waiting for this day
more than I ever was.

560
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,879
And now she's not here.

561
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:07,286
No. She's not.

562
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,454
From out of nowhere, huh?

563
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:19,100
Nowhere is right.

564
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,100
Why me?

565
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:25,741
I guess you don't live right.

566
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,375
- Kari, what was that?
- Nothing.

567
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:36,076
- What broke?
- Nothing, Mama.

568
00:47:41,957 --> 00:47:44,790
- <i>So...</i>
- Yeah.

569
00:47:45,695 --> 00:47:49,290
- You just drive over here.
- I did.

570
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:52,996
Why tonight? What happened?

571
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,801
I was in my old district tonight...

572
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,266
which is where I used to feel pretty good,
I think.

573
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:04,078
I wasn't so angry when I was there anyway.

574
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:07,772
I don't know, someone said something,
I guess, <i>and...</i>

575
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:11,253
That doesn't make sense.

576
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:17,620
- I guess I finished something today.
- A case?

577
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:19,889
More than that.

578
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:24,825
It's like everything I poured into a glass
came out the bottom.

579
00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:30,263
And I just kept on pouring,
like the thing had a hole in it, you know?

580
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,569
The things that make me right for this job...

581
00:48:33,676 --> 00:48:36,975
maybe they're the same things
that make me wrong for everything else.

582
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:41,041
Do you want to come inside for a drink?

583
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:46,248
Not tonight.

584
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:52,923
But if it's not too late,
I wouldn't mind meeting your kids.

585
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:55,015
<i>Major Colvin misled his officers.</i>

586
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:58,958
<i>They thought that his initiative was</i>
<i>a tactical deployment...</i>

587
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:01,461
<i>to entrap narcotics traffickers.</i>

588
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:03,895
<i>There was no mention whatsoever...</i>

589
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:06,695
<i>of the initiative to any superior officer.</i>

590
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:08,565
<i>And for five weeks...</i>

591
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:12,601
<i>all evidence of what he was doing managed</i>
<i>to elude the entire command staff?</i>

592
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:15,137
<i>Are you kidding, Commissioner?</i>

593
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:17,974
<i>I take full responsibility, and indeed...</i>

594
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,675
<i>after I first learned of the matter,</i>
<i>I informed the Mayor...</i>

595
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:23,718
<i>and together we moved immediately...</i>

596
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,811
<i>to relieve Major Colvin of his command.</i>

597
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,219
<i>I'm under the impression that...</i>

598
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,622
<i>this administration gave</i>
<i>serious consideration...</i>

599
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:33,058
<i>- to proceeding with Colvin's initiative.</i>
<i>- No, sir.</i>

600
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:36,029
<i>Major Colvin informed you of his effort</i>
<i>at a COMSTAT meeting...</i>

601
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:37,223
<i>more than a week ago.</i>

602
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,563
<i>His free zones stayed up</i>
<i>for six days after that.</i>

603
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:42,136
<i>That's my responsibility, Councilman.</i>

604
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:44,468
<i>We needed the time to conclude</i>
<i>an ongoing investigation...</i>

605
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:45,733
<i>by the Major Crimes Unit...</i>

606
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:48,639
<i>a wiretap case that would have been</i>
<i>disrupted had we moved immediately.</i>

607
00:50:48,744 --> 00:50:51,872
<i>Correct, Mayor Royce was aware</i>
<i>of the pending case...</i>

608
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:55,109
<i>and allowed us to delay</i>
<i>our response accordingly.</i>

609
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:57,447
<i>But the Mayor was unequivocal...</i>

610
00:50:57,553 --> 00:51:00,545
<i>in his opposition to what Major Colvin did.</i>

611
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:03,249
<i>What we have here, I'm afraid,</i>
<i>is nothing more complicated...</i>

612
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,160
<i>than a solitary police commander who</i>
<i>under great pressure proved to be amoral...</i>

613
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:11,062
<i>incompetent, and unfit for command.</i>

614
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:14,828
<i>No. It's about more than that.</i>

615
00:51:14,937 --> 00:51:19,397
<i>This is more important than who knew</i>
<i>what when, or who falls on his sword or...</i>

616
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:23,308
<i>whether someone can use this disaster</i>
<i>to make a political point or two.</i>

617
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,778
<i>- Mr. Chairman...</i>
<i>- We can forgive Major Colvin...</i>

618
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:28,042
<i>who, out of his frustration and despair...</i>

619
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,586
<i>found himself condoning something</i>
<i>which can't possibly be condoned.</i>

620
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:33,314
<i>We can do that much.</i>

621
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:37,287
<i>But, gentlemen, what we can't forgive...</i>

622
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:42,294
<i>what I can't forgive ever is how we...</i>

623
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:47,864
<i>you, me, this administration, all of us...</i>

624
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:51,196
<i>how we turned away</i>
<i>from those streets in West Baltimore...</i>

625
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:54,708
<i>the poor, the sick, the swollen underclass</i>
<i>of our city trapped...</i>

626
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,711
<i>in the wreckage of neighborhoods</i>
<i>which were once so prized...</i>

627
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:00,543
<i>communities which we've failed</i>
<i>to defend...</i>

628
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:04,312
<i>which we have surrendered to the horrors</i>
<i>of the drug trade...</i>

629
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,685
<i>and if this disaster demands anything of us</i>
<i>as a city...</i>

630
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:09,585
<i>it demands that we say "Enough."</i>

631
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:12,684
<i>Enough to the despair which makes</i>
<i>policemen even think about surrender.</i>

632
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:15,229
<i>Enough to the fact that</i>
<i>these neighborhoods are not saved...</i>

633
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:16,798
<i>or are beyond the saving.</i>

634
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:20,960
<i>Enough to this administration's</i>
<i>indecisiveness and lethargy...</i>

635
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,900
<i>to the garbage which goes uncollected, the</i>
<i>lots and row houses which stay vacant...</i>

636
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:28,033
<i>the addicts who go untreated...</i>

637
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:31,943
<i>the working men and women who every day</i>
<i>are denied a chance at economic freedom.</i>

638
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,644
<i>Enough to the crime</i>
<i>which every day chokes...</i>

639
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:38,811
<i>more and more of the life from our city.</i>

640
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:45,523
<i>And the thing of it is, if we don't</i>
<i>take responsibility and step up...</i>

641
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:48,327
<i>not just for the mistakes and the miscues...</i>

642
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,228
<i>but for whether or not we're gonna win</i>
<i>this battle for our streets...</i>

643
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,664
<i>if that doesn't happen...</i>

644
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:56,397
<i>we're gonna lose these neighborhoods</i>
<i>and ultimately this city forever.</i>

645
00:52:56,505 --> 00:52:58,837
<i>If we don't have the courage</i>
<i>and the conviction...</i>

646
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:00,875
<i>to fight this war the way</i>
<i>it should be fought...</i>

647
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:04,969
<i>the way it needs to be fought, using every</i>
<i>weapon that we can possibly muster...</i>

648
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:06,846
<i>if that doesn't happen...</i>

649
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,282
<i>well, then we're staring at defeat.</i>

650
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:16,884
<i>And that defeat should not and cannot</i>
<i>and will not be forgiven.</i>

651
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:28,059
It was a good case, I'm not denying that.

652
00:53:28,837 --> 00:53:30,828
But I need to trust my people.

653
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:34,306
Unless you can give your word,
there's no way that I can...

654
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,902
That's more than fair. Thanks.

655
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,849
But it's better for me if I do something else.

656
00:53:45,554 --> 00:53:46,885
Detective.

657
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,487
It's not you, it's me.

658
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:55,096
- But where...
- The Western, I think.

659
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:58,493
Yeah, the Western feels like home.

660
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:17,843
- You showed something today.
- Just felt like it needed to be said.

661
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:23,257
Sounds like you're running for something.

662
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:29,924
Eunetta. Been a while.

663
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:46,642
Thought you all was in training.

664
00:55:02,364 --> 00:55:04,855
So what time you want us
to be there tomorrow, Coach?

665
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,930
3:30 would be good.

666
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:10,262
- Hope to see you all then.
- All right.

667
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:31,325
What the fuck you all standing around for?
Man, get to work.

668
00:55:49,278 --> 00:55:52,770
<i>... to the false promise that our schools are</i>
<i>providing a future for our children.</i>

669
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:37,588
That's it. That's it.

670
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:39,694
Yeah.

671
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:52,951
In the cases of Malik Carr, a.k.a. "Poot"...

672
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:57,916
Herbert DeRodd Johnson, a.k. A "Puddin',"
Arthur <i>Carroll...</i>

673
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:00,260
What do you see right here?

674
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:03,424
It's bulk metal, 10 cent a pound.

675
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:04,932
Here.

676
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:07,465
- Aluminum.
- Right you are.

677
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:10,538
Thirty cent a pound. No problem.

678
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,869
You see, in these modern times...

679
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:17,170
a man got to keep one eye on the ground,
pick up what he find, feel me?

680
01:00:18,346 --> 01:00:20,871
Well, there's money to be made
if you know where to look.

681
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:24,511
I hope you listening
'cause I'm trying to school you here.

682
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:30,648
Yeah, you don't want to know.
You think you're brown, but you still green.

683
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,501
How you doing?

684
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:47,100
That's something, huh?

685
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:50,572
Looks like they just took a big eraser
and rubbed across it.

686
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:53,005
Yeah.

687
01:00:55,617 --> 01:00:58,142
Yeah, but before
a dope fiend come down here...

688
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,778
cop a little something,
ain't nary a soul hassle him.

689
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:04,855
Hoppers and police, they just let him be.

690
01:01:09,464 --> 01:01:10,988
Was a good thing, huh?

691
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:17,068
I'm just saying.

692
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:19,903
You probably don't know,
but it's rough out there, baby.

693
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:24,309
Cops be back banging on you,
hoppers be messing with you.

694
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,883
Yeah, thank you.

695
01:01:30,819 --> 01:01:31,786
Shit.

696
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:34,581
That's a dollar here. That's a seed.

697
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:37,486
Come on, boy.
