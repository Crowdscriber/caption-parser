<i>Urca de Lima,</i>

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,009
the largest Spanish treasure galleon
in the Americas.

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:13,212
A page was torn from the log
with the Urca's course and schedule.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,081
Take them into custody.

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,154
The schedule is here
on the island.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,757
The thief who stole it
has offered to sell it to me.

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,826
5,000 pesos in pearls.

9
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,528
- After I get payment, we leave tonight.
- Leave with me.

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,298
I've spent my life trying
to build something here.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,567
If you ever challenge me
again in front of my crew,

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,302
I might just forget
that I loved you once.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,070
The page is gone.
Don't lie to me!

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,409
- Where's the page?
- You're looking at it.

15
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,612
I took drastic measures.
Your schedule is up here.

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,583
Ah!

17

18
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,843
You're dripping blood
across my floor.

19
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:40,486
Whoever tied this bandage
was either blind or drunk.

20
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,854
I think both.

21
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,892
Oh, my God.

22
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,333
You couldn't have told me
about this last night?

23
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,838
It's really not
as bad as it looks.

24
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,543
Is that really necessary?

25
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,148
One of my neighbors

26
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,318
must have witnessed
your arrival last night.

27
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,688
They've planted a spy
out by the scrub pine.

28
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,890
The crone with the crooked nose?

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,926
She passed.

30
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,530
Pastor Lambrick has a new
chief of intelligencers.

31
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,334
Mrs. Archer.
Eyes like saucers.

32
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,176
What is it?

33
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,013
I found it, Miranda.

34
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,818
Parrish's ship?

35
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,356
You found the schedule?

36
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,539
Ma'am.

37
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,913
She's gone.

38
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,681
She's gone?
Are you sure?

39
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,119
One of the whores
helped her past the guards.

40
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,021
She said Max had a boat waiting.

41
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,523
I went to check.
It's no longer there.

42
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,295
I told her I would protect her.

43
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,531
Did she not believe me?

44
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,336
She chose this, not me.

45
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,715
- Something wrong?
- You better be worth it.

46
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,329
When do you imagine you'll sail?

47
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,231
We'll know for certain
once that thief

48
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,132
has transcribed
the page that he stole,

49
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,668
but it'll be soon.

50
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,272
Which reminds me.

51
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,109
Found it in Parrish's cabin.

52
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,880
Middleton.

53
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,983
Thought you might like it.

54
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,959
I must admit,

55
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,495
given how long
it's taken to track him,

56
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,697
I had wondered
if it was a lost cause.

57
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,303
You seem disappointed.

58
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,441
Not at all.

59
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,310
I just...

60
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,484
well, I was hoping
to have you all to myself.

61
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,991
About that.

62
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,331
Ma'am.

63
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,849
I need a favor.

64
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,790
You promised us a score.

65
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,092
That I did.

66
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,660
And now there's no score.

67
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,996
There would not
appear to be, no.

68
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,432
This ain't no joke, Jack.

69
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,568
5,000 pesos of our money is gone

70
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,236
and someone's got
to answer for it.

71
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,238
I assure you all
what happened last night

72
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,040
was as disappointing to me
as it was to you.

73
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,610
But if you're quite certain
my value to this crew is exhausted,

74
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,447
then by all means elect
yourselves a new quartermaster.

75
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,949
Make it right, Jack.

76
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,253
Quickly.

77
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,698
- Where's the rest?
- Beg pardon?

78
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,167
The Urca has a planned
stop to take on water

79
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,869
<i>somewhere on the coast</i>
<i>of Florida.</i>

80
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,439
That's the point where
they're most vulnerable to attack.

81
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,441
This describes a course

82
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,309
that ends miles
short of the coast.

83
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,947
Where's the rest of the course?

84
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,752
Well, I can't exactly
write that down, can I?

85
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,887
Why not?

86
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,389
Well, you all seem
rather angry with me.

87
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,392
Especially you.

88
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,594
And if I were
to write it all down,

89
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,662
then what's to stop you
from killing me right here?

90
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,935
I say we bring Joji in here.

91
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,970
<i>He'll have it out of him</i>
<i>in 10 minutes.</i>

92
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,640
<i>- Torture won't help you.</i>
<i>- You haven't seen Joji work.</i>

93
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,110
No, I mean I have an
exceptionally low tolerance for pain.

94
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,680
I'd say anything
to make it stop.

95
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,715
But there may be a more

96
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,453
mutually beneficial
solution to all this.

97
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,722
What if I were to remain
with your crew?

98
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,829
It makes sense.
I forgo payment for the schedule

99
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,398
in exchange for my share
of the prize.

100
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,033
You proceed with your plan.

101
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,469
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

102
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,271
I will be right by your side.

103
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,740
If what I tell you
is in any way incorrect,

104
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,742
well, you can do with me
what you will.

105
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,581
And when the Urca's ours,

106
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,016
what's to stop me
from killing you anyway?

107
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,088
Well, that's a few weeks
from now, isn't it?

108
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,023
We might be friends by then.

109
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,169
Good enough for you?

110
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,874
I guess it will have to be.

111
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,611
Wait, we're moving ahead?

112
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,280
<i>Mr. Gates and I will begin</i>
<i>our search for a consort.</i>

113
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,115
This is not a task
we'll be able to complete

114
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,551
without the assistance
of another ship.

115
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,254
- Captain, can we just discuss this?
- Join me outside, Billy.

116
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,271
We'll need some additional items
that will exceed our normal demands.

117
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,840
- You'll have it.
- <i>100 casks of powder.</i>

118
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,376
1,000 rounds of shot.

119
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,647
New guns, 12-pounders.
At least a dozen of them.

120
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,619
When we fire on the Urca, we'll need
to do more than make a scratch

121
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,354
or we'll have no chance
of success.

122
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,125
As I said...

123
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,096
you'll have it.

124
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,376
All right, fire away.

125
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,413
Silver knows Singleton
wasn't a thief.

126
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
Am I the only one
that remembers this?

127
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,616
No, you're not.

128
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,386
Our crew is less than a day removed
from a mutiny.

129
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,655
I don't care how much gold
you dangle in front of them,

130
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,624
that hatred
doesn't just disappear.

131
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,261
And Flint wants to put
him back on board?

132
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,731
What if he tells
the wrong person the truth?

133
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,866
- I think we need to canvass.
- Oh, Billy.

134
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,935
No, 'cause then we'll at least know
who to watch out for

135
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,804
and who to keep Silver
separated from on the watch.

136
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,772
And there's a good chance
by doing that,

137
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,108
you're gonna cause the very same
suspicion you're looking to ferret out.

138
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,978
You know that, don't you?

139
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,284
Everything all right?

140
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,719
Aye. Onward.

141
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,924
You, come with me.

142
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,660
You heard him.

143
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,568
You sure he's all right?

144
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,570
Billy?
He'll be fine.

145
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,649
Randall.

146
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,386
Mr. Silver here
has lost a wager to me.

147
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,288
Owes me the rest of the day
helping you peel.

148
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,291
Not supposed to wager
on the ship.

149
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,496
I know, but it was made
over an ale at Guthrie's.

150
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,297
It's all in good order.

151
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,206
Would you do me a favor
and keep an eye on him?

152
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,770
Give me a yell
if he tries to wander off.

153
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,575
Peel.

154
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,228
That's what I'll do
if he should wander.

155
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,006
I haven't seen a pair of 12-pound guns
on this island in months.

156
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,942
He wants a dozen and you
tell him not to worry.

157
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,144
Bryson's due back in two days.

158
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,046
And?

159
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,782
He's armed himself with 12-pounders
since he joined my father's fleet.

160
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,284
What?

161
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,219
But they are his guns.

162
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,521
You can't expect him
to give them to us.

163
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,891
I understand that.

164
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,730
And while we're on
the subject of Bryson,

165
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,898
once he arrives, if he arrives,

166
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,368
that is the last of your father's
supply ships we can expect.

167
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,804
We have to assume
that the others

168
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,439
will hear of your father's
arrest at port.

169
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,742
In which case they won't
dare return here.

170
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,545
Look.

171
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,883
I can reach out to our
contacts in Port Harbour.

172
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,588
And there's also the sloop trade
in Havana and Santo Domingo.

173
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,724
But even so, we will only cover roughly
one-third of our costs

174
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:56,394
per ship per week, which means
in less than four weeks...

175
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,396
The warehouse is empty.

176
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,935
Then he'll have to help us.

177
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,138
Who?

178
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,939
My father.

179
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,214
I can't help but notice that
you don't seem to like me very much.

180
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,849
Do you mind if I ask why?

181
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,553
I can cook.

182
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,655
I see.

183
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,324
You're upset because
they gave me your job.

184
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,928
In my own defense,

185
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,365
I'm still trying to figure out how this
whole place works myself.

186
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,835
I mean, I came aboard
the ship two days ago

187
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,505
and I hear Mr. Singleton
making what sounds to me

188
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,307
to be a lot of sense.

189
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,811
Then less than a day later,
he's dead, Flint remains,

190
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,247
and everyone seems to have
forgotten that any of it ever happened.

191
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,656
What?

192
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,559
Do you know of people
who still harbor

193
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,328
some anger towards the captain?

194
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,431
Not supposed to talk about that.

195
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,466
Well, that's a shame.

196
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,735
If you knew someone like that,

197
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,738
I'd be very curious
as to what they had to say.

198
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,486
Hello, Father.

199
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,227
You lost a lot of blood.

200
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,062
May I have a towel?

201
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm sorry this happened to you.

202
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,280
Flint wants you guarded.

203
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,282
To make certain you don't
interfere with his plan

204
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,317
to hunt the Spanish galleon.

205
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,056
Father, I need your help.

206
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,792
If we're to stay in business here,
we need a new partner.

207
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,527
Someone with ships
and legitimacy.

208
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,631
Someone we can trust
not to cross you.

209
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,667
I know this is difficult,
but I need you to trust me.

210
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,703
I can do this.

211
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,188
Who the fuck are you kidding?

212
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,925
It's help me or flee to Boston.

213
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,594
Beg your father
and brothers for sanctuary.

214
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh, they might save you
from the gallows,

215
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,865
but they won't
spare you their scorn.

216
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,867
You'll be right back
in the parlor room

217
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,703
listening through a crack in the door
to where the real business is being done.

218
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,707
Back to where you started before
you brought Mother and myself here

219
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:59,344
and we made you into the man that
you always insisted to them that you were.

220
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,246
Think on that while you
sit here and pretend

221
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,155
that helping me isn't
the only choice you have.

222
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,791
Billy, I don't know
what you want me to say.

223
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,559
No griping?

224
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,796
No grumbling over duties?

225
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,532
Everyone on the crew
is content, that's what you're saying?

226
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,500
Except for maybe this bastard.

227
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,004
There you go.

228
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,843
Hmm.

229
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,914
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

230
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,219
I just find it hard to believe.

231
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,054
You know what I find
hard to believe?

232
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,556
What?

233
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,926
We've been on land two days

234
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,628
and you still haven't
gotten yourself laid.

235
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,931
Now that's a fucking mystery
worth investigating.

236
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,678
I was right, wasn't I?

237
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,114
Billy's been asking
'round about us.

238
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,915
What do you think?
Does he know anything?

239
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,917
No.

240
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,820
And if we're smart,
it'll stay that way.

241
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,924
What's this?
You backing out?

242
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,063
You know Flint lied
about Singleton.

243
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,965
You know what he is.

244
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,874
Fuck you, then.

245
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,088
I've been talking
with our friend Randall

246
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,123
about my suspicions
about our captain.

247
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,526
He seems to think
we might have that in common.

248
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,149
You make me climb
those fucking stairs

249
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,617
just to see you again

250
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,587
and my first order of business will be
tossing you

251
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,690
and that poxy chair
into the fucking ocean.

252
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,928
Philip, do you know
the provenance

253
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,563
of the chair in which
I currently sit?

254
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,432
- The what?
- This chair once sat

255
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,135
in the Plymouth office
of one Sir Francis Drake.

256
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:41,172
I took this chair from a prize
off the coast of Boston.

257
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,141
I lost six men in that fight.

258
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,611
Ever since then,
this chair has resided here

259
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,148
atop my fort from which
I survey the harbor

260
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,651
that I protect for the good
of an ungrateful island.

261
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,888
Philip, if Mr. Gates should
ever lay a hand on my chair,

262
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,058
you have my permission
to shoot him where he stands.

263
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,759
<i>Yes, sir, Captain Hornigold.</i>

264
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,402
How are you, Ben?

265
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,405
"How are you, Ben?"

266
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,808
Don't be pleasant with me.
I know why you're here.

267
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,710
L'Urca de Lima.

268
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,257
Every captain
on the island is buzzing

269
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,080
about who will be
joining you on consort.

270
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,016
News travels fast.

271
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,053
Time was the thought
of taking on a treasure galleon

272
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,955
would have gotten you
laughed off a crew.

273
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,358
The world's changed, Ben.

274
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,393
Some risks nowadays,

275
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,028
it's more dangerous
not to take 'em.

276
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,798
Jesus, now you're
talking like him.

277
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,036
So I am to be Flint's new consort, huh?
Is that what it is?

278
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,205
He couldn't come down here
and ask me himself?

279
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,174
He thinks you don't like him.

280
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,910
Then he's right.
The man's arrogant and presumptuous.

281
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,013
Be that as it may, he doesn't
want you as the consort.

282
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,082
Then what does he want?

283
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,987
Your ship and your crew.

284
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,691
The offer is one share per man,
two for you personally

285
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,459
<i>in exchange for your support</i>

286
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,262
<i>in persuading the men</i>
<i>to vote in favor.</i>

287
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,332
And who exactly is going
to captain my ship

288
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,067
under these arrangements?

289
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,806
Oh. You?!

290
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,374
Oh, don't say it like that.

291
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,643
- It's not such a crazy idea.
- Isn't it?

292
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,879
Well, look, he doesn't want
somebody new.

293
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,248
He and I share
a kind of a shorthand.

294
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,950
Your ship is sound.

295
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,086
Your crew know and trust me.
It makes the most sense.

296
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,090
You assume too much.

297
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,559
I'm not even certain my men
trust me at this stage.

298
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:46,974
Any news from your friends
in Edinburgh?

299
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:51,102
The last I heard,
James fled to France.

300
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,871
Call him the Pretender now.

301
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,975
I promised my men that if they
stayed with me, they'd be soldiers again,

302
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,611
that they'd be part
of a rebel navy

303
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,614
fighting a war to restore
a rightful king.

304
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,917
Now...

305
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,152
They'd never desert you.

306
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,921
Who knows what they'll do?

307
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,824
They're coming to terms with
a very uncomfortable truth.

308
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,928
And what is that?

309
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,664
That no matter how many lies
we tell ourselves

310
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,634
or no matter how many stories
we convince ourselves

311
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,569
<i>we're part of,</i>

312
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,872
we're all just thieves
awaiting a noose.

313
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,219
And what do I tell Flint?

314
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,325
That after 50 years at sea...

315
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,495
you're the only man
I've ever met

316
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,664
that's gotten dumber with age.

317
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,547
<i>Hello.</i>

318
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,887
Salted meat, cornbread, broth.

319
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,058
If you require
anything else, just ask.

320
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,225
Who are you?

321
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,499
My name is Mrs. Barlow.

322
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,270
Who are you to him?

323
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,782
"Marcus Aurelius."

324
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,352
Have you read it?

325
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,887
It's a personal favorite.

326
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,790
And at the risk
of sounding presumptuous,

327
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,159
I think you might
find it helpful.

328
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,133
Perhaps when you've finished,

329
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,168
we could discuss it together.

330
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,644
Hey!

331
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,052
What the hell are you doing here?
Where's Randall?

332
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,796
Follow me.

333
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,943
There.
The short-haired gentleman

334
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,879
<i>who goes by Mr. Turk,</i>

335
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,481
<i>Randall, and the man in black.</i>

336
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,486
They are what's left
of your mutiny.

337
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,356
How do you know?

338
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,792
Because I had a long
conversation with Mr. Turk

339
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,293
<i>about it this afternoon.</i>

340
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:06,130
His resentment of the captain
runs very, very deep.

341
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,900
And he's convinced
Flint lied about Singleton.

342
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,035
When I told him
I was of a like mind,

343
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,304
he happily opened up.

344
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,474
And now you're telling me why?

345
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,576
I want to live.

346
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,446
Earning your trust seemed
like a good start toward that end.

347
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,649
Now, would you like
to know what Mr. Turk

348
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,385
shared with me
about our beloved captain?

349
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,955
Turk thinks Flint is undead,

350
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,990
walks the earth without a soul.

351
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,927
He believes there's a witch
who lives deep inside the island

352
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,463
<i>who controls his every move.</i>

353
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,632
More or less, yes.

354
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,802
Fucking numbskull's been
spreading those tales for years.

355
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,872
Randall is Randall.

356
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,675
But Morley...

357
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,445
Morley I had no idea about.

358
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,517
He's got no one left
but the misfits.

359
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,952
How dangerous can he be?

360
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,931
Mind if I sit down?

361
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,267
I understand congratulations
are in order.

362
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,203
Captaining the Royal Lion
as consort to the Walrus.

363
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,105
It's your first command,
is it not?

364
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,910
Get up and walk away.

365
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,846
With all due respect,
Mr. Gates,

366
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,548
this tone is beneath us.

367
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,850
As quartermasters,
we serve our men best

368
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,219
when we rise above the fray
and see the truth

369
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,587
from an unobstructed vantage.

370
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,822
When we indulge in their...

371
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,925
I don't know what
you're after, Jack,

372
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,996
but you sound like one
desperate motherfucker to me.

373
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,466
Has this got anything to do
with that massive stash

374
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:52,370
of pearls you lost
out by the wrecks, eh?

375
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,908
How long did they give you
to make it right?

376
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,876
They weren't specific
about time frames.

377
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:03,414
Oh, usually in my experience,
that means about three days.

378
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,050
Perhaps instead of pestering me,

379
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:09,387
you should be out there
looking for a boat.

380
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,495
It won't take much for you
to lose that new crew of yours.

381
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,667
You may have them
fooled now, but at sea...

382
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,203
<i>Perhaps you'll oversleep the bells</i>
<i>and need to be roused.</i>

383
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,440
Perhaps you'll be handed the glass
and need help with where to point it.

384
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,977
Perhaps you'll slip and fall and
that knee of yours will finally give out.

385
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,581
Perhaps... perhaps.

386
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,350
Perhaps no one
will say anything.

387
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,419
<i>Of course, they respect</i>
<i>you too much for that.</i>

388
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,955
<i>But the moment</i>
<i>the Urca looms close</i>

389
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,690
<i>and the first shot</i>
<i>is fired in anger,</i>

390
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:50,194
you know exactly what every last man
in that crew will be thinking.

391
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,463
Christ Almighty,
I wish we had a captain

392
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,632
30 years younger.

393
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,714
What did we spend on stores?

394
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,816
Too much, sir.
We're bleeding money.

395
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,318
Just tell me how much it was.

396
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,754
- 105...
- Mr. Dufresne.

397
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,589
Would you give us
a moment, please?

398
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,491
We're almost done.
Just another minute.

399
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,427
Dufresne, get the fuck out.

400
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,739
I think I have a better idea for
the consort than the one we discussed.

401
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,310
Another crew for you to captain?

402
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:42,480
No, different captain.
Comes with his own crew.

403
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,049
Really?
Who?

404
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,786
Charles Vane.

405
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,762
Yeah.
Yes, let's do that.

406
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,703
That wasn't a joke, was it?

407
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,007
- Are you ill?
- Not that I'm aware of.

408
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,842
Then why would you even think...

409
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,845
Because the Ranger
is twice the ship the Lion is.

410
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:18,082
More men, more guns.

411
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,118
More importantly,
the captain is strong in a fight,

412
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,087
second only to you.

413
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,660
Where's this coming from?

414
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,565
You said it yourself.

415
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,534
Without the Urca,
we have nothing.

416
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,405
From where I'm sitting,
without Vane,

417
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,340
we don't have the Urca.

418
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,819
Even if I was willing
to consider this,

419
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,322
and I am absolutely not
willing to consider this,

420
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,858
what makes you even think
he would do it?

421
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,896
- Fuck you, Jack.
<i>I understand your feelings,</i>

422
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,467
but humbly, I'm not certain
this is entirely your choice.

423
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,673
You already told the crew.

424
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:17,050
They have a right to know.

425
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:19,591
And if Mr. Gates succeeds in bringing
Flint to the table,

426
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:22,138
they may wish to move forward
with or without your endorsement.

427
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,262
They were ready
to bury you this morning.

428
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,231
You're looking to dig
the hole even deeper.

429
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:29,234
They need to yell
every now and then.

430
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,236
It's good
for their self-esteem.

431
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:34,205
And besides, you haven't even asked me
what's in it for you.

432
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:38,176
You said five million
pieces of eight.

433
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,677
That's what's in it
for the crew.

434
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:40,979
Do you really think
I'd bring you something

435
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:42,806
like this with just money
to offer in return?

436
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:45,717
<i>See the bigger picture.</i>

437
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:47,118
What are you talking about?

438
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:50,521
If we swallow our pride
and help Flint land the Urca,

439
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:52,957
who else on this island
stands to benefit?

440
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,732
Who else might see you
in a different light?

441
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:22,096
What did you have to threaten him
with to get him to agree to this?

442
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,822
This was his idea.

443
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:34,332
Here we go.

444
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:49,914
Shall we begin?

445
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:51,949
First off, let me
express my appreciation

446
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:54,018
to everyone seated
at this table.

447
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:56,220
Given recent events,
it's encouraging to know

448
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,457
that we can still rise above our
differences in the spirit of mutual...

449
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,426
I want to talk about Mosiah.

450
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,196
...gain.

451
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:06,631
What about him?

452
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:10,101
He's dead.

453
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:13,871
And before we rise
above anything,

454
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:17,008
I want to hear your cowardly
fuck of a captain

455
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:18,743
<i>apologize for it.</i>

456
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:27,151
I'd like a moment to confer
with my colleague.

457
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:30,955
Outside.

458
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,799
That was my fault.
Entirely my fault.

459
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:44,235
I should have been clearer
when I prepared you for this meeting.

460
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:46,571
When I said we would need
to keep our tempers in check

461
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,272
if we were going to make
this meeting happen,

462
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,108
I should have specified
we'd need to do so

463
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:52,610
for the duration
of the meeting as well.

464
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:54,345
Not to worry.
A simple setback.

465
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:56,481
Now we have clarity
and a unity of vision.

466
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,483
I feel good.
You?

467
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:07,191
All righty, then.

468
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:18,603
What Captain Flint meant to say

469
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,205
<i>is that we have a crew</i>
<i>to answer to.</i>

470
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:24,242
<i>And whether we can reach an agreement
around this table is meaningless</i>

471
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:26,511
if we can't sell it to our men.

472
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,946
Having lost a valued
and respected brother,

473
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,749
they will want to know
what's been done about it.

474
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,088
Without accepting responsibility

475
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,623
for your loss,

476
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,692
I can see a small
allowance being made

477
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,294
for goodwill.

478
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:47,398
How much did you have in mind?

479
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,700
£10,000.

480
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:54,272
<i>That's for Mosiah.</i>

481
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:57,241
Now let's talk about
his man that you killed.

482
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:03,981
No, that's all right.
We can wait.

483
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,122
Well, at this rate,
the Urca will get to Cadiz

484
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,324
and back again before
we resolve anything.

485
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:18,262
I'm gonna take a piss.

486
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:27,839
Be honest.

487
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:32,176
Are you as surprised as I am...

488
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:34,946
that I'm the only one here
behaving myself?

489
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,293
A share per man,
two for the captain,

490
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:50,928
two additional
for use of the ship,

491
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,865
and five set aside in a fund
to offset injury payments.

492
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:00,838
Share and a half
for the captain,

493
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:02,740
one for the ship.

494
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:04,141
Injuries come out of your end.

495
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:08,012
But your men get priority on...

496
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,114
unique items.

497
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:12,116
Ooh.

498
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,691
Done.

499
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:22,293
Oh, just one more thing.

500
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:24,061
Don't push your luck, Jack.

501
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,463
No, no, the terms are agreeable.

502
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,231
My concern is
who will enforce them?

503
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,167
What the fuck
are you talking about?

504
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,971
Your role in propping up
Captain Flint was made clear

505
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:36,140
when you assaulted my captain
the other night.

506
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,075
What's to stop you from
altering the terms of the deal

507
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:40,945
after the fact to see it suit
a more favored party?

508
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,314
<i>I'd feel much better if our deal</i>

509
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:46,017
had a more impartial guarantor.

510
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,319
And who did you have in mind?

511
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,121
The only person around here
that isn't beholden

512
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:52,123
to Miss Guthrie
for their livelihood.

513
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:56,928
- Her father.
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

514
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:59,931
What have we been doing here all day
if you're planning on pulling this shit?

515
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,567
Certainly he can be persuaded to come
down off the mountain,

516
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,869
as it were, and bless
our little arrangement.

517
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:10,007
Unless I'm missing something.

518
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:12,476
My father doesn't know
about this.

519
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:16,180
I see.

520
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,017
But you have my word
these terms shall be honored.

521
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:23,654
Perhaps it would be wise
to revisit our terms

522
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:25,456
to account for this added risk.

523
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,625
<i>- No one's revisiting shit.</i>
<i>- We had a fucking deal.</i>

524
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,293
I've heard enough.

525
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:32,763
<i>The terms are fine.</i>

526
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,469
Her word's good enough for me.

527
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,541
And it's good enough
for you, too.

528
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:49,146
Well...

529
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:56,253
can we consider this a deal?

530
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:11,902
I was getting somewhere.

531
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,272
You're too clever
for your own good, Jack.

532
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,275
Regardless, our fortunes
appear to be on the rise.

533
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,114
So...

534
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,152
perhaps it's time you
finished cleaning up last night's mess

535
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,354
before someone finds out

536
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:33,658
and everything we've achieved here
goes up in smoke.

537
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:48,305
She's all yours, Captain.

538
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,369
You do understand

539
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:20,404
I had no choice.

540
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:25,409
What you did,

541
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:27,278
it required an answer.

542
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,024
<i>I've been meaning to ask you.</i>

543
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:45,062
Our mutual friend,

544
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,064
<i>she put guards at your door,</i>

545
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:48,933
<i>tried to protect you.</i>

546
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,369
Yet you left anyway.

547
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:54,805
Why?

548
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,677
You really have to ask?

549
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:04,582
How did you feel

550
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:07,718
when she threw you aside?

551
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:24,902
When she's ready,
get her on a boat.

552
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,506
Captain, this isn't
what I meant by cleaning up.

553
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,909
<i>What if she comes back?</i>

554
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:36,213
She won't.

555
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,920
Do it after dark.

556
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,224
And do it quietly.

557
00:41:12,117 --> 00:41:13,551
<i>Mrs. Barlow.</i>

558
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:18,589
I'm sorry. You're expecting company.
I can return another time.

559
00:41:18,657 --> 00:41:21,392
Pastor Lambrick,
you have happened by here

560
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,993
every Wednesday for months now.

561
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:25,296
<i>I've grown tired</i>
<i>of acting surprised,</i>

562
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:27,531
so I have instead
decided this Wednesday

563
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,966
to receive you properly.

564
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:33,037
I beg your pardon.
I'm afraid I've become a burden.

565
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,573
Far from it.

566
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,975
I look forward
to our conversations.

567
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:39,710
Please, sit?

568
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:02,299
This week's sermon?

569
00:42:03,602 --> 00:42:06,170
Your thoughts
are always enlightening.

570
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,075
Ahem.

571
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:14,778
Easter.
Is it Easter already?

572
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:27,992
"It is Christ's love of sinners
that gave him the strength

573
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,194
to endure his agony.

574
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:32,529
This, the truest form of love,

575
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:34,465
love through suffering..."

576
00:42:36,568 --> 00:42:38,168
Do you believe this?

577
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:41,005
It's not to be believed
or disbelieved.

578
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:43,374
It's God's gospel truth,
is it not?

579
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,916
"Thy navel is like
a round goblet

580
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:54,518
which wanteth not liquor.

581
00:42:54,586 --> 00:42:58,255
Thy belly is like
a heap of wheat

582
00:42:58,323 --> 00:43:00,391
set about with lilies.

583
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:04,862
Thy breasts are like two fawns,

584
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,032
twins of a gazelle.

585
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:11,435
Thy stature is like
that of a palm tree

586
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:14,905
and thy breasts like
clusters of grapes.

587
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,677
I will go up the palm tree

588
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:22,179
and take hold
of its fruits."

589
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:26,550
God wrote that, too.

590
00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:31,622
True love shouldn't
require suffering.

591
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,958
And you don't have
to take my word for it.

592
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,227
More tea?

593
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:06,523
I must confess there is
an ulterior motive for my visit today

594
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,525
beyond the content of my sermon.

595
00:44:08,593 --> 00:44:10,828
Is that so?

596
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:14,231
There are whispers
among my flock

597
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:16,000
that a ship of the Royal Navy

598
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:18,836
docked in Harbour Island
recently.

599
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:21,171
The Scarborough.

600
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,975
They say the king
means to reassert colonial rule here.

601
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:27,344
Perhaps soon.

602
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:30,881
Judgment in this world,
not the next.

603
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:32,950
For those who are
a part of my flock

604
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,918
when that judgment arrives,

605
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:37,821
their righteousness
will almost certainly go beyond doubt.

606
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,725
It's not quite
that simple for me.

607
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:45,295
Is he keeping you here?

608
00:44:53,204 --> 00:44:55,072
<i>Good day, Pastor.</i>

609
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:04,942
Ah!

610
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:39,676
Hello, Jack.

611
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,480
Gentlemen.

612
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:45,849
The captain might
have brought her here...

613
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:51,255
but it's up to us
when we're done with her.

614
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:38,735
Captain, the men.
I need you now.

615
00:47:38,803 --> 00:47:40,170
Oh, shit.

616
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,374
Eleanor, wait.

617
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:45,909
- Fuck.
- Shit.

618
00:48:11,436 --> 00:48:13,303
Fuck you!

619
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,784
You did this.

620
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:41,231
Listen to me very carefully.

621
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:45,402
You are, all of you,
this whole crew,

622
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,638
as of right now finished!

623
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:52,209
<i>You will not sell anything.</i>
<i>You will not buy anything.</i>

624
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:54,011
You will not eat anything.

625
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:56,146
Eleanor.

626
00:48:58,316 --> 00:49:01,018
Unless...

627
00:49:03,254 --> 00:49:06,089
unless you decide right now

628
00:49:06,157 --> 00:49:07,924
to elect yourselves
a new captain.

629
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:17,768
Unless you decide to join
the crew of Captain Flint.

630
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:24,508
You will join his crew and
you will grant him disposal of your ship.

631
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:29,646
So what will it be?

632
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:32,115
Beggars under an old captain?

633
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:36,553
Or rich men under a new one?

634
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,364
Where are you going?

635
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:17,994
You move, you die.

636
00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:28,972
Get the fuck away from her!

637
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:34,845
I'm so sorry.

638
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,247
I'm so sorry he did this to you.

639
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:38,915
Let me take care of you.

640
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:42,819
We could have left.

641
00:50:44,555 --> 00:50:46,990
We could have been free.

642
00:50:48,526 --> 00:50:50,293
He didn't do this to me.

643
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:54,364
You did.

644
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:10,313
My actions cost you your pearls.

645
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:14,885
Until the debt is paid,

646
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:16,686
I am yours.

647
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,241
What the hell just happened?

648
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:42,446
It looks like she
just gave us a ship.

649
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,017
A ship with no captain.

650
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:19,115
Billy.

651
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:21,051
Is my watch up?

652
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:29,926
So, what now?

653
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:32,996
You here to threaten me?

654
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:35,432
What the captain wants
to accomplish here,

655
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,301
our survival hangs
in the balance.

656
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:41,071
And I need to know we're
all pulling in the same direction.

657
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,175
I've got a right
to think what I think.

658
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:46,476
Well, then say it.

659
00:52:49,113 --> 00:52:51,381
Singleton was no thief.

660
00:52:51,449 --> 00:52:55,151
He had his warts,
but thieving wasn't one of them.

661
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:57,687
Singleton stole the page.

662
00:52:57,755 --> 00:52:59,756
Saw it with my own eyes.

663
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:04,461
You calling me a liar?

664
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:09,933
Oh, fuck!

665
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:19,576
I may be wrong about Singleton,

666
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:22,178
but I'm not wrong about Flint.

667
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:25,982
What's that supposed to mean?

668
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,752
To him, we're all disposable.

669
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:33,056
Chits to be used
for his own purposes.

670
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:39,362
I don't believe that.

671
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:46,670
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

672
00:53:58,149 --> 00:53:59,883
You were right.

673
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:03,687
This is a remarkable book.

674
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:16,333
May I?

675
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:33,883
The emperor writes,

676
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,286
"How should you be?

677
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:39,422
You should be like
a rocky promontory

678
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,627
against which the restless
surf continually pounds.

679
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:48,063
It stands fast
while the churning sea

680
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:51,166
is lulled to sleep at its feet.

681
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,234
<i>I hear you say, 'How unlucky</i>

682
00:54:57,302 --> 00:54:59,670
<i>that this should</i>
<i>happen to me.'</i>

683
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,277
<i>But not at all.</i>

684
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,249
<i>Perhaps say instead,</i>

685
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:14,318
<i>'How lucky I am</i>

686
00:55:14,386 --> 00:55:18,789
<i>that I am not broken</i>
<i>by what has happened</i>

687
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,593
<i>and I'm not afraid</i>
<i>of what is about to happen.'</i>

688
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:27,832
<i>For the same blow</i>
<i>might have struck anyone,</i>

689
00:55:27,899 --> 00:55:31,235
but not many who would
have absorbed it

690
00:55:31,303 --> 00:55:34,305
without capitulation
or complaint."
