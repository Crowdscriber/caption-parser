2
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,658
Hey, it's me!

3
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,126
Yep. We just landed.

4
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,026
Okay. Cool.

5
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:31,690
The guy's not home
five seconds,

6
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,291
- he's already calling Kristen.
- Oh boy, here we go.

7
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,632
You don't want her thinking
you're dying to see her, do you?

8
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,933
Turtle's right, E.
Let her think you're busy.

9
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:40,303
She's my girlfriend,
idiots.

10
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,864
I don't care
what she thinks.

11
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:44,206
I don't have to play games anymore.
Tell them, Vince.

12
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,404
Come on, what do I know
about relationships?

13
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:49,472
What kind of girlfriend won't come
see you while you're away working?

14
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:51,039
The kind of girlfriend
in school.

15
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,518
I went to school.
How hard is it to cut out on that shit?

16
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:55,953
Not that hard
when you're headed for a G.E.D.

17
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:58,253
Three months without pussy, E.
That's rough.

18
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,918
You're almost
a virgin again.

19
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,085
Why do you think
he's calling?

20
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,220
It's like the guy
got his hymen restored.

21
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:05,389
Vince, you ever go
three months without pussy?

22
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,264
- Vince ain't never gone three days--
- Wait, that's not true.

23
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:10,098
Sophomore year.

24
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:12,161
- Really?
- Well, you had mono.

25
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:15,231
- Good memory, E.
- That shit don't count.

26
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,765
Yo, Johnny, is there
another slice left?

27
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,175
No, sorry, bro.

28
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:20,873
Polished it off
over the Grand Canyon.

29
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,541
We need an Eddie's out here.
L.A. pizza blows.

30
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,484
Why is it so hard
to get a good slice in L.A. anyway?

31
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,919
Tap water. That's why you can't
get a decent bagel either.

32
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:30,616
Except on Fairfax.

33
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:32,955
There's different water
on Fairfax?

34
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:36,155
Yeah, Vince.
The Jews import it from Borough Park.

35
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:38,390
I'm serious.

36
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,662
If that were the case, then why can't you
get a good slice on Fairfax?

37
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,896
Because Jews don't
make pizza, idiot.

38
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:45,961
So, given your theory,
Drama,

39
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,166
I should get a decent pizza bagel
at Canter's.

40
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:49,765
- Uh-huh.
- Wrong, E.

41
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:51,868
Kosher mozzarella
tastes like tofu.

42
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,970
Tofu?

43
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:57,108
Did you call for a car,
Turtle?

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,640
Was I supposed to?

45
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,277
No, we're supposed
to walk home.

46
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,516
Summer break's over, E.
Time to get your soldiers in line.

47
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:06,582
Guy's not my soldier.
I inherited him.

48
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:09,254
- Hey, fuck you.
- I hate the new system.

49
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,286
Check it out.

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,299
You called them
and asked them not to tow it?

51
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,791
It would be cooler if I left it
for Homeland Security to impound.

52
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:18,804
Shotgun!

53
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,669
I hate
the new system.

54
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:30,172
All right,
so, remember--

55
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:33,913
gardener, pool guy,
newspaper, vet, alarm company,

56
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:36,183
satellite, Gelson's,
dry cleaning,

57
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,383
and get the MLB package
hooked up.

58
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:39,891
Oh, call your boy Busey,
Vince.

59
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,553
We're finally gonna
accept that gift.

60
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,357
I hope it's not
a self-portrait.

61
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:45,455
Turtle, will you do me a favor?
Will you take this stuff in?

62
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:48,092
Vince, I want his job.
The guy's sitting on Easy Street.

63
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:50,261
Turtle, please.
You're like a three-time Lotto winner.

64
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,167
Where you going?

65
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,604
Three months, Vince.
Three months.

66
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,106
Yeah, you won't last
five minutes.

67
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,631
He won't last
five seconds.

68
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:59,440
What are you doing?

69
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,913
You got me thinking.
Take me to Stacy's.

70
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,746
No, Jamie's.
No, Stacy's.

71
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,843
What?

72
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,513
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

73
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,681
Jerk each other off,
you losers!

74
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:12,714
Yeah, don't forget
your bag!

75
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:18,289
- Help me with this stuff?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,390
I got Arnold.
Come on, Arnold, let's go.

77
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,011
Huh-uh! Huh-uh!
Huh-uh!

78
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,342
What?

79
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,473
I have my period.

80
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:39,007
Oh, fuck.
Really?

81
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,986
Yeah.
Bad timing, huh?

82
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,511
Yeah.

83
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:48,119
Uh, you know.
I mean...

84
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,096
- Maybe, uh...
- What?

85
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:54,794
It's been three months.

86
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,132
Maybe
a little something else.

87
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,467
No.

88
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,267
- Why?
- Because...

89
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,967
that wouldn't be fair
to me.

90
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:05,967
I've been waiting to have sex with you
for three months also.

91
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,809
Yeah, but it's easier
for girls to hold out.

92
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,576
No. Eric.

93
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:12,083
I feel gross.

94
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:13,745
I feel fat and bloated.

95
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:16,186
Well, you're not.
You're beautiful.

96
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,951
- Saturday night.
- What?

97
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:21,653
We can get really drunk.

98
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:24,663
And since you're
this big hotshot manager

99
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:28,565
making the big bucks, we can get
a room at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

100
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,161
Big bucks?
I made $6,000 on that movie.

101
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:33,104
Okay, well,
we'll split the room.

102
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,403
We'll have the best sex ever.

103
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,705
What are we gonna do now?

104
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:40,075
Just kiss.

105
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:43,013
- She wouldn't even blow you?
- Or give you a nice tug?

106
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:44,539
That's bullshit.

107
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:46,051
You act like a priest
for three months,

108
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:47,677
the least the girl
can do is service you.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,347
That is
a little selfish.

110
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:51,982
Had I shown up and Kristen
was missing a leg,

111
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,117
I still would have
taken care of business.

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,187
You would have sex
with a girl on her period?

113
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,858
Who wouldn't, man?

114
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,494
Hey, I've done it.
It's not something I hope for.

115
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,800
You guys are disgusting.
I don't think I've ever done that.

116
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,362
Well, you should,
altar boy.

117
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:10,102
Because it's a fact
a girl on her period is hornier.

118
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,837
And there's no need
for a raincoat.

119
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:15,211
- It's like Flag Day.
- Except it's a week. Hold that!

120
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:21,142
Hey, what's up?

121
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:27,221
What the fuck?

122
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,160
Hey, guys.
I'm Lloyd, Ari's new assistant.

123
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:30,685
What's up, man?
I'm Vince.

124
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,789
I know who you are.

125
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:34,629
If Ari gives you a hard time
let me know, all right?

126
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,965
What happened to Emily?

127
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,130
I don't know.
Can I get you something to drink?

128
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,299
- Water.
- Water sounds good.

129
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,605
I'm good.

130
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,875
- What are you being an asshole for?
- Yeah?

131
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:51,077
A bigwig like Ari should have
a hot assistant to look at.

132
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,449
Johnny, some people
probably think he is hot.

133
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:55,215
I ain't one
of them people.

134
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,721
Come on, Turtle,
let's go.

135
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:59,486
The only reason we stopped
was to see how Emily treated you.

136
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,492
Peace.

137
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,289
The boys are back
in town!

138
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,057
You like "Gaysian Lloyd"?

139
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,826
He's cute, right?
And he covers two quotas.

140
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,891
- Did you fire Emily?
- I had to.

141
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:11,836
To make sure you wouldn't
fuck another one of my assistants.

142
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,600
You're not gonna try
to fuck Lloyd?

143
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,129
Did you really fire her?

144
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,734
James Cameron stole her.
She's over at Lightstorm.

145
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,745
So, how was
the little movie?

146
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,303
Ah, honestly...

147
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,247
one of the best
experiences of my life.

148
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:25,910
That's fantastic. But you got it
out of your system, right?

149
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,977
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

150
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:31,313
I ran into Neil Labute
in New York.

151
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:33,325
He wants me
to do his play in London.

152
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,827
Six months,
$300 a week.

153
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:39,319
But I figure with your negotiating skills you
can get me $400.

154
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:40,957
And it's very well written.

155
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:44,195
Okay, Ari, I'm joking.

156
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm ready to work.
What do you got?

157
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,136
Hiya, Mary.

158
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:58,847
Hi, I'm Carla.

159
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:01,114
Adam's newassistant.

160
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,279
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

161
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:07,349
You have a "Diet Creamsicle Shasta"
by any chance?

162
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:09,657
Johnny, Turtle.

163
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,558
Adam!

164
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,466
You have an office!

165
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:19,096
And you've got
a smoking-hot assistant.

166
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,265
Yep, and it's all
because of this guy.

167
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,571
- Really?
- No, not really.

168
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:25,076
Sit. Sit.

169
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:31,715
So, I'm back
and I'm ready.

170
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:33,742
Great!
Exciting stuff going on.

171
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:35,754
- Yeah?
- I'm circling something at NBC.

172
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,653
TV?

173
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,921
I thought maybe after "Queens Boulevard"
we could get a movie.

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,827
Oh, this is a movie.
A movie of the week.

175
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:46,024
But I have
a little problem.

176
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,090
Your headshots--

177
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,431
they're setting us back.

178
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:51,561
I've had those shots
since '92.

179
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,469
They've been great.
What's the problem?

180
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,633
The problem is people
get annoyed

181
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,074
when they expect to see
a 24-year-old.

182
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:02,610
Does this look
like you?

183
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:08,109
- You ready?
- Let's go, we're ready.

184
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,416
This kid's got
no patience.

185
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,423
In some countries,
they would cut off your elfin feet

186
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:12,754
for disrupting
the master's flow.

187
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,419
How about I shove
my elfin foot up your ass?

188
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,428
- You missed me, didn't you?
- Ari, come on.

189
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:18,487
All right, you ready?

190
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,522
"Aquaman"!

191
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:24,494
- "Aquaman"?
- "Aquaman," baby!

192
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:27,335
It is "Spiderman" underwater!
Boom.

193
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,466
- Is there a script?
- No, I know he doesn't like to read,

194
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:32,068
so I got you something
with pictures.

195
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,513
Tell him, E.

196
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:38,414
Uh-oh, tell me what?

197
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,078
We know what we want
to do next.

198
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,451
What?
The fucking Belt Parkway?

199
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:45,048
- Relax. It's a studio movie.
- Really?

200
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,649
It's big.

201
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,023
Show him.

202
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:52,460
What is this, some Showtime miniseries?
Come on.

203
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:55,865
No, it's "Medellin."
The Pablo Escobar story.

204
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:58,062
Sex, drugs
and salsa!

205
00:09:58,104 --> 00:09:59,594
Did you read it?

206
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:01,435
I know about it.
It's at Universal.

207
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,965
This movie is gonna be
the new "Scarface."

208
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,977
Which was our favorite movie
growing up.

209
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,809
- Really?
- "Here's the story.

210
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:13,712
I come from the gutter,
that's okay.

211
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,344
I got no education,
I know that.

212
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:17,912
There will be
no stopping me.

213
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:19,948
I go straight
to the top, Ari!"

214
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:25,525
This is the kind of studio movie
we want to do.

215
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,930
- "What're you gonna do about it"?
- I'll get into it.

216
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,400
But I'm also deep
into "Aquaman."

217
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:30,925
I got a meeting
with Dana Gordon.

218
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,370
Well, should I be there?

219
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:34,667
Uh, no.

220
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,868
Unless you wanna
pull up her car

221
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,343
- or serve us creme brulee.
- Go fuck yourself.

222
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:41,676
- Not gonna work this year.
- What're you talking about?

223
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:43,841
- What did I tell you?
- I can't play with the guy?

224
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,578
What's the deal?
We gotta battle.

225
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:48,212
- Go easy. He's having a rough day.
- What happened?

226
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,313
- He's not getting any.
- Oh, no. You kidding me?

227
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:51,914
You want me
to get Lloyd in here

228
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:54,585
and have him hari-kari you
with his pecker? Or no?

229
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:57,619
No? I thought the girlfriend
was still in play.

230
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,893
Bad time of the month
to come home.

231
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,900
- You're like me.
- Yeah? How so?

232
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,698
I won't even fuck my wife
after she plays tennis.

233
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,568
Listen,
here's the deal.

234
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,869
I got other things
to discuss with Dana Gordon.

235
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,500
So you set
your own meetings.

236
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,773
But, Vinnie,
the good news is,

237
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,109
Warner's loves you.
Know it.

238
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:18,207
This year you're going to jump
to the next level, baby.

239
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,115
- Sounds good.
- Sounds fine.

240
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,780
I'd say hug it out,
but I don't want you drawing wood.

241
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:24,186
All right?

242
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,657
This is your year, baby.
Your year!

243
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,590
Jesus.

244
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,902
Try this side.

245
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:48,680
Turtle! Turtle!

246
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,181
What the fuck
you screaming about?

247
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:51,444
- I'm right here.
- What's going on?

248
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,144
Everything.
Just like you asked.

249
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:55,619
It's fucking chaos out there.

250
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:56,951
You couldn't
spread things out?

251
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:58,957
I have my system,
you had yours.

252
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:01,186
What is this thing out here
on the front lawn?

253
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:04,060
That's Busey's gift.
It's "a psychedelic totem pole."

254
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:06,030
I thought he was giving us
a painting.

255
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:07,623
I told him I liked
that one better.

256
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,600
We don't own this house. What are we
gonna do with it when we move?

257
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,466
Fucking leave it.
It's ugly as shit.

258
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:13,733
I told him Vince would take
a picture in front of it, though.

259
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,138
Now you're pissing me off.

260
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:18,370
Maybe you should
try doing my dog shit job

261
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,310
and I should
try being Vince's manager.

262
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:22,507
- I did your job.
- Not like this.

263
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:24,106
Vince never yelled at you.

264
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:26,276
You yell at a guy,
you break his spirit.

265
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:28,252
- Ah.
- Vince, does his new title

266
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,118
allow him to yell at me
all the time?

267
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:31,452
That was in his deal.
Sorry.

268
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,787
Don't be so sensitive,
Turtle.

269
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,055
- What day is she on, E?
- Who?

270
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,584
Kristen-- what day
of her period is it?

271
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,823
Day two.

272
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,524
You're in
for a rough week.

273
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,193
- Not as rough as E.
- Can I buy you a blow job?

274
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,462
It would make
both our lives easier.

275
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,163
Nope, I'm fine.
Don't need any of that.

276
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:46,831
Just gotta make it
to Saturday night.

277
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:48,499
What?
You made a sex date?

278
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,508
He's got to wine and dine
his own girlfriend?

279
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,477
I thought the whole reason people have
girlfriends is for effort-free sex.

280
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,571
Are you sure she's not trying
to avoid fucking you?

281
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,378
Exactly. Whoever heard of a girl
who cycles mid-month?

282
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,749
- Mm-hmm.
- When do you cycle, Drama?

283
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:02,777
Hey, Turtle, let's go outside
and take a couple shots.

284
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,652
I already took care
of your head shots.

285
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,124
You can't let Turtle
take your headshots.

286
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,684
- Why not?
- Because you need a professional.

287
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,787
You want me to call David LaChapelle?
He owes me a favor.

288
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,230
The guy charges five grand
to set up a light.

289
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:18,032
- I already took care of this, Drama.
- So, I'll pay. It's your career.

290
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,799
You can't
fuck around with it.

291
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,898
It's emasculating having
your kid brother pay for your headshots.

292
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,432
And him paying for the rest of your life
is empowering?

293
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:27,604
Vince don't pay for shit
of mine.

294
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:29,807
Everything's on my tab.
Tell him, bro.

295
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,976
It's all a loan, okay?
So borrow the money.

296
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,485
It's not the money.

297
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,045
It's the principle.
I can't let them win.

298
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,250
- Who's "them"?
- The conspirators in this town

299
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,986
who force the good actors
out of the business

300
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:44,325
by draining their resources
with shit they don't need,

301
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,921
Iike... fucking headshots.

302
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:47,727
Your headshots
are taken care of.

303
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,324
If someone would
just listen to me.

304
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:51,768
- By who?
- Trust me, all right?

305
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:54,429
See, I'm a multi-tasker.

306
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:56,703
You're a regular Martha Stewart,
Turtle.

307
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,472
At any point am I gonna
get any credit from anyone?

308
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,445
We'll see, Turtle.
We'll see.

309
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,608
"California Pizza Kitchen"?

310
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,141
- Did you buy this?
- Yeah, it's New York style.

311
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:10,019
Not with guacamole on it,
it's not.

312
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,717
You guys are all over me today.
Jesus.

313
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:15,124
Oh, come on,
don't be so sensitive.

314
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,526
I'll eat the shitty pizza!

315
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,997
Vince, you should take a look
at this "Aquaman."

316
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,329
It's cool
for a comic book.

317
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,959
I don't want
to do "Aquaman."

318
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:25,265
Afraid you don't got
the body to fill out the suit?

319
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:28,273
I didn't want to tell Ari,
get the hard sell.

320
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,639
- Will you tell him?
- Sure, I'll lock him into "Medellin."

321
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:32,075
Gracias, chico.

322
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,488
Excuse me,
was anyone gonna call me

323
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,550
- and tell me you're back?
- You didn't know we were back?

324
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:50,653
I knew you were back
because Gary Busey told me.

325
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,061
He wants that shot
with Vince.

326
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,928
- Eric Murphy, this is Amanda Peet.
- Hey.

327
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,696
- Hey.
- Eric is Vincent Chase's manager.

328
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,669
- Oh, hey.
- Nice to meet you.

329
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,535
You too. When's Vince
gonna do another movie?

330
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,096
- Soon, very soon.
- Good.

331
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:03,733
You should find Vince
a movie to do with Amanda.

332
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:04,936
Yeah!

333
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,002
- That would be great.
- I'm more than a publicist.

334
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:08,410
I really should produce.

335
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,415
Give me your card,
I'll give you a call.

336
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:13,145
You know what,
I don't have a card.

337
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,653
What's the name
of your company?

338
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,552
You know what,
I don't have a company either.

339
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,217
- I'm getting that going.
- I'll put you two in touch.

340
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,749
- Okay, great.
- I'll call you.

341
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,591
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,460
You sound like a fucking moron,
you know that?

343
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:26,896
Thanks, Shauna.
It's weird.

344
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,524
Your eyes--
they look black in this light.

345
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,398
- You should seriously--
- Hey.

346
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:32,165
You're not gonna keep me
waiting are you? What're you doing?

347
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:34,468
- Hey, Shauna!
- Oh, fuck you, Ari!

348
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:36,269
Hey, hey,
who speaks like that at Koi?

349
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,003
I apologize.
She's in PR.

350
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:39,772
She knows not what--
You need to be punished.

351
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,370
Let's go.

352
00:15:43,982 --> 00:15:45,745
This is retarded.

353
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:47,775
Do you wanna drop
two grand on headshots?

354
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:52,587
This won't be out
for another four weeks.

355
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:55,024
What do we have to do
to make sure my boy gets picked?

356
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,789
I do the picking.

357
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,162
How do I know this isn't
your signature?

358
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,360
Come on, Christy,
are you crazy?

359
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:05,131
That's the classic "Vincent Chase swoop"
on the V right there.

360
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,968
Yeah, yeah.
I got the same thing with my J.

361
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:10,907
Who are you?

362
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:15,970
I had an unbelievable lunch
with Dana Gordon.

363
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,879
The script is
coming in next week.

364
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,884
And-- Kanpai--

365
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:23,513
I think I convinced her to attach Vinnie
before they get a director.

366
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:25,318
I should get
a fucking Pulitzer.

367
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:27,450
Ari, Vince doesn't want
to do "Aquaman."

368
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:29,051
What do you mean
he doesn't want to do "Aquaman"?

369
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:29,958
He hasn't read the script.

370
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,088
He has read "Medellin."
He wants to do that.

371
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,621
Where did you get that one?
Josh Weinstein?

372
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,396
- A little insecure, Ari?
- How did you get it?

373
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:40,337
Turtle found it on the subway.
What's it matter? We wanna do it.

374
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:41,930
And I wanttofuck
AngelinaJolie.

375
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,999
The only difference is,
I might have a shot.

376
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,306
- We don't have a shot?
- No-- you want to know why?

377
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,006
They're out to a guy.
I don't know if you ever heard of him.

378
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:48,978
His name is Tom Cruise.

379
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,538
Tom Cruise is gonna play
Pablo Escobar?

380
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,140
The guy is not
even Hispanic.

381
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:53,845
Hillary Swank has a vagina

382
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,116
and she won an Oscar
pretending she has a dick.

383
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:57,815
That's what actors do--
they pretend.

384
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,221
I get it.
I get it, okay.

385
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:00,589
So, what if Cruise passes?

386
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,856
They go to Brad Pitt.
He passes, they go to Keanu Reeves.

387
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:04,294
And on down the list.

388
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,797
- Where is Vince on that list?
- He ain't on the list.

389
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:08,129
How do we get him
on the list?

390
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,964
You do "Aquaman,"
you stupid fuck.

391
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,667
- Let's go.
- All right, let's do it.

392
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:32,521
Okay, great.
I think we got what we need.

393
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,389
Wait, hold on a second,
pal.

394
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:37,020
I got a couple of wardrobe changes.
Turtle!

395
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:44,796
Who is this guy?

396
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:50,801
- Okay.
- Suck in that gut a little, Drama.

397
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:52,173
Fuck you, Turtle.

398
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,939
How's the hair look?
Good?

399
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:58,212
Before he did
"Born on the Fourth of July,"

400
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,945
Tom Cruise did "Top Gun."

401
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:02,180
Hanks fucked a fish before
he did "Forrest Gump."

402
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,155
We need a commercially viable
popcorn flick,

403
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,317
Iike "Matterhorn" would
have been.

404
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,851
- We can get "Aquaman."
- We can get a lot of things.

405
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,454
Since Vince doesn't want
to do "Aquaman,"

406
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,055
Iet's talk about those things.

407
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,329
Really, we can get a lot
of other things? You know?

408
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:18,233
- Yeah.
- You know what we can get?

409
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,397
You don't even know the name
of your own fucking company.

410
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,134
"Stop cursing at Koi.
You're embarrassing me."

411
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:23,436
You know what's embarrassing--

412
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:25,534
is that you are managing
your best friend

413
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:28,137
right out of the business.
That would roughly be embarrassing.

414
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,807
That is not true.
You'll be singing a different tune

415
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:31,975
when you see
"Queens Boulevard."

416
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:35,350
We need a career intervention,
is what we need.

417
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:37,378
No more arguing.
No more bullshit.

418
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:39,253
We're going to sit down,
the three of us,

419
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,782
and I'm going to lay out
for you clearly,

420
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:43,124
what our options are.

421
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:45,891
This town is littered
with the trashed careers

422
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,626
of the "once upon a time"
movie stars.

423
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,396
Don't let our boy be
a cautionary tale.

424
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:56,972
Okay. Well,
I conceptualized this

425
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:59,500
when I was on a walk-about
in the Badlands.

426
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:02,104
And I stumbled
on this briar patch of berries.

427
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,479
And I ate every berry
I could see,

428
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:07,349
because I thought that would be
nurturement from the earth to me.

429
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,547
Vincent. Teeth.

430
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:11,681
And after I ate the berries,
this came to me.

431
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:13,486
Each one of these
represents...

432
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,618
Don't ever commit to shit
without talking to me first.

433
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,856
I gotta have some freedom
to operate, E.

434
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,557
You gotta earn freedom.

435
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,624
Why didn't you get this guy
to do my shots? He's a real pro.

436
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,397
All right, you know what?
Fuck you.

437
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:27,530
And fuck you, all right?
That's it, I'm done. I quit.

438
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,366
What's he quitting?

439
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,401
He gets paid?

440
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:36,471
I don't think there's a word
in the Earth language

441
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,483
- or in the dictionary to define...
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,486
...what it did to me.
But it was up in here.

443
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,011
It was in my heart, my spirit,
my soul, my mind, my emotions.

444
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:45,956
- No anxiety...
- Gary, how many pictures do we need?

445
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:50,621
One perfect one. It comes from the light
of the sun after it's set.

446
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,493
It's 1 1 :30 now, Gary.

447
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:55,398
I know it is.
But we must wait for this precious time.

448
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:57,299
Well, we have a meeting.

449
00:19:57,335 --> 00:20:00,532
Your meeting and your future
is meaningless.

450
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:02,199
Gary, a couple more pictures
and that's it.

451
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,470
Guys, let me ask you
a question.

452
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,170
What's more important...

453
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,813
Oh, great.
Now what?

454
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,680
Got a big one
for you fellas today.

455
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,887
Yo, "H&H Bagels."
All right!

456
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:21,154
- How you doing, Blake?
- What's happening?

457
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,161
Yo, check it out.
"Carnegie Knishes."

458
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:24,628
Nice!

459
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:26,631
What else you got?

460
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,155
Whatever this is.

461
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,259
Oh!

462
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,701
"Eddie's Pizza"!

463
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:33,830
What a score.
It's like being back in New York.

464
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,306
- Nice, E!
- I didn't do it.

465
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:38,002
Who did?

466
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:42,146
Jesus, E.

467
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,148
You never came up with
something like this.

468
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:46,047
Yo, great job, Turtle.
Come down here!

469
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,847
Yeah, Turtle,
good job!

470
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,719
Oh, any corned beef?

471
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:53,657
I'm not coming out till
all of yous apologize.

472
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,284
And that means you, too,
Vince.

473
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,993
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,396
I didn't do nothing.

475
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,367
Sorry, Turtle!

476
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,335
Now the "Lucky Charm."

477
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,668
Come on, E.

478
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:10,140
Yeah, come on.
This is impressive.

479
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,405
Whose DHL number
is this?

480
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:14,844
It's Ari's.

481
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:19,077
I'm sorry.

482
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:20,243
I knew
you would like that.

483
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:22,412
Get down here
and help us carry this shit.

484
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:24,149
Yeah, that figures.

485
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,104
These are great.

486
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:41,799
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

487
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,308
Yeah, except, what's with
the big apple behind your head?

488
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:46,572
Ah, itdoesn't matter.

489
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,144
This is our year,
Johnny.

490
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:51,046
Can you feel it?

491
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:55,884
So, twice in two days, huh?

492
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,548
Must be important.

493
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,682
E didn't explain
the situation to you?

494
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:02,420
Did you explain to E
that there wouldn't be any lunch?

495
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,657
I would have waited
for my pizzas to defrost.

496
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:07,597
You didn't tell him
what I told you?

497
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:09,122
I told him you wanted
to sit down and talk.

498
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,135
I thought we just
sat down and talked.

499
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:13,137
What's the situation,
Ari?

500
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:15,036
- You seem stressed.
- Uh...

501
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:19,099
Yeah.
We can't get "Medellin."

502
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,338
Why not?

503
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:23,142
Because they're looking
at other people.

504
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,445
So call and tell them
to look at me.

505
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,848
You don't think
I've been on the phone?

506
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:28,978
You're the "most powerful agent
in the business."

507
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,544
One of the most powerful,
yeah.

508
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:32,454
No, you said
when I signed with you

509
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,788
you were "the most powerful."
He said that to you?

510
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,589
- A bunch of times.
- Shut the fuck up, Eric!

511
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:39,392
Listen, Ari, snap out of it,
all right?

512
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,093
If they're not looking at me,
you call them.

513
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,498
Tell them to look at me.

514
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:46,470
They'll listen to you,
all right? We cool?

515
00:22:46,504 --> 00:22:48,972
I'm starved.
Let's get outta here.

516
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:50,872
Vince,
we have to do "Aquaman."

517
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:55,941
You didn't tell him
any of this?

518
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:57,972
No, he told me.
He told me, okay?

519
00:22:58,016 --> 00:23:01,543
And Eric also told you
that I don't want to do "Aquaman."

520
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:03,611
If we can't get
"Medellin,"

521
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,953
then we will wait
for something else that I love.

522
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,854
For the past three months,

523
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:12,329
while your boy has been sitting
on your indy set pouring creamers

524
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:16,494
and getting no pussy, I have been scouring
this town for an offer.

525
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:20,329
It ain't out there.

526
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,169
Come on.

527
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,038
Okay.

528
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:26,066
Here's an offer
for you to star...

529
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,908
in a new
Olsen twins' movie.

530
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:30,312
It's a love triangle in which little Mary Kate
and Ashley

531
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:32,578
use you as an experiment
to see if you can tell

532
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:34,517
if they are two separate,
distinct people.

533
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:36,417
This would be mildly amusing

534
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:40,720
if the producer didn't think
he had a realistic shot of getting you.

535
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:46,656
It ain't eight months ago,
man.

536
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:48,495
Listen, you cooled off.

537
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,831
The $5 million offers
do not exist.

538
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:54,202
But Warner's loves you,
so "Aquaman" does.

539
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,976
What do you think,
Eric?

540
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:03,470
We should read "Aquaman"
and then see what's what.

541
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,540
Excellent representation.
Nice work, E.

542
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,814
You know what I think?
I would rather quit the business

543
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:10,684
than to do more shit
that I don't love.

544
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:12,690
I've done that.

545
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:14,351
And you know what,
it sucks.

546
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:17,190
I was only partially joking
about Neil Labute, Ari.

547
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:18,991
I'll go do a play.

548
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,191
I'd rather do a play
than this bullshit.

549
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,700
Don't forget,
I came from nothing.

550
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:26,966
As much as I love the toys,
I don't need them.

551
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:33,467
Well, that went well.

552
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,409
I don't want this
to get to a place

553
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:41,009
where you start blaming me
for everything.

554
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:42,747
You guys don't listen to me.
Listen to this--

555
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:45,255
you tell your boy
to do "Aquaman,"

556
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,919
or you tell him to find
other representation.

557
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:14,015
Yo!

558
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,885
My headshots were
a monster hit.

559
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:24,462
This is gonna be
a great fucking year.

560
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:26,760
- Can you feel it?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,064
