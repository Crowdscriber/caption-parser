1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,445
Okay, hold still, honey.

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:06,502
I'm afraid you're going
to hit me again.

3
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:08,292
Don't worry.
I'm just putting this time.

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,779
I'm not the strongest golfer,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,955
and I think it's holding me
back in business.

6
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:14,390
Too bad deals aren't closed
in a trampoline park.

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:16,172
I'd just lazy-back
into a Rudolph

8
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:18,983
into a quadriffus right up
the corporate ladder.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,356
Hey, dad, you coming
to my play tonight?

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,281
"Your" play?
You only painted the sets.

11
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:29,031
Yeah, and Michelangelo "only"
painted the sixteenth chapel.

12
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:31,483
Maybe don't keep your face
so close to the paint cans.

13
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:32,894
Sorry, buddy,
I'm getting a golf lesson

14
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:33,957
and then I'm playing with a client,

15
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,861
but I'll try to make
your next performance.

16
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,509
- Phil!
- Little busy.

17
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,501
Oh, you always do this.

18
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:42,123
You cram stuff in the freezer
without thinking about it.

19
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:44,890
I opened the door, and a frozen
turkey almost fell on my foot.

20
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,982
I keep pulling it to the left.

21
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,327
Are we sure the house is level?

22
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:48,971
Are you not the least bit sorry?

23
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:50,272
I could have broken a toe.

24
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:52,148
Honey, I'm sorry
for dozens of things

25
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:53,735
every day that actually happen.

26
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,755
If I start apologizing
for things that don't happen,

27
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,877
how productive
of a person would I be?

28
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,803
Hey, your golf pro's here!

29
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,445
- Hola, hola.
- Hello, everybody!

30
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:03,504
Hey!

31
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,718
Thanks so much
for the quick lesson, Jay.

32
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,740
Just think of me as a blob of Clay,

33
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,624
waiting for your experienced hands

34
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,317
to caress and coax me--

35
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:13,230
First rule of golf-- 
Shh.

36
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,494
- Okay.
- Good.

37
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,414
If you're going to be
a grump all day,

38
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,245
why did you even say that
you were going to teach him?

39
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,189
Because he's how
my grandkids get food.

40
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:21,756
There he is.

41
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:24,630
- Ay, thank you so much for
taking care of the baby. - Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,555
Cam has me running all
kinds of errands for the play.

43
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:29,790
Yeah, well, you gotta keep
your eye on the caller I.D.

44
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,137
I have to go to the dry cleaners
to pick up the costumes...

45
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:32,728
Mm-hmm.

46
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,057
Then I have to go get
the dry ice for the fog machine.

47
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:35,676
Mm-hmm.

48
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:37,386
And maybe I'll go
get Cam some flowers.

49
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:39,161
Oh, Alex can help you with all that.

50
00:01:39,162 --> 00:01:40,624
Oh, perfect.
Okay, let's go.

51
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,875
We can't be late, or there
won't be any dry ice in the house.

52
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:45,517
- Good one.
- What?

53
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,904
You guys have fun. Go on.
Nothing to worry about.

54
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:48,721
I got it handled here.

55
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:49,659
Be careful.

56
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,449
Don't worry,
just keep your mouth open.

57
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,339
We're fine. It's fine.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,074

60
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:11,523
Okay, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

61
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:13,374
Reuben?
Hit me with a spot.

62
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,704
That's a little harsh.
Throw a pink gel on that.

63
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,043
That's great. Perfect.

64
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:20,081
All right, I will be recording
today's rehearsal,

65
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:22,342
but don't let that
make you self-conscious.

66
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,728
I'm only using it
to pinpoint your mistakes.

67
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,683
Secondly, I have granted full
set access to Maureen Schick,

68
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,732
who will be reviewing
your show tonight.

69
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,111
Oh-oh, she's vicious.

70
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:34,431
Our last music teacher,
Mr. Namagachi,

71
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:36,957
never recovered from her article,
"anything blows."

72
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,706
But in fairness,
I saw that production,

73
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:41,893
and the lead soprano
was an absolute disaster.

74
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,142
No offense, Sophie.

75
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:45,187
You've blossomed since then,
sweetie, okay?

76
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:46,928
No batteries in her mic, okay?
Great.

77
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,825
And lastly, Marcus Talbot.

78
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:51,191
Guys, he's feeling
a little under the weather.

79
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:53,517
Fear not.
He's home resting his instrument,

80
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:55,525
and he will be ready
for the show tonight.

81
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:57,261
But I will need a phantom
for this rehearsal.

82
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,497
So, anyone...

83
00:02:58,498 --> 00:02:59,874
I guess I could help.

84
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:02,282
I don't know how Marcus
ever got the lead.

85
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:05,139
But I know how he got sick--
from chewing all that scenery.

86
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,089
This was my chance to earn it back

87
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,482
from that insincere phony.

88
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:12,039
But first, a silent prayer
for our fallen Captain Marcus.

89
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,660
Godspeed, old friend.

90
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,554
This is boring. 
Is he dead?

91
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,831
No, he's not dead. 
He's just sleeping.

92
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:20,889
Babies need to sleep a lot

93
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,472
so they grow bigger
and stronger and smarter.

94
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,430
- Hey, Mrs. D.
- Hey, Lucy.

95
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,675
- Every time.
- Mm.

96
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:28,998
Well, that's a nice shirt.

97
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,722
Thanks. I designed it myself.

98
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:32,004
It's my best seller.

99
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,361
I'm so jealous you know what
you want to do with your life.

100
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,358
I wish I was inspired like you.

101
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:39,009
Or, you know, aim higher.

102
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:40,787
Open yourself up
to some new experiences

103
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:41,840
and find out what--

104
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,846
- Oh, my g-- 
- Are you okay?

105
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,886
Fine. Just... slipped on one of
your father's stupid golf balls.

106
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:48,644
Good, you woke him up.

107
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,212
Maybe he's hungry.
I just fed him,

108
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,319
but I don't think bottles
can live up to the real thing.

109
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,109
Maybe I can calm him down.

110
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,615
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
but he's super fussy today.

111
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,642
And when babies are fussy,
they--they...

112
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,675
- Wow.
- Yeah, I'm good with babies.

113
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,345
You should see him play
peek-a-boo. He's amazing.

114
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,777
No. I'm good.

115
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,775
I know a guy in Chicago--
he's amazing.

116
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:13,824
Dang it!

117
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,734
Are you kiddin' me? That divot
flew out of there like a rocket.

118
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,466
I decided to go gentle with Phil,

119
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,596
which didn't come easy to me,

120
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:22,206
because I've always been
a bit of a drill sergeant

121
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:23,637
when it comes to sports.

122
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,266
And with the new baby,

123
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,894
Gloria's been buggin' me 
to have more patience.

124
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,612
But come on.
He's been alive a month.

125
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,830
How hard is it to support
your own head?

126
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:33,941
What the hell?

127
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,946
Hello, boys.

128
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:37,753
What a sweet ride, Pepper.

129
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:38,962
What are you guys doing here?

130
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,067
I've been golfing for a few weeks.

131
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,334
Pepper's been teaching me.

132
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,384
I grew up golfing with my father,

133
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,672
the great Chaim Saltzman.

134
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,345
Or as he was known
around the clubhouse,

135
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,381
Chad Treadwell.

136
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,434
Well, we should play together
as a foursome.

137
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:53,553
First time that word's
creeped me out, but okay.

138
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,684
Care to make it interesting?

139
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,999
I think your pants
have already done that.

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,283
How 'bout a hundred bucks?

141
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:58,674
Me and Phil will play you and Mitch.

142
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,411
- Fun.
- Mitchell, care to go first?

143
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:01,546
Oh, I...

144
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,569
Okay. Yeah.
I'll-- I'll give it a whirl.

145
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,034
Running into my dad was no accident.

146
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,004
I wasn't the best athlete
growing up,

147
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,902
and my dad never missed
an opportunity

148
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,139
to point that out.

149
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,802
"Nice throw, Nancy!"

150
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:15,291
Nancy was our neighbor.

151
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:16,939
I could never throw
as well as she could.

152
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:19,677
I'd pretty much given up
on beating my dad at anything

153
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:22,002
until Pepper dragged me
to a golf course one day.

154
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,767
Turns out I wasn't half bad.

155
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,418
Six months' practice later,

156
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,367
I was ready to kick my dad's ass.

157
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:30,335
I knew just how
I was gonna do it, too.

158
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,414
I'd walk up to the tee all nervous,

do a few clumsy practice swings,

160
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,247
and then I'd hit
that ball dead center,

161
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,850
watch it arc through the sky,
land on the green,

162

Fingers crossed.

171

Why is it taking you so long?

00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,718
How hard is it to paint a wall?

173

A lot harder than
your so-called singing.

174
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:15,930
At least this is supposed to be flat.

175
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:17,580
I once saw a monkey paint a wall.

176
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,669
Yeah?
Did you say, "good job, mom"?

177
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,821
Mono? But he's my lead.

178
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,954
My career depends upon this.

179
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,141
The district is this close
to cutting my funding,

180
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:28,926

together right now.

- Why are you whispering?
- Saving my voice, just in case.

Oh. Well, Marcus is out.

191
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:05,219
But luckily, I found an even
better phantom right here.

192
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,164
I wouldn't say better,
but since you did...

193
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,912
Luke. I was just about to ask him.

194
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:11,844
- Luke? - He knows the show,
he sings like a nightingale,

195
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,169
and he has a certain theatrical
madness in his eyes

196
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,076
you cannot teach.

197
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:16,182
That's just from all the paint.

00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,198
Oh. Uh, Luke?

199
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,901
Stop it.
Are you trying to spook him?

200
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:19,876
What are you talking about?

201
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:21,257
He's already intimidated by you

202
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:22,642
after you criticized his sets.

203
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,450
Oh, please.
I could not be the only person

204
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,057
that found his unicorns distracting.

205
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:28,246
Let me talk to him first.

206
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,436
If I can't get the job done,
then you step in...

207
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:32,335
Kind of like the way an understudy

208
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,695
would traditionally take over
when the lead finds himself--

209
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:35,808
Yeah. Just do it.

210
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:39,389
Hey there, Luke.
Or should I say, phantom?

211
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:40,300
You wanna get to the point?

212
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:41,874
'Cause I'm kind of on a schedule,

213
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,743
and this paint keeps
making me fall down.

214
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,551
Marcus is out, and Cam
wants you to take over.

215
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:49,753
Really?
Well, I do know all the songs.

216
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:51,636
Stop trying to talk yourself
out of it. You're doing it.

217
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,380
It's only for two nights.

218
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,945
You're doing it again,
looking at the negatives.

219
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,800
Look at the bright side. 
What if you don't screw up,

220
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,846
humiliate yourself,
and get mocked forever?

221
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,238
- I'd get mocked?
- Only by the cool kids.

222
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,850

Uh-huh. 
Lily, I made you lunch.

230
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,084
Peanut butter. My favorite.

231
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:27,890
It's just hard to believe

232
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,889
that somebody could be so oblivious

is clearly dangerous.

234

Look at us.
We're like a little family.

235
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,269
I know.

236
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,641
- We're the parents.
- I know!

237
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:41,016
I know what his

238

"but you're fine.
Why you getting all bent out of shape?"

239
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,083
But what if I wasn't fine?

240
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,217
What if he walked through the door,

241
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:49,326
and he thought he had
created a horrible accident?

242
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,058
Oh, this is so fun.

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,553
I'm gonna make his little hand
flip us off again.

246
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,553
No, it's not just me.

247
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,008
Three mothers are giving the party,

248
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,011
and we need all
our names in the card--

249
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:06,810
Gloria Pritchett,
Sara Leonard, Dee Cho...

250
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,346
What do you mean that
there's no more room?

251
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,868
Dee Cho must go on.

252
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,883
Okay, come on.
That one had to be on purpose.

253
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,792
Okay, we'll be there then.

254
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,182
They won't be ready
until one more hour.

255
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:19,538
You maybe wanna take
a shift carrying this dry ice?

256
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,994
No, I just had a baby.

257
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,006
I've watched you carry
Manny to bed.

258
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,733
I know what we can do to kill time.

259
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:26,830
My psychic is around the corner.

260
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,811
Please tell me
you just said "sidekick."

261
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,969
I used to think that
I knew everything, too.

262
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,056
We're going for a reading.

263
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,734

266
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:41,469
I'm trying to remember
the telephone number.

267
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:44,802
What is happening to me?

268
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:46,975
All right, what are we,
3 strokes down now?

269
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,748
I think someone needs a Pepper talk.

270
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,260
Aah! Ow!

271
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,966
How is that a pepper talk?

272
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,048
You need to get angry.
Play aggressive.

273
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,553
That man's been Mitch-slapping
you your entire life.

274
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:01,636
I know, but...
he's being so nice to Phil,

275
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:03,886
and Phil is way worse
than I ever was.

276
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:05,317
I don't know.

277
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:08,254
Maybe he's not the
unsympathetic jerk he used to be.

278
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,871
Okay, so you got off
to a rough start.

279
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,183
Let's simplify.

280
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:15,126
On this shot, I want you
to just concentrate

281
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:16,827
on bending your knees.

282
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,367
- You got it?
- Bend my knees.

283
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,172
Bend my--

284
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:21,836
Dang it!
Straighten my knees.

285
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:23,823
Son of a bitch,
you're a hopeless embarrassment.

286
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,620
You're kickin' up more sand
than a sea turtle layin' eggs.

287
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,789
Did you see that?!

288
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,285
Yeah, that wasn't half bad.

289
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,537
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I yelled.

290
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:35,652
No, no, no.
That's what I needed.

291
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:36,736
My old tumbling master in college

292
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,031
used to yell at me all the time.
It just made me better.

293
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:39,911
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

294
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,665
He'd say terrible things
about my manhood,

295
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,043
he'd throw the chalk bag at me,

296
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:45,256
he'd call me and taunt me over
the summer to keep me sharp.

297
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:46,600
So bring it, Jay!

298
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,137
You stink, Phil.

299
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:49,639
You're the worst thing
to happen to golf

300
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,246
since they let people wear shorts.

301
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,248
You just told me to--

302
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,741
No, that's part of it.

303
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,649
Did you hear that?

304
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,126
And he wasn't just talking to Phil.

305
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:00,449
He was talking to 10-year-old you

306
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,962
and 12-year-old you and...

307
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,508
Suck it, Nancy!

308
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,967
I was just trying to help.

309
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,888
Just listen with an open mind.

310
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:12,229
She doesn't believe in psychics.

311
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,496
It's not just psychics.

312
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,632
It's all unquantifiable phenomena.

313
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,417
I'm going to save you some time.

314
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,330
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

315
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:20,945
Maybe not now, but soon.

316
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:22,150
You see?

317
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,438
- That means-- 
- Shh. Go on.

318
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:26,022
You are going to meet
someone special.

319
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,899
I see a handsome man on a horse,

320
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,629
like a knight.

321
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,407
Well, I am going to
a renaissance fair this weekend.

322
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,716
Yes, I know.

323
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:36,130
There's no renaissance fair.

324
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,950
Even if there was, I wouldn't go.

325
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,868
I'd be the laughingstock
of the young astronomer's club.

326
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:44,277
But I couldn't tell Gloria
her fortune-teller was a fake...

327
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,180
Not until I had a little more fun.

328
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,725
I see that you're smiling.
You're enjoying yourself.

329
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:50,803
I know it sounds crazy,

330
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:52,054
but could you please
tell me what happened to

331
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,399
my bunny buttons,
who ran away when I was 5?

332
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,709
Never had a bunny.
Hate bunnies.

333
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,453
- I see a farm...
- Mm-hmm?

334
00:11:58,454 --> 00:11:59,779
With a red barn.

335
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,792
I know who's in the barn!

336
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,756
It's like Scrabble with Haley.

337
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,750
After a while, you're just
playing against yourself.

338
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,999
Okay, everyone,
look sharp, please!

339
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,107
The press is here!

340
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:11,411
As I was saying, Maureen,
I was really at an advantage

341
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:12,786
having seen the Broadway production.

342
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:14,885
I was able to learn
from their mistakes.

343
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,155
For example, in my production,

344
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,706
the phantom appears
in the first scene,

345
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,128
because after all,
it's not called

346
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,771
"Christine and Raoul
of the opera."

347
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:21,954
I have two sources telling me

348
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,249
your lead is home with chicken pox.

349
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,992
- Uh, mono.
- Make that three sources.

350
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:25,988
Oh, damn, you're good.

351
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,490
Um, permission to speak...
off the record?

352
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:29,291
Denied.

353
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,827
Okay, fine. 
Well, then...

354
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,646
See for yourself in just a moment.

355
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:33,892
Tonight a star will be born.

356
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:36,025
- Cam? - Not now, Manny.
I'm birthing something.

357
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,712
Sometimes in the theater,

358
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:40,482
the real drama happens
before the curtain rises.

359
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,790
Observe.

360
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:44,769
Luke Dunphy,

361
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:46,756
how would you like
to play the starring role

362
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:49,152
in Cameron Tucker's
Andrew Lloyd Webber's

363
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,737
"Phantom of the opera"?

364
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,791
Nope.

365
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,802
Luke Dunphy,
is it true you passed

366
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:56,357
because of creative differences
with an overbearing director?

367
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,843
Say nothing to that jackal!

368
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:58,998
Manny, what happened?

369
00:12:58,999 --> 00:12:59,978
I tried my best.

370
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,324
He started hyperventilating
just thinking about it.

371
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:04,848
I guess some people just aren't
comfortable taking center stage.

372
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,572
Okay. Well, maybe
we can pump Marcus

373
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:08,570
full of whatever they
gave those bike riders.

374
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:11,054
He's too sick. But don't worry, Cam,
you'll think of something.

375
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,205
It's always darkest
right before the...

376
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,242
Reuben, could you keep
that thing still?!

377
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:16,807
Okay, well, I guess
we only have one option.

378
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,120
- I'll do it.
- Hmm?

379
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,160
I was gonna say
play the role myself,

380
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,099
but, you know, I guess
it really should be about the kids.

381
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,817
Now if I had tripped
on your father's golf ball,

382
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:29,487
say... top of the stairs,

383
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:31,538
probably would have-- oh, no!

384
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,725
Taken out some pictures.

385
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:33,980
Look what you've done, Phil!

386
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:34,984
Mom!

387
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,044
It's okay. It's finally sleeping.

388
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,327
Hey, we should take
a picture of all of us.

389
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:42,121
Then once you get going,
you know, you just can't stop.

390
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,112
You're taking
everything down with you.

391
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:45,536
Oh!

392
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,784
And then, to make it perfectly clear

393
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,313
to your father what happened,

394
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,467
I'll put the golf ball right here,

395
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:52,075
because some people
can't see the danger

396
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,891
unless it's right
under their nose.

397
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,083
Having kids is fun.

398
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,670
And easy.

399
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,995
Maybe this is what
I should do with my life.

400
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,164
Oh.

401
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:12,398
Oh, he's such a little angel.
I want one.

402
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,295
Shh. Haley, little dude
needs his sleep.

403
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:16,900
I wanted to tell Haley
about the dangers

404
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,787
of starting a family too early,

405
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,387
but what could I say

406
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,876
that couldn't be said better
by a screaming baby?

407
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:26,199
Mom!

408
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,553
Oh, sorry.

409
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:30,296
I don't know what's wrong
with me today.

410
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,268
- Mom!
- Still good.

411
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,254
- Sorry.
- Would you just get out of here?

412
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,160
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
Totally sorry.

413
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,210
It's my--

414
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:38,671
Sorry.

415
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:42,845
When he wakes up,
we should all go out for ice cream.

416
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:44,965
I was thinking the same thing.

417
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,080
What are you doing?

418
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:50,836
Minding my own business.

419
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,961
Wait. Ice cream
might ruin Lily's dinner.

420
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,114
So?

421
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,313
So I spent all afternoon cooking.

422
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,811
I thought ice cream would be fun.

423
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:01,293
All you've done today is have fun
while I did all the work.

424
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm just trying to make
the most of it with these kids.

425
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,694
I don't have as much time
with them as you do.

426
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,521
What, by spoiling them?

427
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,097
Who's that? Who's texting you?

428
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:11,282
It's just about work.

429
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:13,551
Typical. Even when you're here,
you're not here.

430
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,149
Why are you this upset
about ice cream?

431
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,268
If that's what you think
this is about,

432
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,105
then you haven't heard
a word I've said!

433
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:21,633
I-I'm confused.
Why do we even have these kids?

434
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,693
I don't know!

435
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:24,353
I'm going home!

436
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,374
Good!

437
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:32,041
Oh, fantastic.

438
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,221
One stroke down on the final hole.

439
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:38,466
It's such a big putt.
Such a big, big putt.

440
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:41,171
I like big putts,
and I cannot lie.

441
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,148
Money.

442
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,732
You know what'll be sad?
You doing all that practicing

443
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,775
to finally be able
to beat your old man,

444
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,199
and coming up just short.

445
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:49,532
I almost...

446
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:51,087
can't watch.

447
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:52,703
Yeah!

448
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,744
You're up, ace.

449
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:58,139
Ohh!

450
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:00,243
I was the same way with my father.

451
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,808
It's always complicated.

452
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,722
Not for mine.
My dad was just supportive.

453
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:06,265
Never missed a tumbling meet
or a break-dance brawl.

454
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:08,755
Heck, I'd set up the sound system
for our school assembly,

455
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:10,526
he'd be the loudest
voice in the crowd.

456
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:14,032
"Hey, everybody!
Check out my son's equipment!"

457
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,398
- Aw.
- Yeah.

458
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,874
Hey, seriously, good luck.

459
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,417
You played good. 
I'm proud of you.

460
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:21,040
- Really?
- We should do this again sometime.

461
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,219
Don't listen to him.
He's "Cat's in the cradling" you.

462
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,092
- What? - He's playing on your
emotions so you lose your edge.

463
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:27,735
I do it to my son all the time.

464
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,666
Did he say "son"?

465
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,649
Yes. He's a Navy S.E.A.L.

466
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,541
Oh, I've said too much.

467
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,719
What's "Cats in the cradle"?

468
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,180
You know, that song
about the dad who misses

469
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:36,916
all the important moments
in his kid's life?

470
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,179
Stay strong,

471
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,013
just like Kyle did in Yemen.

472
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,576
Oh, my God, I'm a sieve.

473
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,748
All right, Mitch. Showtime.

474
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,221
Five. Six.

475
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,247
A-five, six, seven, eight.

476
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,291
- Ah ha ha!
- Yes!

477
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,890
A hundred bucks!

478
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,103
Oh, we did it!

479
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:57,404
Now I can afford the shirt
that matches these pants.

480
00:16:57,993 --> 00:16:59,499
So... drinks in the clubhouse?

481
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,959
Can't. My kid's in a play.

482
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,944
Yeah, I'm meeting a client
for another round of golf.

483
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:05,387
Hey, if you see Luke,
will you give him a hug for me?

484
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,768
Will do.
Hey, I was serious

485
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,008
about we should
play again sometime.

486
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:09,386
It's a crazy thing

487
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,494
that if I'd been less of a hard head
when you were a kid,

488
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,090
we could have had 20 years
in this dumb game.

489
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,548
No, it was half my fault.

490
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,813
I mean, I-I used to be
pretty sensitive.

491
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:18,674
So y-you really weren't

492
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:20,036
"Cat's in the cradling"
me back there?

493
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:20,882
Of course not.

494
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:23,108
How have I not heard of this song
you keep talking about?

495
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,201
- You have. It's the worst.
- It's the schmaltziest.

496
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:25,880
Unbearable.

497
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:28,724
I'll play it on the way back.
I have it on my iPod phone.

498
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:47,518
I should have golfed
with you sooner, dad.

499
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,042
I never made the time.

500
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:50,479
Luke!

501
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,707
I need to call my son.

502
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,851
What time is it in Damascus?

503
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:58,004
Ugh. Why don't I just
draw them a map?

504
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,041
Ready to play, Phil?

505
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,599
I can't, Carl!
My boy's sets are in a play!

506
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,266
I get the feeling 
that something wonderful

507
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:07,749
has happened to someone you know.

508
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,150
Yes, it's Manny.

509
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:11,551
He got the lead role 
in the school play.

510
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,261
Yes, that's it.

511
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,499
Okay, I think you might have met
her halfway on that one.

512
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,322
Do you feel that?

513
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,657
A presence has just
entered the room.

514
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:20,947
Or the A.C. kicked in.

515
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,733
Gloria, I have to say something.

516
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,135
It's your abuela.

517
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:25,963
Which one?

518
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:28,482
Is she smoking a pipe,
or is she smoking a cigar?

519
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,425
A cigar.

520
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:31,815
- My mother's mother.
- Mm.

521
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:33,242
I miss her so much.

522
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,019
She says she misses you, too.

523
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:38,239
I wish that she was here
now to see Fulgencio Joe.

524
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,780
She has seen him,

525
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,579
and she says he is beautiful.

526
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,260
He is, isn't he?

527
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,673
Ay. Tell her that I love her.

528
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,061
She knows.

529
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,608
- Thank you so much for that.
- Mm.

530
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,529
You see now?

531
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:55,870

534
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,968
Did you forget the notes I gave you

535
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,229
or just choose to ignore them?

536
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,149
Where are you going with that?

537
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,338
We need an extra one up front.

538
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,755
Mr. Namagachi decided to come.

539
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,446
Oh, you mean the disgraced
teacher I replaced

540
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,196
suddenly has an interest
in this production?

541
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:14,584
He's parking his Peugeot right now.

542
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,029
Wow, the vultures
are officially circling.

543
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,055
Okay, Manny, it's no secret

544
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:20,783
that you were not
my first choice for this,

or my second.

But it's not too late for you

547
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,101
to make this your very own phantom.

548
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:27,081

I was transported,

553
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,325
and I was furious.

554
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:41,131
But my quarrel wasn't with Luke.

555
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:42,722
It was with God.

- Well...

I'm gonna be straight
with you, Carl.

585
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,102
You got a ton of inventory to move,

00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,838
and you're in need
of a serious realtor.

on your commission?
