1
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:49,879
<i>Good morning, Presage employees.</i>

2
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:53,220
<i>We hope you're all ready for our exciting
team-building retreat.</i>

3
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:54,599
<i>Please enjoy your breakfast...</i>

4
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,228
<i>and then make your way to the bus,
which will leave shortly.</i>

5
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,559
Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put
breakfast together for the retreat?"...

6
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:03,773
I meant, like, some stale doughnuts,
some coffee.

7
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,277
But this is amazing.

8
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:09,111
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you
see my sales report for last month.

9
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,694
Oh, I saw it last night.

10
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,902
Shit. Has Dennis seen it?

11
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,320
Not yet.

12
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,784
Look, you just need to make a decision,
you know?

13
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:20,199
Are you gonna be "chef" or are you
gonna be "sales guy"?

14
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:24,537
I'm saying that as your friend because,
as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.

15
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:25,683
As your friend,

16
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,584
- I appreciate that advice.
- Good.

17
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:32,421
<i>Inside my baby's room</i>

18
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:34,304
Hold on, man, I'll be right back.

19
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,224
<i>Yeah, I guess I'm doing okay</i>

20
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,430
<i>I moved in with...</i>

21
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,563
Molly. Your ticket's canceled.

22
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,229
Tell me that's a mistake.

23
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:48,025
I was gonna tell you after this weekend.

24
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:49,814
Uh, tell me what?

25
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:53,151
That I don't think it's such a good idea.

26
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:57,319
What, the trip?
It's my brother's wedding.

27
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,162
What's going on here?

28
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,164
We should talk about this later.
Let's just...

29
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:04,368
What, pretend like I didn't see this
for the next two days?

30
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,069
No, let's talk about this now.

31
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,169
It's not working out, Sam.

32
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,215
We're not working out.

33
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,379
Hey.

34
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:20,265
Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?

35
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,637
- Not funny.
- Oh...

36
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:27,022
Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation.
Okay, this is a business retreat.

37
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,807
So we're gonna be all business
for the next two days.

38
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:31,146
Sorry.

39
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:34,151
I love you, but doesn't change the fact
that you're still an intern.

40
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,702
Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight?
You should plan on breaking that.

41
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,908
Why?

42
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,164
For the naked team-building.

43
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,513
Hey, Olivia.

44
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:05,969
Don't forget these.

45
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,478
Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.

46
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,436
- Hmm.
- I like it. it's very Lisa Loeb.

47
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,940
Oh, well, you know...

48
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:18,275
...I'd rather be very Olivia.

49
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,029
We got a gig on Sunday.

50
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,530
Yeah, I'll be there.

51
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:24,400
Morning, Peter.

52
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,073
- Looking good.
- Uh, hi.

53
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:30,409
Olivia. Have you slept
with every hipster in town yet?

54
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:33,292
Candice. Do you actually get paid
for this internship...

55
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,703
...or does Daddy
just increase your allowance?

56
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:39,794
You know, if you wanna get rid of that
baby fat, you should try the gym.

57
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:42,505
They have these workout machines
that you use on your back.

58
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,759
You're good at that.

59
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,841
Sweetie, it's not fat.

60
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,057
They're called tits.

61
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:55,388
You're not looking so hot there,
Moll-face.

62
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,805
Gee, thanks.

63
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,758
Did you try the little jam-bread whatever
your boyfriend made?

64
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,087
I gotta tell you, he's a pre...

65
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,188
Uh-oh, that's what it is, is it?
Did I touch a nerve?

66
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:06,398
- Just leave me alone, Isaac.
- Hey, Moll? Moll? Look at me.

67
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,433
Look at me, hey?
If you ever need anyone to talk to...

68
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,241
I've been told I'm a good listener
by a lot of ladies. Shh, wait.

69
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:15,406
Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday.
Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber is...?

70
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,324
Hey, let's sit next to each other
on the bus.

71
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,370
No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?

72
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:22,956
You know what you should do?
You should apologize.

73
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,920
- Why?
- Doesn't matter.

74
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,675
Never matters.
"I'm sorry, because I"...

75
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,260
Oh, shit.

76
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:39,100
Hey, Stan, how's it going?

77
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,310
Uh, it's Sam, sir.

78
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:43,766
Did you just correct me?

79
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,481
No.

80
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:47,769
Look at me.

81
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,235
- What's my name?
- Dennis.

82
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:50,773
Look away.

83
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,156
All set, Pete?

84
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:54,818
Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.

85
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:57,659
What's the one thing
we can't recycle, Pete?

86
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:58,913
Wasted time, sir.

87
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:02,287
Exactly. I wanna be on the road
in 90 seconds.

88
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,077
Uh, well, I just saw his car,
so I'll go track him down.

89
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:07,497
Way to show some initiative, Stan.

90
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,416
It's gonna be a good day.

91
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,924
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

92
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,301
What's up, bud?

93
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,138
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?

94
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,649
You know,
I'm just trying to make sense of it here.

95
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,356
Three weeks ago they brought you in
as assistant plant manager...

96
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:35,069
- and now you got a day off?
- It's not a day off. it's a re... Re...

97
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,823
Re... Re-what? Retarded?

98
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,952
It's a retreat.

99
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,281
I don't wanna go.
I'm just following orders.

100
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:44,150
- If you don't like it, then you can...
- I can what?

101
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,551
What? I can what?

102
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,001
Nathan, hey. Come on, man,
we're all waiting for you.

103
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:51,796
- Yeah, okay.
- Now, hold on. What you gonna say?

104
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:53,547
What you gonna say?

105
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,686
I got 15 years on you here.

106
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:58,187
You got, what, 4 years
in some classroom upstate?

107
00:08:58,252 --> 00:08:59,926
Listen, if you think
I'm gonna sit here...

108
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:02,930
Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.

109
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,263
We're fine for the day.

110
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,473
Why do you let him get away with that?

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,187
No choice. He's the union rep.

112
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:15,445
I fire him and suddenly
I've got a factory full of Roys.

113
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,855
But I'll win him over,
even if it kills me.

114
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,902
What about you?

115
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,693
When are they gonna offer you
that permanent gig at the restaurant?

116
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:25,077
- They already did.
- Dude, that's great.

117
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:26,328
I don't know, man.

118
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:30,210
I mean, they wanna send me
to the flagship restaurant in Paris...

119
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,916
for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.

120
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,331
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.

121
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,423
Although now I'm not so sure.

122
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:45,055
Well, look, if you do go to Paris,
do me a favor.

123
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:47,636
- What's that?
- Take Roy with you.

124
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,891
Aw, hell, no.

125
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,441
Hey, Sam.

126
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:02,942
You coming?

127
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,698
Yeah.

128
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:13,287
<i>Get ready for a new
adventure at 180 Corporate Consulting.</i>

129
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,052
<i>For the next two days,
you will be tested,</i>

130
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,853
<i>both physically and mentally...</i>

133
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:27,554
<i>This weekend, a professional will
guide you to achieving better results...</i>

134
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,597
What are those for?

135
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:34,261
Oh, it's, um, just something I do
to relax me. And for luck.

136
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,687
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players
at this kind of thing.

137
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,975
She's superstitious.

138
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,862
Hey, Katrina, how you doing?

139
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,281
Nah, just this stupid retreat thing
with the idiots from the office.

140
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,694
No, no, no, not you, sir. Them.

141
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,910
Hold on a sec, let me go someplace
a little more private.

142
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,950
Bald's the new black, sir.
Bald's the new black.

143
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,087
Yeah, no, hang on a sec, babe. Just
gonna head on back to my private office.

144
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,915
The right-hand side!

145
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,894
Whew.

146
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:34,211
Ow. Damn it.

147
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,919
<i>For management,
the valuable skills necessary...</i>

148
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:41,430

00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,816

00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,071
Oh, whoa!

153
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:01,191
Whoa, what the hell?

154
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:07,279
- Peter, did you feel that?
- What?

155
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,247
Something's wrong.

156
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,598
Look out!

No!

165
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:00,290

166

00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:09,591
Oh, no! No! No!

Come on, let's go! Let's go!

Oh, Shit!

170
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,831
Over here!
See the railing?

171
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,720
You can do this. Let's go.

172
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,675
Let's go. Do it!

173
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,512
You can do it. Don't look down!

174

Good. Good.

175

Olivia!

- Sam!
- I'm right here. I'm right here. Okay.

180
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,579
It's coming loose!

181

follow this to Molly's voice, alright?

Come towards me.
Come on, you're almost there! Come on.

Sam, just get back on the bus.
We can talk about it.

Molly, Sam, come on, guys.

00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,090
Did he seem weird to you
when he got on the bus?

226
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,973
No, he was fine.
It's like he just snapped.

How did you know?

00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,616
<i>That's the big question here.</i>

234
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:32,080
How did you know?

235
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,999
It says right here in your statement:

236
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:38,707
"I saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen".

237
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:40,462
That sounds premeditated to me.

238
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,498
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

239
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,173
I had a vision.

240
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:50,134
Okay. A vision.

I don't know.

00:20:59,222 --> 00:21:01,145
I'll tell you what I believe:

245
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:03,185
There's an answer for everything.

246
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:05,853
There's an answer for why
you knew to warn everyone...

247
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:09,489
the bridge was going to collapse,
and minutes later, it did.

248
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:13,949
I told you, I saw it coming.
I don't know how.

249
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,407
I just did.

250
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,207
And no one else did?

251
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:22,995
Like I said, it just came out of nowhere.

252
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:24,754
Did Sam have issues with authority?

253
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:28,667
Did he ever demonstrate
any sort of extremist behavior?

254
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,050
No.

255
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:34,255
Wait. "Extremist behavior"'?

256
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:36,511
You mean like a terrorist?

257
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:40,223
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?

258
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:41,730
Just his girlfriend.

259
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:45,357
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.

260
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:48,359
- But that was in person.
- Molly.

261
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:50,607
Ex.

262
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,364
Tell me about the breakup.

263
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:56,572
Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.

264
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,698
It's personal.

265
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,574
You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.

266
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,742
What does that have to do
with anything?

267
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,796
I'm just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together...

268
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:12,128
before I start moving them around,
making them fit.

269
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,713
Look, I just had a hunch that something
bad was gonna happen. That's it.

- And?
- They're chalking it up to high winds...

from the construction.

Yeah. Send everyone home.

When Dennis gets here, I guess.

That agent still hounding you?

295
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:04,147
No. You heard the news,
it was natural causes.

Yeah, more like supernatural.

So?

300
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,878
How did you explain it?

301
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,049
I didn't.

302
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,255
I couldn't.

303
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,216
Sam, there had to be a reason.

304
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,755
Heh. That is exactly
what the agent kept saying.

305
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,389
Whatever answer you're looking for,
I don't have it.

306
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,898
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.

307

We should all just put it behind us

But the people that left us on the bridge
that day, they were more than that.

312

People like Jennifer Alcott...

Maybe you worked next to them.

Maybe you worked for them.

317
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:20,221
But we all worked with them, huh?

00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:29,853
Did he just say my name?

321
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:33,445
- That's not funny.
- I know, I'm sorry.

322
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:36,528
I just get weird with tragedies.
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:39,785
I see dead people.

324
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:42,784
Guys.

325
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,461
Death...

326
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:57,469
doesn't like to be cheated.

327
00:25:58,128 --> 00:25:59,381
Excuse me?

328
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,973
What's that supposed to mean?

329
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:08,808
You all just be careful now.

330
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:11,145
Okay. Thanks for the advice!

331
00:26:12,182 --> 00:26:13,307
Creepy guy.

332
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:39,293
How's that foie gras, Sam?
Waiting on you.

333
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:53,680
<i>Wasted like a drunk
She drank, drunk, drunk</i>

334
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,565
<i>Stop it</i>

335
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,191
<i>It's not forgotten</i>

336
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,064
Thanks.

337
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,443
Got my dessert?

338
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:09,866
What's the matter with it?

339
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,248
Said it was flat. No flavor.

340
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:15,414
- Do they want something else?
- Yeah.

341
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:16,748
The check.

342
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:21,631
Let me taste it.

343
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,515
The customer is an asshole.
The bourguignon is good.

344
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,394
Hold on.

345
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,623
You mind if I come in?

346
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:00,707
Yeah. Sure.

347
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:11,924
Thanks.

348
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,884
I thought you'd be working tonight.

349
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:17,266
Yeah. You know,
I worked the first shift, but...

350
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:20,357
there's something else
I needed to do.

351
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:27,894
- Can I...?
- Oh.

352
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,688
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.

353
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:25,615
Thank you.

354
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,372
Listen...

355
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:32,580
When everything started going down
on that bridge...

356
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:38,506
...the only thing I thought about
was you.

357
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,680
Getting you to safety.

358
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:45,847
You are the only thing
I care about, Molly.

359
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:51,227
Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.

360
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:53,811
You haven't done anything wrong.

361
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:56,860
Then, what? What is it?

362
00:29:58,354 --> 00:29:59,401
Paris.

363
00:29:59,687 --> 00:30:01,189
We talked about that.

364
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:06,202
I'm not going to uproot my life,
leave you, for that job.

365
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:08,865
But it's the only thing
you've ever dreamed of.

366
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:13,582
Life is too short, Sam.

367
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:16,336
You have to go after what you love.

368
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,546
I am.

369
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:25,044
You should take the job.

370
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:29,257
Go to Paris.

371
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:47,278
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:48,863
What's the matter?

373
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:52,576
I don't know. I'm not ready.
I don't feel ready.

374
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:56,206
It's been really hard to concentrate
after everything.

375
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,540
Yeah? Are you sure?

376
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:00,541
Yeah.

377
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:03,583
Because this is the last practice
before the championship.

378
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,254
And it's your last practice
of your college career.

379
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,169
I know, but...

380
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:12,006
I think you got this.

381
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,051
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:18,020
I mean, you love it out there.

383
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:21,098
Okay. You're right.

384
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,485
And besides, coach would kill me. Heh.

385
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:25,235
Yeah.

386
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:26,485
Here.

387
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:30,111
Thanks.

388
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:31,445
Come here.

389
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,202
Bye.

390
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:38,744
You got this.

391
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,036
You have to get
a little more speed.

392
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:51,837
You gotta hit that follow-up.

393
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,659
I'm sore from the back extensions.

394
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,060
Really?

395
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,478
Okay, seriously, this is stupid.

396
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,144
They've gotta make it cooler
or we're gonna pass out.

397
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,856
They're working on it.

398
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,115
Well, they should have it fixed by now.

399
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:39,130
Come on, Candice.
You're up.

400
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,811
Come on, Candice. You got this.

401
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:20,127
Candice, now.

402
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,682
Really strong value on this.

403
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,860
Hey, coach! How was that?

404
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,628
I wanna see you guys
run the routine all the way through once.

405
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,025
- That's good.
- Whew.

406
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,236
All right, Janine next. Let's go.

407
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,696
Let's go, ladies, and drink water.

408
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,660
That's it.

409
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:38,116
Every time, Candice.

410
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:44,916
- There you go.
- Thanks.

411
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,004
Nicely done, Candice.

412
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:53,384
Okay, go to bars.

413
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,676
Come on. Hit the floor.
You can do it.

414
00:34:58,177 --> 00:35:00,100
Go hard this time, Candice.

415
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,481
Let's be aggressive.

416
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:07,318
Here we go, Candice. Stay loose.

417
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:09,947
Okay, Porter, it's your turn.

418
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,816
Stay focused.

419
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,489
Good.

420
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,331
Looking good, Candice.

421
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,201
Candice? Candice'?!

422
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,665
- Oh, what happened?
- Don't touch her.

423
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:11,546
Someone call 911.

424
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:12,705
Candice?

425
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:35,895
Peter.

426
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,001
I came as soon as I heard.

427
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:57,289
She was doing great.

428
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:03,341
She was almost finished with her routine
and then...

429
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,345
Why did it happen?

430
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:17,566
This doesn't make any sense.

431
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:19,442
I don't know, man.

432
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:25,232
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Peter.

433
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,794
Let's just go, Sam.

434
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:56,562
Hey.

435
00:37:57,011 --> 00:37:58,809
How's it going?

436
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,683
It's weird.

437
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,313
Being here, I mean.

438
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,278
It's just so quiet.

439
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:12,619
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls
rerouted to corporate.

440
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:16,656
Yeah, well, it's depressing.

441
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:23,128
Holy crap. Did you guys
get your bereavement pay yet?

442
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:28,916
Hey, what's he doing here?

443
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,174
I think he just needed the distraction.

444
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:33,805
Yeah.

445
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:36,678
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.

446
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:39,931
Guess we all should have seen
that coming.

447
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,601
What?

448
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:45,743
You see the crazy shit
those gymnasts do.

449
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:47,544
I'm surprised it doesn't happen
more often.

450
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,517
<i>Once you've handled the e-mail...</i>

451
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,557
<i>you'll need to deactivate
all the key cards...</i>

452
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:54,158
<i>of the deceased employees.</i>

453
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:56,025
<i>Instructions are in your binder.</i>

454
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,492
Well, shouldn't that be the job
of the facility manager?

455
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:02,290
<i>The facility manager's dead.</i>

456
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,201
<i>Dennis, you want me to fly someone
up there?</i>

457
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,707
No, no, I got it.

458
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:16,544
Aw, Debbie.

459
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:24,681
You were so naughty.

460
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:39,862
Fuck it.

461
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,955
Robert, my man.

462
00:39:58,376 --> 00:39:59,673
OW.

463
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:03,597
Shit.

464
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,481
You shouldn't have, buddy.

465
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:25,359
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?

466
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:29,121
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.

467
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:32,457
So, uh, who wants one?

468
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:33,742
Where'd you get these?

469
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:38,039
I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. it's good, right? Ha, ha.

470
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:39,707
I got something better.

471
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:41,754
Ooh, nice one.

472
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,464
Yeah, count me in.

473
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,797
Are you sure you wanna share that?

474
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:51,017
If I don't, I'll end up
drinking it alone, which is just sad.

475
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:53,762
Well, this day just got way more fun.

476
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:09,234
No, I did call you.

477
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:13,037
Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?

478
00:41:13,321 --> 00:41:15,995
Because I really do
wanna take you out again.

479
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:19,161
Yeah, yeah, we'll do, like, a nice
romantic dinner.

480
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,828
You know,
somewhere maybe outside the city.

481
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:23,248
Hold up.

482
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,796
You know what? I gotta go.

483
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:31,133
No, no, no. I'm not blowing you off.

484
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:34,972
Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?

485
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:36,885
Amber, yes, that's what I said.

486
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:38,098
Excuse me.

487
00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:49,189
Amber? Amber, I'm sorry, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or mi...?

488
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:54,031
Sorry about that. My, uh, sister
tends to get a little chatty sometimes.

489
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:56,036
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

490
00:41:56,195 --> 00:42:00,200
So tell me about stress relief.

491
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:03,996
And what does this really get me?

492
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:06,879
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

493
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,337
Like massage therapy?

494
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,419
Erotic massage?

495
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:17,508
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.

496
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:19,743
Hey, that's great.
I prefer a professional.

497
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,644
In fact, you know what?
I kind of demand it.

498
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:23,625
I'm just trying to clarify, though,
that this...

499
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:26,826
professional experience ends,
uh...

500
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
happy.

501
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,649
I know exactly what you need.

502
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:37,863
Oh, I'm sure you do.

503
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:40,199
- Follow me, please.
- I'd love to.

504
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:41,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

505
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:43,496
Slow down there a little bit.

506
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:46,535
Yeah. Yeah, you have
a lovely little Canter.

507
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:52,710
Yum yum, dim sum.

508
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,250
Hold up there a second.

509
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,884
All right, these are solid.
Just making sure.

510
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:59,217
Tend to be a bit noisy,
if you know what I mean.

511
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,515
Ha, ha. Yo, Buddha.
Slow down on the rice cakes.

512
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:13,730
- Just close your eyes.
- Mm-hm.

513
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:15,145
- Relax.
- Ooh.

514
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:19,987
And Someone will be in
to service you soon.

515
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:22,071
Oh, yeah.

516
00:43:34,538 --> 00:43:36,414
Oh, yeah.

517
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:37,924
Feels dynamite.

518
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:42,007
No, no. You're going the wrong way there,
little lady.

519
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:46,224
Oh.

520
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:49,385
Wait a second, what happened
to the younger version of you?

521
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,940
Okay, I'm sorry.
Do you come with subtitles?

522
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:59,151
Maybe I should go.

523
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,234
Don't know what that means. No idea. Yep.

524
00:44:02,397 --> 00:44:03,865
OW!

525
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:05,071
Fuck!

526
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:09,867
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I'm all right.

527
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:11,202
Holy shit, you're strong.

528
00:44:11,363 --> 00:44:13,989
- Come on.
- Hey, what're you doing? Ow.

529
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:15,980
You're a little aggressive there,
don't you think?

530
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,662
- What's "capay"?
- Breath in...

531
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:18,563
I don't know what that means.

532
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,919
I don't want a "foo-hay".
No "foo-hay". Aah!

533
00:44:27,045 --> 00:44:29,218
Cheers.

534
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,683
Mm.

535
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:38,894
Shit, that's my ride.

536
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:40,650
Shit. I gotta go.

537
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,560
Leaving more for us.

538
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,987
All right, well, more for me.

539
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:54,279
All right, bye.

540
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:55,788
- See you later.
- Okay.

541
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:56,995
Later.

542
00:44:57,156 --> 00:45:00,626
This is the end,
so, what are we toasting to?

543
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:02,583
To, uh, finding new jobs.

544
00:45:02,745 --> 00:45:05,123
Because it's only a matter of time
before they shut us down.

545
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:07,962
- Hear, hear.
- Oh. To starting over.

546
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:13,763
Peter?

547
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,304
It just doesn't make sense.

548
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:22,313
She dies doing something
that she's done...

549
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:25,396
almost every day
for the last 15 years of her life.

550
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:29,065
She said she didn't wanna do it.

551
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:31,481
She said she wasn't ready.

552
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,069
And I should have stopped her.

553
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,696
I should have done something.
I should've...

554
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:41,207
Peter, there wasn't anything
you could've done.

555
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:45,373
How do you know?

556
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,504
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

557
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,688
Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.

558
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:09,692
Yeah, Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know what.

559
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,352
Does that mean anything?

560
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,940
You told me to call
if I saw anything odd.

561
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:19,610
I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis,
and call me if you see anything strange.

562
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:21,198
Stranger.

563
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,660
Should we maybe have code names
for one another, do you think?

564
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:29,285
Over and out.

565
00:46:30,326 --> 00:46:33,456
All right, ahem,
show me how this happened.

566
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:35,832
I don't think I can.

567
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,593
What do you mean?

568
00:46:37,752 --> 00:46:40,149
I mean,
I could try it a hundred times...

569
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,650
and never re-create exactly
what happened here.

570
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,304
This is some freaky shit.

571
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,317
God!

572
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,948
Oh, that actually felt great.

573
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:10,327
Oh, yeah. Awesome.

574
00:47:11,908 --> 00:47:13,285
Oh...

575
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,372
Wait. Are those things even sterilized?

576
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:20,837
No, no. I'm not catching any diseases
unless I've earned them.

577
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:31,302
Wait a second. You understood that.

578
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,437
You speak English.

579
00:47:37,432 --> 00:47:38,729
Oh.

580
00:47:45,314 --> 00:47:46,782
All right, you know what?

581
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,820
Let's do this.
Two billion people can't be Wong.

582
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:52,823
I said Wong. You follow me?

583
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:54,331
You get it, you're Chinese.

584
00:47:58,369 --> 00:47:59,721
Ow, ow. Okay, it's in.

585
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:01,522
It's definitely in.
Ow, okay, yes, it is in.

586
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:04,545
How many of these are you gonna
put in me?

587
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:21,149
Oh, uh, hey,
can you grab that for me? Thanks.

588
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:24,647
Hey.

589
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:29,064
That's not very nice, you know.

590
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:44,370
Okay, your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes.

591
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:46,209
I'm not gonna lie,
it's a little annoying.

592
00:48:46,664 --> 00:48:50,167
Once again, Chinese lady,
I don't have a clue what you're saying.

593
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:54,304
Thirty minutes. You sleep.

594
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:07,024
Sleep.

595
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:35,134
Oh.

596
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:39,176
Hey! Fire!

597
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:41,216
Hello?!

598
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:42,428
Hey!

599
00:49:43,133 --> 00:49:45,307
Hey! Hey!

600
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:47,847
Hey, there's a fire in here!

601
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,932
Hey, there's a fire!

602
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:52,018
Get in here!

603
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,369
Oh, shit.

604
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:18,689
<i>You should come with me.</i>

605
00:51:19,098 --> 00:51:20,350
To Paris?

606
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:24,146
Yeah, you know, you said it yourself.
Like, you're gonna have to start over.

607
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,027
Start over with me.

608
00:51:29,442 --> 00:51:31,284
How many drinks have you had?

609
00:51:31,444 --> 00:51:34,415
Enough. Molly, I'm serious.

610
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:38,747
Look, you were right.
If I don't take the job, I'll regret it.

611
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:41,961
But I'm not willing to lose you.

612
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,669
Why does it have to be
one or the other?

613
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:47,042
I'm better when you're with me.

614
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:51,888
Uh, guys, you're not gonna believe this.

615
00:52:05,352 --> 00:52:06,944
They're saying it was a freak accident.

616
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:09,195
Yeah, raise your hand
if you believe that.

617
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:12,528
Who dies during a massage? Seriously.

618
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:14,823
First Candice, now Isaac.

619
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:16,828
It can't be a coincidence.

620
00:52:17,028 --> 00:52:18,746
It's not.

621
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:20,660
Where are you going?

622
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:23,492
It's that creepy dude.

623
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:26,458
Why are you following us?

624
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:28,790
Who are you?

625
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:33,637
You were at the cemetery,
then the gym, now here.

626
00:52:34,628 --> 00:52:36,050
What are you doing?

627
00:52:36,214 --> 00:52:37,965
My job.

628
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,058
What's happening to us?

629
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:55,236
What makes you think I know anything?

630
00:52:55,398 --> 00:52:56,571
You warned us.

631
00:52:57,191 --> 00:53:00,114
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.

632
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,326
It's just that I've seen this before.

633
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,286
You've seen what?

634
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,826
A lucky few survive a disaster.

635
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:13,043
And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.

636
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:17,010
You changed things on that bridge.

637
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:22,264
There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.

638
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:24,846
So, what, we're doomed to die?

639
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:26,845
I mean, is that it?

640
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:30,602
We just got our lives back,
so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?

641
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:32,481
Are you saying that we can't stop this?

642
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:35,393
You were supposed to die on that bridge.

643
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:37,983
You're not supposed to be here.

644
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:40,530
You shorted Death.

645
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:43,489
So you let Death
have somebody else in your place...

646
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:46,655
and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living.

647
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:50,667
All the days and years
that they have yet to live.

648
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:54,419
And they take your place in death.

649
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:56,172
Then the books are balanced.

650
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,001
Wait a minute. We kill someone,
we get their life?

651
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,302
Is that what you're telling me?

652
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,758
I don't make the rules.

653
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,973
I just clean up after the game is over.

654
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:24,860
Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.

655
00:54:25,273 --> 00:54:28,527
They weren't supposed to survive,
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

656
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:30,611
No.

657
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:32,781
No, not all of us.

658
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:35,291
Molly made it, she didn't die.

659
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,794
What?

660
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:42,336
Well, when I had that vision,
or premonition, or whatever it was...

661
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:46,715
...I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

662
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:48,003
You survived.

663
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,388
You saved her?

664
00:54:50,546 --> 00:54:52,322
Why, because you...

665
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,523
decided that she deserved
to live more than the rest of us?

666
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:55,983
No, that's not what he's saying.

667
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:57,545
I don't deserve to live more
than anyone else.

668
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:59,119
You apparently deserve
to live more than Candice.

669
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,353
Hey, whoa,
Peter, hang on.

670
00:55:00,515 --> 00:55:02,894
Look, guys, come on.

671
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,027
You're not drinking the Kool-Aid,
are you?

672
00:55:05,187 --> 00:55:08,440
Killing people
to survive Death's list. Really?

673
00:55:09,565 --> 00:55:13,286
I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what that guy's selling.

674
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:16,492
Yeah? What else is it, then?

675
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:22,541
Shit.

676
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:24,080
We need to tell Olivia.

677
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:26,043
Come on.

678
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:31,631
My forms are all signed.

679
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:35,094
I see that it's been quite a while
since your first consultation.

680
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:37,600
What made you decide
to take the leap today?

681
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:42,021
Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life...

682
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:45,398
and I just don't wanna
miss anything...

683
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:46,856
you know, important.

684
00:55:47,017 --> 00:55:48,690
Same reason I had it done myself.

685
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:52,982
- Come on in back. Let's get you started.
- Okay.

686
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,074
Oh.

687
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,541
Yep, that's the first step.
You'll never need those again.

688
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:08,338
Here we are. Come on in.

689
00:56:19,881 --> 00:56:20,928
What's with these?

690
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:24,727
Oh, just for some of
our younger patients.

691
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:29,891
And, um, sometimes our older ones too.
Come on.

692
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:42,115
What was that?

693
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:43,871
Relax.

694
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,873
You know, it looks a lot worse
than it really is.

695
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:51,378
Okay, I'm gently going to
position your head...

696
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,585
...and I want you to tell me...

697
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:57,584
...when this feels snug.

698
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,172
I can't move my head.

699
00:56:59,335 --> 00:57:02,179
Perfect. Just what we want.

700
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,096
There we go.

701
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:09,888
Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.

702
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:14,484
And you will feel a little numbness
in your eye...

703
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,109
...which is a good thing.

704
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,455
Deep breath.

705
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,502
Relax.

706
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:47,345
Very good.

707
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,222
Thattagirl.

708
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:05,947
There.

709
00:58:06,106 --> 00:58:08,826
That's not so bad, is it?

710
00:58:20,912 --> 00:58:22,414
Looks good.

711
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:32,889
- What was that?
- Just relax, Olivia.

712
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:35,516
I'm just gonna enter some data into...

713
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:41,021
Dottie!

714
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,768
Dot...

715
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:46,608
Do you know what? My assistant's
given me an incomplete file.

716
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,521
I'll be right back.

717
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:52,651
Hold on, you're leaving?!

718
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,973
Is that supposed to be happening?!

719
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,517
Help me!

720
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:21,154
Olivia Castle. Where is she?

721
01:00:21,316 --> 01:00:22,441
She might be in danger.

722
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:25,353
No, she's fine. We do this kind
of procedure all the time.

723
01:00:33,036 --> 01:00:35,209
Help me!

724
01:00:35,913 --> 01:00:37,506
Help me!

725
01:00:55,975 --> 01:00:57,817
This has never happened before.

726
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:04,190
Sam.

727
01:01:05,275 --> 01:01:07,572
Stay with me tonight, please.

728
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:10,538
Of course.

729
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,458
Five different systems had to go wrong...

730
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:21,500
for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly. Five.

731
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:23,417
What do you want from us?

732
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:25,882
I want you to tell me
what you think is going on.

733
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:28,762
Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.

734
01:01:28,921 --> 01:01:31,800
Three? That's a pattern.

735
01:01:44,811 --> 01:01:46,314
Now...

736
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:49,320
...I know you two didn't do this.

737
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:51,823
All right?

738
01:01:53,194 --> 01:01:55,572
But I think you know something.

739
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,412
What is it?

740
01:02:01,493 --> 01:02:03,962
We don't know anything.

741
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,833
Take a guess.

742
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:16,176
We think we weren't supposed to survive
on that bridge.

743
01:02:17,509 --> 01:02:18,555
What?

744
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:23,519
And now something
is trying to set it right.

745
01:02:25,015 --> 01:02:26,768
"Something"?

746
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,153
That's all you got?

747
01:02:30,354 --> 01:02:31,573
Right now, yeah.

748
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:37,199
But if you come up
with any other explanations, let us know.

749
01:02:39,863 --> 01:02:41,991
Thank you.

750
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:50,002
"Something".

751
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:00,095
Hey.

752
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:03,515
Been up long?

753
01:03:05,637 --> 01:03:10,313
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about the bridge.

754
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:16,983
Sam, you can't do this to yourself.

755
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:21,118
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about,
in the premonition...

756
01:03:21,946 --> 01:03:26,041
...we all got off the bus,
but the ground gave way and Candice fell.

757
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:29,160
Then the bus tipped over.

758
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:33,334
And Isaac, he never got off the bus.
He went with it.

759
01:03:33,497 --> 01:03:34,874
What are you getting at?

760
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,169
I know that there was just
so much going on...

761
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:42,048
Look, I know that I helped you across.

762
01:03:42,588 --> 01:03:45,432
Then I reached back for Olivia.

763
01:03:46,008 --> 01:03:48,354
But she didn't make it. She fell.

764
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,600
So first was Candice.

765
01:03:56,436 --> 01:03:57,483
Then Isaac.

766
01:03:58,855 --> 01:03:59,946
Then Olivia.

767
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,193
They're dying in order.

768
01:04:04,443 --> 01:04:06,194
Who dies after Olivia?

769
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:44,272
<i>Roy, would you come
to the control room, please?</i>

770
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:47,157
Uh-oh, Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.

771
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,959
Okay, schoolboy,
what do you wanna talk to me about?

772
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:07,425
What is with your timecard?

773
01:05:07,426 --> 01:05:09,026
Yeah, let's talk about my timecard.

774
01:05:09,088 --> 01:05:11,556
You out my hours,
which means you cut my pay!

775
01:05:11,714 --> 01:05:12,986
I cut everyone's hours, okay?

776
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:16,177
Corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over.

777
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:18,446
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.

778
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,515
My dumbest kid
ain't operating at 50 percent.

779
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,380
Roy.

780
01:05:21,381 --> 01:05:24,433
My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent,
so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

781
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:25,560
No, we gotta move, man.

782
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:29,073
- Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Hey!
- Look, we gotta move! Gotta move!

783
01:05:29,232 --> 01:05:30,528
We gotta move now!

784
01:05:40,616 --> 01:05:42,870
Roy! You okay down there?

785
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:49,082
- Hey, Dennis?
- Hey.

786
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,220
They're closing us down.

787
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,676
They're shutting down the plant?

788
01:05:54,839 --> 01:05:59,139
Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.

789
01:05:59,301 --> 01:06:00,974
Can you believe it? Us?

790
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:03,309
It's the factory guys
that usually get laid off.

791
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:05,018
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.

792
01:06:05,182 --> 01:06:07,558
Yeah, Dennis, we got bigger problems.

793
01:06:08,393 --> 01:06:10,144
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

794
01:06:11,146 --> 01:06:12,237
Who's Isaac?

795
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:15,491
Isaac Palmer, tech support.

796
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:17,819
Wasn't he dead already?

797
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:19,362
No, Dennis.

798
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:24,872
Listen, it's going to happen to us too
if we don't do something about it.

799
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:28,837
Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.

800
01:06:28,996 --> 01:06:33,091
No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.

801
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:35,217
Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.

802
01:06:35,376 --> 01:06:37,174
I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.

803
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,221
Anyone could be next.

804
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,007
It could be you. Understand?

805
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:43,643
Nobody's safe.

806
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:45,348
What are you talking about?

807
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:50,356
We weren't supposed to survive
that bridge collapse.

808
01:06:50,515 --> 01:06:53,394
And so now it's kill or be killed.

809
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:56,150
You get that, Dennis?

810
01:06:57,271 --> 01:06:58,319
Whatever.

811
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,324
I warned you.
Do whatever you wanna do.

812
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,872
I Will.

813
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,958
Hey, Agent Block, it's Dennis. Um...

814
01:07:14,121 --> 01:07:18,045
Listen, Pete just came in here
and he's just completely lost it.

815
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:21,088
He's yelling about "kill or be killed".

816
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:24,176
Oh, yeah,
it definitely sounded like a threat.

817
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:42,238
What happened?

818
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:45,322
I don't know. I don't know.
It just happened so fast.

819
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:48,203
- Nathan. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

820
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:52,037
- We heard, and we thought...
- No. No, uh, I'm good.

821
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:54,409
Did you kill him?

822
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:55,910
What?

823
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:58,670
No. No, I just...

824
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:01,708
It was just timing, you know?
He got in the way and...

825
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:03,171
No, you did, didn't you?

826
01:08:03,334 --> 01:08:06,713
You saw it coming, and then you took
his life. You put him in the way.

827
01:08:06,879 --> 01:08:08,505
No, I didn't really do anything.

828
01:08:08,572 --> 01:08:10,117
Tell us the truth:
Did you or didn't you?

829
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:13,218
- Hey, Peter, calm down.
- Did you or didn't you?

830
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:17,734
Did you or didn't you?

831
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:21,772
Yes. I think I did.

832
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:23,853
I killed him.

833
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,945
So if the theory works,
then you traded spots.

834
01:08:28,107 --> 01:08:31,783
He should have your death,
and you should have his years.

835
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:33,825
How do we know for sure?

836
01:08:33,988 --> 01:08:35,866
I think there's an order to these deaths.

837
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:40,253
They mirror the order everyone died in
on the bridge.

838
01:08:40,411 --> 01:08:42,208
Then who would be next?

839
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,291
Who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened?

840
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,796
Who is it, Sam?

841
01:08:47,959 --> 01:08:49,005
Who's what?

842
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,802
Dennis! It was Dennis.

843
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,227
No shit.

844
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:02,015
Jesus.

845
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:07,110
Why are you fighting me on this?

846
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:09,647
You're not seriously going to work,
are you?

847
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:14,113
Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.

848
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,950
If Death is gonna come for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.

849
01:09:17,113 --> 01:09:18,864
You have to do something.

850
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,750
- What, kill someone so I can live?
- No, of course not.

851
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,661
We'll just have to
figure something else out.

852
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,921
I have figured it out.

853
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:30,341
Something saved me on that bridge.

854
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,342
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.

855
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,137
Maybe.

856
01:09:36,296 --> 01:09:39,175
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.

857
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:45,853
So if it happens tomorrow,
or 50 years from now, whatever.

858
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,233
As long as we're together...

859
01:09:49,475 --> 01:09:50,693
...I'll be okay.

860
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:56,239
Right? Why don't you come by
after my shift...

861
01:09:56,398 --> 01:09:58,492
...and I'll make you
a nice late dinner, okay?

862
01:10:07,284 --> 01:10:08,627
All right, give me this.

863
01:10:17,585 --> 01:10:19,837
Excuse me.
We don't have to wait for them, do we?

864
01:10:20,003 --> 01:10:22,302
- I'll let you know.
- Okay, thank you.

865
01:10:25,132 --> 01:10:27,477
<i>To the girl on the run</i>

866
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:39,488
Veal's ready, take it out.

867
01:10:39,648 --> 01:10:41,742
Samuel. Get to work on the bourguignon.

868
01:10:50,073 --> 01:10:51,291
Whoa.

869
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,746
Pan coming through.

870
01:10:54,369 --> 01:10:56,044
Whoa, watch yourself.

871
01:11:06,799 --> 01:11:09,442
- Okay. Meat's in. Pick it up, eh?
- Yes, sir.

872
01:11:20,018 --> 01:11:21,693
Whoa.

873
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,698
That could've been ugly, huh? Ha, ha.

874
01:11:23,856 --> 01:11:26,530
Yeah. Could've been.

875
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,907
Vincent, speed it up, okay?

876
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:41,543
Whoa, hey!

877
01:12:05,102 --> 01:12:07,105
Hey, clean that grate.

878
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:18,575
- Just met your girlfriend.
- Oh.

879
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:21,664
Are you sure it's okay
if I make her a little something?

880
01:12:22,287 --> 01:12:24,333
Make sure to clean up afterward.

881
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:27,249
I will, of course. Thank you.

882
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,918
And, chef...

883
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:33,380
The apprenticeship.

884
01:12:33,546 --> 01:12:36,048
If the offer still stands...

885
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:37,560
...I'd like to take it.

886
01:12:39,219 --> 01:12:40,720
It's yours.

887
01:12:55,441 --> 01:12:56,909
Okay, no more suspense.

888
01:12:58,694 --> 01:13:00,741
What you've been waiting for.

889
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,959
Wow. You're gonna help me
with this, right?

890
01:13:05,117 --> 01:13:06,585
Yeah, sure, if you want me to...

891
01:13:06,744 --> 01:13:08,246
No? You don't want me to...?

892
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:10,210
So how's your French?

893
01:13:10,706 --> 01:13:12,959
<i>Heh. Terrible.</i>

894
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,799
Oh, good. Well, then,
we can be terrible together.

895
01:13:16,962 --> 01:13:20,136
- Why?
- I took the internship.

896
01:13:20,297 --> 01:13:24,223
What? Sam, that's amazing.

897
01:13:27,598 --> 01:13:29,395
I'm so proud of you.

898
01:13:46,573 --> 01:13:49,326
- Peter.
- Hey.

899
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,169
You okay, man?
You look a little, uh, upset.

900
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:58,256
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a rough couple days.

901
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,634
Yeah. Yeah, for everyone.

902
01:14:02,589 --> 01:14:04,466
For some more than others.

903
01:14:05,258 --> 01:14:06,680
Do you mind if I come in?

904
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,187
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, come in.

905
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,351
Here, have a seat.

906
01:14:17,184 --> 01:14:18,779
Thanks.

907
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,193
Hey, Peter.

908
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,157
Hi, Molly.

909
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:45,758
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?
I can make you up some pasta.

910
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,883
Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm good.
Uh, thank you.

911
01:14:51,384 --> 01:14:53,226
Uh, I'm sorry. I just thought...

912
01:14:53,386 --> 01:14:55,979
It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.

913
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:59,067
Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.

914
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:01,898
Uh...

915
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,905
Still alive, I mean.

916
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,405
I'm next to go, right?

917
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:08,404
It's me and then you, isn't it?

918
01:15:11,195 --> 01:15:16,042
Anyways, uh, I was up all last night,
you know...

919
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:19,474
thinking...
about if I could really do it.

920
01:15:19,995 --> 01:15:23,794
- Do what?
- Take someone else's life.

921
01:15:23,956 --> 01:15:29,213
If I could actually kill some stranger,
replace their life with my own.

922
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:32,093
And I thought about it.

923
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:34,884
And I convinced myself that...

924
01:15:36,259 --> 01:15:37,761
yeah, I could.

925
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:42,853
<i>So I went on a walk.</i>

926
01:15:43,015 --> 01:15:45,768
<i>You know, nowhere in particular...</i>

927
01:15:45,936 --> 01:15:48,814
<i>but every couple of minutes,
an opportunity would just present itself</i>

928
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,777
<i>Heh. Like clockwork.</i>

929
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,286
<i>I could just grab somebody
and pull them into an alley.</i>

930
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:59,457
Or just shove somebody off a curb
into traffic.

931
01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:01,621
<i>You know?</i>

932
01:16:02,451 --> 01:16:03,748
<i>It'd be real easy.</i>

933
01:16:06,788 --> 01:16:09,041
Peter, what did you do?

934
01:16:16,755 --> 01:16:19,178
- Did you...?
- No, I didn't.

935
01:16:22,093 --> 01:16:24,141
<i>I couldn't.</i>

936
01:16:24,305 --> 01:16:26,147
<i>I realized that...</i>

937
01:16:26,306 --> 01:16:29,230
I couldn't kill somebody
that didn't deserve to die.

938
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:35,032
And I thought about Candice,
and I thought, "Wait a minute.

939
01:16:36,066 --> 01:16:38,989
Candice didn't deserve to die.

940
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:43,705
Olivia didn't. Dennis didn't.

941
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,083
I don't".

942
01:16:47,993 --> 01:16:49,290
Do I?

943
01:16:49,496 --> 01:16:51,669
No, of course you don't.

944
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,047
Well...

945
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:03,342
none of us deserve to die,
then why is it...

946
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:07,604
that you deserve to live, Molly?

947
01:17:09,513 --> 01:17:10,810
You said it yourself...

948
01:17:12,016 --> 01:17:13,188
...you don't.

949
01:17:18,856 --> 01:17:20,279
Go!

950
01:17:21,025 --> 01:17:25,576
Repeat, shots fired.
Requesting backup. 1026 Washington.

951
01:17:26,322 --> 01:17:29,700
Hide and I'll distract him.
When you can, go.

952
01:17:31,826 --> 01:17:33,294
Not done yet, Sam.

953
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:37,252
Where is she?

954
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:43,047
- Where is she?!
- I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.

955
01:17:43,254 --> 01:17:45,052
You're gonna have to kill me first.

956
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:47,429
Well, that doesn't do me any good.
Heh, heh.

957
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:48,844
Death's after you too.

958
01:17:49,009 --> 01:17:51,388
This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.

959
01:17:52,554 --> 01:17:56,149
Just think for a minute, all right?

960
01:17:56,308 --> 01:17:57,900
You are not a killer.

961
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:00,896
I don't wanna kill anybody, Sam.

962
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:05,491
I don't wanna die yet either.

963
01:18:12,365 --> 01:18:14,708
Heh. It's not your time yet.

964
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:25,882
Don't worry, Molly...

965
01:18:28,045 --> 01:18:29,592
...I didn't kill him.

966
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:35,771
But I didn't need to, Molly...

967
01:18:36,847 --> 01:18:40,942
...because Death
is gonna do that for me.

968
01:18:41,393 --> 01:18:43,770
Doesn't mean I can't help it.

969
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:47,447
That's it.

970
01:19:29,146 --> 01:19:32,365
- Are you okay? What's going on?
- It's Peter. He has a gun.

971
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:39,285
Oh, my God.

972
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:44,375
You killed him.

973
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:53,252
It's Sam's turn.

974
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:01,809
Peter, just go.

975
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:05,396
You have Block's life, you're safe now.

976
01:20:06,263 --> 01:20:07,731
Please.

977
01:20:07,973 --> 01:20:09,849
I'm sorry, Molly.

978
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,772
But you just witnessed the murder
of a federal agent.

979
01:20:17,441 --> 01:20:21,946
And I'm not gonna spend
the life I just earned in prison.

980
01:20:33,413 --> 01:20:36,040
Molly, go! Go get help!

981
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:06,196
You son of a bitch!

982
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:47,449
Tell Candice I love her.

983
01:21:47,817 --> 01:21:48,864
Peter.

984
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,975
It's gone. You killed him.

985
01:22:18,805 --> 01:22:20,602
So does that mean I get Block's life?

986
01:22:25,603 --> 01:22:27,104
Yeah.

987
01:22:27,812 --> 01:22:29,690
I guess I do.

988
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:47,165
Do you mind if I take the window seat?

989
01:22:47,581 --> 01:22:50,630
- You're gonna make me sit in the middle?
- Uh-huh.

990
01:22:50,793 --> 01:22:52,966
- I'm like twice your size.
- Not really.

991
01:22:53,128 --> 01:22:55,130
- All right.
MAN 1: Sit down.

992
01:22:55,298 --> 01:22:57,640
- I'll remove him.
- Fuck you. I'll remove myself.

993
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,017
Get off him!

994
01:22:59,176 --> 01:23:00,428
Settle down!

995
01:23:00,594 --> 01:23:03,472
- Come on, Browning! Come on, you punk!
- Get off the plane!

996
01:23:03,638 --> 01:23:06,106
Get off the plane. You don't understand!

997
01:23:06,265 --> 01:23:07,983
Everybody just stay where you are.

998
01:23:10,269 --> 01:23:13,900
- What's all that about?
- I have no idea.

999
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:17,194
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be pulling away from the gate as...</i>

1000
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:24,373
Here we go.

1001
01:23:24,574 --> 01:23:27,122
<i>The cabin lights
have been dimmed for takeoff</i>

1002
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:54,902
<i>With curiosity</i>

1003
01:23:56,312 --> 01:23:59,783
<i>Dust in the wind</i>

1004
01:24:11,995 --> 01:24:13,246
Sorry about that.

1005
01:24:15,581 --> 01:24:17,834
Oh, excuse me.

1006
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,675
Those passengers who got off the plane
earlier, what was that all about?

1007
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:25,513
A kid had a
panic attack and wanted off the plane.

1008
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:27,763
Said he had some kind of vision.

1009
01:24:28,634 --> 01:24:29,978
No.

1010
01:24:32,097 --> 01:24:33,188
Oh, my God!

1011
01:24:38,102 --> 01:24:39,148
Sam.

1012
01:25:07,796 --> 01:25:08,921
I got you!

1013
01:25:11,133 --> 01:25:14,055
- Sam!
- Molly, hold on!

1014
01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:16,686
No!

1015
01:25:18,724 --> 01:25:20,397
No!

1016
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:46,296
Nice of you to come, Nathan.

1017
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,711
I know Roy
wasn't the easiest guy to work with.

1018
01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:51,171
You know.

1019
01:25:51,338 --> 01:25:53,465
I still can't believe he's gone, though.

1020
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:56,100
Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.

1021
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,511
I guess it was for the best.

1022
01:25:59,011 --> 01:26:00,011
What do you mean?

1023
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:03,352
Company did an autopsy
for insurance purposes.

1024
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:06,611
Turns out Roy had an enlarged
blood vessel in his brain so big...

1025
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:10,022
it was about to burst.
They said he'd be dead any day now.

1026
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:12,533
<i>Nothing lasts forever but the...</i>

1027
01:26:12,691 --> 01:26:14,318
Any day?

1028
01:26:15,278 --> 01:26:16,324
Life's a bitch.

1029
01:26:16,487 --> 01:26:18,284
<i>Dust in the wind</i>

1030
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:01,961
<i>You all just be careful now.</i>
