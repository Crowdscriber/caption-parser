00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,021
Sometimes...

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:12,228
at night I Ieave the lights on
in my little house.

4
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:17,309
And... walk across the flat fields

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,295
When I look back from a distance,
the house is like a boat on the sea.

6
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,502
It's really the only time I feel safe.

7
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,669
You stood in the breathing silence of
Gareth Jacob Hobbs' home,

8
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:37,927
the very spaces he moved through.

9
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:42,222
Tell me Will... Did they speak to you?

10
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,979
WIth noise and clarity.

11
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,514
You could sense his madness,
like a bloodhound...

12
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:55,737
I tried so hard to know
Gareth Jacob Hobbs.

13
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,535
To see him.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,702
<i>Gareth Jacob Hobbs, FBI!</i>

15
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:11,087
Past the slides and viles,

16
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:13,406
beyond the lines of the police report,

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,175
between the pixels of all those

18
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:21,119
printed faces of sad dead girls.

19
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:25,828
<i>See.</i>

20
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:34,067
How did you feel seeing Marissa Shore,
impaled in his antler room?

21
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:42,674
Guilty.

22
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,323
Because you couldn't save her.

23
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,623
Because I felt like I killed her...

24
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,030
I got so close to him.

25
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,005
Sometimes...

26
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,601
I felt like we were doing the same things
at different times of day

27
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:03,328
like I was eating

28
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,266
or showering or sleeping
at the same time he was.

29
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,121
Even after he was dead?

30
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,732
Even after he was dead.

31
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:15,911
Like...

32
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,206
you were becoming him.

33
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:22,536
I know who I am.

34
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,659
I'm not Gareth Jacob Hobbs,
Doctor Lecter.

37
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,538
I can hide what happened to me.

38
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,980
All I need is a scarf to pass.

39
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,569
Hiding what happened to you
defeats the purpose of being here.

40
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,971
Sharing will help normalize.

41
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:18,243
I'm not normal... not anymore.

42
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,161
What happened to you was a...

43
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,220
Some of these women
aren't even sharing.

44
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,478
They speak in "little girl voices"

45
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,382
telling everyone what was done to them
without saying a word about it.

46
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,562
Certain traumas can
arrest vocal development.

47
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:36,700
And victims can sometimes broadcast
victimhood involuntarily.

48
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:39,165
Not me.

49
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:43,100
That's not necessarily true.

50
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,687
Your victimhood has a high profile.

51
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,198
celebrity victim.

52
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:52,945
Someone here asked me
if I kept my stained clothes.

53
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,880
How did that make you feel?

54
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,829
Like I wanted to go home.

55
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,493
But I don't have a home anymore, do I?

56
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,414
You will. You will,
I'll help you find it.

57
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:11,128
Abigail I'd like you to give
the support group another chance.

58
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,659
Supportgroups are
sucking the life out of me.

59
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,115
Well isolation can suck just as much.

60
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:20,940
You have to find someone to relate to
in this experience.

61
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:29,764
Hi.

62
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,859
- Do you have an appointment?
- Do you have a beer?

63
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:44,464
Interesting day with Abigail?

64
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,777
Yeah, with grief work.

65
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,574
Trauma, intervention.

66
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:54,901
It's all on course.

67
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:59,095
I think she might be wrestling
with a low grade depression.

68
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,013
She?

69
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:07,482
Nothing wrong with a little
self medication, right Doctor?

70
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,035
Professional neutrality be damned.

71
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:17,068
It's so hard to watch
a bright young girl go so adrift.

72
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,593
Perhaps it's time Abigail is released
from clinical treatment.

73
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,437
Released where?

74
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:24,695
Back into the wild?

75
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,413
Spending each day immersed in tragedy
may be doing more harm than good.

76
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:30,570
She should be out in the world.

77
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:33,657
Finding her footing, giving her
the confidence to move forward.

78
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:36,999
Abigail is in no condition
to tackle her real world issues.

79
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,187
- Where's she gonna live?
- I'm not suggesting abandonment.

80
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,388
Hannibal this is a girl who was
very attached to her parents.

81
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:47,724
You stepping in as a surrogate,
would only be a crutch.

82
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:51,860
I think Abigail need to figure
things out for herself in a safe

83
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:53,704
clinical environment.

84
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:56,722
And that will give her
the confidence to move forward.

85
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,510
I defer to the passion
of my esteemed colleague.

86
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,697
Passion's good.

87
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,752
Gets blood pumping.

89
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:13,319
- Tell me about your mother.
- Some lazy psychiatry Doctor Lecter.

90
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,528
Low hanging fruit.

91
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,860
I suspect that fruit is on a high branch.

92
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,055
- Very difficult to reach.
- So is my mother.

93
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:26,330
- Never knew her.
- An interesting place to start.

94
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,215
Tell me about your mother,
let's start there.

95
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,857
Both my parents died
when I was very young.

96
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:41,095
The proverbial orphan until I was adopted
by my uncle Robertos when I was 16.

97
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,223
You have orphan in common
with Abigail Hobbs.

98
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:47,684
I think you'll discover that you and I have
a great deal in common with Abigail.

99
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:52,201
She's already demonstrated an aptitude
for the psychological.

100
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:57,793
There's something so foreign about family,

101
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,338
like an ill fitting suit.

102
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:03,808
I never connected to the concept.

103
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:07,326
I followed my father
from the boatyards of

104
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:11,969
Biloxi and Greenville,
to lakeboats on Eerie.

105
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,588
Always the new boy at school,
always the stranger.

106
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:17,423
Always.

107
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,931
You created a family for yourself.

108
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,723
I've only connected a family of strays,

109
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:28,217
and thank you for feeding them
while I was away.

110
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,688
I was refering to Abigail.

111
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:41,695
A modified Budeaux Noir
from Ali Bab's Gatronomie Practique.

112
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,702
You promised to deliver
your wife to my dinner table.

113
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:49,233
Well we'll have to polish up our act,
we can't have

114
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,103
you diagnosing our marital problems
all in one fell swoop.

115
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,573
- What am I about to put in my mouth?
- Rabbit.

116
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:58,923
- He should have hopped faster.
- Yes he should have.

117
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:04,633
- But fortunately for us he did not.
- Mmm mmm.

118
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:11,018
Our friend Will seems haunted today.

119
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,391
We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled beneath Will's pillow.

120
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:19,026
He still suspects Abigail Hobbs
in her father's crimes.

121
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,228
Perhaps the nightmare under Will's pillow,

122
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,782
is that he was wrong about her.

123
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,070
Children tranport us to our childhoods.

124
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,163
Will may feel the tug of life
before the FBI, before you.

125
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:33,784
Simpler times in boatyards with dad.

126
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:37,653
That life is an anker streamed behind him
in heavy weather.

127
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,122
He needs an anker Jack.

128

129
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,802
Good evening Will, please come in.

130
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,398
Has christmas come early?
Or late?

131
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,896
- Was for Abigail.
- Was?

132
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:29,841
I thought better of it, I wasn't thinking
straight, I was upset when I bought it.

133
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,069
Maybe still am.

134
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:35,469
- What is it?
- A magnifying glass.

135
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,439
Fly tying gear.

136
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,138
Teaching her how to fish,

137
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:47,035
- her father taught her how to hunt.
- That's why I thought better of it.

138
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:51,797
- Pretty paternal Will.
- Aren't you?

139
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:52,923
Yes.

140
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,998
Our good friend Doctor Bloom
has advised against taking

141
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,679
to personal an interest
in Abigail's welfare.

142
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,358
And perhaps it's our responsibility

143
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,694
yours and mine to help her find her way.

144
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,851
I don't think I'm allowed to leave,
after I climb the fence.

145
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,609
I've made arrangements.

146
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,818
you could say I'm, one of your guardians.

147
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:28,462
- Where are we going?
- Home, my home.

148
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,642
I thought you might enjoy
if I cooked for you.

149
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:35,799
- I'll have you back before bedtime.
- Can't I spend the night?

150
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,137
I don't like sleeping here,
I have bad dreams.

151
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,869
- You have to sleep in your own bed.
- This isn't my bed.

152
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,271
Tell me about your bad dreams.

153
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,268
I had one where

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,392
Marissa was sending me picture texts.

155
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:02,655
Like crimescene photos of Nicholas Boyle.

156
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,454
- Gutted.
- How you left him.

157
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,883
Even though she's dead
I'm afraid that Marissa's gonna

158
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,767
tell everyone I killed him
and they'll think I'm just like my dad.

159
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:22,694
Sorry.

160
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,830
Can't really talk about this in group.

161
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,728
You don't have that luxury Abigail.

162
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:32,909
I just have to get used to lying.

163
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,185
You only have to lie about one thing.

164
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:44,306
And when you're with me
you don't have to lie about anything.

165
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:49,597
In the dream I wonder
how I could live with myself.

166
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,777
Knowing what I did.

167
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,535
And when you're awake?

168
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,969
When I'm awake I know I can
live with myself.

169
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,290
And I'll just get used to what I did.

170
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:07,215
- Does that make me a sociopath?
- No.

171
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,198
It makes you a survivor.

172
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:18,016

174
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,121
It's important to know
when it's time to turn the page.

175
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,665
Have you thought about
applying for schools?

176
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:46,010
My dad killed girls
from all the schools I applied to.

177
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,009
- Perhaps that can wait then.
- I wanna work for the FBI.

178
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,954
I would certainly feel safer
if you were in the FBI,

179
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,240
protecting my interests.

180
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,526
They wouldn't let me though,
would they?

181
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,403
Because of what my dad did.

182
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,637
Only if they believe
that's in your nature too.

183
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,610
Nature versus nurture.

184
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:13,447
You're not your father's daughter,
not anymore.

185
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,665
What if it weren't so painful anymore,
to think of him.

186
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:27,623
- My dad?
- Yes.

187
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,633
Have you ever tried Psilocybin?

188
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,615
- Mushrooms? That's what's in the tea?
- Yes.

189
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:42,238
There are those psychiatrists who believe
altered states could be used

190
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:42,957
to access traumatic memories.

191
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:45,885
I have all the access to
traumatic memories I need.

192
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,773
Unlimited access.

193
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:51,193
Which is why we need to supplement them
with positive associations.

194
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,258
No more bad dreams Abigail.

195
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,755
- You want me to do drugs?
- I want you to do this drug.

196
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,196
With my supervision it's quite safe.

197
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:06,586
Do you trust me?

198
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:39,783
Just like we talked about.

199
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,297
Doctor Bloom said this was ok.

200
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:59,124
Not at all, we often
have a difference of opinion.

201
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,111
- More secrets for us.
- Well.

202
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,450
You and I will have many secrets.

203
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:17,849
Infusing Psilosybin into the bloodstream
before psychotherapy

204
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:22,164
can illicit a positive even spiritual
experience for patients.

205
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:25,451
Psychological trauma is an affliction
of the powerless.

206
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,893
I want to give you your power back.

207
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,821
I don't feel so good.

208
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:35,288
That feeling will pass.

209
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:40,554
Allow it to wash over you, through you.

210
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,305
Let me be your guide.

211
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:47,893
You're making breakfast for dinner?

212
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:51,753
*** for eggs.

213
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:56,299
A chef in Spain called Muro claimed
he invented it in the 19th century.

214
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,866
Taste, is not only biochemical...
it's also psychological.

215
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,662
Sausage and eggs was the last meal
I was having with my parents.

216
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:10,964
I know. It's also the first meal
you're having with me.

217
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:15,202

219
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:21,279
As someone who makes such a deal
about common courtesy

220
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,668
I'm a little taken a back.

221
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:26,922
Slash a lot taken a back,
that you would take my patient

222
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,381
<i>my patient</i>

223
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,862
out of the hospital without my permission.

224
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,574
And I'm not a professional scold

225
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:38,784
but don't put me
in this position ever again.

226
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:43,427
I'm sorry.

227
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:47,193
Rude! Hannibal shockingly rude!

228
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:50,506
You have every right to be upset with me
I overstepped my bounds.

229
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:55,514
- Where is she?
- She's in the dining room.

230
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:06,052
And Alana... you were right.

231
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:10,855
Often am. You have to be more specific.

232
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,882
She wasn't ready to leave the hospital,

233
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:17,638
she... experienced a bit of anxiety
so I gave her a sedative.

234
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,168
- Sedative what did you give her?
- I only gave her half a Valium

235
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,921
but she may be a little hazy.

236
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:31,501
- Hi Doctor Bloom.
- Hello Abigail.

237
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,303
You were expecting me?

238
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,354
Please.

239
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,389
You hungry?

240
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,256
Hannibal made breakfast for dinner.

241
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,216
I could eat.

242
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,206
What is it?

243
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:06,373
Abigail.

244
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:10,583
What do you see?

245
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,526
I see family.

246
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,586
Hello.

247
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,802
Think it's to late for us to have kids?

248
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,574
It is for me.
