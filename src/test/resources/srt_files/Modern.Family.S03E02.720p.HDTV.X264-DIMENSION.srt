Oh, could you grab me
an extra virgin...

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:07,462
- I think one's enough for the sacrifice.
- Olive oil, Phil.

4
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:08,801
Come on. That's funny.

5
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:11,591
Oh, it's funnier than your
freestyle "sandwich rap."

6
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:13,104
Girl, you crazy.

7
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:15,947
I'm mad fun to shop with.

Hi.

00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:27,822
Oh, roadblock.

00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,739
- Beep beep!
- Pardon me.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,340
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

16
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:34,615
Actually, not okay.

00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:36,789
Not okay.

00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:40,246
Honey, did you pull
from the bottom again?

19
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,055
So after hors d'oeuvres,

20
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,728
we'll bring everyone in
here to share the news.

21
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,950
We're having the family
over tomorrow night

22
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:51,569
to tell them we're planning
on adopting a new baby.

23
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,120
Yes, and we both agreed

24
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,700
to--to go a little more low-key
with the announcement this time.

25
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:58,360
♪ Let's hear ... ♪

26
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:03,222
Okay, just to be clear,
this is low-key?

27
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,119
It's a banner

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,245
and just some light musical
accompaniment, Mitchell.

29
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:07,812
I don't have a lower key.

30
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:10,162
Besides, this is a happy occasion.
Am I right, Lily?

31
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:12,083
Aren't you excited to
get a new baby brother?

32
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:14,092
No! I hate the baby!

33
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:18,073
We are having a slight issue

34
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,030
getting Lily on board
with the adoption.

35
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:21,256
"I hate the baby."

36
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:22,047
"No new baby."

37
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,719
"I wanna make the baby dead."

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,497
I thought we weren't
gonna share that one.

39
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,056
I-I-I just hope
that the problem is

40
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,891
she hasn't spent much time
with any babies.

41
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,771
So we thought it would
be a great idea

42
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:35,316
to show her how much fun
it'll be to have one around.

43
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:37,415
Oh, he is so cute!

44
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,934
Yeah, and he never cries.

45
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,830
Literally never.
It's actually a little weird.

46
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,729
Oh, no, that's not weird.

47
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,009
My sister was born with
a full set of teeth.

48
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,538
- Yeah, that never happened.
- Oh.

49
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,819
No? Really?
You should've seen her crib.

50
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,426
It looked like beavers lived there.

51
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:50,752
Oh, is this Lily?

52
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:53,513
Oh, yes, it is. Hey, honey.
Say hi to the baby.

53
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,520
- My Daddy!
- Oh!

54
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,739
Okay, so that's
one problem solved.

56
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,055
Bye! See you soon!

57
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,062
Or never.

58
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,777
Cam, I'm a little freaked
out about what Lily did.

59
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,209
Oh, please. She barely touched him,

60
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,377
and he went from zero to big crybaby.

61
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,652
We're talking about bringing
another child into this house.

62
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:27,674
How's that gonna work with Lily
being so possessive of you?

63
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,526
Why am I hearing an accusatory tone?

64
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,007
Oh, come on. You have to admit
that you do coddle her.

65
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,326
I will not apologize for
loving our daughter.

66
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:36,636
I'm not criticizing.

67
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,145
I'm not only criticizing,

68
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:41,822
but we did talk about giving
Lily a little more independence.

69
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,917
Yeah, which is why we
put her in preschool.

70
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,417
Yes, but you can't bear
to leave her there.

71
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:46,610
You always pick her up early.

72
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:47,882
That is ridiculous.

73
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:48,893
Okay. Okay.

74
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:50,187
Lily, honey,

75
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,213
did daddy pick you up early
from preschool today?

76
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,327
No.

77
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:55,473
Case closed.

78
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,285
We didn't go.

79
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,524
Case opened.

80
00:02:58,525 --> 00:02:59,587
We went shopping.

81
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,122
That's enough.

82
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,807
We bought matchy hats.

83
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:05,218
You are going to your room.

84
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,527
You're both going to her room.

85
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,397
Do we spend a lot
of time together? Yes.

86
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,366
Do we have a special bond?
Absolutely.

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,545
But do I coddle her more than
any other loving parent?

88
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,743
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,566
It's possible.

90
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,161
And for Lily's sake, I should
probably work on that.

91
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,274
No, you calm down!

92
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:39,432
This is how I talk when somebody
accuses my Manny of stealing.

93
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,837
- Who is that?
- It's the principal.

94
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:43,266
He's saying that Manny
stole some girl's locket.

95
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:46,137
What, do you think that all
Colombians are criminals

96
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,533
because a Colombian necktie

97
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:51,198
is a symbol of violence
all over the world?

98
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,029
No, no, I'm not threatening you.

99
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:55,363
Okay. Apology accepted.

100
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,612
No, I didn't mean anything
about the necktie.

101
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:59,772
I just--
I was trying to make a point.

102
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,659
Could you "L"
A little less "O L"?

103
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,423
Don't you see what
I'm trying to do here?

104
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,710
Die alone?

105
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,963
Girls, dinner!

106
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,380
You know, why does Luke
get his own room,

107
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,884
and I still have to share with you?
I can't take it anymore.

108
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,887
Me either, even if it is
just for one more year...

109
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,722
When I leave for college.

110
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,774
It is one more year or when
you leave for college?

111
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,967
Because those happen to
be two different things.

112
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,800
So I hear this little voice
coming from the cans

113
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:32,599
and it's like...

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,604
"Help! I fell in the peaches!"

115
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,220
That's Mom!

116
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,487
- Hilarious!
- So hilarious.

117
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:39,849
I'm like, "Claire?"

118
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,559
You might wanna tell
them that it was you

119
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,185
who pushed me into the
peaches in the first place.

120
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:45,045
This again? I wasn't even near you.

121
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:46,943
Yes, you were!
You knocked me with the cart.

122
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,677
It was completely your fault.

123
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:51,147
Well, let's just agree to disagree.

124
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:54,252
No. I-I disagree to disagree.

125
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,453
Then you agree.

126
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,801
No. No, I don't,
because I'm right.

127
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,430
Okay, Claire.
You're right.

128
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:04,567
As usual.

129
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,485
No, I am right.

130
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:06,404
Like always.

131
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,572
Stop it. When I am wrong,
I admit it.

132
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:09,876
Which is never.

133
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,033
Fine. Fine.

134
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,426
Aah!

135
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,695
You're a little jumpy tonight,
Manny. Anything wrong?

136
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,647
No. Well, I'm just gonna--

137
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,099
Have a seat, kid.

138
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:24,063
You know, maybe it's me,

139
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,209
but I thought you were kinda
squirrelly tonight, you know,

140
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,748
before when your mom was on
the phone with the principal.

141
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,076
Almost like you wanted
to say something...

142
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,943
But you just couldn't.

143
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,055
Anything you wanna say now, Manny?

144
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:41,953
No. I have nothing to say.

145
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,335
You sure about that?

146
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,101
Think real hard.

147
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,055
Could I get a glass of water?

148
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,663
That girl's locket--
you took it, didn't you?

149
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:54,603
Um...

150
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,074
- Didn't you?
- Yes. Yes, I took it.

151
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,243
- I didn't mean to.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

152
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:03,133
You're gonna tell your mom,
and you're gonna set this right.

153
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,119
Do you understand?

154
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,478
All right, get out of here.

155
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,128
Just one more thing.

156
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,404
You're not, um...

157
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,044
You're not wearing
that locket, are you?

158
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,225
No. Of course not.

159
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,075
It's a girl's.
Why would I want to wear it?

160
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:20,318
It's no reason.

161
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:29,654
Mom, hurry up!
I don't want to be late for school.

162
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:31,706
You didn't tell her, did you?

163
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:35,826
What's the hurry this morning?

164
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:40,196
Okay, what's with the looks?

165
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,685
- It's like a silent
movie in here. - Okay.

166
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:45,495
I was walking behind this girl
Alicia, who's moving away,

167
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:48,023
and I was working up the
courage to get her new address

168
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,026
so I can write her.

169
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:51,199
I express myself a lot
better on paper than--

170
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,184
Tick-tock, kid.

171
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,660
Well, she dropped her
locket, and I picked it up,

172
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,133
but she kept walking, and I...

173
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,632
You stole the locket.

174
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,286
After I told the principal

175
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,970
that you could have never
done something like that,

176
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:06,498
and I threaten him with
the Colombian necktie!

177
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,003
Manny, why?

178
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,260
Don't worry. It wasn't 'cause
he wanted to wear it.

179
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,326
I thought I could keep it as
something to remember her by.

180
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:16,284
But then you were yelling
at Mr. Vickers,

181
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,131
and I-I was just too
scared to tell you.

182
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:19,002
Go to the car.

183
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,120
- I'm really sorry.
- Go.

184
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,320
Why would he do
something like that?

185
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:28,191
It's bad enough that he's
the boy with the pan flute

186
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,870
and the puffy shirts
and--and the poems.

187
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:32,662
Now he's the jewelry thief.

188
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:33,659
Might be an upgrade.

189
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,492
Ay, Jay, this is not funny.

190
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:37,160
Those things stick to you.

191
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,549
My cousin Rosa Marina--

192
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,743
when she was 14, she stole
something, and after that,

193
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:44,237
everybody thinks of her as
the girl who steals cars.

194
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:45,337
She stole a car?

195
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,493
Cars.

196
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:49,229
But after she got that label,
what else could she do?

197
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,105
Listen, you can't
control what kids think,

198
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:53,038
but you can make sure
he learns from this.

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,547
You take him to
the principal's office,

200
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:56,821
he owns up to it,
he never does it again.

201
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,096
Okay. Okay.

202
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,986
But what was he thinking?

203
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,732
This is not even real gold.

204
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:08,202
No way, Haley! It was my idea!
I'm taking this room!

205
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,332
Over my dead body!

206
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,533
This is going to be my room,

207
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,645
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

208
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,244
Seriously?

209
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:21,256
What are you guys
fighting about?

210
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:22,860
Okay, so we both think

211
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,962
that this would make a
totally awesome bedroom.

212
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,584
But only one of us can have it.

213
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:27,929
Don't you think it should be me?

214
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,036
Oh, so not. It should be me.
Right, Luke?

215
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:32,371
Why do you guys
wanna move into the attic?

216
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:34,114
Oh, you mean "the penthouse"?

217
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:38,325
With all the privacy of being
on its very own floor?

218
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,700
It is kinda cool.

219
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:44,490
I'm not an idiot.

220
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,113
I knew what they were up to,

221
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:48,477
but I've been wanting
to move for a while.

222
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,195
There's a line of ants

223
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,254
going to a trick-or-treat
bag in my closet,

224
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:53,801
and I don't want
to still be there

225
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,139
when they get tired of candy.

226
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,052
Good morning, princess.

227
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:58,903
Good morning, Lily.

228
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,345
Very adorable, Mitchell,

229
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,318
but I'm having
kind of a rough morning,

230
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,177
Daddy, up.

231
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,318
I'm sorry, Lily,
those days are over.

232
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,130
Now here's your lunch.

233
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,790
Go get your bag.
We will be leaving shortly.

234
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,070
Cam, you don't have to
ice her out completely.

235
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,598
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

236
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,956
But I need her to detach from
me before the new thing comes

237
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,654
or who knows what
she'll do to it.

238
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,502
Why are you saying "thing"
instead of "baby"?

239
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,308
Kill the new baby.

240
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,731
Oh. Um, look,
I-I-I know this is hard,

241
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,799
but I really appreciate
what you're doing.

242
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,472
And believe me,

243
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:32,956
I take no pleasure in seeing
you suffer like this.

244
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:34,909
I take a little pleasure.

245
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,290
No, but there--there are
very few parenting issues

246
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,298
where I come out on top.

247
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,339
You know, I'm distant.
I work too much.

248
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,940
My French braiding is "sloppy."

249
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,082
Finally, you know, something
that isn't my fault.

250
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,625
Ready.

251
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:50,565
Okay.

252
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,524
Could you please just go
put her in her car seat

253
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,734
while I compose myself?

254
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:54,636
All right, you know what, Cam?

255
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,396
Why don't I just take Lily to
preschool on my way to work?

256
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,254
I think that would be best.

257
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:00,640
Let me just whip up a smoothie
for you before you go.

258
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,115
I push the buttons, Daddy.

259
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:05,542
You certainly do.

260
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,790
What do you think the
principal's going to do to me?

261
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,275
I am a first-time offender.

262
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,992
Oh, great. Now I'm tardy.
Strike two.

263
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:17,240
Manny, think of this
in a positive way,

264
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,602
- like it is your "ha ha" moment.
- What does that mean?

265
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:21,572
That means that one day,
you're gonna laugh about it.

266
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,307
Ah, I should've just given
that stupid necklace

267
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:24,092
back to Alicia

268
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,097
when she was standing
right next to her locker.

269
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,307
This is the worst day of my life,

270
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,396
- till tomorrow...
- Oh.

271
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,455
- And every day after that.
- Oh.

272
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,164
Come on, Mom.
Let's get this over with.

273
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:37,893
- Wait.
- What?

274
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:40,446
Which one did you say that
it was her locker? This one?

275
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,865
Mm-hmm. The one that
smells like rose oil.

276
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,489
Mom?

277
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,129
Keep the lookout.

278
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:51,975
Now promise me that

279
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:54,576
you will never, ever do
anything dishonest again.

280
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:55,144
I promise.

281
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,294
Okay, because that's not
the way I raised you.

282
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,064
- Don't tell Jay anything, okay?
- Mnh-mnh.

283
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,369
- Hi, Lily.
- All right, Lily.

284
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,829
- Hi.
- Have fun, sweetheart.

285
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,754
Bye.

286
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:06,440
She is so sweet.

287
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,245
Oh, thanks. Well, you
should've seen her yesterday.

288
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,743
Yeah, she pushed a baby
off of Cam's lap.

289
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,264
- Huh.
- I know. I know.

290
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,150
She is so possessive of him,
but, you know,

291
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:17,931
Cam's really working on trying
not to coddle her so much,

292
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:19,119
- So... - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,167
I'm not really sure
it's about coddling.

294
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:23,069
Sounds more like
a sharing issue.

295
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,109
You know, we've noticed Lily
has a hard time with that.

296
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,084
- Really?
- I wouldn't worry.

297
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:30,326
Kids usually pick that
habit up from other kids,

298
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,620
except the ones that pick
it up from their parents.

299
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,778
We have a few of those in here.

300
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,397
Of course, I can't share
those names with you...

301
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,174
Until I get a glass
of wine in my hand.

302
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,969
Oh. Oh, miss Elaine.

303
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,670
I have been told
that I might have

304
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,672
the teensiest issue
with sharing.

305
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,410
But is that something Lily
would even pick up on?

306
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,744
My chicken.

307
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:56,689
My pillow.

308
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:58,107
Ow! Mmm.

309
00:11:58,842 --> 00:11:59,624
Daddy's pen.

310
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:03,779
Okay, it's possible.

311
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,805
And I suppose for Lily's sake,
I-I should work on that...

312
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,716
Privately, because right now

313
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:13,601
we really need to get Cam's
coddling problem under control.

314
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,180
What's going on?

315
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,938
Moving into the attic.

316
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:21,126
Give me a day or two to get
settled, then I'll have you up.

317
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:22,615
When did all this happen?

318
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,293
Depends on who you ask.

319
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,578
My plan's been in motion
for three weeks.

320
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:29,565
Honey, this is a terrible idea.
You're gonna hate it up there.

321
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,150
Mom, stay out of this.

322
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,969
Yeah. We all have our own rooms now.
Everybody wins.

323
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,088
Well, don't get too
comfortable in there, girls.

324
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:39,025
Luke, it's cold,
and it's scary up there.

325
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,943
You're gonna be back in your
own room by tomorrow night.

326
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,712
I don't know, Claire.
It's got a lot of potential.

327
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,063
This is a lot nicer

328
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,198
than the attic I lived
in when we met.

329
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,434
One night, if that.
Trust me on this.

330
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,432
Oh, yes, because
you're always right.

331
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,830
Sweetheart,
I would love to be wrong.

332
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:56,199
I just don't live with the
right people for that.

333
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,692
Let it go, kids.
She's not gonna budge.

334
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,744
- Kept me up all night with the--
- Phil, you did push me!

335
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:03,470
Your word against mine.

336
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:05,290
Guess it's one of those
things we'll just never know,

337
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,425
like what really happened
to the "Titanic."

338
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,507
It hit an iceberg.

339
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,372
- Maybe.
- Mm, there's no maybe.

340
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,608
Oh, you're right, Claire.

341
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,039
Again.

342
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,820
Surprise, surprise.

343
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,734
Okay, I-I will see you
over at Uncle Mitchell's.

344
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:22,489
I'm gonna skip this meeting
of the "Pile on Claire club".

345
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,660
Guess I pushed her
into that pile, too.

346
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,720
I spend half my life
waiting on you.

347
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,972
How many times do you have
to change your outfit?

348
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,508
Sorry, Jay.
Too many choices is a prison.

349
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,677
Just drive before
he rethinks the pants.

350
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:45,013
- What's wrong with my pants?!
- Go. Go. Go.

351
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,018
So, Manny, how'd it go
with the principal today?

352
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:53,505
It was terrible, but he was
brave, and now it's over.

353
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,173
- Right, Manny?
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:57,559
- Mm. So d-- - What'd they give you?
Detention? Suspension?

355
00:13:57,593 --> 00:14:00,294
No, just a warning because
it was first offense.

356
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,063
- So how was work?
- Great.

357
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:03,348
Just a warning, huh?

358
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,849
Like she said.

359
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,269
So I ask about work,
and you change the subject.

360
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:09,604
Are you trying to hide something?

361
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:12,407
No, I just wanna make sure he's okay.
You okay?

362
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:13,741
'Cause, I mean, it looks like

363
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,076
you're sweatin' bullets
back there, kid.

364
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,745
Stop grilling him.
First the principal, now you.

365
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,695
This poor boy has been
screamed at all day.

366
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:24,134
- Well, not to mention--
- Quiet! I've got this.

367
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:31,879
- Where is Lily?
-Um, she's getting dressed.

368
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,809
All by herself?

369
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,656
- Cam is encouraging her to
be more independent. - Oh.

370
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:37,864
And there she is!

371
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:41,156
- Ah! Ah!
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

372
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:42,485
- Mnh.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,769
She looks like she
was dipped in glue

374
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:45,787
and dragged through a flea market.

375
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:47,228
- Hey there!
- Hi!

376
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,063
- Hey, hey.
- Hi! Hi!

377
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,598
- Hi, guys. Come on in.
- How's it going?

378
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,421
Hey, do you guy
have any old furniture?

379
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,819
I'm moving into the attic.

380
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,654
- The attic?
- Hey, at least it's big.

381
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:58,920
Grandpa said you used
to live in the closet.

382
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,209
Oh. Okay.
Well, you know what?

383
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,711
Yeah, we'll absolutely find
you something for sure. Okay?

384
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:03,923
My Daddy!

385
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:05,453
Lily, no!

386
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:06,942
I-I'm sorry, Luke.

387
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:08,434
This isn't over.

388
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,548
Oh, my God. Mitchell,
she's getting worse.

389
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:14,128
I have turned her into a pushy,
little, entitled monster

390
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,767
on her way to a rap sheet and
a bracelet on her ankle.

391
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,100
Oh, she has a bracelet
on her ankle.

392
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:19,898
Cam.

393
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:21,964
Cam, Cam,

394
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:24,241
This--this might not be
entirely your fault.

395
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:25,015
No, it is.

396
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:26,155
I spoke with Lily's teacher,

397
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,957
and she thinks that--that she may
have a problem with sharing,

398
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,192
which she might have gotten from--

399
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:32,967
You. You don't like to share.

400
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:34,834
No, I do it to make
a point sometimes.

401
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:36,772
Like, if you want the chicken,
then order the chicken.

402
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,238
Wait, when did you talk
to Lily's teacher?

403
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,210
Uh, today, when I--when I
dropped her off at school.

404
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,940
And you let me suffer all day?

405
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,538
All right, look, we--we can't
do this with everybody here.

406
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:46,621
- Can we please just get
through the evening? - Yes,

407
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:48,155
but we are not making the
announcement tonight

408
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,424
because that is a joyful thing,

409
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,623
and I am not feeling
very joyful right now.

410
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:53,951
Well, I share your feeling.

411
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,273
Just so you know, I'm on to you.

412
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:04,089
You never took Manny
to the principal.

413
00:16:06,378 --> 00:16:09,175
Okay, play it like that,
but I know Manny.

414
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,969
He has more of a conscience
than you have.

415
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,184
He's not gonna be able
to live with this.

416
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,781
You'd be surprised what
people can live with, Jay.

417
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:26,370
Hi, miss Lily.
How's my big girl doing?

418
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:26,922
Good.

419
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:29,049
Can you tell me
how old you are now?

420
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:30,848
Three.

421
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,200
That's four. This is three.

422
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,167
Okay, show me again.
How old are you?

423
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,403
- Three.
- No! That many is four.

424
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:40,069
This many is three.

425
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,489
Don't argue, Lily.
You'll never win.

426
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,725
Really, Phil?

427
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:47,499
Okay, I-I was gonna wait
until we got home for this,

428
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,126
but now I think it's something
everyone's gonna enjoy.

429
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,019
Guys, everybody, come
on down to the TV room.

430
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,471
I've got something
really special to share.

431
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,537
Okay, how's everybody on drinks?

432
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:59,446
If this is Alex's graduation
again, just leave me the bottle.

433
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:00,622
I'm good, Cam.

434
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,307
Okay, everybody.

435
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,867
Showtime.

436
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,852
Oh, my gosh.
It's us at the market.

437
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,829
How did you-- uh-huh.
Yeah, it's security camera footage.

438
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,344
I don't understand.
What are we watching?

439
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,980
It ain't "The Godfather,"
I can tell you that much.

440
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,742
Okay, look, I fell
yesterday at the market,

441
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,285
and Phil and I have been
having a little disagreement

442
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,081
as to what happened. Just watch.
Okay, right here.

443
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:20,683
I stop to fix my shoe,
and then Phil--

444
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:21,807
right there. Okay.

445
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,242
He makes way for this
very attractive woman,

446
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,588
whom he conveniently leaves out
of his retelling of the story.

447
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,171
Now right here, Phil backs up,
pushes his butt into the cart,

448
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:32,892
pushes me into the cans!

449
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:33,595
- Do you see that?!
- Oh!

450
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:37,824
It's all his fault, just like I said!
I was right!

451
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:38,963
Suck it!

452
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:42,113
- When did you get this--
- Oh, my God.

453
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,262
That's why you wanted
to come separately.

454
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,200
You went to all that trouble
just to prove you were right?

455
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,686
It really wasn't that much trouble.

456
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,292
I just went to the store, found
your friend Jordan the bag boy,

457
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:52,538
who got me the manager.

458
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,086
He gave me the address of the
off-site security office.

459
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,408
I filled out some paperwork.
Sally faxed it to corporate.

460
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,680
Three minutes later, I'm buying
pack of DVDs and burning a copy.

461
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:01,585
Cake.

462
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,246
It's like a sickness.

463
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:07,216
What? None of you believed
me, so I got proof.

464
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:08,829
You should all be
sucking it right now.

465
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,130
Hey, please stop with the
"sucking it," Claire.

466
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,053
The children!

467
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:13,693
Yes, children are
very impressionable.

468
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:14,869
You'll never know
what they'll pick up.

469
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,667
Okay, Cam, I'm sorry that
I blamed it on you, okay?

470
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,411
But we both need to look
at our actions.

471
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,838
I mean, if we're thinking
about adopting another baby,

472
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,828
then we need to--

473
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:25,844
You guys...
you're adopting another kid?

474
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,715
- No! No, no! You're-- wait!
- Congratulations!

475
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:29,534
We're thinking about it.
It's not...

476
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:32,596
♪ Oh, let's give the boy oh, wow. ♪

477
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:36,365
What the hell's happening here?
Is that from "Footloose"?

478
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,095
Really, Mitchell?

479
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,151
You couldn't even share
telling your family!

480
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:41,597
Fine. Fine.

481
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:44,660
But why are you upset?
This is such good news.

482
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:47,596
No, we're a little on edge
because Lily has been acting out

483
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,064
like she doesn't want
a sibling, and--

484
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:51,059
Yeah, because Mitchell
taught her to hate sharing.

485
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,997
And/or because Cam wears
her like a fanny pack.

486
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:57,087
Oh, stop blaming each other.
No kid wants a sibling.

487
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,721
I mean, Claire hated you so much

488
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,730
she stuck you in a dryer
when you were two.

489
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,303
You put me in the dryer?

490
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,295
I did, but it wasn't
'cause I hated you.

491
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:05,553
My friend Marci said

492
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:07,988
that it wouldn't run with a kid
inside it, and I knew it would.

493
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:09,345
I was right.

494
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,621
Good governor.

495
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,651
It's been going on
since you were five?

496
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,495
- Oh, my God. It is a sickness.
- Yeah.

497
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,577
What would make me have that
need at such a young age?

498
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:23,072
How long was I in that dryer?
Because I--

499
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:24,555
is this why I'm afraid of tumbling?

500
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,751
I had to quit gymnastics, Claire!

501
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,384
- A childhood without tumbling?
- Ohh.

502
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:32,427
You knew this and just
stood by and did nothing?!

503
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,708
Okay, okay.
What's done is done!

504
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,562
All you can do is learn
from your mistakes.

505
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:38,220
And in that spirit,

506
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:41,829
I would like to propose a toast...
to Manny.

507
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,240
This week, he did something
he wasn't supposed to do,

508
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,545
- like we all do--
- Like we all do!

509
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,658
- Salud to Manny!
- Uh, not yet.

510
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,766
But Manny stood up like a man.

511
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,438
He admitted he was wrong
and he took his licks,

512
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,772
and I'm damn proud of him.

513
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:55,903
Ah, now we clink!

514
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,921
No, we clink when I say we clink.

515
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,651
So Manny made a mistake, but he
didn't take the easy way out.

516
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,175
He's got guts, he's got integrity.

517
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:06,834
As far as I'm concerned,
he's the best little b--

518
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:09,359
Okay, stop! Stop!
I didn't do any of that.

519
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,561
Mom broke into the locker and
threw the necklace inside,

520
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:12,970
and then we ran away like cowards.

521
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,832
- I'm sorry, Jay! I'm sorry!
- I knew it!

522
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,651
I was right! I was right!

523
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,127
Ohh.

524
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,554
- Who is it?
- Oh!

525
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:30,072
Hi, honey. It's just me.
Are you okay?

526
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:31,950
Yeah. I'm great.

527
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,584
So, how you liking your new digs?

528
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:36,439
- I know you told me that I'd be cold...
- Mm-hmm.

529
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,570
- And scared...
-  Mm-hmm.

530
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,690
But I'm not.
No, I can see that.

531
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,408
I was--I was wrong.

532
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,574
- You were.
- Yeah.

533
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,526
Well, you're gonna
hate this then, honey,

534
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:45,310
but I'm gonna need you

535
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,501
to go back down and sleep
in your old room.

536
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,946
I just--I'm worried if you
get something so cool

537
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,279
this early in your life,

538
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,912
you're not gonna have anything
to look forward to later.

539
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,923
I-I have to go now?

540
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:57,681
You can spend the night
tonight here if you want.

541
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,931
Oh! No, if it's so
important to you,

542
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:01,683
I'll go now.

543
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,333
You should come, too.

544
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,720
Something sleeps over there.

545
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:11,946
Wait for me. Wait.
Wait for me! Wait for me.

546
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:17,946
