00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:07,546
It's been my privilege
to be treated like a protégé,

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,297
and for you to be my mentor.

5

We're going to

6

an arrangement is made...

00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,437
Tell them I want a partnership.

12
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:24,600
if they even talk
to ketchup again.

13

I want you to find out

So you haven't
officially told anyone

17
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,147
you're looking to change
your life?

18
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:14,115
Yes.

Why put Doyle Dane

20
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,887

is have what NASA calls

Still, Timmy, Don has
some anxiety about--

23
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,496
well, obviously about Raymond.

24
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:31,632
Heinz Baked Beans has given us

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,335
national recognition
and Raymond's a friend.

26
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:37,003
I'm not used to telling people
what my account is worth.

27
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,438
Not just in billings,

28
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,540
but in the prestige
that comes with ketchup.

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,342
Don knows that
or he wouldn't be here.

30
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,476
He's not that polite.

31
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:46,446
Just relax.

32
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:48,381
If you do the work
and I like it,

33
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:50,250
I guarantee that Raymond
will fall in line.

34
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,783
I have that power.

35
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,385
And if you don't like our work?

36
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:55,654
Raymond never has to know.

37
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:57,456
I don't know if that
solves my problem.

38
00:01:57,524 --> 00:01:59,958
Look, I understand your risk.

39
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,660
Or we could have met
in your office again.

40
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,896
In fact, we can have
the presentation here, too.

41
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,398
No, we'll get a hotel.

42

I am supposed to be meeting
someone in about 20 minutes

Well, take your time.

And remember,

47
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,546
I don't need much of an

Well, it's available to you.

54
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:52,308
You know, if you ever have to
spend the night in the city.

55
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:53,976
I live here, Pete.

56
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:04,152
It's been 7:00

I'm starving.

I'm sorry I'm late,
but I have a job.

59
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,958
You know what, Dawn?
You have another job,

60
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,526
which is being
my maid of honor.

61
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:15,028
Well, I can't lose
that one, can I?

62
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:18,131
Well, I have some bad news.

63
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,100
Al called me

64
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,469
and he said both the caterer
and your date fell through.

65
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,005
William?
What happened?

66
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,207
Al doesn't think
he's ready to settle down.

67
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,309
And he didn't want you to spend
the night defending yourself.

68
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,143
You tell Al to keep looking

69
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,145
because I'm never gonna meet
someone at that office.

70
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,380
Al and I met at church.

71
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,148
Church is impossible.

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,584
You can't stand out
in that crowd of harlots.

73
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,288
You stand out.

74
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,723
You must run into
somebody downtown.

75
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,559
I get on the train
and it's just us...

76
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,529
and then it gets thinner
and thinner until about 72nd.

77

Sometimes it's just me
and this old shoeshine--

78
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,800
and he won't even look at me.

79
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,202
Bea Carter says her son
Anthony ran into you.

80
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,637
But that's what
you don't understand.

81
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,639
We were walking
through the plaza

82
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,708
and we passed each other
and we just nodded.

83
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,776
Someone told me he said that,

84
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,911
but he didn't talk to me.

85
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,613
And I didn't talk
to him, either.

86
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,284
Well, I'll keep looking.

87
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,288
That might be too much blush.

88
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:22,191
If you look a little rusty,
it's 'cause I'm a little rusty.

I need all the help I can get.

90
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:26,896
The makeup's
not the important part.

91
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:30,132
Mary Kay always says it's really
about making yourself feel better,

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,702
and that starts with
doing something for you.

93
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,303
Well, that'll be a first.

94
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,376
- Kate!
- Shh, I just put the baby down.

95
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,314
- You have not changed.
- Well, you have.

96
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:48,416
How did you suddenly
get younger than me?

97
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,884
Because she's in
the beauty business.

98
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,753
What do you think?

99
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,154
- How much did she spend?
- It's free.

100
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:56,724
This is my old stuff.
I'm a sales director now.

101
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,626
- How are your boys?
- Good.

102
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:00,561
- Did you see Kevin?
- She looked in.

103
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,163
Why don't we let him sleep
while we eat dinner?

104
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,631
I made a pork roast.

105
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,233
And I made reservations
at Le Cirque for two.

106
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:10,336
Well, I want to catch up.
And, more importantly,

107
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:13,172
Kate has a job interview tomorrow
and I don't want her tying one on.

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,375
- Who are you meeting with?
- The competition.

109
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,343
Can we take a raincheck?

110
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,478
Splendid.

111
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,747
She hasn't changed.

112
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,991
Why are you getting on
the elevator going up?

113
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,327
Because the door opened
and you were standing there.

114
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,030

00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,889
Just have a lot of my recruits
sell a lot of Mary Kay.

How much?
Those are diamonds.

I know.
They do.

You should visit more often.

145

Turns out
someone's proud of me.

146
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,382
- I'm a monster.
- ( laughs )

147
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,384
Believe it or not,

00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:51,821
I spent it with my in-laws
listening to Ed complain

162
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,490
about how much the world
hates Dow Chemical.

163
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,260
And I know that every gripe he has
is directed at me and this company.

164
00:07:57,327 --> 00:08:00,429
Is it possible that this has turned
Ken Cosgrove into a neurotic?

165
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,264
If he wants people
to stop hating him,

166
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,868
he should stop dropping
napalm on children.

167
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,271
I know you just came
here to complain,

168
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,106
but I actually think
that I can help you.

169
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,442
God, that's really true.

170
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,477
I just came in here
to complain.

171
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,344
How hard would it be to meet
with Ed, just you and me?

172
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,814
If I have a good reason?

173
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,749
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosgrove,
but it's the last one.

174
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,184
- Did you find your keys?
- I did.

175
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:25,152
Can you get Pierre
Cossette on the line?

176
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,754
I have an idea.
Let's see what happens.

177
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:28,355
Harry has great ideas.

178
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,642
I saw this thing on a spy show.

179
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,177
It's a clock
with a tiny camera in it.

180
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,114
All we have to do
is get it in there.

181
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,116
If you can get in,
you don't need a clock.

182
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,586
I would guess
it's a military account.

183
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:02,622
And I would guess
they picked Stan

184
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,255
because he has no conscience.

185
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:08,159
So Project K stands for what?

186
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,428
Project Kill Machine!

187
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:11,963
That's not what it stands for.

188
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:15,433
So what does
it stand for, Bobby?

189
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,335
I don't know what it is.

190
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,137
Are you saying that because
you <i>do</i> know what it is?

191
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:20,671
No.

192
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,340
- Stan come through?
- Stan who?

193
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:26,309
I know one thing-- he's not in
a room with tinfoil on the windows.

194
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,178
How are things, Don?

195
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,024
There's nothing in here.

196
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,825
'Cause you're gonna
fill it with work.

197
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:44,994
- If you don't fall asleep.
- Mmm.

198
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,131
I'm telling you,
it clears the cobwebs.

199
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:54,069
( sniffs, coughs )

200
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,538
(<i>"Friends I Haven't</i>
<i>Met Yet" playing</i>)

201
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,246
I think a hot dog and a
hamburger are too similar.

202
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,217
Plus, a hot dog
cries out for mustard.

203
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,587
No, I think a hot dog
cries out for ketchup.

204
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,224
A squiggly line.

205
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,496
Hmm.

206
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:24,531
I think we should order lunch.

207
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,866
( laughs )

208
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,373
( sniffs ) Mmm.

209
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:36,141
My goodness. Someone's having
a party and didn't invite us.

210
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,544
I don't know what
you're talking about.

211
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,214
Is Clara's birthday today?

212
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,916
It's tomorrow
and it's $2 a head.

213
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,951
And, actually, I don't know
what I'm going to get.

214
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,221
- Do you want to come?
- I can't.

215
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,255
Mr. Draper
always needs me.

216
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,757
Could you punch me out
when you leave?

217
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,526
Really?

218
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,962
How long are you
going to be gone?

219
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,797
Well, if you punch me out...

220
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,101
Okay.

221
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,537
I heard Mr. Draper's
in there.

222
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,273
No.

223
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,078
- Did you get the pages?
- No.

224
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:16,714
Are you two rehearsing already?

225
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,582
Call me when you see them.

226
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,217
Arlene, are you sad
it's not you?

227
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,018
You know Mel is my husband.

228
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,919
I could have him write you
into a hospital bed

229
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,388
or a grave.

230
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,729
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:38,667
What's going on?

232
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:42,638
Well, you're going to have
a love scene with Rod.

233
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:45,407
And between you, me, and
soon a national audience,

234
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:46,742
it's more of a love affair.

235
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,344
Oh, my goodness.

236
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:51,112
That's so exciting.

237
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,014
Thank you for telling me.

238
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,282
Oh, I did more than tell you.

239
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,317
Mel's been on the fence,

240
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,986
but I think he really
believes in you.

241
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,688
Now, don't embarrass me.

242
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,189
You've done this
before, haven't you?

243
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,825
Um, well, of course.

244
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,828
Does a high school play count?

245
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,196
No.

246
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,231
It's gonna be exciting at first

247
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,433
and then it'll be
part of the job.

248
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,169
It's pretty exciting.

249
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,906
The hard part is how "James
Garner" there will deal with it.

250
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,875
Some people think it's better to
wait till after it's happened

251
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,078
or not tell them at all, but I
think it's best to be up front.

252
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,780
( sighs )

253
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,383
Well, obviously
he's not going to like it.

254
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,352
Would you be upset if he did?

255
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,355
I don't know.

256
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,291
Why don't Mel and I take
you two out to dinner?

257
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,027
You know, to make
him comfortable.

258
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,295
And, honestly, all of us
should be better acquainted.

259
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,864
I mean, Mel has
big plans for you.

260
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,702
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

261
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,269
<i>( door opens )</i>

262
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,939
I'm gonna leave
you alone with these.

263
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,684
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere?
- No, Meredith.

264
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:10,587
Well, it's just I can't
find her or Mr. Crane

265
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:11,888
and there's someone to see him.

266
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,156
I'm dying for you to meet Ken.

267
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,061
How are you?

268
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,730
Busy.

269
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,633
Have Scarlett see me
when you find her.

270
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:33,908
Oh, good.
You're home on time.

271
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,344
I am. It's only because
I have a lot of work

272
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,246
and I don't want to do
it in a windowless room.

273
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,885
So why don't you have a seat?

274
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,286
I'm gonna get you a drink.

275
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:48,054
And then I'm gonna
stuff you with coq au vin.

276
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,692
I know you're very busy,

277
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,629
but I want us to have,
I don't know--

278
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:58,665
I want us to be able to talk
about things other than work.

279
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,501
Megan, what happened?

280
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,869
Just once I'd like
to be that wife

281
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,838
that lays a trap and has her
husband walk right into it.

282
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,841
Okay, first of all, Arlene,

283
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,777
you know, she plays
Penelope Aldridge.

284
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:12,912
She basically owns
"Berkshire Falls."

285
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:15,281
She's married to Mel
the head writer

286
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:17,316
and they want to have
dinner with us.

287
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:18,650
Does it get worse?

288
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,756
Well, my storyline
is getting more developed

289
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:27,025
and that means

290
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,227
I'm gonna have
a series of love scenes.

291
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,596
- With whom?
- With Rod Holly.

292
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,932
He plays Rafe Jackson.
He's Arlene's nephew.

293
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,900
Megan, I don't care.

294
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,636
What's a "love scene"
consist of?

295
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:41,305
It's just kissing and hugging.

296
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,308
It's TV. We can't
really do anything.

297
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,546
What am I supposed to say?

298
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:52,448
That you trust me.

299
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:56,117
And that you know
it's part of my job.

300
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:59,788
And maybe that it was bound to
happen if things went well.

301
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,690
Keep going. I'm dying to
hear what I say next.

302
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:02,925
Should I have
hidden it from you?

303
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,462
( sighs )

304
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,329
I don't know, Megan.
I need to think about it.

305
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:12,399
Look, I know
I wouldn't like it,

306
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:15,002
but I'd look
on the bright side.

307
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,238
Okay, I guess if I
wasn't your husband,

308
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,707
I would be happy for you.

309
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:21,609
It does mean they like you.

310
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:24,010
Do you like me?

311
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,113
Honey, I can tolerate this,
but I can't encourage it.

312
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,216
You're perfect.

313
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,527
And, honestly, Ed, it's not just Ken
who's been losing sleep about this.

314
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:41,163
<i>I mean, last week when half of
Colombia got into your lobby--</i>

315
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,698
It was 15 people.

316
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:46,467
Look, you've been in
the news every other day

317
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:48,202
and a couple of articles
placed in business journals

318
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,603
are not going
to make that stop.

319
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,139
They acted like they
were storming the Bastille.

320
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:53,941
This is their country, too.

321
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,111
What exactly is your point?

322
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,046
Pierre.

323
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:02,482
A one-hour prime-time TV
special sponsored by Dow,

324
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,918
starring Joe Namath and 15
or so of his best friends

325
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:08,121
putting on a show drawing from
America's most beloved musicals.

326
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:10,523
"Broadway Joe
on Broadway."

327
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,791
Joe Namath sings?

328
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:14,360
Don't you want to watch
it just to find out?

329
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:17,463
( laughs )
And who are his "friends"?

330
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,598
I have access to the
greatest talent available.

331
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,167
There'll be sex appeal. Joey
Heatherton, for example.

332
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:24,770
Pipes, Julie Andrews.
And punch.

333
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:27,939
How about John Wayne in a
sketch version of "Camelot"?

334
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:30,442
We're mostly
household products.

335
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,743
Women don't like football.

336
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:33,678
Have you ever asked them
about Joe Namath?

337
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,480
Forget demographics.

338
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:38,350
How would you like Dow to be
responsible for making people smile?

339
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:41,820
And is there anything
that makes people smile

340
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:43,587
more than Broadway
and football?

341
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:45,422
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" and
the Notre Dame fight song

342
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,257
playing at the same time.

343
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,993
♪ I'm a Yankee
Doodle Dandy... ♪

344
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,128
- ( humming fight song )
- ♪ Yankee Doddle, do or die... ♪

345
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:54,565
Okay, okay.

346
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:57,300
Kenny, did you tell them
I went to Notre Dame?

347
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:59,602
No, I told them
about Joey Heatherton.

348
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,104
( laughs )

349
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:04,173
So it's tailor-made
for us?

350
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:06,942
What's our commitment?

351
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,578
Well, you'd be a corner tenant.

352
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,646
There's six minutes
of commercials in the hour,

353
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,416
you'd get three and then
two 10-second billboards

354
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,751
at the beginning
and end of the show.

355
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,519
"Brought to you
by Dow Chemical,

356
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,621
family products
for the American family."

357
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:26,361
Just imagine
Joe Namath in a straw hat.

358
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,532
<i>( phones ringing )</i>

359
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:38,639
I'm sorry
to bother you, Scarlett,

360
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,875
but is Mr. Crane in?

361
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,911
Okay.
No, he's in a meeting.

362
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:45,345
Is there something
I can help you with?

363
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:48,080
Well, if he's expecting
any special guests,

364
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,983
you should let us know because he had someone
come yesterday and you weren't here.

365
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,352
I must have been
in the ladies' room.

366
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:57,323
No, and it's strange because
you didn't leave until 6:47.

367
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,526
Oh, Joan, it's Clara's
birthday today

368
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,861
and I tried to go at lunch,
but I got stuck at my desk.

369
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:04,195
So I left Mr. Crane
on his own

370
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,931
while I attended
to this company business.

371
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,136
We got her a Givenchy
scarf from Gimbels.

372
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:13,939
I have the card here
for you to sign.

373
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,575
But you never came back and you
had Dawn punch your time card.

374
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:18,343
No, Dawn and I
were working together.

375
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,411
But we were all over the place.

376
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,581
But mostly in accounting.

377
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,850
Thank you for clearing that up.

378
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,722
( sighs )

379
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,560
Dawn.

380
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,628
Have you spoken
to Scarlett this morning?

381
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,498
We're missing the big hole punch and I
think you were the last one to see her.

382
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,667
The hole punch
is in the creative lounge.

383
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,135
Dawn, Scarlett
told me everything.

384
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:50,774
Scarlett, you're fired.

385
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:56,545
Joan, please.
It won't happen again.

386
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:59,414
Not here it won't.
Go get your things.

387
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,116
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Don: <i>Dawn, could you get Stan in here</i>

388
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,318
- <i>before the partners meeting?</i>
- I'll deal with you later.

389
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:08,923
Girls do it all the time.

390
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,992
Just go before you really
embarrass yourself.

391
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,027
( sobs )

392
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,967
I hope you realize this means
now you're on Ed's radar.

393
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,969
So will I be invited
to Sunday dinner?

394
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,537
Something like that.

395
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,974
I don't know where you're going, but
I want you to bring back champagne.

396
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,377
Oh, Harry, I'm not coming back.

397
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:31,712
What are you talking about?

398
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,083
Joan, you owe
Scarlett an apology.

399
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:39,152
Harry, please don't
involve yourself in this.

400
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm tired of your
petty dictatorship.

401
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,390
So whatever capital crime or treason
she committed, she's in my department.

402
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,826
I didn't realize you were
that attached to Scarlett.

403
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,495
- We're not attached.
- We are attached!

404
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,531
I have something
more important to do.

405
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,399
I would hope you do, too.

406
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:57,969
Scarlett, do whatever
you think is best.

407
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:00,304
You are to do
whatever <i>I</i> think is best.

408
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,449
Let's go.
Back to work.

409
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:14,317
Everything's fine.

410
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:23,661
I understand
the confidentiality,

411
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:25,162
but I need to know
how to bill Project K.

412
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,734
Don't.

413
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,369
Meredith, why
don't you step out?

414
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,042
I don't know what she said because I'm
not privy to these conversations,

415
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,409
but I would like the chance
to defend myself.

416
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:42,645
- Mr. Crane, I haven't--
- No, please.

417
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:44,813
<i>Let him go on.</i>

418
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,285
Well, it's this simple-- Scarlett works
for me and Joan tried to fire her.

419
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:52,454
She left work early and had
Dawn punch her time card.

420
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,422
It's pay for a minimum
of five hours of work

421
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,225
that she didn't do
that we are paying for.

422
00:20:57,293 --> 00:20:59,194
Well, it's either me or her.

423
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:01,662
- Joan?
- Scarlett.

424
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,232
I think you mean,
"If she goes, I go."

425
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,234
"Broadway Joe
on Broadway."

426
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:10,204
Is there anybody in here
who thought of that?

427
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,840
- I did.
- What the hell is that?

428
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,875
It's $150,000 worth
of incremental business

429
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,778
I generated while solving a problem.
For what?

430
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,414
So I can stand outside that glass
and watch you all in here?

431
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,683
- What did Dawn do?
- Well, I'm almost positive--

432
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,852
Just keep talking to her
because she's a partner.

433
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,655
You know what?

434
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,657
I'm sorry my accomplishments
happened in broad daylight

435
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:33,125
and I can't be given
the same rewards.

436
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,760
What is that supposed to mean?

437
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,262
You know damn well.

438
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,563
The next time this group
is called to order,

439
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,398
I expect to be sitting
at this table.

440
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,768
I've actually earned it.

441
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,050
Don't worry, dear.
That's not going to happen.

442
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:02,153
Joan, I don't want to put myself
in the same camp as Harry,

443
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
but I might remind you
and everyone

444
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,990
the Commission on Human Rights
is continuing to investigate

445
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:09,626
our industry regarding
the employment of Negroes.

446
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,662
She's a good secretary.

447
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,496
Of course.

448
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:15,532
What about Scarlett?

449
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,702
I think this humiliation
will suffice.

450
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,469
Can we continue
with the billings?

451
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:22,437
Yes.

452
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:23,939
Where were we?

453
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,811
"Meredith, why don't you
step out?"

454
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,680
Well?

455
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,682
Oh.

456
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,207
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't leave.

457
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,943
I don't care as long as you
brought those bridal magazines.

458
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,778
What is wrong with you?

459
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,247
I had a day today that
pushed your stupid wedding

460
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:51,648
to the bottom of the list.

461
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:53,617
- Did you get fired?
- No.

462
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,585
I don't think so.

463
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:57,520
Who can tell at that place?

464
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:59,488
What happened?

465
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:01,457
One of the girls
asked me to punch out

466
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,326
her time card
and we got caught.

467
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,494
I told you, those girls
aren't your friends.

468
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,630
Yes, they are. She got
in more trouble than me.

469
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:09,732
Why do you think she asked you?

470
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,967
You can't say no
'cause you're too scared.

471
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:13,468
All they see is,
"Yes, sir."

472
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:15,070
Everybody's scared there.

473
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:17,539
Women crying
in the ladies' room.

474
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,208
Men crying in the elevator.

475
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:21,810
It sounds like New Year's Eve
when they empty the garbage,

476
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,678
<i>there are so many bottles.</i>

477
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,714
And I told you about that poor man
hanging himself in his office.

478
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,582
Oh, they got it so bad,

479
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,684
they must all
be jealous of you.

480
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:33,487
What am I gonna do? Throw a
brick through their window?

481
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:37,558
I want to keep my job,

482
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,627
so I'm gonna keep my head down.

483
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:42,162
Well, I couldn't do it.

484
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,464
Well, you don't have to.

485
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,732
You're getting married.

486
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,169
And dinner.

487
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,539
Kate: <i>I should have
brought Dennis.</i>

488
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:55,742
You're not even
listening to me.

489
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,710
I'm sorry.
I need a drink

490
00:23:57,778 --> 00:23:59,411
and this place
is a soda fountain.

491
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,281
I feel like I'm in high school
right down to the clientele.

492
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:04,817
- ( phone rings )
- ( girls giggling )

493
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:06,685
Hello?

494
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,922
We're sitting here waiting
for a phone to ring.

495
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,123
This actually is high school.

496
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:12,792
So what do you do to have fun?

497
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:13,892
I don't look in a guidebook.

498
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,994
This wasn't in
a guidebook, okay?

499
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:17,628
My friend told me about it.

500
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:20,531
Is she a nun or just the
right age for this place?

501
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,502
Apparently there are
quite a few men here

502
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,271
who go for a certain type.

503
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,907
Oh.

504
00:24:28,974 --> 00:24:31,341
Joanie, don't judge me.
I'm in New York.

505
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,383
Good evening, ladies.

506
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:42,252
If there's anything you need,
I'll be over there.

507
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,321
Catherine's got a lot
of tables, so don't hesitate.

508
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:46,255
I'm Leo.

509
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:48,991
I'm Kate.
And this is Joan.

510
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:55,832
Actually, I don't think
our phone is working.

511
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:58,701
- Can you test it?
- I'll see what I can do.

512
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:04,405
How many girls come in here and
complain that their phones are broken?

513
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:07,209
He's cute.
Reminds me of Scotty.

514
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:08,910
Well, don't marry him.

515
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,812
That was the worst
six months of my life.

516
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,647
You always did
everything first.

517
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,983
But you did everything smart.

518
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:18,153
Well, tonight we're just
a couple of young secretaries.

519
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:21,322
- ( phone rings )
- ( gasps )

520
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,423
Answer it.

521
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,293
Ahem.
Hello?

522
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:27,895
How did you do that?

523
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:29,497
I didn't do anything.
He likes you.

524
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:31,499
What?

525
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,201
Oh.

526
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:36,170
Just a minute.
Let me ask my girlfriend.

527
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:38,038
He wants us to meet him
after his shift.

528
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:39,573
Well, tell him
you know a place.

529
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,775
But I don't.
Do you?

530
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:44,044
- Should I invite him to my room?
- No.

531
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:46,413
We were just trying
to think of a place.

532
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:47,714
Tell him to think of a place.

533
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:49,449
Do you know of a place?

534
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:51,150
Oh, good.

535
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,920
- Hang up.
- Till then.

536
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,855
( laughs )

537
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,523
Okay, now I need a drink.

538
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:02,428
Do you honestly believe
a few jokes

539
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:05,164
on the "Smothers Brothers"
are really upsetting people?

540
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,199
<i>I think it's the sponsors</i>
<i>and the network</i>

541
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,467
don't want to have
a conversation about the war.

542
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,670
I'd like to have an evening without
a conversation about the war.

543
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,140
( all laugh ) Arlene: <i>Darling, you</i>
<i>shouldn't smoke so much.</i>

544
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,075
The weight you lose
isn't worth the wrinkles.

545
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,244
Mel: <i>See, I think the sponsors</i>
<i>are for the war.</i>

546
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,313
They don't want to have
any dissent.

547
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:24,348
Don, you're a writer.
You know this is censorship.

548
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,018
I am a writer
and I'm against the war,

549
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,321
but when you buy a commercial,

550
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,923
you're hoping that the consumer

551
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,590
is in a good mood when
they hear your message.

552
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,727
So if you agree on
a wholesome variety show

553
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,662
and all of a sudden
it's filled with satire--

554
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,964
the most threatening
humor there is--

555
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,666
you're worried about people
hating what you're selling.

556
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:48,905
Megan, let's talk about you

557
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:51,975
and how you found this man.

558
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,077
( laughs ) I could cast
you, you know that.

559
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,347
Yes, I'm sure he is a man
who plays many roles.

560
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,650
Luckily you don't have
to worry about censorship

561
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:04,619
with the show
because it's so tame.

562
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,755
Mel: <i>Of course it's for
daytime entertainment.</i>

563
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:08,590
It's for housewives.

564
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:11,426
It has to be
a little titillating.

565
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,428
<i>We have our own standards.</i>

566
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:15,196
Although they've been
very liberal with us.

567
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:18,433
But, you know,

568
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,468
when we do things on the show,

569
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,636
it's all very tasteful.

570
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:24,305
Well, it's not real life.

571
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:29,876
Why don't you let me
get the check?

572
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:32,612
We go back to our pad,
smoke some grass,

573
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,382
and... see
what happens.

574
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,917
Sounds like fun.

575
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:40,287
I don't know.
It's late.

576
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:42,289
Arlene:
It's not.

577
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,357
Look, if you don't
smoke grass, that's fine.

578
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:47,259
It's not everything
we had in mind.

579
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,028
I'm not sure if I understand.

580
00:27:50,897 --> 00:27:52,531
We like Megan.

581
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,733
And we like <i>you.</i>

582
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:57,370
And we'd like to be friends.

583
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:59,170
Us, too.

584
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:03,875
Well, then...

585
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:08,613
I guess it's not impossible
under the right circumstances

586
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,649
for us to become
better acquainted.

587
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:17,154
Hey, it may not work.
It's a chemistry experiment.

588
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,924
I have a big day tomorrow.
You both know that.

589
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,560
That's work.
This is play.

590
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,328
I have to get up very early.

591
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:26,030
That's what
black coffee is for.

592
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:27,798
I make it delicious.

593
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:30,267
Uh...

594
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,168
maybe another time.

595
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:35,405
Arlene, we've heard
"no" before.

596
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:37,707
I guess there's no reason
to skip dessert.

597
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:43,780
- ( Kate laughs )
- What?

598
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:47,450
This is the best seat.

599
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,618
St. Marks between
2nd and 3rd, please.

600
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,456
Have you been to
the Electric Circus?

601
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,625
- All the time.
- We're from out of town.

602
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:00,563
Let's see who kisses better.

603
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:03,798
I'm not playing this game.

604
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,199
Because she'll lose.

605
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,943
( giggles )

606
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:26,753
What the hell was that?

607
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,521
What? They like you
and they like me.

608
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,624
They'd like us to be friends.

609
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:33,026
They were so out in the open.

610
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:35,428
It was a good strategy.
I kept thinking

611
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:37,930
he was going to ask me for a
job directing commercials.

612
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,999
Maybe he was waiting
for tomorrow morning

613
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,301
- when we were basking in the afterglow.
- Don't.

614
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:44,904
Just a pile of arms and legs.

615
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:47,607
I don't know whether
to laugh or be sick

616
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:49,709
because now I think

617
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:51,710
that's the reason
they gave me the scene.

618
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,111
I'm sure they've tried that

619
00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:55,080
with plenty of people
who haven't gotten scenes.

620
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:59,017
Don, I have to go
back to work with them.

621
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:01,987
It'll be better than ever.
How long have they been married?

622
00:30:02,054 --> 00:30:04,555
18 years.

623
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:06,524
(<i>"Bonnie & Clyde" playing</i>)

624
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:22,339
I'm busy.

625
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,974
Come up for air.

626
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:27,176
Oh, hey.

627
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:30,046
Would you mind?

628
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,121
This is my friend.

629
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:40,522
I'm Johnny.

Bonnie and Clyde.

Well, war or no war,

Nixon doesn't think he's
running against Johnson.

He thinks he's running against
the ghost of Kennedy.

00:31:35,274 --> 00:31:37,576
- So does Johnson.

644

I don't know where Helen is.

645
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,113
How are you both this morning?

646
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:43,682
Frankly, we're a little
embarrassed.

647
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:47,284
Well, if that has anything to do with me, I apologize.
That was not my intention.

648
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:49,253
How are Jennifer,
Bea, and the twins?

649
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,688
It's Nathan and Steven, right?

650
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,325
Yes.

651
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,860
They're well, thank you.

652
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,530
That display

well, of initiative

654
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,066
really caught our attention.

655
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:08,605
This is a check for $23,500.

656
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:11,174
That's the full commission
on "Broadway Joe."

657
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:14,244
Well, thank you.

658
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,645
That's a lot of money.

659
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:22,251
So, anything else to say?

660
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:25,687
I'm puzzled. What do you
make a year, Mr. Crane?

661
00:32:25,755 --> 00:32:28,022
22. So what about
the partnership?

662
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,559
You want some of the spoils.
Well, there you go.

663
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:32,594
We have to get bigger
before we get bigger.

664
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:34,696
What a load of crap.

665
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,865
- You know, Joan's not even in yet.
- Leave her out of this.

666
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,733
Bert, you know
how important I am

667
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,234
to this company.
You were me.

668
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:44,538
I was different than you,
Mr. Crane, in every way.

669
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,277
- So you don't want the money?
- No, I've earned the money.

670
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,647
But I've also earned
a partnership.

671
00:32:52,714 --> 00:32:55,415
I really hope some other firm
doesn't figure that out first.

672
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:01,288
That was the most
impressive thing he's done.

673
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,323
Should we fire him
before he cashes that check?

you staked this out
on your own.

I always had Dennis

Even when I went to Mary Kay.

701

You didn't.

And I never will.

How'd that happen?

704
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:56,463
The whole reason
I even talked to Avon

705

It's not what you think.

709

You're an executive.

710
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,143
It's a title.

711
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,878
And money.

712
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:14,580
I've been working there
for 15 years

713
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,150

me like a secretary.

incomplete.

726

One thing.

727
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,259
"Pass the Heinz."

728
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,828
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.

729
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,198
It's Heinz.
It only means one thing.

730
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:09,599
It feels like half an ad.

731
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,935
The greatest thing
you have working for you

732
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,604
is not the photo you take
or the picture you paint.

733
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,707
It's the imagination
of the consumer.

734
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:21,110
They have no budget.
They have no time limit.

735
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,112
And if you can get
into that space,

736
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,647
your ad can run all day.

We will test it both ways.

742

It's a testament to ketchup

00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:42,630
that there can be no confusion.

744
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:44,165
Let me chew on it, fellas.

So, what's the difference
between ketchup and catsup?

759
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,863
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,

760
00:37:53,931 --> 00:37:55,665
comes in a bigger bottle,

761
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,034
is cheaper, but tastes
just like ketchup.

762
00:37:59,837 --> 00:38:01,704
Now, we know that's not true,

763
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:03,639

your competitors are saying.

766
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:11,513

But I always say

770
00:38:18,987 --> 00:38:20,888
if you don't like
what they're saying,

771
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,424

This is the key
to the supply closet

00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,888
You don't understand
that this is punishment.

793
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:13,995
Well, I don't care
if everybody hates me here

794
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:15,897
as long as you don't.

795
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:18,400
We'll see.

796
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:24,372
So there's two of us.

797
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,541
We're both
the same size agency.

798
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:29,377
You're not afraid of
a little heads-up baseball.

799
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:31,713
I only did it because no one
else was supposed to know.

800
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,881
I think everything
should be done in secret.

801
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:37,051
Lock me in that Project K room,
I'll work on anything, Don.

802
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,354
I miss it already.

803
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,658
Mind if we join
the Lonely Hearts Club?

804
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,894
Who says we're not celebrating?

805
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:50,731
J. Walter Thompson.
They bought it in the room.

806
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:54,468
Are you kidding me?
We paid for that room.

807
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,669
What do you know?

808
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:59,272
The biggest agency
in the world.

809
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,973
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

810
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,909
See, I just got off
the phone with Raymond Geiger

811
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:05,645
and he said that you
were at the Roosevelt

812
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,680
giving a presentation
to the ketchup brand manager.

813
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:10,283
But I said that was impossible
because how could that happen

814
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:11,951
at my firm without me knowing?

815
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:13,719
Because no one
was supposed to know.

816
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:18,156
Let me get a rye rocks
and an Old Spanish.

817
00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:20,191
I'm sorry, Ken.
Damn it.

818
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,793
I'll call him.
I'll work it out.

819
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:23,395
Don't bother.

820
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:26,097
He doesn't even want
to give us 90 days.

821
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:27,599
There's nothing better than
being known for your loyalty.

822
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:37,175
You hear that, Ted?

823
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:39,677
Vinegars, sauces,
and beans is available.

824
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:41,579
Help yourself.
It's a gold mine.

825
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:43,547
Ted:
<i>They'd love that.</i>

826
00:41:43,615 --> 00:41:46,483
There's a pie and they
slice it into pieces

827
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,652
and they throw the tiniest
piece into the yard

828
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,720
and let all the small
agencies fight over it.

829
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:52,890
Speak for yourself.

830
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,695
It was worth the risk.

831
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:03,699
I think I see a friend.

832
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:17,179
Please, Rafe,
you have a family.

833
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:18,914
I have a family
that ignores me,

834
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:21,082
that treats me like
I've never been there.

835
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,619
But you, you make me
feel new again.

836
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,754
I work for you.

837
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,690
And for her.

838
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:31,359
She's good to me.

839
00:42:31,427 --> 00:42:33,160
Stop fighting.

840
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:34,461
I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

841
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:37,564
This is your bed
you share with her.

842
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:38,966
I can't.

843
00:42:47,742 --> 00:42:49,943
Rafe, we can't.

844
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,012
<i>Corinne, don't deny this,</i>
<i>what's between us.</i>

845
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,715
<i>Don't deny me when</i>
<i>I know you feel it too.</i>

846
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,884
I do.

847
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:05,724
( gasps ) Rafe.

848
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,160
( softly ) You like
to watch, do you?

849
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:11,429
Megan:
<i>Oh, Rafe.</i>

850
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:12,998
Director:
<i>And we're clear.</i>

851
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:16,134
<i>Everyone to</i>
<i>the conservatory set.</i>

852
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:18,270
- <i>Very nice, everyone.</i>
- You did great.

853
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:20,272
Thank you.

854
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:25,809
Megan, your agent's here.

855
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,120
That was steamy.

856
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:42,025
So I should go change
and we can go.

857
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:43,493
I'll keep you company.

858
00:43:54,337 --> 00:43:56,038
What are you doing here?

859
00:43:56,106 --> 00:43:57,907
Because you didn't
want me to see that?

860
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:01,009
No, and I don't understand why
you'd do that to yourself.

861
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:03,645
It's a hell of a lot better than
letting my imagination run wild.

862
00:44:06,382 --> 00:44:08,617
The first time you come
to set is for this?

863
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:11,252
I've been here for months. What did
you think was going to happen?

864
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,621
I didn't expect you
to enjoy it.

865
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:14,255
It's acting, Don.

866
00:44:14,323 --> 00:44:16,724
Were you gonna brush your teeth
at least before you came home?

867
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:20,027
I'm sick of tiptoeing around you every
time something good happens to me.

868
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:22,329
This is my job.
No, my career.

869
00:44:22,397 --> 00:44:25,666
You kiss people for money.
You know who does that?

870
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:29,269
You couldn't stop it, so I guess
ruining it was enough for you.

871
00:44:29,337 --> 00:44:31,171
Would you rather
have not known?

872
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:33,640
You never watch the show. It'd
be like it never happened.

873
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,342
Why don't you have dinner
with Arlene and Mel tonight?

874
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,210
They're much more
open-minded.

875
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:46,052
( sobs )

876
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,667
( raps softly )

877
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,040
That's been out there all day.

878
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,713
Was it going to be
out there all night?

879
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,015
Yes.

880
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,468
- Take that off.
- Why?

881
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,203
It doesn't mean
anything to you.

882
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,738
It does to you.

883
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,573
It does.

884
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,711
So what do you do
when I leave here?

885
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:51,046
Get on your knees
and pray for absolution?

886
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,351
I pray for you.

887
00:45:57,419 --> 00:45:59,120
For me to come back?

888
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:01,322
No.

889
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:07,361
For you to find peace.

890
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,200
