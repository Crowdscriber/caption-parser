1
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:04,784
So we're going to Santa Barbara
to pick up the bassinet.

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:06,268
Or we can save five hours

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:07,915
and go around the corner
to Baby Town.

4
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:08,985
What are you doing all day?

5
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:10,629
- Jay!
- It's fine, mom.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,905
No, it's not fine.
Today's Manny's birthday.

7
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:14,521
Aw, jeez. I'm sorry, kid.

8
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:17,492
Don't worry. Reuben's family's
taking me for a birthday lunch.

9
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,749
You see?
Even the Reubens remembered.

10
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,270
We'll be back at 6:00,

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,094
and we're taking you to
a special birthday dinner. Okay?

12
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:25,466
- We are?
- Jay!

13
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,941
I'm sorry, kid.

14
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:29,160
I wasn't sorry.
It was a setup.

15
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,008
We're throwing him
a big surprise birthday party.

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,834
And he totally fell for it,
the little jerk.

17
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:37,712
I mean, that's the whole point
of a surprise party.

18
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:39,492
You take someone
who you really love

19
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,008
and you play 'em like a fool.

20
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,327
That's not the whole point
of all this.

21
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:45,463
Manny has been feeling
a little bit neglected,

22
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:48,410
and I wanted to give him
the most special day.

23
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,830
This is the last birthday

24
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,740
that it's only going
to be the three of us.

25
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,069
I can't wait to see
the little dope's face.

26
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,935
...And then that smug
Carol Chu was all,

27
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:58,971
"you can't dig without
an environment impact study."

28
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,139
And them I was like, "bam!"

29
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,671
And then I slapped
the study onto Charlie's desk,

30
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,617
and Carol was like,
"but--but--but--"

31
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:05,518
and then I was like,
"chu on that!"

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,245
You said that?

33
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:09,054
Well, not with my mouth.
With my eyes and my swivel.

34
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,256
So how was your day at work?

35
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,672
Oh, you know, fine.

36
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,284
Yeah?

37
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,896
I'm an idiot.

38
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,871
I know Cam's been struggling
since he went back to teaching.

39
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,632
The students, the faculty--

40
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,012
none of it's clicking.

41
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:26,818
The last thing he needed was me
going on about my latest work triumph.

42
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,848
And then it got worse.

43
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,900
Come on, daddy.
It's time for our wedding.

44
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,823
- What's happening?
- Oh, Lily and I are gettin' married.

45
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,412
Uh, what's happening?

46
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,287
When she proposed,
I thought it was a little weird,

47
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,920
but then I read it's a phase
that some girls go through.

48
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,240
So... oh, no, well, I just think
it's the cutest thing ever.

49
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,905
Here, dad. I made you this ring.

50
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,922
Cute, cute, cute, cute,
cute, cute, cute!

51
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:51,273
Do you have a ring for me?

52
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:54,262
Well, Lily, it wouldn't be
a wedding without a ring.

53
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:57,333
- Yay.
- Loving this!

54
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,306
Daddy, move.

55
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,529
Okay, I guess I'll just go
sit on the groom's side.

56
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,632
Oh, come on, Cam. It's fun.

57
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,336
Oh, it's fun.
It's--it's super fun!

58
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,994
You finally got married!
Hooray!

59
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:09,955
Oh! Are you okay, sweetie?

60
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,581
What do you think?!

Geekus nerdipithicus
in its natural habitat,

65
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:33,981
- alone as usual.
- Mine.

66
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:35,433
Hey, give it back.

67
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,947
Gloria asked me to record
Manny's birthday. Mom!

68
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:41,923
Alex, give it back to your brot--
Mmm, sorry. I tried to care.

69
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:44,103
This is everything I made
at the boutique last week.

70
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,745
I'm not gonna have
any money left for me.

71
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:48,024
Should've thought of that before
you got thrown out of school.

72
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,319
You live here, you pay rent.

73
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,293
You used to be fun.

74
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,776
You used to be-- what?
Oh, yeah, at college.

75
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,036
Uh, hang on. Wait.

76
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,855
Gloria says that we are surprising
Manny 6:00 tonight,

77
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:57,814
but she wants us there at 4:00,

78
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:59,931
which means she's expecting us
to do the setup.

79
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,032
I say we leave here around 5:00.

80
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,074
Great.

81
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:04,348
That's Kenny from work.

82
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh, I'll get it.

83
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,049
We're going to a street fair,

84
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,533
so we'll just meet you
guys at the party.

85
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,186
Oh. You've been spending
a lot of time

86
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:12,038
- with this Kenny from work.
- Stop it right now.

87
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,338
Is it gettin' romantic?

88
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,085
- N-- 
- Yeah...

89
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:17,975
- Well...
- Yeah.

90
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,672
Mom, this is Kenny.
And, dad, you already met.

91
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:24,487
Uh, yeah. First of all,
Kenny, sick ponytail.

92
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:25,817
Oh, thanks, man.

93
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,777
- Kenny designs jeans for our boutique.
- Uh-huh.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,507
Oh! That reminds me.
I got something for you.

95
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,124
What are you, a 32-34?

96
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,611
What are you, 36, 38?

97
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,824
- What are you, in my mind?
- Put 'em on your body.

98
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:35,767
Will do. Will do.

99
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:37,271
Phil, honey, d-- Uh--

100
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:39,963
Kenny is kind of a big deal.

101
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,480
What does that fashion
web site call you again?

102
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:44,384
A "Jean-ius."
Spelled like "jeans."

103
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:45,188
- Oh.
- Mortifying.

104
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:47,100
- And a "rack star."
- Ohh.

105
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,780
Hey, what was the headline again?

106
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,667
Oh, yeah. "He's denim-ite."

107
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:52,126
What an embarrassing week
you've been having.

108
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:53,125
- Ooh. Yeah.
- Mm.

109
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,598
I'm just trying to stay fresh
creatively, you know?

110
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:57,148
Made my bones in men's apparel,

111
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:59,520
and now I'm working
with these local boutiques...

112
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,230
Just trying to get
into girls' jeans.

113
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:03,099
- Phil!
- There's no Phil here!

114
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:05,002
These jeans just slipped
on me so perfectly,

115
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:06,889
my name must be pantsarella.

116
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,834
- Boom!
- Comfortable, right?

117
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,074
- Like a diaper.
- Mm.

118
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,337
- Well, we should get going.
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:14,145
Um, but you wanted
to say... something.

120
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,922
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.
- Yeah. Okay.

121
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:16,934
Uh, listen...

122
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:21,498
You made it seem like
you had jeans for both of us,

123
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:24,059
and Claire hasn't gotten
hers yet, so...

124
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,521
- I am so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

125
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:27,756
Here you go.

126
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:30,427
- Enjoy.
- Kenny, you're amazing.

127
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:31,398
No, man. Have fun.

128
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,409
You're amazing.

129
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:36,012
I love him.

130
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:36,735
Phil!

131
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,410
- You think he likes me?
- Phil!

132
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,745
That is a date.
They're going on a date.

133
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,284
What? He's practically my age.

134
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,636
Okay. Uh, yeah, right, right.

135
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:45,471
And what middle-aged guy
would be interested

136
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:48,488
in a young, attractive,
newly legal woman?

137
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,695
Oh, that's right! All of them.

138
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:51,132
That's not true. I wouldn't.

139
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,127
Really?

140
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,728
Hermione Granger?

141
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,392
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,293
I'm just a "Harry Potter" fan.

143
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:57,898
Yeah.

144
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,854
Has she blossomed
into a lovely young lady?

145
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,527
Yes, but-- Luke, I'm never 
telling you anything!

146
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,473
Oh, my God, Jay!
Look how beautiful!

147
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,019
Look at this.
But the bookstore is empty.

148
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,998
That's why China's kicking our ass.

149
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,754
33!

150
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,354
Ay, no. 59.

151
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,706
We're so late, and we still
have to pick up the drinks.

152
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,266
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry.
Excuse me.

153
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,166
Sir? This is my cake right here.

154
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,560
How about I'll just
leave money, I take it?

155
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,336
Sir, if I did for you,
I'd have to do it for everyone.

156
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:23,937
Not if you just did it for me.

157
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,293
33!

158
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,278
Excuse me. Excuse me. Mm.

159
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:30,171
We're in a hurry.
We have a birthday party.

160
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,481
Oh, why didn't you say something?

161
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,137
We don't see many
of those around here.

162
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:35,325
You think you can intimidate me
with that attitude?

163
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,939
- What do I look like to you?
- 34!

164
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:41,368
Thank you, but the point is
that my son is waiting in--

165
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:43,120
Gloria, it's not worth it.
We don't need these people.

166
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,846
- Jay, we need-- 
- Come on. We'll get a better cake.

167
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:46,710
Are you crazy?
How are we gonna--

168
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:49,011
I've got it covered.
Excuse me, miss?

169
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:51,731
I'm sorry I raised
my voice in there,

170
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:53,006
especially in front of the baby.

171
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,355
I know how delicate they can be.

172
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,349
Oh, you're so nice to say that,

173
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,247
- but you know they're sturdier
than you think. - Yeah.

174
00:05:58,248 --> 00:05:59,418
In fact, every day
I learn these little mir--

175
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,620
Yeah, take care now.

176
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:05,707
Hey, honey.

177
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,683
Daddy, what's in the bag?

178
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:08,953
Oh, it's a present for Manny,

179
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,630
and I also got your other
daddy a little something

180
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,285
'cause he's been
feeling down today.

181
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,347
How's your eye, sweetie?

182
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,716
Oh, it's fine.
It's just a scratch.

183
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,066
Let's go this way, honey.

184
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,163
Oh, Cam, are you wearing
a suit to Manny's birthd--

185
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,361
Oh, wow.

186
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,184
Okay, let's get
your hospital band off.

187
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:22,132
I like it.

188
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,757
- Okay, that can be your
"something blue" then. - Cam?

189
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,846
Daddy, I wanna drive my car.

190
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,316
A car? Oh. A car.

191
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:29,214
Just a second, sweetie.

192
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:32,297
Okay, does anyone know a reason
why these two shouldn't be wed?

193
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:33,554
She's my wife.

194
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:35,474
Okay, so by the power vested in me

195
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,812
by the state of Candy Land...

196
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,630
And Utah.

197
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,478
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

198
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,920
Daddy, I wanna play
with my car now.

199
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:42,999
Okay. Of course. Yes, sweetie.

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,488
But remember, we have
to walk down the receiving line.

201
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,664
Oh! What a turnout.

202
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,283
Cam, y-you got her a car?

203
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,834
I can't help it that you
skimped on your wedding.

204
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:57,133
Okay, look, I-I know what's
underneath all this, all right?

205
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,633
Right now in your life,

206
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,424
- you're feeling, you know, very--
- No.

207
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:03,985
Please do not turn me marrying
my daughter into something ugly.

208
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,191
Lily is having the time of her--

209
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,754
Cam!

210
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:11,090
Oh, please. Do not blame me.

211
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,757
We always knew there was
a strong possibility

212
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:14,421
she'd be a terrible driver.

213
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,829
I know we're running late, Claire.
We'll be there soon.

214
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,407
Just start setting up.
What do you mean, "surprise, surprise"?

215
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:29,233
- Ay. Ugh!
- Hang on. I've gotta go. You take care.

216
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,384
- What's the matter?
- Jay, I can't find the parking ticket.

217
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,279
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

218
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,825
Oh, good. It's a male attendant.

219
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:35,529
What does that mean?

220
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,962
How would you get out
of this situation if I wasn't here?

221
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,460
- Mm!
- Hey, pal,

222
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,116
my housekeeper forgot her ticket.

223
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:43,367
You're going to need to back up,
go up to the third level,

224
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:44,955
and find the pay station.

225
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:47,508
Ay, you can't just let us go?

226
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,146
I know I put it somewhere here
but I cannot find it now.

227
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,927
Pay station. Third level.

228
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,108
Maybe you can let us go now,

229
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:57,566
and then next time
I do you two times?

230
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,799
The only way you're going to get out

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,066
is to go back to the pay station.

232
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,770
Actually, there is another way.

233
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,677
- Aah!
- You okay?

234
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,759
Let's drive through something else!

235
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,213
The gala celebration
is only minutes away.

236
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,814
Delectable refreshments,

237
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,446
excited classmates,

238
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:18,623
and what's this?
The most beautiful sight of all?

239
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:20,705
Go away!

240
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,432
He's old. She's young. It's gross.

241
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,033
Honey, nothing's happening.

242
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,293
Young people seek out
older mentors all the time.

243
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,096
When I was 17,

244
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:30,240
I was really close with
my friend Stacy's mom.

245
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,813
Mrs. Robinson was
a former cheerleader,

246
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:34,320
so she knew just how to massage
my legs after practice.

247
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,194
She had her own homemade
bengay that didn't burn

248
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,768
no matter where
she rubbed it on me.

249
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:38,809
If I had the chance
to go over there,

250
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,275
I never missed an opportunity.

251
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:41,723
I think maybe you did.

252
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,211
Oh, I forgot the present in the car.

253
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,662
Oh. All right. I'm gonna go take
a squirt while you grab it.

254
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:47,938
- Oh! Hey!
- Oh, my...

255
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:49,444
- I know!
- I love us!

256
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,878
It's crazy! Mwah!

257
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,956
- I'm gonna fight him.
- Phil.

258
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,531
No, Claire, I'm gonna
fight him up real nice.

259
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,357
How about you start with a threat?

260
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,240
Hey, Claire, um, could you
help me with this?

261
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,133
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

262
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,306
Yeah, you gotta go
around the other side.

263
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,000
- I need to keep my eyes on Phil.
- Ooh, what's happening?

264
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,433
He's about to drop the hammer
on Haley's new boyfriend.

265
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,562
He's twice her age,
and it's disgusting.

266
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,935
Yeah, reminds me of a certain manager
at the Cheesecake Factory

267
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:16,875
that you dated.

268
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:18,224
- Oh. Todd.
- Mm.

269
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,901
He had a Camaro... and power.

270
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,994
Ugh! He was nasty.
You just did it to get a rise out of dad.

271
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,310
Yeah, well, look how well
that worked out.

272
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:26,372
It didn't bother dad at all,
and then I was stuck with a guy

273
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,922
who smelled like potato skins
and said "supposably."

274
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,801
Well, you have to admit,
dad played that pretty brilliantly.

275
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,113
You know, after a few weeks,

276
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,265
you got bored with him,
and then you dumped him.

277
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:35,616
I did.

278
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,296
I dumped him up real nice.

279
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:39,770
- Phil.
- Claire. Oh, come on.

280
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:41,522
Phil, you can't say
anything to Kenny.

281
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,863
- What?
- No.

282
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:44,765
I know why Haley is doing this.

283
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,039
She's doing it to get back at you
for being so hard on her.

284
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,412
I did the same thing to my dad.

285
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,963
First of all, I'm not your dad.

286
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,617
And do you think
I'm just gonna let this happen?

287
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:53,741
Trust me.
The more it bothers you,

288
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,115
the longer he stays.

289
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,749
The more we ignore it...

290
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,523
Up top, dad!

291
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,530
Yeah!

292
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:03,584
Nailed it.

293
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,048
The sooner Willie Nelson's
on the road again.

294
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,164
I'm so conflicted.

295
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,092
What you're saying
makes sense up here,

296
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,378
but it's not what I wanna do here.

297
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,812
And I just feel so damn
comfortable down here.

298
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,945
I forgot to tell ya
I put that in the trunk.

299
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:19,357
- Oh, I know. I had to reach
under your jeans. - Oh!

300
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,219
- I can't believe that!
- We're so crazy!

301
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,045
It's adorable! Mmm!

302
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:25,935
Wanna see outside?

303
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

304
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,089
Sweetie, I brought you a cookie.

305
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,164
I ate at the emergency room.

306
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:35,940
Oh. You worked that in seamlessly.

307
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:37,396
Oh, come on.
It was-- it was an accident.

308
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:39,413
Stop beating yourself up.
Hey, let's go mingle.

309
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:40,120
No. You know what?

310
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,811
Some of my students are here,
and I'm just--

311
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:43,265
- I'm not in the mood.
- All right.

312
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,750
Cam, we're gonna talk about this.
I know what's going on.

313
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,664
You're obviously going
through something at school.

314
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:50,495
You're struggling, and I have
just made things worse

315
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,236
by bragging about what a hero
I've been at work recently.

316
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,150
And it--it's-- 
it's not a competition.

317
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:56,484
You know, my victories
are your victories.

318
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:58,340
- Your defeats are my defeats.
- Hey, Mr. Tucker!

319
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,629
There he is!

320
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,904
- We love you, Mr. Tucker!
- We love you! - You're the best!

321
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,662
- Bye! Bye!
- He's-- yeah.

322
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,826
Yeah, it's been a nightmare.

323
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:22,194
And thank you for assuming
I'm terrible at my job.

324
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:25,776
No. Um...

325
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,377
Hey, everybody.
Sorry we're late.

326
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,188
We got caught doing
a bunch of stuff.

327
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,173
Or not doing a bunch of stuff.

328
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,457
Okay, Manny is going
to be here soon,

329
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,636
so let's go over the plan.

330
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:38,240
When we hear him coming,
we turn off the light.

331
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,183
Then when he comes in
and turns it on,

332
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:43,039
we all scream "surprise!"

333
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,519
You got a pen?
I wanna write this down.

334
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,797
He's coming up the driveway!

335
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:47,862
He's here early! Hurry up!

336
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:50,939
Hurry! Hurry!

337
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,228
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

338
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,456
Quick. I don't want
the neighbors to see us.

339
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:56,432
You're sure we're alone?

340
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,791
Yeah. They're not home till 6:00.

341
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,377
Good, 'cause I wanted to give you
your birthday present.

342
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:06,898
Actually, I'd like to see your face.

343
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,539
It's harsh, I know.
I begged them to put in a dimmer.

344
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,587
No!

345
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,560
Surprise.

346
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,474
Manny, we're so sorry.
We didn't mean to--

347
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:21,227
What? Ruin the greatest
moment of my life?!

348
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,516
Thanks again, mom!

349
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,306
And the surprised
becomes the surpriser.

350
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:28,571
This party had everything.

351
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:30,689
Manny?

352
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:38,500
Manny, please come out.

353
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,516
Unless you're here to cut
a food slot on my door,

354
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:41,671
you can leave now.

355
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:44,036
Nobody's going to make fun of you.

356
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:46,083
Kids make fun of you
if you get a haircut.

357
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,508
I just gave them
a full-blown sex scandal.

358
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,724
No, everybody's so excited
to celebrate with... you.

359
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:54,529
Ay, no.

360
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:57,357
The baby was ready,
but I was not.

361
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:00,946
It was bad enough that Manny
had to share his mother.

362
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,760
I couldn't let him
share a birthday, too.

363
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,549
You stay in there!

364
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,882
I thought you wanted me
to come out.

365
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,495
I do! I do! Come out!

366
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,451
We stole you
a beautiful birthday... cake.

367
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,608
Gloria, tag out.
Let me give it a shot.

368
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,113
Yes, you fix it.

369
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:19,376
Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, kid.
That was rough.

370
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:20,548
Go away!

371
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:21,916
But there's an upside.

372
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,030
The best thing about kissing a girl

373
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:25,631
is you get to tell your friends.

374
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:27,890
The problem is,
they never believe you.

375
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,392
But you had witnesses.

376
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:32,699
Ha! We're gonna be talking about this
one for years to come, aren't we?

377
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,178
You said it, Kenny.

378
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,952
Manny seems to me like a--
like a real old soul.

379
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:40,128
- Kenny is amazing at telling
the age of a soul. - Mm-hmm.

380
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:41,365
- Aw! Thanks, babe.
- Oh!

381
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:45,067
Age is nothin' but
a state of mind, you know?

382
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:45,675
Yeah.

383
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:48,780
I mean, I'm probably more of
a 14-year-old than he is, and...

384
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,557
Mm-hmm. Believe me,
I know 14-year-olds.

385
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:52,075
He has a 14-year-old daughter.

386
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,280
- Oh. Yeah.
- Oh, cool!

387
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,897
Oh, honey! You don't have to do that.
They have a gardener.

388
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,005
Trust me on this.

389
00:13:59,006 --> 00:13:59,606
I want to,

390
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,824
but you're just so wrong
about so many things.

391
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,897
Just keep practicing.

392
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:08,689
Hey, Cam, I-I'm so sorry
that I insulted you earlier.

393
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,570
I thought that there was
something going on at work,

394
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:12,497
and, ugh, obviously,
I was wrong.

395
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,144
Well, you're wrong again.
It is about work.

396
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,451
This is a fun game.

397
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:17,739
I didn't bring it up before
because I was embarrassed.

398
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:21,506
But yesterday was the best day
I've had at work yet.

399
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:24,034
I clicked with the students,
the teachers.

400
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:26,526
- I finally felt like I belonged.
- I get it.

401
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,398
You couldn't possibly get it.
I'm in the middle of my story.

402
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,536
I'm sorry.

403
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:32,003
Every day at 2:30, I call Lily,

404
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,541
and we dunk a cookie together.

405
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,838
And yesterday...

406
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:36,692
I forgot.

407
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,825
Forgot my own daughter.

408
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,750
And obviously,
she resents me for it.

409
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,974
It's why she asked you to marry her,
to get back at me.

410
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:46,128
Okay, here I-I need
to point out that she's 5

411
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,721
and not a character from "Dynasty."

412
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,291
And as much as I try
to connect with her,

413
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,010
I just keep making it worse.

414
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,699
Maybe you're just trying too hard.

415
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:54,557
Everybody, come in!

416
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,047
Manny's coming... down.

417
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,964
Somebody pick up that towel
before someone trips.

418
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,657
Okay. I got it.

419
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,788
Daddy!

420
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,727
Okay! Daddy's coming!
What's wrong with me?!

421
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,525
Okay, everybody. So...

422
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,887
We sing, then presents, then cake.

423
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:13,274
That's a Colombian tradition.

424
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,499
And we do not speak
of what happened before.

425
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,088
Nobody saw anything.

426
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,681
That's another Colombian tradition.

427
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,253
Here he is, the man of the hour!

428
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,527
Gloria, you okay?

429
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,413
No, I'm fine! I'm fine.

430
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:31,064
Hap-- Aaah! Aah!

431
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,726
No way! She peed!

432
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,294
Her water broke!

433
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:37,239
So far, 14's not my favorite age.

434
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,143
No, it's nothing!
Keep singing! Keep singing!

435
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,725
We're gonna pop on
over to the hospital.

436
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:44,907
Pizza's on the way.

437
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,785
You think about it,
run a mop over this area?

438
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:49,037
Ay, Manny! I'm so sorry, okay?

439
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:52,177
And the birthday video
becomes a nature film.

440
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,227
Luke, come on.

441
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,154
Oh, my gosh! It's happening!

442
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,039
Ay. Ay, Manny,
I am so sorry about today.

443
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,136
I just wanted you to have
a happy birthday.

444
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,402
And speaking of birth-- days...

445
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,835
Don't listen to him.

446
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,533
I'm not letting this baby out
before midnight.

447
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,875
This is your day.

448
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:16,393
I'm not gonna let you
share it every year, okay?

449
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,896
Mom, look.

450
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,517
Yeah, I've felt
a little neglected lately,

451
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:23,177
but I've had you
to myself for 14 years.

452
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,054
That makes me a little sad.

453
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:27,801
Oh, please. If we had actually
forgotten his birthday,

454
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:30,174
he'd be out right now
kissing a cute brunette.

455
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:31,414
Things work out.

456
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,463
You know that I love you
no matter what?

457
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,548
You're trying to hold
another person inside of you

458
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:40,200
to spare my feelings.
Message received.

459
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,075
Ooh, that's a strong grip.

460
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,726
Ah, that's a--that's a-- that's a-- ooh! Ooh.

461
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,031
Oh, jeez!

462
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,584
Ah, she's gettin' close.

463
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:52,827
She's at, like,
8 beautiful centimeters.

464
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:56,900
Hey. I don't think we've met.
I'm Kenny.

465
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,908
Hi. I'm disgusted.

466
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,722
Mitchell, she won't even look at me.

467
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,751
Well, she can't really
look at anyone.

468
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:07,768
Oh! Look who's back...

469
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,209
Again. What happened this time?

470
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,033
He threw me in the pool.

471
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,334
- Uh-- oh, no.
- No, that's not what happened.

472
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,736
It kind of is.

473
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:18,224
Luke, come on.
We don't need to relive it.

474
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:20,036
- Daddy!
- Oh, look at this.

475
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:22,101
- I'm coming! Daddy's coming!
What's wrong with me?! - Mitchell.

476
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,984
When she fell in the pool,
she screamed for daddy.

477
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,577
She calls you "dad."
She calls me "daddy."

478
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:30,501
- She got scared, and she
called out for me. - See?

479
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,603
I guess daddy was
worrying about nothing.

480
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,852
But, you know,
I can be silly sometimes.

481
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,342
- You're always silly.
- No, you're silly.

482
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:39,777
No, you're always silly.

483
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:41,620
No, you're always silly.

484
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,029
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with me?

485
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:45,464
The contractions are
coming a little bit closer.

486
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:46,800
I think we have
to call for a nurse.

487
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,199
No, no, Jay! No, please!
I'm sorry.

488
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,127
For what?

489
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:51,102
I don't know yet,

490
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,912
but I know that babies
make mothers crazy.

491
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,606
And I'm going to be
making mistakes,

492
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,578
and the I'm going
to be blaming you.

493
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,796
Please don't leave me

494
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:00,637
you're a little emotional right now.

495
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:03,479
But it's been so long for me,

496
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,576
and a hundred years for you.

497
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,684
Are we still going
to be good at this?

498
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:08,999
It's gonna be an adventure,

499
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,841
but that's what you and I do best.

500
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,163
Look at today.

501
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:15,033
I can't ever remember
having more fun with you.

502
00:18:15,257 --> 00:18:16,575
I'm so lucky.

503
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:19,909
Now get out.

504
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,850
- But I thought you wanted me to--
- No, not you.

505
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,435
Get out!

506
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,941
Hey. Let's go.

507
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,480
Oh, right. Um...

508
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:33,351
Hey, guys?

509
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:36,022
So Kenny and I were thinking
about going to this restaurant.

510
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,497
Oh, sure. I don't have a problem
with that. Do you, Phil?

511
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:39,694
No.

512
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,582
In fact, it has been such a pleasure

513
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,346
getting to know Kenny,
it's our treat.

514
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:44,281
Are you kidding?

515
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:45,156
No!

516
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,821
Give them your credit card, Phil.

517
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:50,203
Also, uh, this restaurant
is pretty far away,

518
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:51,647
so we might be out late.

519
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:54,559
Well, sweetheart,
you are only young once.

520
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,261
Oh, might even make sense
to just stay in a hotel.

521
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,884
Okay. Put it on the plastic!

522
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,069
Great!

523
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:02,728
Okay. See you tomorrow!

524
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,000
Buh-bye.

525
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,627
Ugh. It's my ex-wife--

526
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:07,989
Not the good one.

527
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:09,809
What do you want?!

528
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:12,567
Nice game of chicken, Claire.
She's gone!

529
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,466
She is coming back.
I am almost positive.

530
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,489
- Almost?!
- Mm-hmm!

531
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,976
Why do I listen to you? Why?

532
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,723
You were wrong about
the iPod being a failure.

533
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,576
You were wrong about
tomato being a vegetable.

534
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,705
I don't even want to talk about
your favorite "planet" Pluto!

535
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,830
And unless she was lying
to the good ladies of "The view,"

536
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,903
it's "De-mi," not "Dem-mi"!

537
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:33,411
You were going
to let me go with him?!

538
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,247
Isn't that what you wanted, honey?

539
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:36,552
What's the matter with you?!

540
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:39,061
You've been acting so weird
ever since I left college!

541
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:41,354
For the record,
you didn't leave college.

542
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:42,411
You were asked to leave.

543
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,158
Oh, which you guys never
let me forget, especially dad.

544
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,845
Honey, your father--

545
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:49,065
Oh, you don't have to tell me
what he thinks, okay?

546
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,492
I'm a huge disappointment to him.

547
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,001
I see it on his face every day.

548
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:54,263
He acts as if he doesn't
even want me around.

549
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,353
Give me the ticket for the car.

550
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:56,556
- Phil--
- No, I'm going after her!

551
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:58,153
This little chicken game
may work for you dad,

552
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,330
but it doesn't work for me.
That's my little girl.

553
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:00,896
I need her to know

554
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,599
that no guy on earth
is good enough for her,

555
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,429
let alone some slimy,
middle-aged jean salesman!

556
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,475
What's this?

557
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,964
Just enjoy it.

558
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,892
There's all kinds
of milestones in life,

559
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,495
the kind you expect
to live through--

560
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,173
the first kiss.

561
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,107
Birthdays...

562
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,164
Graduations.

563
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:26,621
If you're lucky,
a wedding or two.

564
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,130
Or even a new addition
to the family.

565
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:36,181
Then there's the kind

566
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:38,599
you never dreamed you'd get
to live through again.

567
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,449
So adorable!

568
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,598
So sweet!

569
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,847
Oh, my goodness!

570
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,132
Look at him. He's perfect!

571
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,555
Look at him. He's so cute!

572
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,920
And that's the best kind of all.

573
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:58,064
Why am I spoiling it for you?

574
00:20:58,198 --> 00:20:59,703
You'll see for yourself.

575
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:10,057
- Oh, was it difficult? 
- Ay, si.

576
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:13,106
It was the most painful
20 minutes of my life.

577
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,203
Oh, well, look at that!

578
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:16,715
- You're skinny again.
- Yeah.

579
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:17,813
Yeah.

580
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,902
So wait.
He-- he's my uncle?

581
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,660
No. He's your half-brother-in-law.

582
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:22,637
He's our uncle.

583
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:23,912
Half-uncle or full uncle?

584
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:24,772
What's a fuluncle?

585
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,565
Okay, so don't feel like
you gotta stick around.

586
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,928
- Okay. We'll see you tomorrow then.
- Okay, we'll be back tomorrow.

587
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,653
- Bye, uncle.
- Congrats.

588
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,037
- Bye.
- He's adorable!

589
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:33,929
Is he?

590
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:37,636
- I don't like this one bit.
- We'll talk.

591
