1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,599
-ELLA: How's your blog going?
-Hmm, fine. Good. Very good.

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,199
-Written much?
-Not a word.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,479
John, it's going to take you a while
to adjust to civilian life.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,599
Sure.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,599
And it will help so much to write about
everything that's happening to you.

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,239
Nothing happens to me.

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,479
As far as we can see,
no marks on the body.

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,439
-No identification.
-Same as the others.

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,159
Exactly the same.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,759
(SIGHS)

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,439
Um, you're not phoning him are you?

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,079
Because we can handle this.
We can absolutely handle it.

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,319
You've got work to do.

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,479
This is Inspector Lestrade.
Please call me as soon as you get this.

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,679
I think we're going to need you.

16
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,199
John! John Watson!

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,759
-Stamford. Mike Stamford.
-Right.

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,839
-We were at Bart's together.
-Yes, sorry. Yes, Mike, hello.

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,639
-Yeah, I know, I got fat.
-No...

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,519
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at.

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,079
What happened?

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,199
I got shot.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,519
-So you still at Bart's, then?
-Teaching now.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,159
Bright young things, like we used to be.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,879
God, I hate them. What about you?

26
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,879
Staying in town
till you get yourself sorted?

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,679
Can't afford London on an army pension.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,359
I don't know, get yourself
a flat-share or something?

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,279
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,559
(MIKE CHUCKLING)

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,719
What?

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,799
Well, you're the second person
to say that to me today.

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,919
Who was the first?

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,239
How fresh?

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,359
Just in. Sixty-seven, natural causes.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,119
Used to work here, donated his body.
I knew him. He was nice.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,679
Fine. We'll start with the riding crop.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,279
So, bad day, was it?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,959
(EXHALES)

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,519
I need to know what bruises form
in the next 20 minutes.

41
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,039
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,079
Listen, I was wondering, maybe later...

43
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,599
Are you wearing lipstick?
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,279
I just refreshed it a bit.

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,879
Sorry, you were saying?

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,839
I was wondering if you'd like
to have coffee?

47
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,279
Black, two sugars please,
I'll be upstairs.

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,039
Okay.

49
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,519
It's a bit different from my day.

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,159
You've no idea.

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,319
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
No signal on mine.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,879
Well, what's wrong with the landline?

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,039
I'd rather text.

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,599
Sorry, other coat.

55
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,239
Oh, here. Use mine.

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,119
Oh. Thank you.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,479
This is an old mate of mine,
John Watson.

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,159
Afghanistan or Iraq?

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,159
Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know?

60
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,439
Ah, coffee! Thank you, Molly.

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,559
What happened to the lipstick?

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,479
It wasn't working for me.

63
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,719
Really? I thought it was
a big improvement.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,639
Mouth's too small now.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,919
Okay.

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,759
-How do you feel about the violin?
-Sorry, what?

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,279
I play the violin when I'm thinking.

68
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,919
Sometimes I don't talk for days on end.
Would that bother you?

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,039
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,959
-Oh, you told him me about me?
-Not a word.

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,159
-Then who said anything about flatmates?
-I did.

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,239
I told Mike this morning that I must be
a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,359
Now here he is after lunch
with an old friend

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,479
clearly home from military service
in Afghanistan.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,839
It wasn't a difficult leap.

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,119
How did you know about Afghanistan?

77
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,439
I've got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

78
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,639
Together we could afford it.
We'll meet there tomorrow evening, 7:00.

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,399
Sorry, I've got to dash.

80
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,679
I think I left my riding crop
in the mortuary.

81
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,839
-Is that it?
-Is that what?

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,799
We've just met and we're going to go
and look at a flat?

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,119
Problem?

84
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,799
We don't know a thing about each other,
I don't know your name,

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,519
I don't even know where we're meeting.

86
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,999
I know you're an army doctor

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,759
and you've recently been
invalided home from Afghanistan.

88
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,279
I know you've got a brother with
a bit of money who's worried about you,

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,039
but you won't go to him for help
because you don't approve of him,

90
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,519
possibly because he's an alcoholic,

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
more likely because he recently
walked out on his wife.

92
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,599
And I know your therapist thinks
your limp is psychosomatic,

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,799
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

94
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,559
That's enough to be going on with,
don't you think?

95
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,639
The name's Sherlock Holmes
and the address is 22 1 B Baker Street.

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,319
Afternoon.

97
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,279
Yeah, he's always like that.

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,559
Mrs Hudson, our landlady.

99
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,039
-Ah, Mr Holmes.
-Sherlock, please.

100
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,239
Getting a special rate,
owes me a favour.

101
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,479
A few years ago her husband got himself
sentenced to death in Florida.

102
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,159
I was able to help out.

103
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,319
You stopped her husband being executed?

104
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,639
Oh no, I ensured it.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,599
Sherlock!

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,999
(LAUGHING)

107
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,999
Come in, come in.

108
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,999
JOHN: Yep.

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,479
Well, this could be very nice.
Very nice, indeed.

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,759
Yes, I think so. My thoughts exactly.
So I went ahead and moved in.

111
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,439
As soon as we get
all this rubbish cleaned out.

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,399
So, this is all your stuff?

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,359
Obviously, I can straighten
things up a bit.

114
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,639
That's a real skull?

115
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,759
Friend of mine. Well, I say friend.

116
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,039
What do you think, Dr Watson?

117
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,679
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
Well, of course we'll be needing two.

119
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,719
Oh, don't worry,
there's all sorts round here.

120
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,599
Mrs Turner, next door,
has got married ones.

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,399
Sherlock, the mess you've made.

122
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,239
Oh, I, um, looked you up
on the Internet last night.

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,399
Anything interesting?

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,079
Found your website.
"The Science of Deduction."

125
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,439
-What did you think?
-Quite amusing, I suppose.

126
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,519
Amusing?

127
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,399
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,079
and, what was it,
a retired plumber by his left hand.

129
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,879
Yes, and I can read your military career
by your face and your leg,

130
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,039
and your brother's drinking habits
by your mobile phone.

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,439
State of the place already!

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,159
-How?
-You read the article.

133
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,399
The article was absurd.

134
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
But I know about his drinking habits.
I even know that he left his wife.

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,119
What about these suicides
then, Sherlock?

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,799
Thought that would be
right up your street.

137
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,399
Been a fourth one now.

138
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,279
Yes, actually,
it's very much up my street.

139
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,959
(TYRES SCREECHING)

140
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,999
Can I just ask, what is your street?

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,999
SHERLOCK: There's been a fifth.

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,279
Where this time?

143
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.
Will you come?

144
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,759
-Who's on forensics?
-Anderson.

145
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,599
Anderson won't work with me.

146
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,239
He won't be your assistant.

147
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,279
But I need an assistant.

148
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,119
Will you come?

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,959
Not in a police car.
I'll be right behind.

150
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,039
Thank you.

151
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,559
Oh, brilliant!

152
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,319
I thought it was going to be
a dull evening.

153
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,159
Honestly, you can't beat
a really imaginative serial killer

154
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,679
when there's nothing
on the telly, Mrs Hudson.

155
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,319
I may be out late, might need some food.

156
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,279
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,079
SHERLOCK: Something cold will do.

158
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,279
John, make yourself at home.
Er, have a cup of tea, don't wait up.

159
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,239
Look at him dashing about.
My husband was just the same.

160
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,759
But you're more the sitting down type,
I can tell.

161
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,959
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

162
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,319
-Damn my leg!
-(GASPS) Oh.

163
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,359
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's just sometimes this bloody thing...

164
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,439
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

165
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,239
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank you.

166
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,039
Just this once, dear.
I'm not your housekeeper.

167
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,679
A couple of biscuits, too,
if you've got 'em.

168
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,559
Not your housekeeper.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,119
You're a doctor.
In fact, you're an army doctor.

170
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,439
Yes.

171
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,159
Any good?

172
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,919
Very good.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,759
Seen a lot of injuries then,
violent deaths?

174
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,159
Well, yes.

175
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,559
-Bit of trouble too, I bet.
-Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime.

176
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,079
Far too much.

177
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,119
-Want to see some more?
-God, yes!

178
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,679
Come on, then.

179
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,919
Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the cuppa.
Off out.

180
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,799
What, both of you?

181
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,879
No point sitting at home

182
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,679
when there's finally
some halfway interesting murders.

183
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,679
Look at you all happy. It's not decent.

184
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,439
Who cares about decent?

185
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,919
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

186
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,759
Taxi!

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,439
-Okay, you've got questions.
-Where are we going?

188
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,319
Crime scene. There's been a murder.
Next?

189
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,399
-Who are you? What do you do?
-What do you think?

190
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,159
-I'd say private detective, but...
-But?

191
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,759
The police don't go
to private detectives.

192
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,319
I'm a consulting detective.

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,519
I'm the only one in the world.
I invented the job.

194
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,599
What does that mean?

195
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,199
It means when the police
are out of their depth,

196
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,919
which is always, they consult me.

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,679
But the police don't consult...amateurs.

198
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,959
When I met you
for the first time yesterday

199
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,639
and asked, "Afghanistan or Iraq?"
you looked surprised.

200
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,159
-How did you know?
-I didn't know, I saw.

201
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,399
Thank you.

202
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
SHERLOCK: Tannedface,
but no tan above the wrists.

203
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,839
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

204
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,959
Your haircut and the way
you hold yourself says military.

205
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,519
Your conversation
when you entered the room...

206
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,319
Ah, bit different from my day.

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,559
...says trained at Bart's.

208
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,599
So army doctor, obvious.

209
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,559
Your limp's really bad when you walk,

210
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,159
but you don't ask for a chair
when you stand,

211
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,679
like you've forgotten about it.

212
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,399
That means the limp is
at least partly psychosomatic.

213
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,959
That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatising.

214
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,079
Wounded in action then.

215
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,479
So, where does an army doctor
get himself a suntan

216
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,239
and wounded in action these days?
Afghanistan or Iraq?

217
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,599
You said I had a therapist.

218
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,039
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

219
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,199
Then there's your brother...

220
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,359
-Here, use mine.
-Thank you.

221
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,239
Your phone. It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, mp3 player,

222
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,399
you're looking for a flat-share,
you wouldn't waste money on this.

223
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,519
It's a gift, then.

224
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,199
Scratches, not just one,
but many over time.

225
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,319
It's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

226
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,119
The man sitting beside me wouldn't treat
his one luxury item like this,

227
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,479
so the previous owner then.

228
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,679
The next bit's easy.
You know it already.

229
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,799
The engraving.

230
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,759
"Harry Watson," clearly a family member
who's given you his old phone.

231
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,639
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

232
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,599
Could be a cousin, but then you're
a war hero returning home

233
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,599
who can't find a place to live.

234
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,999
Unlikely you've got an extended family,
certainly not one you're close to.

235
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,359
So brother it is.

236
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,239
Now, Clara. Who's Clara?

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,639
Three kisses says
it's a romantic attachment,

238
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,039
the expense of the phone says wife,
not girlfriend.

239
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,839
She's given this to him recently,
the model is only six months old,

240
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,159
so it's a marriage in trouble then.
Six months on, he's just given it away?

241
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,279
If she'd left him,
he'd have kept the phone, probably.

242
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,399
People do, sentiment.

243
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,599
But no, he wanted rid of it.
He left her.

244
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,879
He gave the phone to you,
that says he wants you to stay in touch.

245
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,079
He's worried about you.
You're looking for cheap accommodation,

246
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,359
but you won't go
to your brother for help.

247
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,919
That says you've got problems with him.

248
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,759
Maybe you liked his wife.
Maybe you don't like his drinking.

249
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,239
Yeah, how can you possibly know
about the drinking?

250
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,479
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

251
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,319
Thank you.

252
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,759
Power connection,
tiny scuff marks around the edge of it.

253
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,239
Every night he plugs it into recharge,
but his hands are shaking.

254
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,119
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

255
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,799
you never see a drunk's without them.

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,799
There you go, you see, you were right.

257
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,239
I was right? Right about what?

258
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,959
The police don't consult amateurs.

259
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,519
That was amazing!

260
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,079
-Do you think so?
-Of course it was. It was extraordinary.

261
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,159
It was quite extraordinary.

262
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,439
That's not what people usually say.

263
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,039
-What do they usually say?
-Piss off.

264
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,799
Did I get anything wrong?

265
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,999
Harry and me don't get on, never have.

266
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,799
Harry and Clara are getting a divorce,
split up three months ago.

267
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,919
Harry's a drinker.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,239
Spot on then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

269
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,519
Harry is short for Harriet.

270
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,999
Harry's your sister?

271
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,519
Now what exactly
am I supposed to be doing here?

272
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,439
-Your sister.
-No, seriously, why am I here?

273
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,559
Oh, there's always something!

274
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,919
-Hello, freak.
-I'm here to see Inspector Lestrade.

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,679
-Why?
-I was invited.

276
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,559
-Why?
-I think he wants me to take a look.

277
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,279
-Well, you know what I think, don't you?
-Always, Sally.

278
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,679
Even though you didn't
make it home last night.

279
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,039
Who's this?

280
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,879
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

281
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,639
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.
Old friend.

282
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
"A colleague?"
How did you get a colleague?

283
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,479
Did he follow you home?

284
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,599
Look, would it be better if I just go...

285
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,759
No.

286
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,079
Yeah, Freak's here. Bringing him in.

287
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,079
Ah, Anderson, here we are again.

288
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,079
It's a crime scene.

289
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
I don't want it contaminated.
Are we clear on that?

290
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,359
Quite clear.

291
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,719
Magic tricks might
impress Inspector Lestrade,

292
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,679
they don't work on me.

293
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,639
And is your wife away for long?

294
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,639
Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.
Someone told you that!

295
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,519
SHERLOCK: Your deodorant told me that.

296
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,839
-ANDERSON: My deodorant?
-It's for men.

297
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,199
Well, of course it's for men,
I'm wearing it!

298
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,759
So is Sergeant Donovan.

299
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,199
(SNIFFING)

300
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,079
Oh, I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

301
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,919
You listen me, okay?
Whatever it is you're trying to imply...

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,039
I'm not implying anything,

303
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,039
I'm sure Sally came round for a nice
little chat and happened to stay over.

304
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,119
I assume scrubbed your floors,
going by the state of her knees.

305
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,639
Right, just... Just go in.
Just... Just go!

306
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,719
(SIGHING)

307
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,519
You have two minutes.

308
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,319
I may need longer.

309
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,079
-SHERLOCK: Put this on.
-Who's this?

310
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,359
He's with me.

311
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,599
-Yeah, but who is he?
-I told you, he's with me.

312
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,439
So, where are we?

313
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,759
It's upstairs.

314
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,079
Footprint analysis says that
the only other person in this room

315
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,239
in the last 1 2 hours was a man
of about 5'7",

316
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,439
and it seemed that he and the victim
arrived together by car.

317
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,919
All identification is missing
from the body,

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,799
just like the others.

319
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,239
Have no idea who she is
or where she's from.

320
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,479
Well, she's from out of town, clearly.

321
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,679
Planned to spend a single night
in London before returning home.

322
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,799
-So far, so obvious.
-Obvious?

323
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,359
Yes, obvious, back of her right leg.
Dr Watson, what do you think?

324
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,159
-What do I think?
-You're the medical man.

325
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,719
-We have a whole team right outside.
-They won't work with me.

326
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,919
Look, I'm breaking every rule
letting you in here.

327
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,119
Yeah, 'cause you need me.

328
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,159
Yes, I do, God help me.

329
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,279
John?

330
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,719
Oh, just do as he says, help yourself.

331
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,599
(JOHN GRUNTS)

332
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,639
Well?

333
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,959
-(SOFTLY) What am I doing here?
-Helping me make a point.

334
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,479
I'm supposed to be helping you
pay the rent.

335
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,959
-Yeah, this is more fun.
-Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

336
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,799
No, there are two women
and three men lying dead.

337
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,719
Keep talking and there'll be more.

338
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,599
Now, cause of death?

339
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,479
Asphyxiation, probably.

340
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,559
She passed out
and choked on her own vomit.

341
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,039
I can't smell any alcohol on her,
could be a seizure, possibly drugs.

342
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,599
It was poison.

343
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,759
-How do you know?
-Because they were all poisoned.

344
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,519
-By who?
-By themselves.

345
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,439
-Themselves?
-We've identified the drug.

346
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,119
Doesn't matter, it was poison.

347
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,159
Same pattern each time.

348
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,199
Each one of them disappears
from their normal lives,

349
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,399
from the theatre, from their home,
from the office, from the pub,

350
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,879
and turn up a few hours later,
somewhere they've no reason to be, dead.

351
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,679
No marks of violence on the body.
No suggestion of compulsion.

352
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,719
Each of them has taken the same poison,

353
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,319
and as far as we can tell,
taken it voluntarily.

354
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,079
Sherlock, two minutes, I said.
I need anything you've got.

355
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,679
-Okay, take this down.
-Just tell me what you've got.

356
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,639
-I'm not going to write it down.
-Sherlock!

357
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,199
It's all right, I'll do it.

358
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,039
Thank you.

359
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,559
The victim is in her early 30s,
professional person.

360
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,999
Going by her clothes,
I'd guess something in the media,

361
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,079
going by the frankly alarming
shade of pink.

362
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,639
She's travelled from Cardiff today,

363
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,319
intending to stay in London
for one night,

364
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,279
that's obvious from
the size of her suitcase.

365
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,599
-A suitcase?
-A suitcase, yes.

366
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,519
She's been married several years,
but not happily.

367
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,319
She's had a string of lovers,
but none of them knew she was married.

368
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,039
For God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

369
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,559
Her wedding ring, look at it!
It's too tight.

370
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,079
She was thinner when she first wore it,
that says married for a while.

371
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,279
Also there's grime in the gem setting.

372
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,079
But the rest of her jewellery
has recently been cleaned,

373
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,799
that tells you everything you need
to know about the state of her marriage.

374
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,959
The inside of the ring is shinier
than the outside.

375
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,919
That means it's regularly removed.

376
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,119
The only polishing it gets is when
she works it off her finger,

377
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,799
but it can't be easy,
so she must have a reason.

378
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,119
It can't be for work,
her nails are too long.

379
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,279
She doesn't work with her hands,

380
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,239
so what, or rather who
does she remove her ring for?

381
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,359
Clearly not one lover,

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,319
she'd never sustain the fiction
of being single over time.

383
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,159
So more likely a string of them. Simple.

384
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,959
Brilliant!

385
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,119
Sorry.

386
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,319
Cardiff?

387
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,399
-Obvious, isn't it?
-It's not obvious to me.

388
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,559
Dear God, what's it like
inside your funny little brains?

389
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,719
It must be so boring.

390
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,399
Her coat is slightly damp.

391
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,159
She's been in heavy rain
in the last few hours,

392
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,479
no rain anywhere in London
until the last few minutes.

393
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,559
Under her coat collar it is damp, too,
she's turned it up against the wind.

394
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,719
There's an umbrella in her left pocket,
but it's dry and unused.

395
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,999
Not just wind, strong wind.
Too strong to use her umbrella.

396
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,079
We know from the suitcase
that she intended to stay a night,

397
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,319
so she must have come a decent distance.

398
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,319
But she can't have travelled
more than two or three hours

399
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,119
because her coat still hasn't dried.

400
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,319
So, where has there been
heavy rain and strong winds

401
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,639
within the radius of that travel time?

402
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,759
Cardiff.

403
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,199
Fantastic!

404
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,719
-Do you know you do that out loud?
-Sorry, I'll shut up.

405
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,919
No, it's... It's fine.

406
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,759
-LESTRADE: There was no suitcase.
-I'm sorry?

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,799
You keep saying suitcase.
There wasn't one.

408
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,559
Oh. I was assuming
you'd taken it already.

409
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,479
She had a handbag.
Why do you say she had a case?

410
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,599
Because she did.

411
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,719
Her handbag,
was there a mobile phone in it?

412
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,879
No.

413
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,679
That's odd. That's very odd.

414
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,959
-LESTRADE: Why?
-Never mind. We need to find her case.

415
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,679
How do you know she had a case?

416
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,239
Back of her right leg, tiny splash marks
above the heel and calf,

417
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,639
not present on the left.

418
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand.

419
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,719
You don't get that splash pattern
any other way.

420
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,359
Smallish case, judging by the spread.

421
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,239
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious,

422
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,959
could only be an overnight bag.

423
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,719
So we know she was staying a night.

424
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,239
Maybe she checked into a hotel,
left her case there?

425
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,119
She never made it to a hotel.
Look at her hair.

426
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,319
Colour co-ordinates her lipstick
and her shoes.

427
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,679
A woman like that would never
leave the hotel

428
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,239
with her hair still looking like...

429
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,999
Oh!

430
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,479
Sherlock?

431
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,919
What? What is it? What, what, what?

432
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,079
Serial killers, always hard.

433
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,559
You have to wait for them
to make a mistake.

434
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,039
Well, we can't just wait!

435
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,559
Oh, we're done waiting.

436
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,319
When she was found,
she couldn't have been here long.

437
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,439
Is that right?

438
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,599
No, not long at all, no.
Um, less than an hour.

439
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,599
Less than an hour. An hour.

440
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,399
News blackout, can you do that?

441
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,279
Don't say that you've found her,
nothing for a day.

442
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,679
-Why?
-Look at her, really look!

443
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,959
Houston, we have a mistake!
Back in a moment.

444
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,839
What mistake?

445
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,319
Pink!

446
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,959
-LESTRADE: Anderson!
-I'm here.

447
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,359
So, what was the point in all that?

448
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,199
We're after a psychopath.

449
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,239
So we're bringing in
another psychopath to help?

450
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,759
If that's what it takes. All yours.

451
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,599
Come on, let's get on with it.

452
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,359
-My notes, do you want me to...
-Sorry, you're...

453
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,479
Dr Watson.

454
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,159
Well, you're going
to have to go, Dr Watson.

455
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,959
Don't need your notes.

456
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,119
LESTRADE: Okay, let's get on with it.

457
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,679
SALLY: Okay, look,
we're going to need Jones and Abby...

458
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,279
-He's gone.
-What, Sherlock Holmes?

459
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,799
SALLY: He just took off. He does that.

460
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,119
-Is he coming back?
-SALLY: Didn't look like it.

461
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,359
JOHN: Right.

462
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,719
Right, yes. Um, sorry, where am I?

463
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,439
Brixton.

464
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,439
Right. Do you know where I'd get a cab?
It's just my leg.

465
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,479
Yeah, try the main road.

466
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,599
(SIGHING)

467
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,199
-Hey.
-Hmm?

468
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,879
You're not his friend,
he doesn't have friends, so who are you?

469
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,879
Me, I'm... I'm nobody.
I've just met him.

470
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,079
Right, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.

471
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,359
-Why?
-Well, you know why he's here?

472
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,079
He's not paid or anything, he likes it.
He gets off on it.

473
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,759
The weirder the crime,
the more he gets off.

474
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,239
And you know what?

475
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,319
One day just showing up
isn't going to be enough.

476
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,559
One day we'll be standing round a body

477
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,639
and Sherlock Holmes will be
the one who put it there.

478
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,759
Why would he do that?

479
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,679
Because he's a psychopath
and psychopaths get bored.

480
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,799
-LESTRADE: Donovan!
-Yeah, coming!

481
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,679
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

482
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,079
-Thanks.
-No worries.

483
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:58,559
(MOBILE PHONE BEEPING)

484
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,959
-You late or something?
-No, not particularly, why?

485
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,599
Sorry. You just look a bit wired.

486
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,879
Wired? What do you mean, wired?

487
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,839
What are you doing?

488
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,359
Nicotine patch, helps me think.

489
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,279
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit
in London these days.

490
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,639
Bad news for brain work.

491
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,759
Good news for breathing.

492
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,199
Oh, breathing. Breathing is boring.

493
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,759
Is that three patches?

494
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,599
It's a three patch problem.

495
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,479
Well?

496
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,559
You asked me to come.

497
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,599
Took me an hour to get here,
I assume it's important.

498
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,119
Oh, yeah, can I borrow your phone?

499
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,239
My phone?

500
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,679
Don't want to use mine, always a chance
the number will be recognised.

501
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,519
It's on the website.

502
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,999
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.

503
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,319
Yeah, but she's downstairs.
I tried shouting, but she didn't hear.

504
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,759
-I was the other side of London!
-There was no hurry.

505
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,519
Here, here.

506
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,519
So, what's this about? The case?

507
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,319
-Her case.
-Her case?

508
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,959
Her suitcase, yes,
the murderer took her suitcase.

509
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,679
First big mistake.

510
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,359
It's no use, there's no other way,
we'll have to risk it.

511
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,479
Risk what?

512
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,879
There's a number,
over there on the table.

513
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,959
I want you to send a text.

514
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,319
-Who am I texting?
-Never mind.

515
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,039
On the table, the number, now, please!

516
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,959
Maybe Sergeant Donovan
was right about you.

517
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,839
-What did she say?
-Said you were a psychopath.

518
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,759
Oh! Didn't think she was that smart.

519
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,119
She said one day they're going
to show up at a murder scene

520
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,639
and you'll have provided the body.

521
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,439
These words exactly.

522
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,319
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?
I must have blacked out.

523
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,679
"22 Northumberland Terrace.
Please come."

524
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,719
Well? Send it.

525
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,039
Have you sent it?

526
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,599
Just a moment.

527
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,159
Take a look at the impossible.
The contents of her case.

528
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,519
-How did you get this?
-By looking.

529
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,639
Where?

530
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,399
We know the killer drove
to Lauriston Gardens,

531
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,679
we know the killer is a man.

532
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,399
No man could be seen with this case
without attracting attention to himself,

533
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,319
so obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it

534
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,799
the moment he knew
it was still in his car.

535
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,199
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

536
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,319
I checked every back street
wide enough for a car

537
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,599
within five minutes of Lauriston Gardens

538
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,759
and looked for anywhere you could
easily dispose of a bulky object

539
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,719
without being observed.

540
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,839
It look me less than an hour
to find the right skip.

541
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,279
Pink.

542
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,719
You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

543
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,959
Well, it had to be pink, obviously.

544
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,439
-Why didn't I think of that?
-Because you're stupid.

545
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,879
Oh, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

546
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,599
Sent?

547
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,999
Sent, yes. What was that about?

548
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,559
The contents of her case, look at them.

549
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,919
-What am I looking for?
-The impossible. One impossible thing.

550
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,679
There's a change of clothes,
a make-up bag, a wash-bag and a novel.

551
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,359
-What's impossible?
-Her mobile phone.

552
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,519
There isn't a mobile phone.

553
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,639
That's what's impossible.

554
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,159
No mobile in her case,
no mobile in her coat pocket.

555
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,479
Well, maybe she doesn't have one.

556
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,359
She has a string of lovers,
of course she has one.

557
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,439
She could have left it at home.

558
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,399
Again, string of lovers,
she never leaves her phone at home.

559
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,559
And so where is it?

560
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,119
You know where it is.
More importantly, you know who has it.

561
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,799
-The murderer?
-The murderer.

562
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,599
Who did I just text?

563
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,079
Maybe she just dropped it
in the back of his car.

564
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,199
Maybe she planted it on purpose
to lead us to him,

565
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,959
but the murderer has her phone.

566
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,559
(PHONE RINGING)

567
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,559
A few hours since his last victim.

568
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,839
Now he's received the text,
which can only be from her.

569
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,159
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

570
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,239
An innocent man would ignore
a text like that,

571
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,599
assuming it was a mistake.
A guilty man

572
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,399
would panic.

573
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,759
Have you spoken to the police?

574
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,759
Five people are dead,
there isn't time to talk to the police.

575
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,839
-Then why are you talking to me?
-You're here.

576
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,159
-Well?
-Well, what?

577
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,919
Well, you could sit there
and watch telly.

578
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,239
Problem?

579
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,599
-Sergeant Donovan.
-What about her?

580
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,919
Said you get off on this, you enjoy it.

581
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,639
And I said "danger" and here you are.

582
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,159
Damn it!

583
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,999
Where are we going?

584
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,719
Northumberland Terrace is
a five-minute walk from here.

585
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,519
What, you think he's stupid enough
to go there?

586
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,599
No, I think he's brilliant enough.
I love the brilliant ones.

587
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,599
They're so desperate to get caught.

588
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,439
-Why?
-Appreciation.

589
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,399
At long last the spotlight.

590
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,599
To you it's an arrest,
to them it's a coming out party.

591
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,559
That's the frailty of genius,
it needs an audience.

592
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,759
Yes.

593
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,079
Yes. I suppose it does.

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,159
22 Northumberland Terrace.
Keep your eyes on it.

595
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,639
-Don't you want to keep your eyes on it?
-I am.

596
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,759
Yeah, but he's not just going
to ring the doorbell, though, is he?

597
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,439
No, of course not, but he'll pass by.

598
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,559
He might even loiter.

599
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,799
Half of London's passing by.

600
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,039
-I'll recognise him.
-You know who he is?

601
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,359
-I know what he is.
-Sherlock!

602
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,559
Anything on the menu.
Whatever you want, free.

603
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,639
All on the house, you and your date.

604
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,039
-SHERLOCK: Do you want to eat?
-I'm not his date.

605
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,159
Oh, oh, this man!

606
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,919
He got me off a murder charge.

607
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,079
SHERLOCK: This is Angelo.

608
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,399
Three years ago I successfully
proved to Inspector Lestrade

609
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,359
that at the time of
a particularly vicious triple murder,

610
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,199
Angelo was in a completely
different part of town, car-jacking.

611
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,439
He cleared my name.

612
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,159
Cleared it a bit.

613
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,759
Anything on the menu,
I cook it for you myself.

614
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,839
Thank you, Angelo.

615
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,719
If not for you, I'd have gone to prison.

616
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,839
You did go to prison.

617
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,119
I'll get you a candle for the table.
It's more romantic, hmm?

618
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,839
I'm not his date!

619
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,919
You may as well eat.
We might be waiting a long time.

620
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,879
Hmm. Are you going to?

621
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,879
-What day is it?
-It's Wednesday.

622
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,439
I'm okay for a bit.

623
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,159
You haven't eaten today.
For God's sake, you need to eat!

624
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,759
No, you need to eat. I need to think.

625
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,119
The brain's what counts,
everything else is transport.

626
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,039
-You might consider refuelling.
-Hmm.

627
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,199
So, do you have a girlfriend
who feeds you up sometimes?

628
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,479
Is that what girlfriends do?
Feed you up?

629
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,759
-You don't have a girlfriend then?
-It's not really my area.

Oh.

Oh, right.

633
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,639
Do you have a boyfriend?

634
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,519
-Which is fine, by the way.
-I know it's fine.

635
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,119
-So you don't have a boyfriend then?
-No.

636
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,559
Right. Okay.

637
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,159
So unattached, like me.

638
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,399
Good.

639
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,719
John, you should know that I
consider myself married to my work

640
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,639
and while I'm flattered
by your interest,

641
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,759
I'm really not looking
for any kind of...

642
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,199
No, no, no.

643
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,959
I wasn't asking you out. No.

644
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,639
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

645
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,439
Whatever shakes your...boat.
I'm going to shut up now.

646
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,239
I think that's for the best.

647
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,559
So, you don't do anything?

648
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,679
Everything else is transport.

649
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,759
No sign yet then?

650
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,319
I suppose it is a long shot,
we have to be realistic.

651
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,639
You said before you didn't know
who the killer was but you knew what.

652
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,639
So do you, if you think about it.
Why don't people just think?

653
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,119
Oh, because we're stupid.

654
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,359
We know the killer drove his victims

655
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,399
but there were no marks of coercion
or violence on the bodies.

656
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,399
Each one of those five people climbed
into a stranger's car voluntarily.

657
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,719
The killer was someone they trusted.

658
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,919
But not someone they knew.

659
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,279
Five completely different people,
they had no friends in common.

660
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,319
And another thing, Lauriston Gardens,
did you see it?

661
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,199
Twitching curtains, little old ladies.

662
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,199
Little old ladies, they're my favourite,
better than any security cameras.

663
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,519
But according to the police,
no one remembers a strange car

664
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,119
parked outside an empty house.
Not one person remembered.

665
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,479
I see what you're saying.

666
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,359
No, I don't. What are you saying?
That the killer's got an invisible car?

667
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,159
Yes. Yes, exactly!

668
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,319
Then I definitely don't see
what you're saying.

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,999
which is more than can be said for the
dead serial killer on the first floor.

942
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,119
Dead what?

943
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,199
Good news for London,
bad news for your carpet.

944
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,039
Good night, Mrs Hudson.

945
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,119
I'm not your housekeeper!

946
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,359
-Night, Mrs Hudson.
-MRS HUDSON: I'm going in.

947
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,759
-LESTRADE: Sergeant Donovan.
-Sir?

948
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,759
We'll need those two in tomorrow.

949
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,319
What two, sir?
