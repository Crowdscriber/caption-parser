2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,408
Oh. Morning.

3
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,198
Here.

4
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,370
Coffee?

5
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,983
Yeah, with a little
milk and sugar.

6
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:25,458
My daddy let me try it
on my first hunting trip.

7
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:29,578
You get a little older,

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,214
we'll add a little hooch
in there.

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,799
That'll really keep us warm.

10
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,086
Hey.

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,971
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

12
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,474
Hank...

13
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:42,558
Keep your hands steady.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,428
Just like we practiced
on the range.

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,864
I just...

16
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:49,432
I don't want to miss.

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,117
Well, then, you won't.

18
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:54,070
I was the same way
when I was your age.

19
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,122
Worse even.

20
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:58,441
I couldn't keep
my breakfast down.

21
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,609
Ruined my shirt.

22
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,045
Damn near ruined everything.

23
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:05,614
Here you go.

24
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:13,089
We've been hunters
for generations.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,974
You'll be fine, son.

26
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,470
Yes.

27
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,872
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

28
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,323
You stay here.

29
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,925
I'll flush her out
through the brush.

30
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,326
You be ready.

31
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,595
You'll get a clean shot.

32
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,524
Put her down!

33
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,795
Please.

34
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,713
No!

35
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:28,558
Please.

36
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:32,885
Please.

37
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,088
Put her down.

38
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:39,842
No! Please!

39
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,727
Do it! Put her down!

40
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,883
Put her down!

41
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,902
Do it!

42
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,834
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,798
I'm-I'm sorry.

44
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,634
No mercy.

45
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,957
Never forget what they are.

46
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:17,272

47
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,798
Delores Davis,
when is the last time

48
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,499
I had your head in my chair?

49
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,802
We need to talk.

50
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,068
You and I ain't got nothing
to say to each other.

51
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:41,083
Take your skinny ass and
that filthy thing and get out.

52
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,592
You don't want to
talk to me? Fine.

53
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:48,346
Then give what's in
this box a wash and set.

54
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:50,882
Trina!

55
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:54,185
Get Mrs. Davis started
for me, will you?

56
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,554
I won't be long.

57
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,326
Jesus Christ.

58
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,777
This better be good.

59
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,029
I got six more heads
waiting for me

60
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,748
up front. That one

61
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,533
you can keep.

62
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,591
What makes you think I want it?

63
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:20,935
You the one dug it up.

64
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,520
For information, that was all.

65
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,988
Then why'd you keep her around?

66
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,492
She amused me.

67
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:31,790
Hmm... You thought you could
use her as a bargaining chip.

68
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:34,082
What did she say? I can't hear!

69
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,583
You shut up!

70
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,002
I came here to talk terms.

71
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,037
Terms?

72
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,760
You think it's so easy.

73
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,680
Stroll in here and expect
we gonna fix this truce?

74
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,932
Oh, to hell with the truce.

75
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,251
What I'm looking for
is an alliance.

76
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:56,554
Your tribe, my coven, joined.

77
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,189
Are you insane?!

78
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,891
Uh! What the head said.

79
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,110
I told you to shut up!

80
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,646
You can't make a deal
with a darkie!

81
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,065
You can't trust 'em
as far as you can spit.

82
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,817
Like I told the governor. I...

83
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,152
Shut up!

84
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,955
Now, we need to stop
this petty quarreling.

85
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,076
We've got bigger problems
than what goes on between us.

86
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:23,798
Last night, outside
our academy...

87
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,301
witch hunters.

88
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,470
- How many dead?
- None dead.

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,221
They missed.

90
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,623
Hmm. Too bad.

91
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,010
This concerns you
and your people

92
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,896
as much as it does mine.

93
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,731
Don't concern me a bit.

94
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:42,901
Witch hunters
is white women's worry.

95
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,769
You're making a mistake.

96
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,137
I can live with that.

97
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,156
Not too sure about you, though.

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,975
That's good work, that wig.

99
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,144
But it's a wig.

100
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:56,314
What kind of cancer you got?

101
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,700
Shit.

102
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,035
Come down here
'cause you're weak.

103
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,873
Can't protect your own, and
expect me to do it for you.

104
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:13,548
You're kidding yourself
if you think

105
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:16,601
that after they're done with us
they're not coming after you.

106
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,887
I'll fret about that
when the time come.

107
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,523
Right after I pop
the champagne.

108
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,641
Queenie?

109
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,277
Take this filthy thing
out back and burn it.

110
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,013
I don't ever want
to see it again.

111
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,114
You, neither.

112
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,115
Sweet release!

113
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:34,035
At long last!

114
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,620
Goddamn it!

115
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:28,072
Could people please
not move things?!

116
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:30,041
Some of us are blind!

117
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,453
Here it is, Delia.
Let me help you.

118
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,378
Let me do it!

119
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,880
It's my mess!

120
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,850
Delia, there's a...

121
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,420
I need to say something,
or I'll simply explode.

122
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,391
I need to know for certain

123
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,027
that you don't think

124
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,812
I did this to you.

125
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,763
<i>I remember the first day</i>

126
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,899
<i>Fiona dropped you off here.</i>

127
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,603
<i>You were like a baby bird,</i>
<i>pushed too soon from the nest.</i>

128
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,373
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>what you asked me?</i>

129
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:06,127
Will you be my mother now?

130
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,786
I've always loved you
like a daughter.

131
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,505
Wrap your arms around me,
dear girl.

132
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,925
Use your power of sight,

133
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,728
and you'll see that I could not
have done this terrible thing.

134
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:27,932
No. I won't.

135
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:31,686
I don't need magic to tell me
what I already know.

136
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,688
I know you would never hurt me.

137
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,639
I never doubted you
for a second,

138
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:38,326
and I told my mother that.

139
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,529
My mother set you up.

140
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:45,333
My blindness gave me
real vision,

141
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,502
but it's of no use to me now.

142
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,621
Not when there are witch hunters
right outside our door.

143
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,924
Darling...

144
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:55,376
if I could pluck my own eyes
out of my head

145
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,828
and gift them to you, I would.

146
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:07,188
I know.

147
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,565
Hank.

148
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,016
David.

149
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:20,351
Good to see you.

150
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:22,236
I thought you were in Europe.

151
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,989
We had a flare-up with the
Cromwell Coven in North Hampton.

152
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,158
Nothing a few silver bullets
couldn't take care of.

153
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,859
Oh. Corporation
keeps you busy,

154
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:31,629
now that he's made you
the official right hand.

155
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,531
I know you were hoping
to be named,

156
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,383
- but your father has other plans
for you, Hank. - Right.

157
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,201
Am I still in the will?

158
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:38,702
You'll always be his son.

159
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,205
Come on.
He's ready for you.

160
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,096
Hello, Father.

161
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,685
Coffee?

162
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,053
No, thanks.

163
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,655
Never acquired a taste for it.

164
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,941
Well, I'll get right to it.

165
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:04,028
We're not happy with your
progress in New Orleans.

166
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,415
David tells me you're
no longer living at the academy.

167
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,117
A lot of things have happened.

168
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,585
Some of them out of my control.

169
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,237
Allying yourself with
Marie Laveau, the Voodoo Queen,

170
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,572
that was out of your control?

171
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,073
I took some initiative.

172
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,176
I had a plan to bring
them both down.

173
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,243
The Witches <i>and</i> the Voodoos.

174
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:21,546
You don't take initiative, Hank.

175
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,097
You follow orders.

176
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,017
Your only job is to
gather intelligence.

177
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,219
You don't get your hands dirty.

178
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,055
You're the man on the inside.

179
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:34,609
That's why you're married
to Cordelia Goode.

180
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,611
Yes, Father,
I-I just thought that...

181
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,429
Don't think.

182
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,399
You'll just end up
getting somebody killed.

183
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,451
I thought that was the point.

184
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,603
I'm much more capable
than you think.

185
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,742
You're referring
to the firestarter

186
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,462
you terminated in Baton Rouge?

187
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:55,963
I found the witch, killed her,

188
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,448
then got rid of the body.

189
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,300
In a hotel room!
You used a credit card!

190
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:02,220
It could have been traced
to The Corporation.

191
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,088
I had to send David down there

192
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,973
to clean up after you.

193
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:11,846
An innocent desk clerk and
a maid lost their lives...

194
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,397
because you were sloppy.

195
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,152
Hank... you need
to understand,

196
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,354
your father's not only the
head of The Corporation,

197
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,274
he's the CEO of a major
financial institution.

198
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,566
The liberals in Washington are
just looking for an excuse

199
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:28,329
to sic the FEC
on companies like Delphi.

200
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,480
Your recklessness
puts everything

201
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,948
we've worked for at risk.

202
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:33,367
I thought we were
still Witch Hunters.

203
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:40,324
The hunt isn't only
about the kill.

204
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,543
A good hunter stalks his prey

205
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,095
with care,

206
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:47,098
and only strikes when
the time is right.

207
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,832
We need you back
inside that house.

208
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,852
That may be a problem.

209
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,720
Somebody blinded Cordelia,

210
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,106
a-an unknown attacker
threw acid in her face.

211
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,307
Not unknown.

212
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,892
We authorized that.

213
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:00,611
We wanted to make sure
she needed you.

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,984
You disfigured my wife?

215
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,286
Your wife?

216
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,905
Tell me you don't actually

217
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,023
have <i>feelings</i> for her.

218
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,410
Tell me, son!

219
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,880
You haven't forgotten
what she is.

220
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,915
What you are?

221
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,700
I'm part of a Sacred Order.

222
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,585
A soldier in a shadow war.

223
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,889
A war that has been raging
since before the time of Salem.

224
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,873
We are a Brotherhood
pledged in blood,

225
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,260
dedicated to stamping out
the pestilence of witchery

226
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,728
on the North American continent.

227
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:47,191
Don't think I don't appreciate
the sacrifices you've made.

228
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:50,060
I know how confusing it can be

229
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,730
to pretend to love someone

230
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,533
who is your enemy.

231
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,703
But you can never
lose yourself to the lie.

232
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,422
'Cause someday...

233
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,091
she will have to be put down.

234
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,766
What a marvelous invention.

235
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,467
So clever.

236
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:20,524
So, before we move on
to our lobster <i>poché beurre,</i>

237
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,227
a little melon ball
palate cleanser.

238
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,480
Remember back
in the day, Pembie?

239
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,232
We'd always be served
a palate cleanser

240
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,600
at Sunday supper.

241
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,152
Such a sensible tradition.

242
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,436
Nobody bothers anymore.

243
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,537
Now, Myrtle,

244
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,573
Pembie and I were just saying

245
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,208
in addition to

246
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,910
how thrilling it was
to get your phone call,

247
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,580
we-we...
I've... we've...

248
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,131
just had such terrible regrets

249
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,783
about the whole
misunderstanding.

250
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:46,968
And we...

251
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,304
cannot get over your skin.

252
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,422
Ah.

253
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,757
No burn scars.

254
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,175
You look younger than ever.

255
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,727
We-we've got
to hear all about

256
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,096
this Misty Day

257
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,766
and her magical mud.

258
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,151
Should we be looking into it?

259
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,803
Selling it, perhaps?

260
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,971
Oh! My God...

261
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,273
You miss the point, darling.

262
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,308
The swamp mud is a metaphor,

263
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,743
her metaphor.

264
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,945
She's a sophisticated witch

265
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,614
with extraordinary gifts,

266
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,416
hiding out as
a hippie swamp rat.

267
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,001
From humble

268
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,152
hillbilly stock,
she's been a witch since birth,

269
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,038
her power and humanity

270
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,790
separating her from
everyone around her.

271
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,842
In fact, those around her

272
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,160
have tried endlessly
to destroy her,

273
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:33,214
in order to mask
their own evil purposes.

274
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,499
Yet she rose from the ashes,
stronger than ever,

275
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,218
more fully realized.

276
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,303
A living testament
to the greater ideals

277
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,438
of our coven.

278
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:41,722
Power, compassion,

279
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,858
and uniqueness.

280
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,360
We are lucky to have
found her, and she us.

281
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,613
It resonates with
my own story, doesn't it?

282
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,399
Myrtle, I want to toast you

283
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,516
for your spirit

284
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,319
of... f...

285
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,353
...give...

286
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,408
Forgiveness, you say?

287
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,462
Forgiveness is,
and always will be,

288
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,996
the high road...

289
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,133
...the preferred road.

290
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,701
Would that we had such luxury.

291
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:17,341
Oh... Quentin.

292
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,260
Not to worry.

293
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,064
It's just a bit of monkshood

294
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,482
in your balls.

295
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,984
Causes temporary paralysis.

296
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,904
"Human Statue Syndrome,"
we call it.

297
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,190
I believe it's
the nervous system first.

298
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,326
You lose control
over your limbs,

299
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:37,578
the muscles harden into cement,

300
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,364
and it feels like
ice in your veins.

301
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:41,565
Then the respiratory system.

302
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,501
Or is it the other way around?

303
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,086
Well, no matter.

304
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,004
It's supposed to be
quite terrifying. Is it?

305
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:47,955
Are you terrified?

306
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,540
You should be.

307
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,844
At any rate,
I'm not going to kill you.

308
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,796
Well, maybe after dessert.

309
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,749
I put a lot of effort
into the key lime pie.

310
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,851
I do love a key lime pie,

311
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,586
even more than
a <i>ile flottante...</i>

312
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:05,556
call me a Philistine!

313
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,857
Enough chit-chat.

314
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:13,063
You've both wanted
to eliminate me for years,

315
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,899
so you could dominate
the Council.

316
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,034
But I was never worried

317
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,069
you'd be hapless enough to try.

318
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,538
Quentin!

319
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,290
You're a fatuous fool
and a drunk!

320
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,742
Pembie, you're even worse.

321
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,076
You're weak-willed,

322
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,379
boring, and your
fashion faux pas

323
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,297
give me nightmares.

324
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,633
I invited you here

325
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,635
not to chastise you

326
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,720
or exact revenge,

327
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:38,556
but to help out the coven.

328
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,058
To help out my beloved Cordelia.

329
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,478
I bet you thought,

330
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,798
"Oh, she left
the melon baller in there.

331
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:50,851
She's growing old
and forgetful."

332
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:04,331
I had a Turkish Angora cat

333
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,833
who was born with one brown eye

334
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,419
and one blue.

335
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,654
She was absolutely gorgeous.

336
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,295
Oh, my God...

337
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,664
I can see.

338
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:34,955
I know you had
the best of intentions,

339
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,932
but you could've
asked me first.

340
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,433
Delia, does one ask

341
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,902
a drowning man
before throwing him

342
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:40,991
a life preserver?

343
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:44,406
Who let this charcoal
briquette back in?

344
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,911
Oh, sweet Jesus.

345
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,946
He gets no credit.

346
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,249
It was I who restored
our beloved Cordelia.

347
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,451
You're not witch enough

348
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,320
to pull off something
this delicate.

349
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,654
Oh, but you're wrong.

350
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,256
I'm more witch now
than I ever was,

351
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,258
and I've got you
to thank, Fiona.

352
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:05,544
Being burned at the stake
was an empowering

353
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:06,678
experience.

354
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,013
There are secrets
in the flames,

355
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,349
and I came back with
more than a few.

356
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,351
You couldn't find
two that matched?

357
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,355
Why do they look so familiar?

358
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:19,507
The generous donors wish
to remain anonymous.

359
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,371
Well, if she gave
you two new eyes,

360
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,856
it's out of guilt
for having blinded you.

361
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,458
Hurl your baseless accusations.

362
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,026
They have no power now.

363
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:41,163
You could still end up
in an ashtray, you know.

364
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,131
You're the one that should
be put to the stake.

365
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,634
You murdered
Madison Montgomery.

366
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,870
Well, that's going to be
a hard one to stick, Myrtle.

367
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,505
The girl's not dead.

368
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,424
Not anymore,
and no thanks to you.

369
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,261
You were the one

370
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,730
found guilty of a capital crime.

371
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:02,351
I don't care if you
did survive the stake.

372
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,569
I could have you banished.

373
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:07,105
Permanent exile.

374
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,407
You know what
that means, Myrtle--

375
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,194
Paramus, New Jersey--

376
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,895
toxic waste...

377
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,330
outlet malls...

378
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:17,699
You wouldn't dare.

379
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,084
Ha.

380
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,503
I could call
an emergency meeting

381
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,039
of the Council right now.
Good.

382
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,874
Call the Council.
Good luck.

383
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,259
I hear they're not
seeing anyone right now.

384
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,094
Stop it! Stop it!

385
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:30,178
Right now.

386
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,713
Like it or not,

387
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,598
Fiona is your Supreme,

388
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,403
and you need to start
treating her like one.

389
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:38,353
And you...

390
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,439
You need to stop
accusing Auntie Myrtle.

391
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:42,691
We both know she's not
the one who blinded me.

392
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,928
The real danger
is outside these doors,

393
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,096
not inside.

394
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,985
I'm tired. I need to lie down.

395
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:55,270
When the girls get in,
make sure they

396
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,455
stay in.

397
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:57,739
It's dangerous out there.

398
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,824
Of course, baby bird.

399
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,208
You go rest your new eyes.

400
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:01,994
We'll see to
absolutely everything.

401
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,715
Wait...

402
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:08,950
Hug me again.

403
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,323
Of course I will,
my darling girl.

404
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,507
Nothing.

405
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,013
My visions...

406
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:26,151
They're gone.

407
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,743
You can't smoke
in here, Madison.

408
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,412
Why don't you go tell someone?

409
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,647
Ugh, sick people
really gross me out.

410
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,924
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Nan, it's time to go.

411
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,759
Cordelia wants us all
back at the house.

412
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,177
I need to see Luke.
You haven't seen him yet?

413
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,661
You've been here
since last night.

414
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,430
His mother won't let me.

415
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:56,631
That's bullshit.

416
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,844
Luke?

417
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:13,515
Who said you could
come in here?! Get out

418
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,849
before I call security!

419
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,535
She just wants so see him.

420
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:18,236
Absolutely not.
It's your fault

421
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,822
my son is in a coma!
You brought this darkness

422
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,124
into my home!

423
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:24,326
Luke says, "Calm down.

424
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,827
"Don't have a fit.

425
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,245
Like at the lake last summer?"

426
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,464
When did he tell you that?
Now.

427
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:32,217
You're a liar... or a lunatic.

428
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,336
No, bitch, she's clairvoyant.

429
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:38,206
"Regard not them that have
familiar spirits who consort

430
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,875
with demons to be
defiled by them."

431
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,928
Nan's not
talking to a demon.

432
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,563
She's talking to your son.

433
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:46,398
I don't believe it!

434
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,718
You're mocking my grief.

435
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,487
Not your grief.

436
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:55,107
Maybe the outfit.

437
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,025
God works
in mysterious ways, Joanie.

438
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,443
Roll with it.

439
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:00,061
He likes that song.

440
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:03,231
The one that
you sang to him before.

441
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,250
That proves you're a fraud.
I didn't sing.

442
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:07,902
I read to him from Deuteronomy.

443
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,234
When I was eight...

444
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,405
When he was eight...

445
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,673
when I broke my arm...

446
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,126
when he broke his arm...

447
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,343
"A Closer Walk"?

448
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:21,383
How can you know that?

449
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,351
We told you,
she's a mind reader.

450
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:24,752
We're witches.

451
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,055
Haven't you figured
that out by now?

452
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,473
Come on, Nan.

453
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,425
She doesn't deserve your help.

You bring nibbles?

470
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:00,181
I'm starving.

471
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,016
Girl, you ain't got no stomach.

472
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,702
What are you gonna do,

473
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,704
chew it and shit it
out of your neck?

474
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,524
Time for some sensitivity
training.

475
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,409
What fresh hell is this?

476
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:14,462
<i>Roots: The Saga</i>
<i>of an American Family.</i>

477
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,215
You are gonna watch
all eight hours of it,

478
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,802
followed by the sequel <i>,</i>
<i>Roots: The Next Generation.</i>

479
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,671
Why don't you just throw my head

480
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,389
in that fire pit?
I wanna die!

481
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:26,141
I'm ready.

482
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,643
Believe me, I'd love
nothing more than to melt

483
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,378
your ugly face
right off your skull,

484
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,713
but you are ignorant.

485
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,431
And you're not leaving
this earth

486
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:37,152
until I educate you about those
people you tortured: my people.

487
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,856
We're gonna have ourselves

488
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,775
a little film festival.
You're gonna watch <i>Mandingo,</i>

489
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,226
<i>The Color Purple,</i>

490
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:46,561
and then my personal favorite--

491
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,696
<i>BAPS,</i>

492
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,230
starring Miss Halle Berry.

493
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:52,667
But first, based on
the best-selling novel

494
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:55,287
by the great black writer
Alex Haley--

495
00:25:55,371 --> 00:26:00,008
one family's epic story,
from slavery to freedom--

00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:48,977
Protect? Really?

597
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:52,180
You know why I got
a female attack dog?

598
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:53,531
Because bitches stick together?

599
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,622
Because females are more loyal
and aggressive

their families.

I'm sure this isn't enough.

615

The thought of losing my son
shook me to the core.

616
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:18,866
I questioned my faith
in the Almighty.

617
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:23,288
But you have given me
a ray of hope.

618
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,544
Luke says there is a God.

619
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:31,212
And that he's judging you.

621
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:34,382
For what you did to his father.

622
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:38,619
His father?!

623
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:43,925
God says my father's death
was no accident.

00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,150
He's shown me the truth.

628
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:53,651
Joan, I've said
all I have to say.

629
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:56,070
I can't accept that.

630
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:57,405
Well, you'll have to.

631
00:33:57,472 --> 00:33:59,440
I want to be a good father.

632
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:01,442
I... I still want
to be in Luke's life.

But... we're done.

634
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,331
Maybe one day you'll understand.

635
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:18,543

the bees in the car.</i>

636

<i>was allergic to bees.</i>

638
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:25,216
You killed him
because he was leaving you.

639
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:28,186
Dad was in love
with Mrs. Martone.

640
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,853
She was in your book club.

641
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:47,238
She wasn't younger or prettier.

642
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:48,644
She just loved him
for who he was.

643
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:51,859
And that was the last straw.

644
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,629
God says you're going to pay.

645
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:59,700
You don't speak for my son.

646
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:01,636
He's been in that bed fighting
for his life.

647
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:05,139
This has all been
some dark-sided trick.

648
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:06,140

00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:31,731
Well, since none of you girls

662
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:33,834
can play cards worth a damn,

663
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,253
I took the liberty
of sprucing up your boy.

664
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:38,255
- Just a touch.
- You mean you fixed him?
