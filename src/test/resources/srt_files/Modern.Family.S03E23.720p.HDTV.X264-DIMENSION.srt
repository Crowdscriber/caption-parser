1
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:04,020
Phil, honey, you're still up.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,802
Okay, how does this sound?

3
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,982
Mitchell, I love you very much,

4
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:10,546
I not only love you,
but admire you,

5
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:13,221
- and someday I hope to...
- Are you firing him or proposing to him?

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,470
Honey, this was supposed
to be a part-time job.

7
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:17,448
He was gonna be done
in the summer anyway.

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,998
- Just be direct.
- I should have warned him.

9
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,573
How do you tell someone

10
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:22,598
they have a reputation
for being lazy?

11
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:23,936
Mitchell? Lazy?

12
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:26,366
Yeah. Yeah. He handed in
a couple of contracts late,

13
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:27,754
but I didn't want to say anything

14
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,829
because he's practically
doing this for free.

15
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:30,743
I can't do this!

16
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,897
This isn't the face of
a cold-blooded hatchet man.

17
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:34,925
Will you do it?

18
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:36,935
Hey.

19
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:40,229
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did we wake you up?

20
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,916
No, I was up.

21
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:43,234
I'm worried about tomorrow.

22
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:45,335
My art teacher acts
like I don't exist,

23
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,554
but I have one last chance
to impress him at our year-end art fair.

24
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:51,515
A few students are doing
living versions of famous paintings.

25
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:54,054
I've chosen this one,
and I'm using my own family.

26
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,255
Brilliant, right?

27
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,962
When I told him, he said,
"that's nice, Alice."

28
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,551
It's been a year.

29
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,693
Alice? Really?

30
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,077
Honey, do you think
you're nervous

31
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:04,983
because you've got
a little crush on Mr. Jarvis?

32
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:06,822
- No. - Are you sure? Because
I've seen the way you look at him--

33
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,037
Sounds like you're
the one with the crush!

34
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,498
I've just never had a teacher
not like me before.

35
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,750
- Well, Ms. Davis.
- Mm.

36
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,312
Please. She's a gym teacher.

37
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:16,796
She is to teaching what
Dr. Seuss is to medicine.

38
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,655
And to think she didn't like you.

39
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,603
You? What's your problem?

40
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:23,963
Nothing. I'm just
excited for tomorrow.

41
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:26,395
I'm getting a medal at school
because I put out a fire.

42
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,663
Maybe that's what
I should be when I grow up...

43
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,393
A professional medal-getter.

44
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:36,543
Luke, what happened?

45
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:37,872
I don't know.

46
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:41,431
I was just walking by
and I smelled flames.

47
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,761
I was there.

48
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:43,974
I don't like this.

49
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:45,213
We're not supposed to be in here.

50
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:46,460
Just keep a lookout!

51
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,938
We're ten seconds away
from creating luketonium.

52
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,666
- Oh, crap!
- Look what you did!

53
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:55,479
Luke, what happened?

54
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:56,862
I don't know.

55
00:01:57,015 --> 00:02:00,437
I was just walking by
and I smelled flames.

56
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,951
Okay, guys, you're gonna
be dragging tomorrow

57
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,470
if you don't go to bed
right now. Let's go. Go.

58
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,457
Fine. Come on, Alice.

59
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,918
I'll be up in a minute.

60
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,563
"Mitchell,

61
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,922
"I can't tell you how hard...

62
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,421
How hard this..."

63
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:21,140
No, that's-- no,
it's not personal enough.

64
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,059
Okay, okay.

65
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,996
"I can't tell you how hurt
and angry this makes me,

66
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,212
"but you've been late
too many times.

67
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,194
I'll need your keys."

68
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,073
Daddy, no! I'm so sorry!

69
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,048
Honey, I didn't hear you
come downstairs.

70
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,183
You couldn't sleep, either?

71
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,708
Uh, yeah.

72
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,580
No, there's just, like,
a lot on my mind with graduation,

73
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,484
and what to wear.
How does this look?

74
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,752
Wait a second.
You're carrying your shoes.

75
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,588
How am I supposed
to judge the whole outfit?

76
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:55,537
Put 'em on.

77
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:09,117
Synced by YYeTs, corrected by gloriabg
www.addic7ed.com

78
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,443
So make sure you give
this menu here

79
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,998
a good, thorough reading.

80
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:15,231
- Soup.
- You didn't even look at it.

81
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,272
- Soup.
- Check out what's below the soup--

82
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:19,281
Sandwiches.

83
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,010
Have you check out what
is below this outfit?

84
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,088
This doesn't come from sandwiches.

85
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,104
Look!

86
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,668
"The Jay Pritchett"?

87
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,394
I don't understand.

88
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,392
They named you after a sandwich?

89
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,614
No! They named
a sandwich after me!

90
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,894
"Turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese,

91
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:37,651
red peppers, anchovies on wheat"?

92
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,460
Most people would stop
after the salty bacon,

93
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,221
but I double down
with the anchovies.

94
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,703
Were you making a sandwich
or attracting deer?

95
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:45,385
Is this bum bothering you, miss?

96
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:46,683
Oh, I should get
a picture of this--

97
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,142
an actual waitress
sighting in this dump.

98
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,035
I took a chance and put in
an order for your sandwich,

99
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:55,156
although most people like
their Jay Pritchetts to go.

100
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:56,363
What's happening?

101
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,761
Gloria, it's Maxine.

102
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,450
So you're married to Jay.

103
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:01,828
Where'd you tie up
your seeing eye dog?

104
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,462
No, no, I'm not, um...

105
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:06,260
Okay, I get it. I get it.

106
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,673
Here's that number for that
neck doctor I want you to see.

107
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,253
- Thanks.
- What's wrong with your neck?

108
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,909
For 30 years, I've been hearing
it's a handball injury.

109
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,446
But it always seems
to get worse with stress.

110
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,377
Maybe it's that audit
he's got coming up.

111
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:18,863
- Audit?
- It's nothing.

112
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,910
Oh, isn't that cute?
He doesn't want you to worry.

113
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:24,281
Here's your sandwich.

114
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,839
Now you should worry.

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,102
Look at it-- my prettiest child.

116
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,103
Why didn't you tell me
about your neck?

117
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,611
It's fine. Take a bite.

118
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,481
- Your company's getting audited?
- Nothing!

119
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,793
Three bad days,
then it's over.

120
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:36,864
Come on! I'm-- I'm anxious
to hear what you think.

121
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,454
I see it growing on ya.

122
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:42,281
It's like Maxine
when she first tried it.

123
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,519
- You know, she--
- I don't like it.

124
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:46,551
- You probably didn't get all--
- Jay, I try it. I don't like it.

125
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:48,188
That's all you can say?

126
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,902
It tastes bad in my mouth.

127
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,743
It's like a fish and a Turkey

128
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,089
beat themselves
to death with a pepper.

129
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,593
Okay, fair enough.
Maybe a little picky, though,

130
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,507
from someone who prepared
a Colombian specialty

131
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,651
and said, "why are you
not eating the hooves?

132
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,177
They're the best part."

133
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,063
I'm back!

134
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,488
Oh, hey, Uncle Cam.

135
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,449
Oh, thanks again
for picking me up last night.

136
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,585
You're welcome, but
you have to be more careful.

137
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,172
I was the responsible one.

138
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:14,828
Lisa was drinking,
and I took her keys,

139
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,446
- and then e--
- I understand.

140
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,975
My senior year, I had
a pretty crazy night myself

141
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:21,609
involving a bottle of corn mash
and an overturned plow.

142
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,763
- Seriously? - Yeah. You don't know
terror until you've had to

143
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:25,528
stare down the eyes
of a Missouri State Trooper

144
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,226
and talk your way out of a P.U.I.

145
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:31,802
Honey, you don't drink coffee.

146
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:32,935
I do when I've been up
half the night

147
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,788
worrying about a project
that's only one-third done,

148
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,714
and I still have an apron to sew,
scenery to paint,

149
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,833
plus my normal
crushing workload. So...

150
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,863
Unless you have a better way
for me to stimula--

151
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:43,831
Oh, God.

152
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,130
God, coffee's bitter.

153
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,535
That was your first sip?

154
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,748
Okay, I got the chafing dish,

155
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,222
salt and pepper shakers--
perfect matches, both.

156
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,626
I may have to readjust my grapes.

157
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:56,809
Oh. Ow.
I'll just give you a little privacy.

158
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:00,318
Welcome back to the light show. Hi.

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,603
Hi, Lily.

160
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:02,619
Hi, daddy.

161
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:04,923
Lily...

162
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,357
Sweetheart, no.

163
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,860
No, no, no, no. We're--
we're not gonna do that today.

164
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:09,497
Actually-- actually, Claire,

165
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,139
we're--we're trying not to use
the word "no" so much.

166
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,180
We just read a book that said

167
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:15,429
- children learn to rebel
against that word. - Uh-huh.

168
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,511
So we redirect her
into a new activity instead.

169
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,169
Oh. Here--
well, just watch this.

170
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,834
Lily, sweetie, hi.
It's daddy here.

171
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,979
Would you like to listen
to some music?

172
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,118
Okay. There you go.

173
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,248
See?

174
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:29,685
Every new generation thinks

175
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:31,690
they have cracked
the code on child rearing.

176
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,023
What's the latest theory?
Never say "no."

177
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,638
I say "no" every day in this house.

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,396
But at night,
she's a "yes" machine.

179
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,284
No.

180
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:44,142
Oh, it doesn't seem that she
is redirecting her own energy

181
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:45,729
as much as using a lot of ours.

182
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,121
But do you see how
she's slowly transitioning

183
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:50,464
from the lights to the music?

184
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,984
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

185
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:54,741
It's hard to believe
there was ever a time

186
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:57,088
when we just said,
"stop doing that."

187
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,097
Oh. The garbage disposal.

188
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,847
Lily, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

189
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:05,235
Now let's redirect you into a nap, huh?

190
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:06,795
Actually, we're doing
this new thing

191
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:09,447
where we let her tell us when she wants to take a nap.

192
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:11,654
Uh-huh. It's called
"being your own nap Captain."

193
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:13,714
Come on, sweetie.

194
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,394
- Hey! Hey.
- Phil.

195
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,851
Hey. Did you ring the doorbell?

196
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:26,663
Oh, no, 'cause I have
these two coffees.

197
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:27,727
One is for you.

198
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,384
Thank you.

199
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,740
Here's my life-- a full-time job,

200
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,314
a 3-year-old,
and a second one on the way.

201
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:34,929
And as a favor,

202
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,474
I agreed to do a little work
for Phil's agency.

203
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,714
The problem is,
I'm very good,

204
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,624
and the more I do,
the more they want me.

205
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,711
I-I even turned in
a few assignments late

206
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,751
so that they'd fall out of love
with me a little bit.

207
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:48,544
Right.

208
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,201
How-- how long have you
been standing here?

209
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,679
Are-- are you-- are you all right?

210
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,419
Oh, yeah.

211
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,108
'Cause you're--
you're really blinking.

212
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,141
I'm a stress blinker,

213
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:01,540
um, and what really
gets me going is confrontation.

214
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,993
I hate it.
I-I avoid it at all costs.

215
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:04,990
Terrible at it.

216
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:07,277
Once, I, uh, I tried
to break up with a girl,

217
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,912
and I danced around it so much,

218
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,977
she didn't know
I had broken up with her.

219
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:13,676
20 years later,
we're still married.

220
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,479
I am... really... sorry...

221
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,230
About the cold coffee.

222
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:22,385
It's not that cold.
It's lukewarm, so...

223
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,277
Funny story
about that expression--

224
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:27,861
when the kids were younger,
um, we had a, uh,

225
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:29,150
- a wading pool...
- Uh-huh.

226
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,866
And occasionally,
Luke would have an accident,

227
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,477
and, um, Alex would scream,

228
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,514
and we'd say, um, "it's okay, honey,

229
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,425
he's just making it lukewarm."

230
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,018
- Wow, so-- so
- I gotta get going,

231
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,451
- but I-I'll see-- 
- Okay, wait!

232
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,007
I'm just gonna come
straight out and say it.

233
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,106
Mitchell, you've done
a wonderful job for the agency

234
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,408
since you decided you'd help us
out for just a little bit.

235
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,257
And we couldn't ask
for more, could we?

236
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,545
I wish it didn't have to end.

237
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:55,378
In fact, if it was up to me,
you'd stay on forever...

238
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,762
- Phil, Phil... 
- But it is not just up to me, is it?

239
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,820
- So... I...
- Phil, I saw this coming,

240
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,795
and-- and look...

241
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,949
I bailed.
I made an excuse and left.

242
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,118
But I-I-I've gotta
be straight with him.

243
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,567
"Phil, I cannot stay on
with your firm forever."

244
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,245
Oh! God, it's gonna crush him.

245
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,490
Maybe I can get Claire to do it.

246
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,286
Well, that was easy!

247
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,086
We're really proud of you, buddy.
See you at the ceremony.

248
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,882
- You're not a hero.
- I put out a fire.

249
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:29,853
A fire you started.

250
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:31,402
- Was there a fire?
- Yes.

251
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,589
- Did I put it out?
- That's not--

252
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,015
Answer the question.

253
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,213
Yes.

254
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,702
I'm getting an award for it.

255
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,706
If they gave awards
for starting fires,

256
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:40,130
I'd be getting one of those, too.

257
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:42,093
I know you have
a conscience, Luke.

258
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:45,660
Do you see this flag?
It stands for Justice.

259
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,661
So when that fire marshall
gets here,

260
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:49,435
I know you're going
to look at that flag

261
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:50,674
and do the right thing.

262
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,083
You were very quiet
all the way home.

263
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:04,116
Are you upset at me because
I honked at that old lady?

264
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:06,246
Normally, we leave
the honking to the driver,

265
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,499
but I'm used to it.

266
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,219
Is it because of the sandwich?

267
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,284
Ah, you maybe could
have eaten half of it...

268
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,780
Said a couple of nice things.

269
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,529
It's just a sandwich, Jay.

270
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,887
It's not about the
delicious sandwich, Gloria.

271
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:19,779
It's about being respectful
of a person's feelings.

272
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,284
But I was just being honest.

273
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,207
You don't have to be honest

274
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,877
about every little thing
in a relationship.

275
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:26,511
Some things you say,
some things you don't.

276
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:27,427
Oh?

277
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,018
What are the things
that you don't say?

278
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,463
Gloria, I really don't wanna
do this anymore.

279
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,115
Oh, really?

280
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:33,375
But you cannot just try
to teach me a lesson,

281
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:34,481
- and then not even-- 
- Okay, fine.

282
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:35,544
I don't say this,

283
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:38,233
but it... bothers me a little bit

284
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:41,147
that you're just a tiny bit... loud.

285
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:42,237
- Loud?
- Not all the time.

286
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:43,976
Only when you, you know,
when you talk.

287
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,180
So I embarrass you?

288
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,914
Gloria... what?

289
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,818
- Am I being too loud again?
- All right. Buckle up.

290
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,970
Oh, I'm gonna go and
try to do the laundry,

291
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,312
and I'm gonna do it very quietly

292
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:58,630
so I don't bother you.
Maybe Manny can help me.

293
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,014
Manny!

294
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,127
- I get it.
- Manny!

295
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,289
I get it.

296
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:08,979
Now you're not even
making any noise.

297
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,156
Okay, this is way too many grapes,

298
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:15,312
and this spoon is modern day,

299
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,679
so if we use it, everyone
at the table has to react in shock

300
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,075
at the spoon from the future.

301
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,657
- Okay.
- And that went down the drain.

302
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:23,089
And you need a nap.

303
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,474
You need a nap.

304
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:27,308
I got it. Ooh, I lost it. Shoot.

305
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:29,781
Let me know if I can eliminate
any distractions for you.

306
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:31,632
Oh, I got it. No, I got
a finger on it. There it is.

307
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,003
Oh, lost it again.

308
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:34,903
Maybe you should just wait
until it comes to you.

309
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,655
You know, make it the Captain
of its own spoon platoon.

310
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,681
I understand the point
you're making, Claire, but...

311
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:40,915
Oh! Now I'm stuck.

312
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,060
Yeah, Cam, you are stuck.

313
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,486
You are stuck on a philosophy
that clearly doesn't work.

314
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:47,234
Sometimes, you need
to say "no" to a child.

315
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:49,798
Yeah, and sometimes you need
to say "no" to an adult.

316
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,213
No, Claire. No, I don't need
help raising my child.

317
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,178
Oh. Okay.

318
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:56,501
Sorry.

319
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,658
Guess I-I do have a lot to learn.

320
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,812
Right now, I-I'm looking
forward to learning

321
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,136
if you will get your
arm out of there

322
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:05,721
before Lily gets to the
garbage disposal switch.

323
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,439
Um... Lily, sweetie!

324
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,050
C-can you do something,
please, Claire?

325
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,419
I would like to.
Really, I would,

326
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,570
but I would probably just say "no"

327
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:18,490
and shred her confidence
and mangle her self-esteem.

328
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,840
Okay, fine! I'm sorry!
Just-- here,

329
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:22,282
- Stop her! Stop her! Sweetie!
- What to do with you?

330
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,721
Claire! Okay!

331
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:29,716
Ohh! Yes!

332
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,566
- You think that's funny, don't ya?
- Yes!

333
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,706
Yes. Well, it's wicked, Claire.
It's wicked.

334
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,203
Come on. We're leaving, Lily!

335
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:41,383
Lily!

336
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:45,183
It's living art. We stay
perfectly still for 90 seconds,

337
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,482
basically doing nothing.

338
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,906
Sounds like my first wife.

339
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,895
I don't know.
She always moved for me.

340
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:52,152
As long as you both agree
it was only 90 seconds.

341
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:54,045
Two nerds with one stone!

342
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,028
I love working in an office.

343
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,095
Is that your brother-in-law?
I thought you fired him.

344
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,779
I did, before work.

345
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,760
Then what's he doing here?

346
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,541
Is he disgruntled?
He looks disgruntled.

347
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,113
No, he always looks like that.

348
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,808
Hey. How's it going?

349
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,267
Hey, hey. Listen--

350
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:09,703
- Okay, I know this is uncomfortable...
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,346
But we really need to talk
about my future here.

352
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:13,752
But I-I-I thought we--

353
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,626
No, I know.
I know I led you to believe

354
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,603
that I'd be able to stay
on here indefinitely,

355
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:18,968
and--and... O-okay,

356
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:19,949
- don't get all blinky.
- Oh.

357
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,314
- No, it's not all bad news, okay?
- Okay.

358
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:24,196
You will have me until July,
like we agreed.

359
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:25,582
- Okay, great.
- Yes.

360
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,529
Hey, could you jump on the elevator
with me real quick?

361
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,800
Yes. Yes. I could use a hand
carrying up some stuff from my car.

362
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:34,419
Oh! My goodness. I probably
need some empty boxes, don't I?

363
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,846
You know what?
You head down,

364
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,033
I'll meet you at the glass doors.

365
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:37,950
There was something else.
What was it?

366
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,290
I know it's in there.
Oh, yeah, you're fired.

367
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,510
What? F-fired?!

368
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,515
W-what's going on with these things?

369
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:46,712
You trying to open 'em?

370
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:47,720
Mm-hmm.

371
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,852
I guess I better... get somebody.

372
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:51,096
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait--

373
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,350
you're firing me?

374
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,103
I-I don't even like this job.

375
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,321
That can't be safe.

376
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,463
- Is someone trapped in there?
- The guy they fired.

377
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,749
Oh, the lazy guy?

378
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,672
Lazy?!

379
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,000
You handed in
a couple of things late.

380
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:02,282
I should have warned you.

381
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:03,703
I'm terrible at breaking bad news.

382
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,156
Well, then why did you come
over to my house

383
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,386
and tell me how great I was?

384
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,009
That was me trying to fire you!

385
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:11,399
I haven't felt like this since I tried
to break up with Claire 20 years ago.

386
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,343
Someone's stuck again?

387
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,464
That lawyer with the attitude
they just fired.

388
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:15,952
They said it was your attitude,

389
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,881
like you were doing us a favor.

390
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,068
I was doing you a favor!

391
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:22,555
- Why didn't he get the stairs
like everyone else? - Lazy.

392
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,197
Don't worry, he can't get you.

393
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:30,497
Two hours I got stuck in there with
an entire office of people staring at me.

394
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,497
I finally had to lie down.

395
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:35,631
Didn't help my reputation.

396
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:40,349
Figures.

397
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,400
You guys nailed it.

398
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,434
Dude, that was surreal.

399
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:57,047
- Get it?
- Dad, come on!

400
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,872
We have a minute to set up!

401
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,012
Where are Mitchell and Cam?

402
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,824
Hey, Manny. Thanks for what you said
before about the flag.

403
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,088
It really got me thinking.

404
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,484
I knew you had a conscience, Luke.

405
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,676
And more importantly,
you've got a good...

406
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:09,905
You didn't.

407
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:11,468
Yep. And thanks to you,

408
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:14,061
I had them move the ceremony
to right under the flag.

409
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,539
I'll sign a picture for you.

410
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,744
Oh, there you are.
I was afraid you weren't coming.

411
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:20,806
It was a discussion.

412
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:21,684
If we weren't gonna show up,

413
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,636
we would have clearly let you know,

414
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,283
and not humiliated you in public.

415
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,461
If it's any consolation,

416
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:27,659
the lawyer we hired to replace you

417
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,470
is already suing
the elevator company.

418
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,837
Ow. You're sitting on my hand.

419
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,951
Be thankful you have two.
I almost lost one today.

420
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,051
Oh, stop being such a baby.

421
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,383
She was nowhere near that switch.

422
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,742
Shh! Keep your voices down.
We're about to go on.

423
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:38,769
Why you looking at me?

424
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,138
Am I too loud?
Is that what everybody thinks?

425
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,430
- What? - There's a backstory here
you don't wanna know about.

426
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:46,071
- I want turkey.
- Save your appetite, baby girl.

427
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:47,173
And don't forget, afterwards,

428
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:48,468
we're going to Lenny's
for a bite to eat--

429
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,319
more than a bite
if you value my feelings.

430
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,057
Oh! Great, we get to see Maxine.

431
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:54,007
What? You know Maxine, too?

432
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:55,528
Oh, we all know Maxine. Love.

433
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,857
Second-best hugger in the world,

434
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:59,609
after Mr. Burt Reynolds.
Story to follow.

435
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,494
All right, guys, this will all
be over in 90 seconds.

436
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,111
- Hold your poses.
- Okay.

437
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,742
I really wanna impress Mr. Gorgeous.

438
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:06,696
Jarvis! Shut up.

439
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,222
Hey, Mitch, I know
this isn't a good time,

440
00:16:09,223 --> 00:16:10,608
I-I just want you to know,

441
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,727
- I'm really-- 
- I know, Phil.You're really sorry, okay?

442
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:15,198
But this is gonna take me a little
time to get over, all right?

443
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,628
Actually, I was gonna say I'm really
gonna need your parking pass.

444
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:18,514
What?!

445
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:21,727
Our next stage presentation
will be Alex Dunphy's interpretation

446
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:25,483
of Norman Rockwell's 1943 painting
"Freedom from want."

447
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,963
How do you sleep at night, Luke?

448
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:29,775
- With a medal around my neck.
- Shh!

449
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:31,727
- I want Turkey.
- Lily, no!

450
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:32,908
She doesn't understand that word.

451
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,927
Cram it, Claire.

452
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:35,572
Control your child, Cam.

453
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:37,735
It's not that difficult.
I've raised three.

454
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:38,737
- Really?
- Cam!

455
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,896
Why don't you ask Haley what time
she got home last night?

456
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:42,970
- Uncle Cam!
- Sorry, dear. Collateral damage.

457
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,400
- What is he talking about?
- Shh!

458
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:45,212
Your arms are shaking.

459
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:45,940
Oh, yeah,

460
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,833
I'm sure that the great Maxine
can do a better job!

461
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,886
You can criticize my parenting
all you like, Cam,

462
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,870
but my son just won a medal.

463
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:54,133
For a fire he started.

464
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:55,478
Luke, is that true?

465
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:59,096
How long? It's getting heavy!

466
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,604
You're not getting
that parking pass back.

467
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:01,995
I tried to let you down easy.

468
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:03,864
You don't know how
to talk to people, Phil.

469
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:05,961
It's just like when Claire
didn't even know you dumped her.

470
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:07,410
- What?
- When did dad dump you?

471
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,387
I didn't dumr! I just tried to!

472
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,040
I am losing it!

473
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,439
Just a few more seconds!

474
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:14,573
I want turkey.

475
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,504
Lily, no!

476
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,434
We really are trying
to not say that word.

477
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:21,175
B-minus,

478
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,348
but there was a silver lining.

479
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,855
"I expected more, Alex."

480
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:29,410
Alex!

481
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,789
I am gonna call Haley and tell her

482
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,960
we're not going to that deli.

483
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,552
I can't take another minute of Cam.

484
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,654
You know, I'm not even sure

485
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,336
I believe all these
new parenting theories,

486
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:40,283
but I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let her tell me they're wrong.

487
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,102
We are not going to dinner.

488
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,520
I tried that sandwich.

489
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,416
It's not that good.
You're not missing anything.

490
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:48,044
I sure won't miss seeing Luke
and that stupid medal.

491
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:50,207
I play by the rules.
Where's my medal?

492
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,108
Jay can stay with that Maxine.

493
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,706
She's not loud like me.

494
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,784
In fairness, you can be
a little quick to give advice.

495
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,544
Well, I'm always ready to help,
if that's what you mean, yeah.

496
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,385
Yeah, but if you're not careful,
it can come off a little...

497
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:05,610
Know-it-all-y.

498
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:06,916
That's not a word.

499
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:10,388
What you mean to say is,
it can come off like I know it all.

500
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:13,110
I've always been this way.

501
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,639
That's why I wanted
to break up with you.

502
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,473
The word "fired" doesn't even apply.

503
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:19,362
You can't get fired from a favor.

504
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:21,545
Okay, sweetie, maybe
you should just let it go.

505
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:24,119
Like I always say, it's better
to carry a tune than a grudge.

506
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,436
Okay, you...
You've never said that, but...

507
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:28,849
And--and what about this grudge
you're holding against Claire?

508
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,695
I don't see you trading
that in for a tune.

509
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:31,914
That is completely different.

510
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,705
She insulted my parenting skills.

511
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:36,324
Which, you have to admit,
you can be pretty defensive about.

512
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:41,128
Okay, so maybe we both
can be a little sensitive.

513
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:42,683
N-no. No.

514
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:45,208
Mnh-mnh. No. These-- these are--
these are not equal.

515
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,240
No, you have no idea
what it feels like to be fired.

516
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,845
Yes, I do. I've been fired.
Everyone has.

517
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:50,898
Not me.

518
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:53,196
- Never?
- No.

519
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,013
Nope, I've always been
very good at what I do.

520
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,177
So then maybe what you're feeling

521
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,798
is a little insecure about
your work for the first time.

522
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,312
That's hogwash.

523
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:06,110
As someone who's seen
actual hogwash,

524
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,800
I can assure you that it's not.

525
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,722
I don't know why you're
 so bothered by Maxine.

526
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:11,829
She's nice.

527
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:14,271
Oh, good!
Why don't you, Jay, and Maxine

528
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:16,709
live together,
eating sandwiches forever?!

529
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:19,655
Can I float a theory here, mom?

530
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:21,356
You sound like you're jealous.

531
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,701
Please!

532
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,041
Me jealous of that woman?

533
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:28,158
I just don't like the way
they talk to each other!

534
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:29,899
And the little jokes,

535
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,154
and she knows everything
about his life!

536
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,364
Just makes me feel like, em...

537
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,359
Is that jealous?

538
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,158
Ay, my poor sisters.

539
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:49,896
Just you? I thought the whole
family was swinging by.

540
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,819
Who knows what they're doing?

541
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,401
Right now, they're all
sniping at each other.

542
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:53,556
Ah, who needs 'em?

543
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:54,934
Right. As long as
I have you, Maxine...

544
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:56,037
I'm off in five.

545
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:57,389
Hey, Luke!

546
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,098
What's with all the hardware?

547
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,124
Well, he set fire to a school
and lied about it.

548
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,821
You know they give medals
for anything these days.

549
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,104
It's going back tomorrow.

550
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,192
He doesn't get a lot of medals.

551
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,806
I just really need one of these.
Hey.

552
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,790
- Don't hold back.
- Oh!

553
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,464
- My girls. There they are.
- Hi.

554
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,010
- Hello, hello.
- Hi, all.

555
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,901
- Hey, Cam.
- Hey!

556
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,016
Come on in!

557
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:27,043
I, uh, I appreciate your coming.

558
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:30,306
- And, again, I really, really--
thank you. - Yeah.

559
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:32,398
- There she is.
- Well, look who made it.

560
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,677
Hola, Maxine.
So nice to see you.

561
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,099
Let me get you some menus.

562
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,031
We don't need it.

563
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,953
It's Jay Pritchetts all around!

564
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,431
Gloria, if you want your sandwich
without anchovies,

565
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:44,721
- I won't be offended.
- Aw.

566
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:47,490
Of course, then it'll be
a Jack Feldman.

567
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:56,586
- Hey. Hmm?
- Yeah?

568
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,193
- Hey, man.
- Is the repair guy here?

569
00:20:58,194 --> 00:20:59,485
He's working on it.

570
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:00,738
Um, listen, uh,

571
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,780
it's Katie's birthday,
skip's assistant.

572
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:04,797
Big 3-0. Still no ring.

573
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:05,899
You woke me up to tell me that?

574
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,623
No, no. I-I grabbed you some cake.

575
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:09,683
Oh, sure it's not
for employees only?

576
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,242
Okay. Had that coming.

577
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,434
Who are you talking to, Phil?

578
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,765
- Mitchell.
- Who?

579
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,917
Mitchell, my br-- uh, the lazy guy.

580
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:17,422
I was doing you a favor.

581
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:20,590
All right, just give me the cake.
I'm hungry.

582
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:22,562
No! Oh.

583
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:30,062
