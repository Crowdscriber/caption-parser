2
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:22,749
There it is.
Another one.

3
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,322
Every hook I baited with that
jerk chicken got a gator.

4
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:28,024
It's the odor, I tell you.

5
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,308
You can blind the alligator,

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,161
he can still hunt for food,

7
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,196
but you block up his nose,

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,948
he'll starve to death.

9
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,483
Yeah, but he'd die first
from not being able to breathe.

10
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:39,085
Yeah, either way
it's a death sentence.

11
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:43,990
We got a lot of skinnin'
to do before sundown.

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,992
Come on, come to Papa, baby.

13
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,045
Yeah...

14
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:08,231
Well, we're cooked if she
already made the call.

15
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,950
We got $80,000 worth
of fines here in the camp.

16
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:18,458
All wrong.

17
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:24,061
All rot and black.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,534
This will not be forgiven.

19
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:29,553
What do you want, girl?

20
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,006
Why would you kill
God's innocent creatures?

21
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:36,559
So they can be made into shoes?

22
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:38,044
You think she's one of
them goddamn PETA girls?

23
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:39,646
No, she ain't from PETA.

24
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:42,515
You should have
stayed away, girl.

25
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,235
You play with dead things, you're
more than likely to join 'em.

26
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:51,407
Not all dead.

27
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:31,023
Rise and shine, ladies.

28
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,175
It's time
for morning gathering.

29
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:39,815
I expect you both downstairs
in five minutes.

30
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,368
Shall I come in this?

31
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,492
My God, get over it already.

32
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,694
He spent his summers
volunteering for the United Way.

33
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,130
Oh. He should be canonized.

34
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,165
Fiona? I know you're home.

35
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,866
How can you be such a bitch?

36
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:01,036
Because I understand people,
and that guy

37
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:04,423
would have happily taken a turn
on me if he had the chance.

38
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,509
No, that's bullshit.
He wasn't like that.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,644
Those guys were
his frat brothers.

40
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,979
It's guilt by association.

41
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:12,515
Open the door, Mother.

42
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,719
No, I don't accept that.

43
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,489
Look, for the sake
of peace among roommates,

44
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,408
I'm sorry
I killed your boy candy, okay?

45
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,612
But given
your black widow status,

46
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:28,864
he was living
on borrowed time anyways.

47
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,036
I'm kind of busy right now.

48
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,922
My God, what's that smell?

49
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,508
I, um...

50
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,927
I went to a Chinese doctor,
he gave me some herbs to boil.

51
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,579
I know it's kind of pungent.

52
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,414
We're about
to have our morning gathering.

53
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:48,217
I'm going to be going over
the house rules with the girls,

54
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,885
and I would like you
to hear them.

55
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:52,354
Hmm. Sounds riveting.

56
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,690
I'll be down in a minute.

57
00:04:56,526 --> 00:05:00,396
Now, listen up, Miss Pittypat.

58
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,199
If you scream,

59
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:06,535
I'm gonna put you right back in
the ground where I found you.

60
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,655
You understand? Hmm?

61
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,490
Yeah?

62
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:13,626
Help!

63
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,295
Shut up! Shut up!

64
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,581
I want you to tell me right now

65
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:21,167
how it is you're still
alive after all these years

66
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,285
and not some moldering corpse.

67
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,387
Shh!

68
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:26,806
Shut up!

69
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:31,677
Jesus, woman, it's a
cell phone, all right?

70
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:34,680
Fiona? We're starting!

71
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:38,150
Now you just stay quiet,
and when I get back,

72
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,686
we're gonna continue
our little chat.

73
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,475
And you better
make it worth my while.

74
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:52,981
Let me get a 44, extra crispy,

75
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,950
Yo. The medium bucket is
supposed to have eight pieces.

76
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,536
This one has only seven.

77
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:59,338
My name's not "Yo."
It's Queenie.

78
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:00,873
And you must have miscounted

79
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:02,508
because I packed
that bucket myself.

80
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,032
Well, you must have got
a "D" in math

81
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,374
'cause there's only
seven pieces.

82
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:06,495
Actually, sir,
I got an "A" in math.

83
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,013
All of 'em.

84
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,965
Calculus, trig,
advanced algebra.

85
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,184
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

86
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,886
Look, I'm sure you're a genius.

87
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,521
Just give me an extra piece

88
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,306
of chicken,
and I'll be done here.

89
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:20,693
Look, Pencil Dick,
I'm not stupid, okay?

90
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,646
You ate that extra piece,
and now you want a freebie.

91
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,981
I'd like to speak
to the manager, stupid fat ass.

92
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:28,450
What did you call me?
Get the manager!

93
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,537
<i>I am the manager!</i>

94
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,797
Help! She's burned me!

95
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:47,920
Did they send you to jail?
No.

96
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:49,838
There were lots of witnesses,

97
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,474
and none of them had actually
seen me throw the oil.

98
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,510
But it made
the local newspaper,

99
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,712
and that's how
Miss Cordelia found me.

100
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,880
You didn't want to
join us at first.

101
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,433
<i>I grew up on white girl shit
like Charmed</i>

102
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:04,103
<i>and Sabrina the
Teenaged Cracker.</i>

103
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:06,655
<i>I didn't know that
there even were black witches.</i>

104
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:10,058
But as it turns out,
I'm an heir to Tituba.

105
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,194
She was a house slave in Salem.

106
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:15,414
She was the first
to be accused of witchcraft.

107
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,700
So, technically, I'm
part of your tribe.

108
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:20,586
Is this where we all
sing "Kum-Bah-Yah"?

109
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,954
Bitch, I will eat you!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

110
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,706
Hey!

111
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:26,175
You guys have got to start
taking care of each other.

112
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:27,909
We have enough enemies
on the outside.

113
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,462
Ms. Foxx?

114
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:31,714
Yes?

115
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,133
Detective Sanchez,
NOPD Homicide.

116
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:37,586
My partner Detective Stiles.
What's this about?

117
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,973
We'd like to have a word
with two of your girls.

118
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:43,759
When a movie star like you
shows up at a sorority house,

119
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,895
people are gonna pay attention
to where you go and with who.

120
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,731
Lot of people saw you
go into a back room

121
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,282
with some
of the guys on the bus.

122
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,618
What does that have to do
with the bus flipping?

123
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:53,602
These are teenaged girls.

124
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,987
How could they possibly do that?

125
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,455
This all seems so silly.

126
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,939
I'm just looking for someone

127
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,274
who had a motive
to hurt those guys,

128
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,942
who could've screwed
with the brakes

129
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,378
or the steering column.

130
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:04,580
Maybe whatever happened
in that room was upsetting.

131
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,448
Shouldn't we have a lawyer here

132
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,217
or something?
We're just talking.

133
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,453
Did you know any of those boys?
Had you met them before?

134
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,173
No. We barely spoke to them
that night. They took me

135
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:16,725
in the back room to try
to get me high, but I said no.

136
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:19,011
She's sober.
Except vodka.

137
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,013
Madison has a wicked
sense of humor.

138
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,964
But, in fact, she's come a long
way with her addiction issues.

139
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,233
We're very proud of her.

140
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,152
Can I ask you why you visited

141
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:28,737
one of the survivors
in the hospital?

142
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:36,862
Um... I felt bad for him.

143
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,247
We-we just met him
the night before.

144
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:39,815
He seemed nice.

145
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,034
He died right after you left.

146
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:45,153
The doctors can't quite
figure out how,

147
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,155
but when we checked you out,
we noticed

148
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,092
that another boy you knew
died in the exact same way

149
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,993
right before you got here.

150
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,179
A boy named Charles Taylor.

151
00:08:56,266 --> 00:09:00,853
They gang raped her, and
they got what they deserved!

152
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:02,304
How did you flip the bus?
Was it the wheels?

153
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:03,806
It was the wheels.

154
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,107
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

155
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:06,308
I... Nobody raped me.

156
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,843
She's clearly lost her mind.

157
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,344
Madison did it. She can move
things with her mind.

158
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:10,979
And I killed that asshole
in the hospital.

159
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:12,352
I have powers, too.
We're witches.

160
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:13,699
I'm sorry, Detective.

161
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:14,783
Zoe has clearly suffered

162
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,184
some kind of mental break.

163
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,570
No! No, enough lying.
It's over!

164
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,656
Everyone here is a witch.
I'm so sorry.

165
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:21,857
Please don't send us to jail.

166
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:24,526
Nobody's going to jail. Girls.

167
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,046
Will you leave us, please?

168
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,366
Are you in charge here?

169
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,469
I'm Fiona Goode.

170
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,421
I'm in charge everywhere.

171
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,424
We're gonna have to take both of
those girls in for questioning.

172
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:42,177
We'll try to keep this quiet,
but that Madison girl...

173
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,549
Drink.

174
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,734
Fiona,

175
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:50,069
don't.

176
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:51,186
Come on.

177
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:08,737
Oh. Tough guy.

178
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,622
Come on, give up.

179
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:13,125
I'm barely trying, you know.

180
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,844
In about ten seconds,

181
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:19,381
I'm going to turn the heat up
in that chubby melon of yours,

182
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,884
and I'm gonna turn your brains
to scrambled eggs.

183
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:26,421
Frankly, it's been
a hard morning,

184
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:30,275
and I'd really rather not
work up a sweat.

185
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,596
So come on. Just drink the
damn water, will you, please?

186
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,232
This is totally...
Shut up, Delia!

187
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:40,736
Unless you want me
to spit in a third cup.

188
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,165
Good.

189
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:56,084
Now, I'm going to need you both

190
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:58,253
to turn over
whatever information

191
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,922
you've gathered on these girls

192
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,124
and never speak about it
to anyone ever again.

193
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,810
Are we clear?

194
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,345
Perfectly.

195
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:07,896
Do you think Fiona can fix it?

196
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,315
You're such a goddamn idiot.

197
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,467
I can't believe you told them
everything.

198
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,319
I'm supposed
to be cleaning up my act.

199
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,188
When this gets out, I'm screwed.

200
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:17,906
Who cares? This is murder.

201
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,908
Like, multiple murders.

202
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,610
They're not gonna find
any evidence that we messed

203
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,145
with the bus because
we didn't mess with the bus!

204
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,814
What did you do
to that shit-dick

205
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,833
in the hospital though?

206
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,168
Idiots.

207
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,825
Have you any idea
what's going on out there?

208
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,178
Now, I forgave your ham-handed

209
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:41,263
mass murder business
with the bus--

210
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,932
overexuberance
of youth and all that--

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,969
but if you haven't got
the goddamn brains to know

212
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,103
that when strangers come

213
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,439
asking questions,
we close ranks,

214
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,107
then I fear

215
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:54,693
our line is truly at an end.

216
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:56,195
But they knew so much already.
I couldn't

217
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,013
toast a piece of bread

218
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:01,400
with the heat
they were putting on you.

219
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:04,536
You are soft.

220
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:05,616
You're emotional.

221
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:08,991
You care what people think.

222
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:13,078
Now, if there's one thing you
learn before leaving this place,

223
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:18,967
<i>it's that we,
even the weakest among us,</i>

224
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,385
are better
than the best of them.

225
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,168
Are we gonna get arrested?

226
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,571
You are missing the point.

227
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:28,043
Which is?
The point is...

228
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:31,146
in this whole wide wicked world,

229
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:34,635
the only thing you have
to be afraid of...

230
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,653
is me.

231
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:06,353
I was supposed to play a
cat burglar in this movie once,

232
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:08,972
but the funding fell through.

233
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:12,693
But not before I learned how
to do this.

234
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,995
Hold that.

235
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:36,767
Madison, what are
we doing here?

236
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:39,053
I'm gonna pay you back.

237
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:40,554
Pay me back?

238
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,972
For what?

239
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:43,006
I know what you did for me,

240
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:44,391
dealing with that asshole,

241
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:45,776
so I'm gonna return the favor.

242
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,846
Stole it out of Foxxy's stash.

243
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:52,950
It's in Latin.

244
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:55,152
What is this?
Resurrection spell.

245
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:58,155
We're gonna bring your boyfriend
back to life.

246
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:05,329
Oh, shit.

247
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,365
Guess that crash was even worse
than I thought.

248
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:16,373
No, don't!

249
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:19,560
He's still kind of cute though.

250
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:22,062
Madison!

251
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,548
Guess they're trying to figure
out where everything goes.

252
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:28,485
Can we please just
get out of here?

253
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:32,239
Zoe, look around this room.

254
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:33,824
Okay, what do you see?

255
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:35,826
A tragedy.

256
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,696
I see potential.

257
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,447
Look,

258
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,449
nice legs over here,

259
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:46,036
a great set of guns.

260
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,621
I wonder if he's a show-er

261
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,757
or a grower.

262
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,042
What's your point, Madison?

263
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:55,713
We take the best boy parts,
we attach them to Kyle's head

264
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:59,466
and we build the
perfect boyfriend.

265
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,519
Is this just a joke to you?

266
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,104
No, it's a challenge.

267
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:08,192
All we have to do is
follow this recipe.

268
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:14,698
Find me a saw.

269
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:22,956
How's the oven?

270
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,743
Ready for a bun?

271
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,912
I wish I could say yes.

272
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,798
You've been taking
the Clomiphene

273
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:32,166
as directed?

274
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,550
Yes.

275
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:34,951
And I was sure
it must be working.

276
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:36,670
I had horrible cramps,
hot flashes,

277
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:38,722
blurry vision...
Doc, what's the plan here?

278
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,758
She goes through hell and it doesn't even work.
Hank...

279
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,129
We've been at this for a year.
All I can do is stand around

280
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,179
like an asshole
while you get sick.

281
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:49,266
Well, unfortunately, the fertility
drugs don't come with any guarantees.

282
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,317
I'll send your blood
to the lab and we can

283
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,769
consider other options.

284
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,487
Like what?
Like in vitro fertilization.

285
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,522
Doc, can I have

286
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,074
a minute alone with my wife?
Sure.

287
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,781
Baby,

288
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,999
if you want to try this,
I'll support it.

289
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,501
But I don't get it.

290
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:10,420
I'm not ready to give up.

291
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:14,291
I should be able to have a baby
just like any other woman.

292
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:17,160
I know it's horrible,
but a lot of women do this.

293
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,096
- When they have no choice.
- You have a choice.

294
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:21,682
If I start using magic
to fulfill my every whim,

295
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:23,267
then I'm just Fiona.

296
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:24,802
This isn't...

297
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,770
a whim. This is about
us having a family.

298
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:29,223
You don't know
what you're asking me to do.

299
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:32,309
This kind of magic--
it's... dark.

300
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,111
It's about life and death,

301
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:35,946
and I don't want to play God.

302
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,949
So you're gonna let Dr. Morrison
play God instead.

303
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,577
Mmm...

304
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,579
Doesn't that smell good?

305
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,966
One thing

306
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,085
I'll give my daughter--

307
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:01,555
she can fry up a chicken leg.

308
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,925
I imagine you're...
a bit peckish

309
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:09,563
after spending 180 years
buried in a hole.

310
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,815
But then...

311
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,051
you probably don't need to eat,
being immortal.

312
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:18,388
Of course, sometimes we just
like to do things because

313
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,524
we enjoy them.

314
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:22,860
Do you wish to speak?

315
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,164
What did you just say?

316
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,999
About what?

317
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,584
How long?

318
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:33,503
180 years.

319
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:35,789
Easy to lose track,

320
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,090
I suppose.

321
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:40,294
That bitch.

322
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:42,212
That evil bitch.

323
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:43,630
Who?

324
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,082
Who did it?

325
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:48,635
I mean, they said you
were poisoned, but...

326
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,637
they obviously got
that part wrong.

327
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,606
I was tricked.

328
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,141
By whom?

329
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,059
That black devil.

330
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,145
<i>A love potion.</i>

331
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:00,280
<i>I offer it as a gift.</i>

332
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,918
Louis?

333
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,669
LaLaurie!

334
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:24,972
Show yourself!

335
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,407
You think you and this rabble

336
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,142
can frighten me?

337
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:49,863
I am Madame Marie
Delphine LaLaurie.

338
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,748
And you're nothing.

339
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:55,335
Your feeble attempt
at poisoning me failed,

340
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,586
nigger witch.

341
00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:00,340
If I wanted you dead,
you would be.

342
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:03,176
Where's my family?

343
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:05,012
Return them to me.

344
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,330
They never left.

345
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:13,603
Oh, my... God.

346
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:16,606
What have you done?

347
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:20,227
Oh, dear God.

348
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:21,979
Oh, God.

349
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,947
What have you done?

350
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:27,034
God in Heaven.

351
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,494
Oh...

352
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,162
God.

353
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,831
Don't think
that they didn't suffer

354
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:42,499
because they did, greatly.

355
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,869
But the fate
that I have planned for you

356
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,139
will make their suffering
seem as a gentle sleep.

357
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:53,010
It wasn't poison that I gave you
but something far worse.

358
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:57,180
My gift to you, Madame LaLaurie,
was life everlasting.

359
00:19:57,231 --> 00:20:02,352
Immortality was in that bottle.

360
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:04,438
Bring her!

361
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:13,030
My God...

362
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:20,787
For your sins,

363
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,005
Madame LaLaurie,

364
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:24,341
you are damned to live forever.

365
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:26,626
To never know the
release of sweet death.

366
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,078
To never reunite

367
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,713
with loved ones in
the realm beyond.

368
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,349
But instead to be alone,

369
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,753
sealed up in your unmarked grave
for all eternity,

370
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,939
listening to the world go on
around you,

371
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:41,942
even until that world
is no more.

372
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:51,401
I'm sorry for your loss.

373
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:55,872
You want a bite?

374
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,459
I'm not hungry.

375
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,344
I need a bowl

376
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,096
and some hair from his head.

377
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:51,995
Okay.

378
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,835
Breathe in the smoke.

379
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:15,535
Aah!

380
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,634
Give me your hand.

381
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,970

Azazel, we submit

00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:49,385
the lord of the underworld,
we offer you our obedience

386
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,554
and everlasting devotion
until death sanctifies

387
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:53,690
this unholy union.

388
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,225
Did we just marry the Devil?
'Cause I don't know

389
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,243
if I'm down with that.

Arise!

396
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,068
Well, that was a bust.

397
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:46,776
You sure you said
the spell correctly?

398
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,411
Hey, I've been acting
since I was five.

399
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,130
I know my lines.

400
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,252
I guess we're just
not powerful enough.

401
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:02,292
Hey, I'll, I'll meet you
in the car.

402
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:04,227
I, I left my phone
in here somewhere.

403
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:06,129
Hurry up.

404
00:24:22,947 --> 00:24:25,198
Shit.

405
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,117
Tough luck, bitch.

406
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm so sorry, Kyle.

407
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:36,293
None of this would have happened
if we weren't at that party.

408
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:40,180
My life has just been
so out of control lately.

409
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:42,332
I wish I could have kept you
out of it.

410
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,025
Who's there?

411
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:23,139
What the hell?

412
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,043
Oh, Jesus Christ.

413
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:31,815
What the hell
are you doing here?

414
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,530
Kyle, no, no!

415
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,757
Aah.

416
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,093
You're not used to having a...

417
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:19,479
white woman in your
chair, are you?

418
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:22,949
I'm not used to having a white
woman in this neighborhood.

419
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,151
Uh-uh, there's no smoking
in here.

420
00:26:25,236 --> 00:26:28,571
Most of that is real hair,
more precious than gold.

421
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:29,656
We buy it by the pound.

422
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,409
Mm-hmm.

423
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,247
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:47,623
You look good, little mama.

425
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:48,996
All right, you get
going home now.

426
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:51,394
I was just finishing.

427
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:53,396
All right, you all
go home, too.

428
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,650
I'll finish this one myself.

429
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:23,250
Stop.

430
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:24,486
Stop it.

431
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:26,653
I don't like it, stop.

432
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,215
Stop.

433
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:32,178
You okay?

434
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:37,181
Too much noise.

435
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,108
You think too loud.

436
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:50,945
It... is bothering me.

437
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:55,783
Just get out.

438
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:02,206
What the...?

439
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,657
Oh, who are you?

440
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,959
Out of my way, slave.

441
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:06,410
Who you calling a slave, bitch?

442
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:07,711
Yo, who is this stinky old ...?

443
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,303
So, have you owned
this place long?

444
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:18,339
What do you think?

445
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,558
I think, when they say
good black don't crack,

446
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:21,675
they're not wrong.

447
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:22,676
What's your secret?

448
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,044
What's yours?

449
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,347
Your manicure cost
more than my rent.

450
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:28,549
Woman like you wipes
her ass with diamonds.

451
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,386
She don't just end up walking
in here for hair extensions.

452
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:35,940
My, my, my,
aren't you perceptive?

453
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:39,226
You know exactly who I am
and what I'm capable of,

454
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:43,063
just like I know
exactly what you are, witch.

455
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:46,167
I can smell the stink
of it on you.

456
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:48,502
Well, I didn't expect
you to like me.

457
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:54,375
I mean, after all, your kind
and my kind have been going

458
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:57,595
after each other for centuries,

459
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,932
though it is kind of like a
hammer going after a nail.

460
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:03,968
Everything you got,
you got from us.

461
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:05,269
Tituba.

462
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:07,521
Voodoo slave girl who graced us

463
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,774
with her black magic.

464
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,560
She couldn't tell a love potion

465
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:15,279
from a recipe for
chocolate chip cookies

466
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:16,263
if she had to read it.

467
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:19,066
You made her a slave.

468
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,068
Before that she came
from a great tribe--

469
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,703
the Arawak.

470
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,488
She learned the secrets
of the other side

471
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:27,241
from a 2,000-year-old line
of shamans.

472
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:31,445
Necromancy-- she gave it
to your girls of Salem.

473
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:32,663
A gift repaid with betrayal.

474
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:34,498
Please.

475
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:38,252
You want to tell me that some
illiterate voodoo slave girl

476
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:40,337
gave me my crown?

477
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:41,755
Well, maybe
you haven't heard the news

478
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:43,591
about civilization starting
in Africa.

479
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:45,402
We're more than just pins
in dolls and seeing

480
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,678
the future in chicken parts.

481
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:50,147
You've been reading
too many tourist guides.

482
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:51,398
Speaking of
tourist guides--

483
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:53,767
no more spray--

484
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:56,803
I have been to
St. Louis Number 1

485
00:29:56,855 --> 00:30:00,858
and I have seen
the tomb of Laveau,

486
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:03,143
seen the fat tourists

487
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:06,146
from Little Rock to Hackensack

488
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:08,365
drawing crosses on the bricks,

489
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,835
making wishes to the bones
of Marie Laveau.

490
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:16,757
Little do they know,
all they have to do

491
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:21,545
to get their wishes granted was
come down here to the Ninth Ward

492
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,464
and get their hair braided.

493
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:30,271
And what is your wish, witch?

494
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,975
I want what you have,

495
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:39,897
whatever it is that has kept
you young all these years.

496
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:45,786
The hammer wants
the nail's magic.

497
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:48,622
Oh, that is rich.

498
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,408
Yeah, and you're going
to give it to me

499
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:54,545
because I have
something you want.

500
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:56,380
You could offer me a unicorn

501
00:30:56,464 --> 00:30:58,215
that shit $100 bills,

502
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,834
and I'd still never give
you more than a headache.

503
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:02,386
Boys.

504
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:06,724
Hurry, get, get it, put it out.
Stop!

505
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:12,513
I don't like it.

506
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:14,565
But we'll be in touch.

507
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:18,385
Such a lovely place
you have here.

508
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:21,105
It's nice to see
you doing so well

509
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:22,740
after all these years.

510
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:25,909
I mean, maybe in
another century...

511
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:29,913
you could have two
shithole salons.

512
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:38,756
<i>Jam tibi impero</i>

513

00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:45,262

00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:48,265

516
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:51,685
You think it's gonna work?

517
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:55,773
Jesus, Hank, you scared
the shit out of me!

518
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,441
You shouldn't be in here.

519
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,109
You okay, baby?

520
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,261
It's all going to be all right.

521
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:03,480
I just... I need to concentrate.

522
00:32:03,565 --> 00:32:05,899
Just give me 20 minutes, okay?

523
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,485
Whatever it takes.

524
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,429
<i>Absque omni lisione</i>

529
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,706

530
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:05,659
<i>Krek creeteo</i>

00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,430

532
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:22,569
Kyle? Kyle!

533
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,255
Kyle!

534
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:28,876
I know... I know you know
something's wrong.

535
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:30,294
Maybe this is too
hard for anyone

536
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,846
to hear, but...
Kyle, you died.

537
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:34,932
Can-can you
remember that?

538
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:36,633
You know, you were on a bus,

539
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:37,878
and-and there was
an accident.

540
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,604
Sort of.

541
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:41,855
Like, it wasn't your...
it wasn't your fault.

542
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:43,974
Okay, none of it
was your fault.

543
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:45,943
We tried to put you together
the best we could, and-and...

544
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,395
Then we brought you back
from the other side.

545
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:52,432
No! No, stop!
Kyle! No! Kyle!

546
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:53,767
Stop!

547
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:56,036
Look, okay, may...
maybe it would

548
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:59,773
have been better for you
to stay dead. I don't know.

549
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:01,825
But I couldn't forgive
myself if I didn't try.

550
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,627
I forgive you.

551
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:07,748
Even though
you drew me out here.

552
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:10,384
Turn around.

553
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,553
Make a right.

554
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:20,053
<i>Do you really think
that's going to work?</i>

555
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:21,687
I know it will.

556
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:25,842
This stuff is the
shit... literally.

557
00:35:25,962 --> 00:35:28,589
Louisiana swamp is
full of Spanish moss

558
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:30,074
and alligator dung.

559
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,660
Amazing healing properties.

560
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:35,613
Mother Nature has an
answer for everything.

561
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:39,050
Healed me when I
was burned alive.

562
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,502
You are Misty Day.

563
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:43,120
You're the witch
Cordelia was telling us about.

564
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:44,505
Everyone thinks you're dead,

565
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,890
but, of course, you're not.

566
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,009
You have the power
of resurgence.

567
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,728
The power of resurgence.

568
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:53,898
I like the sound of that.

569
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:58,319
We have so much
to teach each other, Zoe.

570
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:01,022
Maybe we do.
I always knew there were others like me,

571
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,640
but I had no idea
how to find you.

572
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:04,325
And then today,

573
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,110
I was meditating in the woods

574
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:08,312
when my heart started racing,

575
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:10,698
and my teeth started vibrating.

576
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:12,951
Something was calling to me.

577
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,703
I had no idea
what it was, but...

578
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:18,256
I knew I had to follow.

579
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:20,658
And it was you, Zoe.

580
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,044
Your magic called me there.

581
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:25,496
And I'm so grateful.

582
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,103
Now I'm not alone.

583
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:49,237
Who sings this?

584
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:51,355
Who sings this?

585
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:54,909
Fleetwood Mac.

586
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:58,629
Stevie Nicks is my hero.

587
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:00,865
<i>That's Stevie Nicks
from American Idol?</i>

588
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,551
It's Stevie Nicks.

589
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,970
"The White Witch."

590
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:09,307
The only witch before you
I've ever known.

591
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:11,476
She's an actual witch?

592
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,429
Listen to the lyrics.

593
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,388
This song was her anthem.

594
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:29,894
Doesn't it just...
penetrate your soul

595
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:31,896
and tell the truth
about everything

596
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:33,915
you ever felt
in your whole life?

597
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:38,169
Yeah. Totally.

598
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:42,740
Um, I really should be going.

599
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,043
Going? What do you mean?

600
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:47,795
My school-- I'm sure
they're wondering where I am.

601
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:52,467
I just have to figure
out where to take him.

602
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:54,469
He can stay here with me.

603
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:56,054
I'll heal him.

604
00:37:57,773 --> 00:38:02,310
And then, when you come back,
he'll be good as new.

605
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:08,449
Hey, you'll come back,
right? Hmm?

606
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:15,289
<i>And clean your
station, baby girl,</i>

607
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:17,441
<i>'cause I am sick and tired
of them old boxes</i>

608
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:19,660
<i>of Popeye's and Coke cans.</i>

609
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:29,887
You ain't never gonna believe
who's back.

610
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:38,846
We got some business
to attend to.

611
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:57,165
They haven't changed the names
of the street signs.

612
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,617
You're lucky you
didn't get run over.

613
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,485
You know, the world
has sped up a bit

614
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:03,004
since you went
down in that hole.

615
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,991
I'd be trampled by
a herd of elephants,

616
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,793
it wouldn't make a
spit of difference.

617
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:11,345
They defaced my home
with a plaque.

618
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,016
"The House of Madame LaLaurie.

619
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,268
An historical site."

620
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,337
My home-- a
museum of horrors.

621
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:23,274
People have always
celebrated the macabre.

622
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,393
You're not remembered fondly,

623
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:29,280
but I guess that beats
not being remembered at all.

624
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,399
I was a woman of my time.

625
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:35,903
Hmm. That is
a crock of shit.

626
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:39,157
You've got a mean streak
wider than your backside,

627
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,025
or a sickness of the mind.

628
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:44,495
Either way, if ten
of the hundreds of things

629
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:46,464
I have read about you are true,

630
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:50,668
then you deserved every minute
down there under all that dirt.

631
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:55,923
They took my babies, you know?

632
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,226
Hung 'em in a straight
line right up there.

633
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,513
My husband, too.

634
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:04,565
Him, I didn't care about.

635
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,350
I'd been planning on
killing him for weeks.

636
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:08,019
Poison in his buckwheat.

637
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,154
Well, you'll forgive me
if I have trouble

638
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,690
feeling sorry for you.
I don't care

639
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:15,159
what kind of a monster
anybody says I am.

640
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:17,912
I loved my girls...
in my own way.

641
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:23,751
Even the ugly one.

642
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:27,455
The moment she came out of
my belly, she was a shame to me.

643
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:30,675
She had the face
of a damn hippo,

644
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:34,178
but I loved her just the same.

645
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:39,800
Hell is real.

646
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:42,937
I've seen it down in that box.

647
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:45,139
Time disappears.

648
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:48,309
The only thing that's left is
what's in your mind's eye.

649
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:52,897
And all mine saw
were the faces of my girls.

650
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:54,932
Forever.

651
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:56,484
Well, maybe it's better.

652
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,486
At least in death,

653
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,038
you can't disappoint
the ones you love.

654
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:06,210
Are you a witch or something?
Why?

655
00:41:06,278 --> 00:41:09,547
Well, I was hoping you were.

656
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:12,466
Then maybe you'd know
how to kill me.

657
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:15,303
Oh, I may kill you yet, but not today.

658
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:16,954
But you run away again,

659
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:20,341
and it's back in the box
for you, understand?

660
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:23,427
Yes, ma'am.

661
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,033
Good. Let's go home.

662
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,053
