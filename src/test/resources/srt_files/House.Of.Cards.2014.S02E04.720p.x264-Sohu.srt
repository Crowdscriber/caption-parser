00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:02,839
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:06,055
It is my great honor to formally
recognize the selection

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,758
of General Alicia Hampton as commander,
United States European Command.

4
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:13,919
The president and I are grateful
for their continued service.

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,589
It was him.
Freshman year.

6
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:19,330
I pressed my hand with
everything I could.

7
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:21,688
I pressed it so hard,
I broke his nose.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,891
That didn't stop him.

9
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,051
Hello?

10
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,451
Any idea who's making the posts?

11
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:30,576
Deep Web forums.
Lone wolf, most likely.

12
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,914
He must have been
working with Zoe.

13
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:33,740
- <i>Speak into the microphone.</i>
- Who are you?

14
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:36,713
- Why did you contact me?
- Because you're desperate.

15
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:38,852
I want you to find him
and put him away.

16
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:41,541
- He hasn't committed a crime.
- But he wants to.

17
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:43,724
And when the House passes
that bill in a few weeks,

18
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:46,219
we will put the government
freeze to rest.

19
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:49,484
You get your win, Curtis.
We just avoid disaster.

20
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:51,747
Maybe the country needs
to see what disaster looks like.

21
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:55,036
You see, I wanted a vice president
who can manage Congress,

22
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:57,664
Whatever faith I have
is quickly evaporating.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,380
Strange not seeing
your name up there.

25
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:17,124
"To improve is to change..."

26
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,724
"To perfect
is to change often."

27
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,486
You know your Churchill.

28
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,003
Inscribed on the
watch you gave me

29
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:23,724
- when I left for Glendon Hill.
- Was it?

30
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:26,204
- Nancy arranges all the gifts.
- She knows you well.

31
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:29,044
- As much as I'm enjoying this little...
- I got you two more votes.

32
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,964
Partridge and Krauss.

33
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,323
Is this Raymond's way
of extending an olive branch?

34
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:38,284
- It's a start.
- Two votes is a twig. It's not a branch.

35
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:42,003
- Which is why I'm here.
- Well, the vote is at 5:00.

36
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:45,364
- We have less than three hours.
- Two hours and 49 minutes.

37
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:48,284
- We have made more happen in less.
- Is that the watch?

38
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:53,325
- No, it's nicer. - So why did Raymond
have a change of heart?

39
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,484
If the government grinds
to a halt, that benefits no one.

40
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:59,324
We want the president focused on China,
not distracted by furloughs and protests.

41
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:02,044
You take direction
from Jacqueline.

42
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,484
She's not gonna
like that very much.

43
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,444
- Bossing you around?
- Having me around.

44
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:08,204
I don't blame her.

45
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,164
Ashleigh will start
the interview with questions

46
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:12,804
about how you and your husband
met, your early marriage.

47
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:15,245
- Fine.
- Then she'll move on to more specific

48
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:20,804
- questions about your recent transition.
- All right.

49
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,404
She's gonna ask about you
having no children.

50
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:25,284
I thought we agreed
to take that off the table.

51
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,484
We did, but they insisted.

52
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,364
Now, I can speak
to Ashleigh directly and...

53
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,284
No, no. It's fine. I've been
asked the question before.

54
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:32,204
- I know how to answer it.
- It'll be quick and painless.

55
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:35,324
I'll confirm that with Ashleigh
when she gets here.

56
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,884
- I like it.
- Maybe something less neutral.

57
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:41,845
I'm sure you'll look good in
whatever you choose. I'll be downstairs.

58
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:48,084
Disori owes you for the
overpass funding you secured.

59
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,884
- Yes, he does.
- I'll call him.

60
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:51,604
- Where's Doug?
- He's doing the rounds.

61
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,003
Making sure our
hard ones stay hard.

62
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:56,644
Birch and Womack are doing the same.
But we're still 15 short.

63
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,884
I've got relationships
with most of these folks.

64
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:02,084
Money's not enough.
I already tried the D-trip route.

65
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:03,884
Retirement age is
the main sticking point?

66
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,405
- Old people vote.
- I'll target the AARP.

67
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,964
- That'll take most of the heat off.
- We're wasting time.

68
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:11,604
- I gotta get to work.
- Take Remy with you.

69
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:12,964
Shouldn't we divide and conquer?

70
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:15,524
It's harder to say no
twice than once.

71
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,684
I'll stay out of your way.

72
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,124
Like you did
on the watershed act?

73
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,564
We're on the same
side of the fence.

74
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,043
You're late to the party.

75
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:22,963
Think of Remy as the guy
who shows up

76
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,485
with a six-pack after
the liquor stores close.

77
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:28,044
- Who's on your plate?
- Donald Blythe.

78
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:30,204
Do you really think that's
the best use of your time?

79
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:32,084
If I can get him
to turn his people.

80
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,844
A lot of eggs
to put in one basket.

81
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,205
We only have one basket.

82
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,804
Jacqueline,
may I use your office,

83
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:41,485
- for old time's sake? - I serve at the
pleasure of the vice president.

84
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,643
Two hours and 17 minutes.

85
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:53,444
Normally all I need to sway
Donald Blythe is patience and time,

86
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,684
neither of which
I have right now.

87
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,605
Tick tock.

88
00:03:58,630 --> 00:05:31,674
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

89
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:37,604
- Donald. Good to see you.
- Mr. Vice President.

90
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,724
Please,
it's always Frank to you.

91
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,804
I came because you asked me,
but don't mistake that for false hope.

92
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,604
If you have other people
to lobby, you should.

93
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,803
- Ten minutes.
- It won't change anything.

94
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,124
Well, at the very least,
enjoy the free coffee.

95
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,204
- I don't drink caffeine.
- Then decaf.

96
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,924
- Still has caffeine.
- Well, enjoy the free oxygen.

97
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,084
It gets stuffy over there
in the Longworth building.

98
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,724
- Coffee for me, and...
- Seltzer water, if you have it.

99
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,605
I'm sure we do.

100
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:08,844
Now, I can understand
if you might hold a grudge.

101
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:11,283
I don't hold grudges, Frank.
I just don't negotiate

102
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,524
with people who are
fundamentally deceptive.

103
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:15,123
I never lied to you, Donald.

104
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,683
You promised to seek my counsel,
which you never once did.

105
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:21,563
We had to move the education bill in
a direction I knew would make you unhappy.

106
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:24,004
- I saw no reason to frustrate...
- You eviscerated the unions.

107
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,764
- You federalized performance standards.
- If we hadn't done that,

108
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,364
the bill would've
been dead in the water.

109
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,684
Now you want to cut
the pathetic level

110
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:31,163
of funding you
did manage to pass.

111
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:34,323
Isn't some funding better
than none?

112
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:37,324
A flatline will send a louder
message than life support.

113
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:42,124
Look, I'm impressed with the
little coalition you've cobbled together,

114
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,884
- but we...
- Not so little. Twenty-eight votes.

115
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:49,644
- And you need them all.
- Well, really only half.

116
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:53,644
- Half of zero is still zero.
- I had to pull every trick in the book

117
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,044
to get entitlement through
the Senate. If it fails in the House,

118
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:58,364
we don't get a round two.
This is a one-time deal.

119
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:01,764
It should never have passed
the Senate to begin with.

120
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:05,604
Can we start over?
May I offer you an apology?

121
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:08,603
Deaf ears, Frank.

122
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:12,764
I withdrew myself from the education
fight and that is my cross to bear.

123
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,443
But I will be damned if I will
make the same mistake twice.

124
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:19,805
This sort of stubbornness
makes you no better than the tea party.

125
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:25,284
- Except for the fact...
- that we happen to be right.

126
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:29,043
Just a few more minutes, Donald.
You haven't even had your seltzer yet.

127
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,844
They have seven other data centers
spread across the Northeast.

128
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,204
- Those aren't good odds.
- Well, if we can access one,

129
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,563
I should be able to talk to the
other seven. They all look like that.

130
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:39,123
- Fort Knox wrapped in a nuclear bunker.
- How do we get in?

131
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,844
Well, we don't. You do.

132
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:45,883
What...? How?
What's my reason?

133
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:49,203
You're writing a story on cyberterrorism.
It's free publicity.

134
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:51,244
- If they're so secure...
- They give tours all the time.

135
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:54,084
- Mostly to prospective clients.
- Then why haven't you done it yourself?

136
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:57,004
Because I run a white hat firm.

137
00:07:57,005 --> 00:08:00,206
And if I were to show up in the tour logs
before a breach, it would raise alarms.

138
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,765
OK. Once I'm in?

139
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,124
These are what
servers look like.

140
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,364
If you can get inside one of
these cages, you will have this.

141
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,844
You slide it into
the server. Voilà.

142
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,244
- It's that simple?
- Yeah. Well, your part, not mine.

143
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,084
- Code's extremely complex.
- How do I do it without them noticing?

144
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:25,445
You get good at anything.
Practice makes perfect.

145
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,965
We've got a problem.

146
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:50,884
Everyone, stop what you're doing, head
into the nearest office and shut the door.

147
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:53,845
You, stay exactly where you are.

148
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,323
Retirement age is a done deal.

149
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,404
I might be able to
redistribute some appropriations...

150
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:08,403
That's not what I'm after. You can't fix
a wrecked car with new hubcaps.

151
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,363
How about a sister bill?
One that focuses entirely on education.

152
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:14,163
My coalition is fighting
for the integrity of the party.

153
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,083
We're not just
focused on education...

154
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,963
I'm sorry, Donald.
Excuse me.

155
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:21,124
Nancy, I said no interrup...

156
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,843
When?

157
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:25,564
But the vote is in
less than an hour. I...

158
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,963
I don't care what protocol... Quarantine.
There's white powder in the mail.

159
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:34,323
- We're locked in?
- Sir! Close the door now!

160
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,564
- Look, I have to...
- Now, sir! Please!

161
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:42,724
- I should call my wife.
- And I should call Claire.

162
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:46,483
- Should I tell Connor?
<i>- No. It's better the press doesn't know.</i>

163
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,883
Field tests should come in before the vote.
Soon as the tally's in,

164
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:51,003
- I'll come home.
<i>- How's it looking?</i>

165
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,284
Shaky. We may lose this one.

166
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,724
That could make
for a tough interview.

167
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,764
<i>Well, I didn't want</i>
<i>to do it in the first place.</i>

168
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,483
Well, we're committed now.

169
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:02,044
<i>I better get</i>
<i>back to the holy crusader.</i>

170
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:04,243
Let me know as soon
as the tests have cleared.

171
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,844
If we're lucky,
it'll be anthrax.

172
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:07,484
I won't live long enough
to see the bill fail.

173
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:10,364
- Don't say that.
<i>- We're gonna be fine.</i>

174
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,644
<i>How many of these quarantines</i>
<i>we been through?</i>

175
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,283
- I've lost count.
- <i> Wish me luck with Donald.</i>

176
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,644
Heels crossed.

177
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:20,004
- It's ripping the caucus apart.
- Of course.

178
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,643
We took a united stand
on our version of the bill.

179
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:26,084
- Some of us have to stay on our feet.
- This is about party unity.

180
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,683
- It's about abandoning our base.
- No. That's what the freeze is.

181
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,484
Our base doesn't benefit
from sword rattling.

182
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:33,403
It gets left
bleeding on the field.

183
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:36,204
My district has the third largest number
of seniors in the country.

184
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,683
If we raise the age
of retirement, the AARP will raise hell.

185
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:42,124
I spoke with the president
of the AARP this morning.

186
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,923
They'll be receiving
a 45 million dollar endowment next week.

187
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:46,843
Voters will still revolt.

188
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:48,844
The midterms are gonna be ugly.

189
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,764
Many, and I can speak
for myself...

190
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:53,924
The choice is between immediate
discontinuation of services

191
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,283
and an age bump
five years from now.

192
00:10:56,284 --> 00:11:00,283
You're comparing theoretical
discomfort to imminent pain.

193
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,803
I just feel like we're losing
touch with our core values.

194
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,083
The education bill
was a good example.

195
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:07,364
We all followed Frank's lead,
hoping it would buy us

196
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:11,005
- traction with the Republicans.
- Would you excuse me? Just one moment.

197
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,043
- Does the press know?
- Not yet.

198
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,884
Can you keep in touch with him?

199
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:22,043
I need to pummel our lunch
guests into submission.

200
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:25,243
You got 'em close,
but relax. Listen more.

201
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:28,643
They want their hands held,
not someone in their face.

202
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,603
I know how to whip votes.

203
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,644
Best caviar in DC,
ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:35,643
- We can't let you pay for that.
- Then don't eat it.

205
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:39,044
But if you do,
I won't tell anyone.

206
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,564
You were saying
about the education bill...

207
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:59,204
No, Marjory, honey. Remember,
we just talked about it.

208
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,604
I was telling you...

209
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,725
Right. Nothing to worry about.

210
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,323
If you have any questions,
ask Molly.

211
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,364
She knows what's going on.

212
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:14,164
I will call as soon
as I know anything.

213
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,844
I love you.

214
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:22,404
How's Marjory?

215
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:31,644
- She's OK.
- Long call.

216
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:36,324
You know, she... gets emotional.

217
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:39,003
Molly took a semester off
to be at home.

218
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,043
I told her she needs
to head back in the spring.

219
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:44,403
I don't want her mother
dragging her down.

220
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:47,844
- Must be hard on you.
- Harder on the girls, I think.

221
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:51,564
- Is she lucid?
- About half the time.

222
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,684
Just enough to be aware
of how quickly she's going.

223
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,725
It's awful.

224
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:07,603
I feel terrible saying it, but part of me
is looking forward to her not being lucid.

225
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,844
At least then she won't
realize what's happening.

226
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:14,563
I should have thought
of this before.

227
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:17,284
Appeal to the heart,
not the brain.

228
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,723
Forgive my ignorance, but...

229
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:24,364
...has there been any
progress with research?

230
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:30,043
Some. Genetic testing,
vascular manipulation. But it's slow.

231
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,964
They won't come up with
anything in time for Marjory.

232
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:36,844
We're focusing on quality of life.
Look, I know you have work to do, so...

233
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:39,044
I'm no longer the whip.
That's Jacqueline's job.

234
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,604
I just agreed to meet with you
because we have a history.

235
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:43,524
She would be tougher
to say no to.

236
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,563
But it still
would've been a "no."

237
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:49,763
- Yes.
- I admire your convictions, Donald.

238
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,643
You're a rare breed nowadays.

239
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:54,163
It didn't sound that way when
you were comparing us to the tea party.

240
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:58,563
I was being unfair. You're not
a reactionary. You're a progressive.

241
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:03,564
- I see where this is going.
- How do you mean?

242
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:08,524
When you've been in the
wasteland as long as I have,
you become immune to flattery.

243
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,603
I know you think I'm
fundamentally deceptive,

244
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:14,203
but I am capable
of a genuine compliment.

245
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:17,363
Then I will take it as one,
but it won't soften my resolve.

246
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:21,244
If it did, you wouldn't deserve
the compliment in the first place.

247
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,724
If you vote no,
I won't hold it against you.

248
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:26,523
We are all in this together
through the midterms.

249
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:32,403
But, if you stick with me,
we can show both the Republicans

250
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,843
and the American people that
we are capable of more than stagnation.

251
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,004
And that's worth something,
even if it hurts.

252
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,365
Who can I count on?

253
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,924
Copy that.

254
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:15,724
The fact that there's still
a door between us, I take as a bad sign.

255
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,043
One tested negative,
one inconclusive, sir.

256
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:20,083
That means we have to take
the samples to the lab.

257
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,802
- So how much longer?
- Another three or four hours.

258
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:26,483
We have an important vote going to the
floor. I have to be talking to my people.

259
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:30,083
The vote is delayed, sir.
We're evacuating this side of the Capitol.

260
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,963
- So no vote?
- Not until we get the all-clear.

261
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,803
- Good things happen to good people.
- Another thing, sir.

262
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:39,763
All cell phone service, WiFi,
land lines, we'll be blocking them,

263
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,843
in case there's
a legitimate security threat.

264
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:45,203
- I need to be able to call my wife!
- I apologize, sir.

265
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:48,243
- We can have someone notify her.
- No, it needs to be me.

266
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,524
She gets very anxious
if she doesn't recognize the voice.

267
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,562
Congressman, I have
strict instructions not...

268
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,284
Figure it out, unless you want me
to get the White House involved.

269
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:58,844
I'll find a way, sir.

270
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:03,484
There are advantages
to being vice president.

271
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:10,323
Ma'am, we'll have to ask you
to remain up here for a little while.

272
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,963
- Is it the quarantine?
- The Capitol is being evacuated.

273
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:17,643
We expect everything to be fine.
It's just standard procedure.

274
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,483
You won't be able to get through.
Communication's being jammed.

275
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:23,483
- You mean I can't even speak to Francis?
- Not until the all-clear.

276
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,043
- How long?
- - Four hours is the estimate right now.

277
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:29,644
- We're supposed to tape in 25 minutes.
- - Nothing we can do.

278
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,484
- You OK?
- Yes.

279
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:36,084
I'll go talk to Emma.

280
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,284
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

281
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:45,603
Em.

282
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,963
- So we might have a problem.
- It's all over the news.

283
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:50,723
- Yeah, it could be a while.
- Can we get audio from the vice president?

284
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:53,363
Communications are being
jammed until the evacuation's over.

285
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:54,803
- Have you spoken to Ashleigh?
- She thinks we should get

286
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,364
a sat truck down here
and wait and go live.

287
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:58,483
I can't guarantee
when that'll be.

288
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,164
The vice president is quarantined
in the Capitol and we have an exclusive.

289
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:03,483
The network will broadcast
whenever the hell we tell them to.

290
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:05,603
<i>They're</i>
<i>holding off until you get here.</i>

291
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,763
You should do the
interview solo.

292
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:10,963
<i>- I'd rather wait.</i>
- Who knows whether we'll win the vote?

293
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,363
If we lose, I don't want my face
on national television.

294
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:16,443
- This could be a silver lining.
- <i> I don't know, Francis.</i>

295
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:19,803
- I'm sure you'll be terrific.
- <i> Let me run it past Connor.</i>

296
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:22,043
OK.
Thank you, we're done.

297
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:26,843
- Sir, we were able to get Mrs. Blythe.
- Donald.

298
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,803
- Marjory?
<i>- Hello?</i>

299
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:31,883
- Yes, it's me, sweetheart.
- <i> It's hard to hear you.</i>

300
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,004
- We're still stuck inside the office.
- <i> What office?</i>

301
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:39,243
At the Capitol. It's going
to be a little while longer.

302
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,603
<i>But why are you there?</i>
<i>It's Sunday.</i>

303
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:44,443
- No, it's Friday, sweetheart.
- <i> Donald?</i>

304
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:47,363
- I'm here.
- <i> Who is this man with me?</i>

305
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:52,283
He's a police officer. They're using
walkie-talkies so we can speak.

306
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:55,283
<i>- Who am I talking to?
- - It's your husband, ma'am.</i>

307
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,283
<i>- I'm not married.</i>
- It's me. It's Donald.

308
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:00,242
<i>Turn it off.</i>
<i>I don't know that man.</i>

309
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:03,724
- Marjory!
- -<i> She went to the other room, sir.</i>

310
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:08,603
OK, thank you.

311
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:11,884
- If you could stay with her, please?
- -<i> Yes, sir.</i>

312
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,484
Drink?

313
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,083
Sure. Why not?

314
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,723
For all we know, it could be
midnight before he's out.

315
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,924
- He still needs to manage the vote.
- - We're fine if it's 2am.

316
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,043
When everyone's asleep.

317
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,003
- People would stay up for this.
- The whole point was primetime.

318
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,684
- Then we do it tomorrow.
- We've already set aside

319
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,162
half a day for this.
The vice president can't

320
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,123
rearrange his schedule
for an interview.

321
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:59,443
- I don't see any other options.
- I spoke to Francis over the radio.

322
00:18:59,444 --> 00:19:03,923
- We think I should do it alone.
- Just you?

323
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:05,963
Mrs. Underwood and Ashleigh,
one-on-one.

324
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:07,364
Maybe we can
broadcast his voice...

325
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,443
Francis doesn't want
the entire interview

326
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,123
to be about the quarantine.

327
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:13,202
Neither do I.
That's just spectacle.

328
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,003
The quarantine is news.
We have an opportunity...

329
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,123
- We're done.
- What?

330
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,163
- Cancel the interview. No reschedule.
- Come on.

331
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:22,324
Please, pack up
everything and leave.

332
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:25,924
OK, let me call Ashleigh.

333
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:33,284
I thought I'd get used to it,
but no. Hurts every time.

334
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:37,764
You spend 30 years with someone and then
they don't have a damn clue who you are.

335
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:43,083
Oh... I really shouldn't.

336
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,003
If we never did anything
we shouldn't do,

337
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:47,564
we'd never feel good
about doing the things we should.

338
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:51,083
- Excellent point.
- If these are our last moments on Earth,

339
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:53,883
I don't know about you,
but I'd rather go out with a buzz on.

340
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:57,284
To Marjory.

341
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:02,364
- You love her dearly.
- More than anything.

342
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:09,042
I can't imagine what I'd do
without Claire, or if she...

343
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,323
...didn't remember who I was.

344
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:14,002
- Hopefully you'll never have to.
- It makes me angry that you do.

345
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,484
- That anybody does. - No sense being
angry over what you can't change.

346
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:22,244
How much funding
does Alzheimer's research get?

347
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:24,803
Just under 500 million.

348
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,723
Well, I'm no expert, but that
sounds inadequate to me.

349
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:31,763
It is. For every $100
we allocate to research,

350
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,683
- we spend nearly $30,000 on care.
- We oughta change that.

351
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:38,323
I tried. My bill didn't even
leave committee.

352
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:41,562
- Who opposed it?
- Howard Webb.

353
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:45,883
- Appropriations.
- He didn't even put it to a vote.

354
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:50,202
- I've never been fond of Howard.
- That makes two of us.

355
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:53,483
- What was his argument?
- He didn't feel he owed me one.

356
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,403
"Fiscally irresponsible,"
is all he said.

357
00:20:56,404 --> 00:21:02,324
Walk me through the
specifics of your bill.

358
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:11,963
- I see what you're doing.
- Doing what?

359
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,162
- You're disgusting, Frank.
- Excuse me.

360
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:16,763
- Using my wife.
- Donald, what are you saying?

361
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:20,242
You think I'll give in on entitlement
if you slap some extra Alzheimer's funding

362
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,443
- on the table?
- I was not suggesting that at all.

363
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:25,603
- Bullshit, Frank.
- You think as little of me as you want,

364
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:27,243
but I do not barter
with people's health.

365
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,682
Then why are you trying to raise
the age of retirement?

366
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:32,402
Medical research we can afford.
Medicare we can't.

367
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:36,123
- There are realities, Donald.
- Don't talk down to me about realities.

368
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:39,003
My wife is dying!
That's a reality!

369
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:42,283
Other people will die, too,
if your package succeeds!

370
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:45,603
That's a reality! Goddamn it,
I wish I wasn't stuck

371
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,802
- in this fucking room with you!
- Donald.

372
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,723
I'm done talking!

373
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:53,243
- One more time.
- I've got it.

374
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,642
I want it to sound more natural.

375
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:58,883
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

376
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:03,483
And we didn't feel that we could both
do that and be the parents we wanted to be.

377
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:06,002
And by making that choice,
it allows more time for us

378
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,563
- to be in the service of others.
- Good, that sounds good.

379
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:10,843
We need you,
Mrs. Underwood.

380
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:19,883
Keep Derek at the Capitol. I want quotes
from evacuees and Homeland Security.

381
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:23,563
And Sarah should be finishing
that history of biohazard scares.

382
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:25,923
I'll be there soon.

383
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:28,723
- I have to go.
- No. We're not done yet.

384
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,243
This is a major story.
I'll come back tomorrow.

385
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:34,002
Come here two days in a row
and this is how patterns emerge.

386
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:37,642
The FBI likes patterns. And we do not
give the FBI what the FBI likes.

387
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:39,523
I can't disappear all
day in the middle of...

388
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:44,323
- I have eight reporters out in the field.
- Stop!

389
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:49,443
- Tell me why I purchased Cashew.
- I don't know.

390
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:52,402
Companionship?

391
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,043
Yes.

392
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:59,002
But more importantly,
a reminder that I am never more

393
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:03,003
than one wrong move away
from life in a cage.

394
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:04,722
You stay.

395
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:06,923
I'm gonna walk you through every
line of code I intend to write,

396
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:09,603
every attempt I make to breach
the wall. If we get caught,

397
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:12,123
you don't get to plead
ignorance. We go down together.

398
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,442
I didn't sign up for Bonnie and Clyde.
You need me for this one thing.

399
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,963
Just like I need you.
But whatever you've done before me...

400
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:24,124
You know where I live,
and you know who I am.

401
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:33,604
Sit down. The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

402
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:41,403
<i>The Capitol is still on lockdown</i>
<i>as hazmat crews continue</i>

403
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:43,043
<i>a thorough sweep</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

404
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,003
<i>Earlier this morning,</i>
<i>a white powder-like</i>

405
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:47,163
<i>- substance was found</i>
<i>in a package...</i>

406
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,963
<i>...mailed to the office of</i>
<i>Majority Whip Jacqueline Sharp.</i>

407
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:53,243
- Are we free to go?
- Almost, sir. Less than an hour.

408
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:56,163
- I've got a message from your wife.
- - What is it?

409
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,563
She's doing the
interview live, right now.

410
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:02,563
<i>...Congressman Donald Blythe and 14 of Ms.
Sharp's staff.</i>

411
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:07,083
<i>Mrs. Underwood, I so appreciate</i>
<i>you taking the time to speak with us today</i>

412
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:10,923
<i>in what I am certain</i>
<i>is a very stressful situation.</i>

413
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:14,523
<i>- Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>
<i>- Have you spoken with your husband today?</i>

414
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:17,602
<i>Yes, I did,</i>
<i>and he's in very good spirits,</i>

415
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,602
<i>and in good hands</i>
<i>with the Secret Service.</i>

416
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,923
<i>Of course, he's very</i>
<i>disappointed he couldn't be here.</i>

417
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:25,003
<i>Well, our thoughts are with him
and everyone else quarantined</i>

418
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:26,763
<i>- at the Capitol today.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

419
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,723
I'd like to begin
with Claire Underwood

420
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:32,803
before you met your husband,
in Texas.

421
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,523
- And I have a couple of pictures.
- Oh, no.

422
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,363
Yes.

423
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:40,562
Oh, my goodness.
That was Red.

424
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:44,722
- An accomplished rider?
- An enthusiast.

425
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:49,202
- This one's from a couple of years later.
- Oh, my goodness.

426
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:51,963
You like those penny loafers?
Those are won...

427
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:56,484
Those are two very different girls.
Which one are you more comfortable being?

428
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:02,563
My family's ranch,
that was home for me.

429
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,243
You didn't like the prep school?

430
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:07,643
No, I think
I preferred the dirt.

431
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:13,803
You grew up in Dallas,
though. Highland Park.

432
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:18,322
Yes. My father, well, he was
a businessman, so we lived in the city.

433
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:22,882
But we're ranchers. I mean,
we go back three generations, our family.

434
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:25,483
Your parents were very wealthy.

435
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:28,323
We were comfortable, yes.

436
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:31,363
They made sure
I wanted for nothing.

437
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,963
It was a very happy childhood.

438
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:38,202
What is your most vivid
memory from that time?

439
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,524
My most vivid memory?
Wow. Um...

440
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:48,043
Probably, when I was
about nine or ten,

441
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:52,562
my father took me to Dealey
Plaza where Kennedy was shot.

442
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:55,683
And he said, "Claire,
a great man died here."

443
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:59,843
And I remember not
fully comprehending

444
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:02,083
the meaning of death yet.

445
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:06,443
And I asked him how he died
and he told me.

446
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:09,964
And I remember feeling so sad,
so angry.

447
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:14,162
It seemed so unfair.

448
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:19,003
I started to cry, and my daddy picked
me up and he wrapped his arms around me

449
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:22,682
and he said,
"Don't be sad, sweetheart.

450
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:27,884
He made the world a better place,
but sometimes that comes at a price."

451
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:32,923
I guess that was
the most vivid memory.

452
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:51,282
- We're only eight votes away.
- I'm sorry, I made up my mind.

453
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:52,923
Me too. I gotta stick
to my guns on this one.

454
00:26:52,924 --> 00:26:55,683
You would rather
let the government shut down...

455
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:58,202
Don't put that on us because
we're on the ass-end of the whip list.

456
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,003
Don't get us wrong.
We have a lot of respect for you, Jackie.

457
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:04,642
You're doing a fine job since Frank's gone.
Different styles, but a fine job.

458
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:07,843
Excuse us just a moment.

459
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:11,642
- They're not taking me seriously.
- Because you're not Frank.

460
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:15,282
- You mean because I'm not a man.
- No, I mean Frank.

461
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:18,563
They're used to being offered something.
Ask them what they want.

462
00:27:18,564 --> 00:27:20,323
Paul needs help with the
waste treatment facility.

463
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:23,483
You're being just
as condescending as they are.

464
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:28,243
Take some good advice when you get it.
I was right earlier, wasn't I?

465
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,762
Paul, Remy tells me you
need a waste treatment plant.

466
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:40,562
We've had some trouble
getting matching federal funds.

467
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:44,402
Ben, you mentioned once
a winery museum in your district.

468
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:46,603
We are making some
great wines in Long Island these days.

469
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:50,123
I've tried some. It tastes like piss
compared to what we have in Napa.

470
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:53,082
The sort of piss that belongs in Paul's
waste treatment plant.

471
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,843
- Jackie...
- We have a possible terror attack,

472
00:27:55,844 --> 00:27:58,083
and you're holding out your
plates for more pork?

473
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,163
You should be ashamed of
yourselves. In my caucus,

474
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:05,163
people are rewarded for good behavior,
not trading their votes for ransom.

475
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,563
When we walk in there,
I expect the both of you

476
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:11,283
to vote yes without
a moment's hesitation.

477
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,764
Thank you for your
change of heart.

478
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:19,883
Six more to go.

479
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:24,402
<i>You left Texas and spent the</i>
<i>last two years of high school</i>

480
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,482
<i>at the prestigious</i>
<i>Phillips Academy.</i>

481
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:30,683
- And then onto Radcliffe.
- Yes.

482
00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:32,922
Where you would meet
the future vice president.

483
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:36,643
Back then,
just a dashing law student.

484
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:39,802
I never dreamed he would become
vice president, of course.

485
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,802
Some people think that your marriage may
be a bit more calculated than you let on.

486
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:47,203
That perhaps he needed
your family's money.

487
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:50,043
- No, that's just not true.
- Your father did contribute an awful lot

488
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:53,643
- to his campaign. - Yes, he did,
because he believed in Francis.

489
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:58,123
Would he have won that campaign had it
not been for your father's contributions?

490
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:59,962
I don't know.
I mean, it certainly helped.

491
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:02,283
But I like to think
that it was Francis's ideas

492
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:05,803
and leadership that convinced
voters, not just TV commercials.

493
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:09,202
- You've been married 27 years.
- That's right.

494
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:12,282
You were just in school.
I mean, you married so young.

495
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:16,282
We did, but when
you've found the one...

496
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:19,042
Well, Francis was the one.

497
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:24,043
- You call him Francis.
- Back home they call him Frank, still.

498
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:26,042
But he likes
that I call him Francis.

499
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:29,682
<i>He said that it makes him</i>
<i>sound more sophisticated.</i>

500
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:35,203
- Is it hard being a politician's wife?
- It's thrilling.

501
00:29:35,204 --> 00:29:39,162
- Not without its challenges.
- Always in the background.

502
00:29:39,163 --> 00:29:42,443
Subsuming your goals
for his goals.

503
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:44,442
Well, I don't see it that way.

504
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:50,802
We're two very independent people
who have chosen to live our lives together.

505
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:52,762
I support him.
He supports me.

506
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:56,843
Which, you know, goes back
to the political partnership.

507
00:29:56,844 --> 00:30:01,442
My husband happens to be a politician.
And I happen to do political work.

508
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:05,683
But our partnership
extends far beyond that.

509
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:11,122
Children.
Was that a sacrifice?

510
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,323
Because you haven't had any.

511
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:16,802
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

512
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:20,082
And we didn't feel that we could both do
that and be the parents we wanted to be.

513
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,803
So we made the choice.

514
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:25,123
- We've heard that answer before.
- Sorry?

515
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:28,643
You have given the exact same
answer in previous interviews.

516
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:30,723
Because it's the truth.

517
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:35,322
Forgive me,
but career and timing,

518
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:38,002
those are often
very convenient answers.

519
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,482
It is true that whatever it takes
for people to get from "maybe" to "yes"

520
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:45,163
- never arrived for me.
- Never felt the pressure?

521
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:47,763
No... maternal instinct?

522
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,683
- No.
- And it was a choice?

523
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,042
It wasn't because
you couldn't have any?

524
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:56,483
Francis and I did
what was right for us.

525
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:59,962
Because it is unusual,
I mean, even now,

526
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:05,283
for politicians at the
executive level not to have children.

527
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:06,962
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

528
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:10,442
<i>In your husband's</i>
<i>second congressional campaign,</i>

529
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:13,362
<i>there was a Republican,</i>
<i>a pro-family candidate,</i>

530
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:17,402
<i>who made some pretty</i>
<i>unsettling accusations.</i>

531
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:21,082
<i>Well, Francis</i>
<i>is a Southern Democrat.</i>

532
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,602
<i>We have thick skins.</i>

533
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:27,962
<i>He suggested, in order to keep your
husband's political career on track...</i>

534
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:31,562
<i>Children are the center</i>
<i>of many people's lives.</i>

535
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:34,722
<i>And I think they just want to make sure
that their representatives will fight</i>

536
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:39,802
<i>for their children's dreams. And Francis
has again and again proven that he will.</i>

537
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:43,362
<i>And he will continue</i>
<i>to do so as vice president.</i>

538
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:45,643
<i>He claimed that...</i>

539
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:48,644
...you may have been pregnant
during the campaign.

540
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:52,963
Was there a pregnancy?

541
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:59,802
Have you ever been pregnant?

542
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,803
- Break. Now.
- That's not gonna happen.

543
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,684
Yes.

544
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:14,444
- During the campaign?
- Before.

545
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,843
- Was it a miscarriage?
- No.

546
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:23,002
Did you...

547
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:25,803
<i>Did you terminate the pregnancy?</i>

548
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:29,041
If I said yes,

549
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:33,722
my husband's political career
would be in jeopardy.

550
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:38,722
My faith would be questioned.
Likely, my life would be threatened.

551
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:43,884
But I won't feel ashamed. Yes, I was
pregnant. And, yes, I had an abortion.

552
00:32:47,204 --> 00:32:51,242
- Can you excuse me for one moment?
- Of course.

553
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:55,483
<i>We'll have more of our live interview
with Claire Underwood in a moment.</i>

554
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,602
That took a lot of guts.

555
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:09,283
Yes, it did.

556
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:12,802
No. It'll look like I am ashamed.
I'm not. And I won't.

557
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:14,482
Nothing you can say
will make this any better.

558
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:16,642
- I'd rather deal with...
- I'm not going to run from this.

559
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:19,002
She's going to ask why
you had the abortion.

560
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:20,683
I haven't had one.
I've had three.

561
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:22,801
Three? No, you need
to stick to one.

562
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:25,802
- OK. Fine.
- Tell me what you'll say.

563
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,882
Well, I can't
use the real reason.

564
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,002
The first two, I was a
teenager and I was reckless.

565
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:32,002
What about the third?

566
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:34,682
Well, the article that
she showed, it's right.

567
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:37,162
I was on the pill, it didn't work.
We talked about having the baby,

568
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:39,482
- and then we decided against it.
- Why?

569
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,322
- Because we were focused on the campaign.
- How many weeks in?

570
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:47,082
- Sixteen.
- You can't say any of this.

571
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,682
Go upstairs.
I'll deal with Ashleigh.

572
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:51,442
If we're going to continue,
we've got about 20 seconds.

573
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,521
- Connor, I...
- Please trust me.

574
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:55,204
You'll be making a big mistake.

575
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:05,682
Are you willing
to discuss the circumstances...

576
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:09,041
I became pregnant
as a result of a sexual assault.

577
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:12,882
- Are you saying that you... you were...
- Raped.

578
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:18,802
<i>You've never spoken publicly</i>
<i>about this before.</i>

579
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,682
<i>No one ever asked.</i>

580
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,682
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

581
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:27,002
<i>It was college.</i>
<i>A classmate.</i>

582
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:29,682
We were dating
and it happened on a...

583
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:33,442
We had a fight,
and he forced himself on me.

584
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:36,562
Did you tell anybody about it,
I mean, did he...?

585
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:38,801
- Was he charged?
- No.

586
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:41,962
Because at the time I felt that I was
somehow at fault. I knew I wasn't.

587
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,762
But I just didn't
want to be stared at.

588
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:48,082
I didn't want to be known
as the girl who got raped.

589
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:52,723
And when I became pregnant,
I wasn't gonna drop out of school.

590
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:57,162
I wasn't going to
let this man ruin my life.

591
00:34:57,163 --> 00:35:00,881
So I made a choice.
I ended it.

592
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,002
But if you never told
anybody about it,

593
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,282
the assailant could
still be out there.

594
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:08,122
Can you tell us
anything about him?

595
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:12,401
I saw him for the first time in
almost 30 years just a few months ago.

596
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,763
<i>Where?</i>

597
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:19,723
<i>At a commissioning</i>
<i>ceremony that Francis and I attended.</i>

598
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:22,482
- Did you speak to him?
- Briefly.

599
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:26,603
- Francis pinned stars on him.
- He was being commissioned?

600
00:35:28,923 --> 00:35:30,963
General Dalton McGinnis.

601
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:36,282
And for the record, Francis
has always known about the assault,

602
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:37,842
he just didn't know the name.

603
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:43,121
And he's been nothing
but supportive all these years.

604
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:47,122
We're gonna have
to reach out to the general...

605
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,043
...for a response
to what you just said.

606
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:53,443
Would you mind
if we took a quick break?

607
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,522
Absolutely.

608
00:35:55,523 --> 00:36:00,123
We'll be right back with
Mrs. Claire Underwood.
Take all the time you need.

609
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:08,042
The lab tests
all came back negative, sir.

610
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:10,282
- What was it?
- Talcum powder laced with flour.

611
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,962
It was pesticide from the wheat
that gave us the false positive.

612
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,762
- So are we free to go?
- Yes, sir.

613
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,962
- Nancy! Tell them I'm on my way down.
- I already did.

614
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,363
- Mind if I use your phone?
- Of course.

615
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:23,883
And Donald, I'm gonna get you that research
funding, no matter how the vote goes.

616
00:36:23,884 --> 00:36:26,122
It's your call, because I'm
still voting against it.

617
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:30,242
- I understand.
- You have a brave wife, Frank.

618
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:31,763
So do you, Donald.

619
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:38,362
- Frank!
- How did you do?

620
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,242
We're down four.
How about Blythe?

621
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,962
- He won't budge.
- What did you offer him?

622
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:43,842
Alzheimer's research.
He was insulted.

623
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:46,082
- The vote's in 45 minutes.
- I need to get to Claire.

624
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,482
- Who should I call from the car?
- We have exhausted our options.

625
00:36:48,483 --> 00:36:50,242
It's Blythe's people
or it won't pass.

626
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:53,002
- They're too loyal to him.
- Hey, go. I'll figure it out.

627
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:56,643
- I can stay if you need me. - No, get to
your wife. I know where to find you.

628
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:01,282
Nancy! I need every
ream of paper you have!

629
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,563
And get me dollies!

630
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,042
Almost done.
Twenty more minutes.

631
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,442
I hate lying.

632
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,082
- Did he do it?
- Yes.

633
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:30,242
- Then don't feel bad.
- What if he denies it?

634
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:33,002
Then we'll cross that bridge.

635
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,042
- Connor?
- Give us one more minute.

636
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:37,162
We have a young woman
on the phone, a private.

637
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:41,201
She says she was also assaulted
by the general. Two years ago.

638
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:43,762
She wants to share her story,
but she won't give her name.

639
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,363
We can't put her on
if she's anonymous.

640
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:51,842
- You want me to convince her?
- She's frightened.

641
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,043
Is she still on the phone?

642
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,962
<i>I've never told anyone.</i>

643
00:37:57,963 --> 00:38:03,322
It took me almost half my life
before I could say anything.

644
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,362
But you can say something now.

645
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:08,282
<i>I don't know.</i>

646
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:11,442
Just think of how many
others there must have been.

647
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:13,202
<i>But you want me to talk.</i>

648
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:16,162
Well, would you have called
if you didn't want to?

649
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:18,641
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>I'd have to use my name.</i>

650
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:22,162
Listen, I understand
you're afraid of the consequence.

651
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:24,642
<i>I'm a private. He's a general.</i>

652
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:27,962
And my husband is the vice
president of the United States.

653
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:32,003
We will protect you.
I promise you that.

654
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:36,722
What's your name?

655
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,123
<i>Private Megan Hennessey.</i>

656
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:51,762
- What is this?
- The names of every person in America

657
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,041
who will lose home care
when the freeze sets in.

658
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,002
Who will lose half
their welfare benefits.

659
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,841
Who will go on furlough.

660
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:01,802
Who will lose their student
loans, transportation services,

661
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:04,922
post-combat counseling.
Shall I go on?

662
00:39:04,923 --> 00:39:06,842
This is about the big picture,
Jacqueline.

663
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:10,203
This picture looks
pretty big to me.

664
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:14,963
I can't vote for the package.

665
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:18,842
Then don't.

666
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:20,842
Just get four
of your people to do it.

667
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:24,682
And then, work with me
after we avoid the freeze.

668
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:27,842
I'm not Frank Underwood.

669
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:32,922
<i>At least two</i>
<i>other girls that same year.</i>

670
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:36,522
<i>If that was true for all</i>
<i>the years he's served...</i>

671
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:40,401
- It's just staggering.
- <i> And I've felt so helpless.</i>

672
00:39:40,402 --> 00:39:45,282
<i>And he keeps rising in the</i>
<i>ranks. The system protects him.</i>

673
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:49,082
Why do you think
no one has ever reported him?

674
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,922
Do you want to join her?

675
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,642
<i>- We know it won't do anything.
</i> - No.

676
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,242
<i>Chain of command.</i>

677
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:56,002
It's inexcusable
that you're willing

678
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:58,321
to put your life on the line
to defend our freedom,

679
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:00,922
and yet you don't feel the
freedom to come forward.

680
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:05,642
<i>I love my country,</i>
<i>and I love serving in the Marines.</i>

681
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:07,642
<i>But not like this.</i>

682
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,161
<i>Private Hennessey,</i>
<i>thank you for your courage</i>

683
00:40:10,162 --> 00:40:12,362
<i>in joining us tonight.</i>

684
00:40:12,363 --> 00:40:15,562
<i>It was Mrs. Underwood</i>
<i>who gave me the courage.</i>

685
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:18,882
<i>Mrs. Underwood,</i>
<i>thank you for your honesty.</i>

686
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,642
Sir, your wife is on the phone.

687
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:23,042
<i>You've given us</i>
<i>a great deal to think about.</i>

688
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:24,721
<i>Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>

689
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,882
And that concludes our live
one-on-one exclusive interview

690
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,602
with Claire Underwood. You can watch
the entire interview on our website.

691
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,921
And as always, we invite you
to give us your thoughts

692
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:36,081
and your comments
on Facebook and on Twitter.

693
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:39,002
But for now, thanks for watching
and good night.

694
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,283
And we're out.

695
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:48,402
This is going to make waves
like you never imagined.

696
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:51,483
Thank you.

697
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:22,841
- Where's Carter?
- You'll be reporting to me now.

698
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:26,762
- And who are you?
- Carter's boss.

699
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:30,122
You're doing good work, Gavin.
But you can't be assaulting the target.

700
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:32,441
That could compromise us.

701
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:34,681
I don't even know why you're
going after this guy. He's small-time.

702
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:37,602
- That's not your concern. - He couldn't
write a line of code to save his life.

703
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:40,281
He intends to commit an act
of cyberterrorism.

704
00:41:40,282 --> 00:41:43,202
Well, that's intention, not capability.
He's not a real threat.

705
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:46,402
Maybe Carter
talked things out with you.

706
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,683
I won't.

707
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:54,882
- How much longer?
- Until what?

708
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:58,442
- Until I can stop.
- You prefer prison?

709
00:41:58,443 --> 00:42:01,962
I've given you eight child
pornographers, three botnet masters.

710
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:03,882
But you still haven't
given us AVunit.

711
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:07,121
I told Carter I don't
know where he is.

712
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:10,722
- Yes, you do.
- I don't. Nobody does.

713
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:13,643
Then what about your
friends in Dec Sec?

714
00:42:18,763 --> 00:42:21,521
I'm not giving you my friends.

715
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,962
Then you can keep doing this.

716
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:26,042
You're a productive asset,
Gavin.

717
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,201
But the moment you stop
being productive,

718
00:42:29,202 --> 00:42:30,962
no lawyer can help you.

719
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:55,602
I wish we had the
real thing right now.

720
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:13,803
- Always prepared.
- Francis.

721
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:29,282
- I've missed this.
- So have I.

722
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:31,521
Shouldn't you be on the phone
getting your accolades?

723
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:34,083
They can wait till tomorrow.

724
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,601
Sing me something.

725
00:43:39,602 --> 00:43:42,322
- What do you want to hear?
- Anything.
