2
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:55,576
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

3
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,120
- Here you are.
Thank you kindly.

4
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,543
Oh, watch it!
Sorry, darling.

5
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,172
- There you are.
- Thank you.

6
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:16,847
Master Stadle.

7
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,379
Mind if I join you?

8
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:50,339
I'll have the same.

9
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:58,681
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

10
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,392
Gandalf the Grey.

11
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,644
I know who you are.

12
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,147
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

13
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:13,028
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

14
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,574
I received word that my father...

15
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:19,368
...had been seen wandering...

16
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,578
...the Wilds near Dunland.

17
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,498
I went looking.

18
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,750
I found no sign of him.

19
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:29,128
Thorin, it's been a long time...

20
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,255
...since anything but rumor was heard...

21
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,381
...of Thrain.

22
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,133
He still lives.

23
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:35,926
I am sure of it.

24
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,307
My father came to see you
before he went missing.

25
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:45,352
What did you say to him?

26
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:49,022
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...

27
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,108
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...

28
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,277
...to destroy the dragon and take back...

29
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,154
...the Lonely Mountain.

30
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,322
And I would say the same to you.

31
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,576
Take back your homeland.

32
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:07,583
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

33
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,751
No.

34
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:12,045
It is not.

35
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:14,006
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

36
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,926
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.

37
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,219
Sooner or later...

38
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,473
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

39
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:25,476
I ran into some unsavory characters...

40
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:28,020
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.

41
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,023
They mistook me for a vagabond.

42
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,483
I imagine they regretted that.

43
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,152
One of them was carrying a message.

44
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:38,947
It is Black Speech.

45
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:43,869
A promise of payment.

46
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:45,329
For what?

47
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,207
Your head.

48
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,377
Someone wants you dead.

49
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,840
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

50
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,759
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.

51
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,428
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

52
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,805
Together, you have the might and power...

53
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,974
...to retake Erebor.

54
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,477
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.

55
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,437
Demand they stand by their oath.

56
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,608
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

57
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:15,901
The Arkenstone.

58
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,736
It is the only thing that will...

59
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,530
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...

60
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,032
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

61
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:28,956
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

62
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:31,750
How?

63
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,045
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...

64
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,798
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.

65
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,216
Yes, it does.

66
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:43,136
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

67
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,032
How close is the pack?

68
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,827
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

69
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:51,580
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
Not yet. But they will do.

70
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,166
- We have another problem.
Did they see you?

71
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,000
They saw you.

72
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,918
No, that's not it.

73
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,252
What did I tell you?

74
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:58,795
Quiet as a mouse.

75
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,089
Excellent burglar material.

76
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,549
Will you listen? Will you just...

77
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,967
...listen?

78
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,261
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

79
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,891
What form did it take'?

80
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:12,601
Like a bear?

81
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,520
Ye- Yes, but bigger.

82
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,855
Much bigger.

83
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:18,941
You knew about this beast?

84
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:21,985
I say we double back.

85
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:24,321
And be run down by a pack of Ores?

86
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,281
There is a house...

87
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:31,995
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

88
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,497
Whose house?

89
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:34,957
Are they friend or foe?

90
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,501
Neither.

91
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:40,462
He will help us or...

92
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,589
...he Will kill us.

93
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,092
What choice do we have?

94
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,804
None.

95
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,562
Come on!

96
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,658
This way! Quickly!

97
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:10,534
Run!

98
00:08:12,953 --> 00:08:14,496
Bombur, come on!

99
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,752
To the house!

100
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,380
Run!

101
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,223
Come on, get inside.

102
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:47,946
Open the door!

103
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,322
Quickly!

104
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,375
Push!
Push!

105
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:04,880
Dwalin!

106
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,714
Come on, lads!

107
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:11,595
What is...

108
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:12,596
...that?

109
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,182
That is our host.

110
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,938
His name is Beorn.

111
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:26,318
And he's a skin-changer.

112
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,946
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

113
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:32,741
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

114
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:35,077
The bear is unpredictable...

115
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,537
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

116
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:40,999
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.

117
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,170
He's leaving.

118
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,380
Come away from there.

119
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:50,092
It's not natural. None of it.

120
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,302
It's obvious. He's under some...

121
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,470
...dark spell.

122
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,721
Don't be a fool.

123
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,349
He's under no enchantment but his own.

124
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,811
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

125
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,396
You'll be safe here tonight.

126
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:09,236
I hope.

127
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:54,479
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

128
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,481
Tell me...

129
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:58,066
...why is Azog...

130
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,276
...the Defiler hunting you?

131
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,320
You know of Azog?

132
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,114
How?

133
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:07,367
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...

134
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,329
...before the Ores came down
from the North.

135
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,666
The Defiler killed most of my family.

136
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,167
But some he...

137
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,502
...enslaved.

138
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,672
Not for work, you understand...

139
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,340
...but for sport.

140
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:24,759
Caging skin-changers...

141
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,805
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

142
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,850
There are others like you?

143
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:34,936
Once there were many.

144
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:36,729
And now'?

145
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,233
Now there is only one.

146
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,987
You need to reach...

147
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:47,907
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

148
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,284
Before Durin's Day falls.

149
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,493
Yes.

150
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,579
You are running out of time.

151
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,039
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

152
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,084
A darkness lies upon that forest.

153
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:01,337
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

154
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:05,175
There is an alliance
between the Ores of Moria...

155
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:08,303
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

156
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,471
I would not venture there...

157
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,765
...except in great need.

158
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:14,684
We will take the Elven Road.

159
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,019
That path is still safe.

160
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,228
"Safe"?

161
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,022
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

162
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,231
...are not like their kin.

163
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,317
They're less wise...

164
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,444
...and more dangerous.

165
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,489
But it matters not.

166
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:30,492
What do you mean?

167
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,494
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

168
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,956
Their numbers are growing.

169
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:38,666
And you are on foot.

170
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:40,543
You will never reach...

171
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,837
...the forest alive.

172
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,636
I don't like Dwarves.

173
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:52,305
They're greedy-

174
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,015
...and blind.

175
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,393
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

176
00:16:57,644 --> 00:17:00,104
...lesser than their own.

177
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:08,988
But Ores I hate more.

178
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,492
What do you need?

179
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:20,583
<i>BEORN".
Go now. While you have the light.</i>

180
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,419
<i>Your hunters are not far behind.</i>

181
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,779
The Elven Gate.

182
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,282
Here lies our path...

183
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:54,033
...through Mirkwood.

184
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,412
No sign of the Ores.
We have luck on our side.

185
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,796
Set the ponies loose.

186
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,882
Let them return to their master.

187
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:12,719
This forest...

188
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,387
...feels...

189
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,097
...sick.

190
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,766
As if a disease lies upon it.

191
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,895
Is there no way around?

192
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:25,607
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

193
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,942
Or twice that distance...

194
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,194
...south.

195
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:59,474
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

196
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:03,311
<i>...hidden from our sight.</i>

197
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:07,357
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

198
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,943
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

199
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,571
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

200
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:21,579
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

201
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:25,708
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

202
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:28,628
The High Fells.

203
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,050
So be it.

204
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:38,971
Not my horse!

205
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:39,806
Ineedi?

206
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:43,434
You're not leaving us?

207
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,436
I would not do this unless I had to.

208
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,361
You've changed...

209
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,363
...Bilbo Baggins.

210
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,784
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

211
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,247
I was going to tell you.

212
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,001
I...

213
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,965
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

214
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,550
Found what?

215
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,140
What did you find?

216
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:26,853
My courage.

217
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,691
Good. Well, that's good.

218
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,362
You'll need it.

219
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:39,240
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

220
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,616
...the slopes of Erebor.

221
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,244
Keep the map and key safe.

222
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:46,456
Do not enter that mountain without me.

223
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:55,631
This is not the Greenwood of old.

224
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:59,177
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

225
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:02,138
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

226
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,307
"Lead us astray"?

227
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,100
What does that mean?

228
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:09,604
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

229
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,064
If you do, you'll never...

230
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:13,608
...find it again.

231
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:16,819
No matter what may come, stay on...

232
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:17,737
...the path!

233
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:21,157
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

234
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:22,408
Durin's Day?
Let's go.

235
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:25,161
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

236
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,548
The path turns this way.

237
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:04,784
This way.

238
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:16,546
Air. I need air.

239
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,839
My head, it's swimming!

240
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,174
What's happening?

241
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,842
Keep moving.

242
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,302
Nori...

243
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,680
...why have we stopped?

244
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,848
The path...

245
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,766
...it's disappeared.

246
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,059
What's going on?

247
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,853
We've lost the path!

248
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,188
Find it.

249
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,483
All of you, look. Look for the path!

250
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,911
I don't remember this bit.

251
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,788
None of it's familiar.

252
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,790
It's got to be here.

253
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,917
What hour is it?

254
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,671
I do not know. I do not even know
what day it is.

255
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,841
Is there no end to this accursed forest?!

256
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:17,648
Attercop.

257
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:46,510
Look.

258
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,387
A tobacco pouch.

259
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:51,057
There's Dwarves in these woods.

260
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:53,934
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.

261
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,853
This is exactly the same as mine.

262
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,773
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

263
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:00,816
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

264
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:03,110
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

265
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,988
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

266
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,615
I thought you were the expert.

267
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:09,742
The sun.

268
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,244
We have to find...

269
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:13,746
...the sun.

270
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,749
Up there.

271
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:17,833
We need to...

272
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:19,585
...get above the canopy.

273
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,508
What was that?

274
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,595
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

275
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,307
We're being watched.

276
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:23,482
I can see a lake!

277
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,485
And a river.

278
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,822
And the Lonely Mountain.

279
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:32,074
We're almost there!

280
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:35,327
Can you hear me?

281
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:38,748
I know which way to go!

282
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,210
Hello?

283
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,763
Hello.

284
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:06,776
Oh, no.

285
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:07,860
Oh, come on.

286
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,712
Kill them! Kill them.

287
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,006
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

288
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,759
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

289
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,635
Stick it again.

290
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,929
Stick it again. Finish it off.

291
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,807
The meat's alive and kicking!

292
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:02,641
Kill him.

293
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:03,642
Kill him now.

294
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,477
Let us feast.

295
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:06,937
Feast! Feast!

296
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,273
Feast! Feast!

297
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,067
Eat them alive!

298
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,361
Feast!

299
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:22,578
What is it?
What is it?

300
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,665
Eat them alive!

301
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,046
Fat and juicy.

302
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,508
Just a...

303
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,843
...little taste.

304
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,856
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

305
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:53,359
Here.

306
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,236
Ah! It stings!

307
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:57,363
It stings!

308
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:04,620
Sting.

309
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,872
That's a good name.

310
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:09,792
Sting.

311
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,895
You all right there, Bofur?

312
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,480
I'm all right!
Get it off me!

313
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,815
Where's Bilbo?

314
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,024
I'm up here!

315
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,016
Grab the legs!

316
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,184
Pull!

317
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,187
Pull!

318
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,568
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

319
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:19,445
Where is it?

320
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:42,342
No!

321
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,261
No! No!

322
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,472
Thorin! Get them!

323
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,639
Come on!

324
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,895
Look out, brother!

325
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,315
Fili!

326
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,423
Mine.

327
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:57,418
Come on...

328
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:58,836
...keep up!

329
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,712
We're clear!

330
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,027
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

331
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:25,946
It would be my pleasure.

332
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,244
Help!
- Kili!

333
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,430
Throw me a dagger!

334
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,348
Quick!

335
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:54,683
If you think I'm giving you...

336
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:55,976
...a weapon, Dwarf...

337
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,311
...you're mistaken!

338
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:04,818
Search them.

339
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,451
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

340
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:13,869
Who is this?

341
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,621
- Your brother?
That is...

342
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,164
mm)' Wife!

343
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,500
And what is this horrid creature?

344
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:20,918
A Goblin-mutant?

345
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,086
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

346
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,328
Where did you get this?

347
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:57,955
It was given to me.

348
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,795
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

349
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,093
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

350
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,024
LEGOLAS

351
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,783
Unh! This is not the end of it!

352
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:20,329
- Do you hear me?!
Hey, let us out of here!

353
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,122
Get off me!

354
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,505
Aren't you going to search me?

355
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:34,343
I could have anything down my trousers.

356
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,762
Or nothing.

357
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,063
LEGOLAS:

358
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,574
LEGOLAS:

359
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,006
Again!
Leave it!

360
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,592
There's no way out!

361
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,844
This is no Orc dungeon.

362
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,597
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

363
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:24,685
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

364
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:32,901
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

365
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,405
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

366
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,407
...and slay a dragon.

367
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:43,787
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

368
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,331
Attempted burglary.

369
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,334
Or something of that ilk.

370
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:53,255
You have found...

371
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,506
...a way in.

372
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:55,715
You seek that which would...

373
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,969
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

374
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,513
The King's Jewel.

375
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,932
The Arkenstone.

376
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:09,521
It is precious to you beyond measure.

377
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,232
I understand that.

378
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:16,820
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

379
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:19,156
White gems...

380
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,450
...of pure starlight.

381
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,744
I offer you my help.

382
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,332
I am listening.

383
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,209
I will let you go...

384
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,880
...if you but return what is mine.

385
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,384
A favor for a favor.

386
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:40,594
You have my word.

387
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,514
One king to another.

388
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:51,897
I would not trust Thranduil...

389
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:53,899
...the great king...

390
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:55,317
...to honor his word...

391
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,069
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

392
00:37:58,695 --> 00:37:59,279
You...

393
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,739
...who lack all...

394
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:01,990
."hono?

395
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,118
I have seen how you treat your friends.

396
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:09,414
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

397
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,124
...seeking your help.

398
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,044
But you turned your back!

399
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:17,964
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

400
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,175
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

401
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,888
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

402
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:25,931
I know...

403
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,433
...its wrath and ruin.

404
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:33,813
I have faced...

405
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,817
...the great serpents of the North.

406
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:39,653
I warned your...

407
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,198
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

408
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,660
But he would not listen.

409
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,291
You are just like him.

410
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,504
Stay here if you will...

411
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,297
...and rot.

412
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,466
A hundred years is a mere blink...

413
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:03,718
...in the life of an Elf.

414
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,637
I'm patient.

415
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,682
I can wait.

416
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:17,232
Did he offer you a deal?

417
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,650
He did.

418
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,696
<i>I told him he could go
ish kakhfe ai-'d dEIr-rugnu!</i>

419
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:25,282
Him and all his kin!

420
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:29,077
Well, that's that, then.

421
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,290
A deal was our only hope.

422
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,461
Not our only hope.

423
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,761
I know you're there.

424
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,558
Why do you linger in the shadows?

425
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,936
I was coming to report to you.

426
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:59,482
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

427
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:00,400
We cleared...

428
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,111
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

429
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,446
...coming up from the South.

430
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:05,322
They are spawning in...

431
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,824
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

432
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:10,285
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

433
00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:13,330
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

434
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,207
And when we drive them off, what then?

435
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,043
Will they not spread to other lands?

436
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,170
Other lands are not my concern.

437
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,214
The fortunes of the world...

438
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,549
...will rise and fall.

439
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,717
But here in this...

440
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,010
...kingdom, we will endure.

441
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,934
Legolas said you fought well today.

442
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:41,024
He has grown very fond of you.

443
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,695
I assure you, my lord...

444
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,907
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

445
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,992
Perhaps he did once.

446
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,537
Now I am not so sure.

447
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,418
I do not think you would allow your son...

448
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:03,129
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

449
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,966
No, you are right. I would not.

450
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,010
Still, he cares about you.

451
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,347
Do not give him hope where there is none.

452
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,690
FIMBUL

453
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,483
BOLG

454
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,805
The stone in your hand, what is it?

455
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,767
It is a talisman.

456
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:02,605
A powerful spell lies upon it.

457
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,567
If any but a Dwarf
reads the runes on this stone...

458
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,652
...they will be forever cursed.

459
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:14,659
Or not.

460
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:19,539
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

461
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,793
A rune stone.

462
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:26,546
My mother...

463
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,715
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.

464
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,843
What promise?

465
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:33,720
That I would come back to her.

466
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,891
She worries.

467
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,894
She thinks I'm reckless.

468
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,729
Are you?

469
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:45,398
Nah.

470
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:58,244
Sounds like quite a party...

471
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,871
...you're having up there.

472
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,540
<i>It is Mereth e-nGilith...</i>

473
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,001
...the Feast of Starlight.

474
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:08,630
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

475
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:12,675
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

476
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,844
I always thought it is a cold light.

477
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:19,224
Remote and far away.

478
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,310
It is memory...

479
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:25,230
...precious and pure.

480
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,236
Like your promise.

481
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,539
I have walked there sometimes.

482
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:44,457
Beyond the forest...

483
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:46,251
...and up into the night.

484
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,839
I have seen the world fall away...

485
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,884
...and the white light of forever fill the air.

486
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,139
I saw a fire moon once.

487
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:04,727
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

488
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,564
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

489
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:12,360
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

490
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,738
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

491
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:18,283
...keeping the mountain to our left.

492
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:20,243
And then it appeared.

493
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,495
This huge fire moon...

494
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:24,581
...lighting our path.

495
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,125
I wish I could show you the caverns.

496
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:31,045
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

497
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:34,674
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

498
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,968
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

499
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,303
Say what you like about our...

500
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,890
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

501
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:44,392
Come, Elros, try it.

502
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:45,935
I have the Dwarves...

503
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,187
...in my charge.

504
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:50,523
They're locked up. Where can they go? Ha, ha.

505
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,154
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

506
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:58,114
Must be nearly dawn.

507
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:00,658
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

508
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,705
Not stuck in here, you're not.

509
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:12,295
Bilbo!

510
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:13,421
What?

511
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,926
Shh! There are guards nearby!

512
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:24,599
- Ha, ha, ha.
Close the doors.

513
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:27,018
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

514
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,322
Up the stairs.
You first.

515
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:40,156
Ori.

516
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:41,824
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

517
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:44,077
Go.

518
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:45,828
Easy, now.

519
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,011
This way.

520
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:05,890
Come on.

521
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,725
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

522
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:09,727
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

523
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:10,687
I know what I'm doing!

524
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:11,771
Shh!

525
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:13,898
This way! This way!

526
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:19,529
Everyone...

527
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:22,031
...climb into the barrels quickly.
Are you mad?

528
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:23,908
- They'll find us.
No, no.

529
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:25,201
They won't, I promise you.

530
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:28,955
Please, please. You must trust me.

531
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:33,918
Do as he says.

532
00:46:35,044 --> 00:46:36,129
Move your big ginger head.

533
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,048
Bifur, get in...

534
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,217
...the barrel! Move!

535
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,600
Everyone's in.

536
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,647
What do we do now?

537
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:56,399
Hold your breath.

538
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:57,525
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

539
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:25,845
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

540
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:54,207
Well done, Master Baggins.

541
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,918
Go! Come on, let's go!

542
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:08,554
Hold on!

543
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:23,111
Bilbo!

544
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:28,950
Hang on!

545
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,870
Help!
Ori!

546
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:58,187
No!

547
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:13,703
Watch out! There's Ores!

548
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:34,182
Get under the bridge!

549
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:47,945
Kili!

550
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:13,930
Kili!

551
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,604
Kili.

552
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,367
Kili!

553
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:41,744
<i>Nori!</i>

554
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:55,633
Cut the log!

555
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:04,600
Bombu r!

556
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,030
Tauriel.

557
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:50,790
BOLG:

558
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,065
Oh, it's you!

559
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:41,900
Why am I here, Gandalf?

560
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:43,360
Trust me, Radagast.

561
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:46,572
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

562
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:53,662
This is not a nice place to meet.

563
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:55,039
No.

564
00:56:55,998 --> 00:56:57,458
It is not.

565
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:01,086
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

566
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:04,048
Old and full of hate.

567
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:05,633
Who's buried here?

568
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:09,345
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

569
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:11,680
He would have been known only...

570
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:14,224
...as a servant of evil.

571
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:18,771
One of a number.

572
00:57:22,983 --> 00:57:24,818
One of nine.

573
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:29,990
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

574
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,824
The Ringwraiths...

575
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:32,868
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

576
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:35,079
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

577
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:38,832
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.

578
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,043
Who said it was human?

579
00:57:42,795 --> 00:57:46,340
The Nine only answer to one master.

580
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,176
We've been blind, Radagast.

581
00:57:49,426 --> 00:57:51,512
And in our blindness...

582
00:57:51,762 --> 00:57:53,889
...the Enemy has returned.

583
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,519
He is summoning his servants.

584
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:00,896
Azog the Defiler...

585
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:03,148
...is no ordinary hunter.

586
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,733
He is a commander.

587
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:07,528
A commander of legions.

588
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:11,949
The Enemy is preparing for war.

589
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:14,326
It will begin in the East.

590
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:17,371
His mind is set upon that mountain.

591
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:19,456
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

592
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:20,666
Gandalf.

593
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:24,586
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

594
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:26,755
They are in grave danger.

595
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:28,257
If what you say is true...

596
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:31,218
...the world is in grave danger.

597
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:35,931
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

598
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:40,352
You want me to cast my friends aside?

599
00:58:43,355 --> 00:58:45,691
Anything behind us?
Not that I can see.

600
00:58:50,863 --> 00:58:53,699
I think we've outrun the Ores.
Not for long. We've lost the current.

601
00:58:54,324 --> 00:58:56,118
Bombur's half drowned.

602
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:58,454
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

603
00:58:58,704 --> 00:58:59,621
Come on, let's go!

604
00:58:59,872 --> 00:59:01,665
Gloin, help me, my brother.

605
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:05,878
Come on, lift yourself.

606
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:07,463
Come on!

607
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:10,174
Come on, you big lump, you!

608
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:21,977
I'm fine. It's nothing.

609
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:23,145
On your feet.

610
00:59:23,395 --> 00:59:25,439
Kilt's wounded. His leg needs binding.

611
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:28,067
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

612
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:29,234
To where?

613
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:31,403
To the mountain. We're so close.

614
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:34,865
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

615
00:59:35,115 --> 00:59:37,409
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

616
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:40,621
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

617
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,956
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

618
00:59:43,207 --> 00:59:44,875
Bind his leg, quickly.

619
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:46,960
You have two minutes.

620
01:00:07,272 --> 01:00:08,190
Do it again...

621
01:00:08,982 --> 01:00:10,067
...and you're dead.

622
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:13,987
Excuse me...

623
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:17,366
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

624
01:00:18,325 --> 01:00:20,828
That barge over there...

625
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:24,373
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

626
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,126
What makes you think I would help you?

627
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:30,212
Those boots have seen better days.

628
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:32,339
As has that coat.

629
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:35,384
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

630
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,928
How many bairns?

631
01:00:38,846 --> 01:00:40,472
A boy and two girls.

632
01:00:41,473 --> 01:00:44,017
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

633
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,395
Aye.

634
01:00:46,854 --> 01:00:47,896
She was.

635
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:52,651
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-

636
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:54,736
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

637
01:00:56,446 --> 01:00:57,573
What's your hurry?

638
01:00:57,823 --> 01:00:59,032
What's it to you?

639
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:00,951
I would like to know who you are...

640
01:01:02,202 --> 01:01:03,287
...and what you are doing in these lands.

641
01:01:03,954 --> 01:01:06,456
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

642
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:08,292
...journeying to see our kin...

643
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:10,127
...in the Iron Hills.

644
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:13,463
Simple merchants, you say?

645
01:01:13,714 --> 01:01:15,048
We need food...

646
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:17,259
...supplies, weapons.

647
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:18,677
Can you help us?

648
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:23,849
I know where these...

649
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:25,475
...barrels came from.

650
01:01:26,226 --> 01:01:27,477
What of it'?

651
01:01:27,728 --> 01:01:30,147
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

652
01:01:30,689 --> 01:01:32,399
...but I don't think it ended well.

653
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:34,735
No one enters Lake-town...

654
01:01:34,985 --> 01:01:36,945
...but by leave of the Master.

655
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:40,365
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

656
01:01:40,616 --> 01:01:43,410
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

657
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:46,288
Offer him more.

658
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:49,875
I'll wager there are...

659
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:52,044
...ways to enter that town unseen.

660
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,004
Aye.

661
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:56,590
But for that...

662
01:01:57,799 --> 01:01:59,176
...you would need a smuggler.

663
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:01,345
For which we would pay double.

664
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:13,523
<i>Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...</i>

665
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:15,359
...the vast ignorance of the world...

666
01:02:15,609 --> 01:02:17,903
...it festers and spreads.

667
01:02:18,153 --> 01:02:20,864
A shadow that grows in the dark.

668
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,200
A sleepless malice as black...

669
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:26,370
...as the oncoming wall of night.

670
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:29,247
So it ever was.

671
01:02:29,998 --> 01:02:32,042
So will it always be.

672
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:37,005
In time, all foul things come forth.

673
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:40,175
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

674
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:41,385
Why?

675
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:42,970
Not 13.

676
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:44,763
Not anymore.

677
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:46,390
The young one...

678
01:02:47,057 --> 01:02:48,976
...the black-haired archer...

679
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:51,436
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

680
01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:56,233
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

681
01:02:56,483 --> 01:02:57,526
...choking on it soon.

682
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:00,112
Answer the question, filth.

683
01:03:05,534 --> 01:03:07,244
I would not antagonize her.

684
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:09,621
You like killing things, Orc?

685
01:03:10,956 --> 01:03:12,332
You like death?

686
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:14,376
Then let me give it to you.

687
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:16,253
THRANDUIL

688
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:32,185
I do not care about one...

689
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:35,105
...dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

690
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:38,692
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...

691
01:03:38,942 --> 01:03:41,445
...what you know
and I will set you free.

692
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:44,406
You had orders to kill them. Why?

693
01:03:44,656 --> 01:03:46,825
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

694
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:49,953
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

695
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:51,121
King?

696
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:54,416
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

697
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:56,960
None would dare enter Erebor...

698
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,211
...whilst the dragon lives.

699
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:00,130
You know nothing.

700
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,008
Your world will burn.

701
01:04:03,258 --> 01:04:04,885
What are you talking about?

702
01:04:05,385 --> 01:04:06,595
Speak!

703
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:09,848
Our time has come again.

704
01:04:10,474 --> 01:04:13,769
My master serves the One.

705
01:04:15,228 --> 01:04:17,689
Do you understand now, Elf ling?

706
01:04:17,939 --> 01:04:19,775
Death is upon you.

707
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:22,235
The flames of war...

708
01:04:22,486 --> 01:04:24,112
...are upon you.

709
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:28,241
Why did you do that?

710
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:30,577
You promised to set him free.

711
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:31,953
And I did.

712
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:36,249
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

713
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:38,418
There was more...

714
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:40,420
...the Orc could tell us.

715
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:43,131
There was nothing more he could tell me.

716
01:04:44,091 --> 01:04:46,551
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

717
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:49,513
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

718
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:51,932
...it will destroy all before it.

719
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:55,977
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

720
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:57,979
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

721
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,773
No one enters this kingdom.

722
01:05:00,899 --> 01:05:02,442
And no one leaves it.

723
01:05:05,862 --> 01:05:07,364
LEGOLAS

724
01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:12,744
ELROS

725
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:18,333
ELROS:

726
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:28,486
Watch out!

727
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:38,288
What are you trying...

728
01:06:38,538 --> 01:06:40,207
...to do, drown us?

729
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:43,043
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.

730
01:06:43,293 --> 01:06:44,669
If I wanted to drown you...

731
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,505
...I would not do it here.

732
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:51,009
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

733
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:54,012
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

734
01:06:54,262 --> 01:06:56,723
- Bard, his name's Bard.
How do you know?

735
01:06:57,307 --> 01:06:58,725
Uh, I asked him.

736
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:01,561
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

737
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:03,355
We do not have to like him.

738
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:05,232
We simply have to pay him.

739
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:07,275
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

740
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:08,485
...your pockets.

741
01:07:09,736 --> 01:07:11,321
How do we know he won't betray us?

742
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:12,781
We don't.

743
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,324
There's...

744
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:15,825
...just a wee problem.

745
01:07:17,077 --> 01:07:18,495
We're 10 coins short.

746
01:07:20,664 --> 01:07:21,331
Gloin.

747
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:23,542
Come on.

748
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,919
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

749
01:07:27,003 --> 01:07:29,339
I have been bled dry...

750
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:30,674
...by this venture.

751
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:31,967
What have I seen...

752
01:07:32,217 --> 01:07:33,510
...for my investment?

753
01:07:34,344 --> 01:07:36,096
Naught but misery and...

754
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:37,222
...grief and-

755
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:47,565
Bless my beard.

756
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,568
Take it.

757
01:07:50,694 --> 01:07:52,070
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

758
01:07:55,907 --> 01:07:57,033
The money, quick. Give it to me.

759
01:07:57,284 --> 01:07:57,993
We will pay you when we...

760
01:07:58,243 --> 01:07:59,953
...get our provisions but not before.

761
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:02,664
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

762
01:08:03,123 --> 01:08:04,374
There are guards ahead.

763
01:08:22,934 --> 01:08:24,311
What's he doing?

764
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:25,854
He's talking to someone.

765
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:29,608
He's pointing right at us.

766
01:08:32,986 --> 01:08:33,570
Now they're...

767
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:34,404
...shaking hands.

768
01:08:34,654 --> 01:08:36,114
- What?
The villain.

769
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:37,657
He's selling us out.

770
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,598
Quiet.

771
01:09:04,392 --> 01:09:06,102
We're approaching the tollgate.

772
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:18,323
Halt!

773
01:09:18,615 --> 01:09:19,949
Goods inspection!

774
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,535
Papers, please!

775
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:24,537
Oh, it's you, Bard.

776
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:25,830
Morning, Percy.

777
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:27,290
Anything to declare?

778
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,293
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

779
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:31,586
...and ready for home.

780
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:33,088
You and me both.

781
01:09:37,175 --> 01:09:38,593
There we are.

782
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:39,678
All in order.

783
01:09:39,928 --> 01:09:42,764
Not so fast.

784
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:47,227
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm. "

785
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:49,437
Only...

786
01:09:51,606 --> 01:09:53,233
...they're not empty...

787
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:55,276
...are they, Bard?

788
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:56,486
If I recall correctly...

789
01:09:56,736 --> 01:09:59,030
...you're licensed as a bargeman.

790
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:00,907
Not...

791
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,660
...a fisherman.

792
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:05,412
That's none of your business.

793
01:10:06,121 --> 01:10:07,080
Wrong.

794
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:10,750
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

795
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,545
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

796
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:16,047
These fish are illegal.

797
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:17,424
Empty the barrels...

798
01:10:17,674 --> 01:10:19,884
- ... over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

799
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,930
Come on. Get a move on.

800
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,974
Folk in this town are struggling.

801
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:27,725
Times are hard.

802
01:10:27,976 --> 01:10:28,935
Food is scarce.

803
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:30,311
That's not my problem.

804
01:10:30,645 --> 01:10:32,605
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...

805
01:10:32,856 --> 01:10:34,441
...back in the lake...

806
01:10:34,983 --> 01:10:36,568
...when the rioting starts...

807
01:10:39,404 --> 01:10:40,738
...will it be your problem then?

808
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:46,828
Stop.

809
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,332
Ever the people's champion...

810
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,668
...eh, Bard? Protector of...

811
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:54,711
...the common folk.

812
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:56,421
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...

813
01:10:56,671 --> 01:10:57,630
...but it won't last.

814
01:11:01,843 --> 01:11:02,969
Raise the gate!

815
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:07,974
The Master has his eye on you.

816
01:11:08,224 --> 01:11:09,726
You'd do well to remember:

817
01:11:09,976 --> 01:11:11,519
We know where you live.

818
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,438
It's a small town, Alfrid.

819
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:16,191
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

820
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:34,667
All this talk of civil unrest.

821
01:11:34,918 --> 01:11:36,586
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

822
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:41,216
Gout playing up, sire?

823
01:11:41,466 --> 01:11:42,425
It's the damp.

824
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:43,635
It's the only possible explanation.

825
01:11:44,511 --> 01:11:45,512
Get me a brandy.

826
01:11:46,387 --> 01:11:49,182
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

827
01:11:49,432 --> 01:11:52,393
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

828
01:11:52,644 --> 01:11:54,187
It's not my fault they live in a place...

829
01:11:54,437 --> 01:11:57,148
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.

830
01:11:57,857 --> 01:12:00,818
Jobs, shelter, food.

831
01:12:01,069 --> 01:12:02,695
It's all they ever bleat about.

832
01:12:02,946 --> 01:12:06,574
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

833
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:09,285
<i>MASTER".
Then we must find these...</i>

834
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:11,454
...troublemakers and arrest them.

835
01:12:11,704 --> 01:12:13,623
My thoughts exactly, sire.

836
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:16,709
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

837
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,254
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...

838
01:12:19,504 --> 01:12:21,172
...and start making noises.
The next thing...

839
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:24,342
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...

840
01:12:24,592 --> 01:12:26,177
...forming committees...

841
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:28,596
...launching inquiries.

842
01:12:28,847 --> 01:12:31,307
Out with the old, in with the new?

843
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:32,976
What?

844
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:35,270
That's what they've been saying, sire.

845
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,479
There is even talk...

846
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:37,939
...of an election.

847
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:39,399
An election? Heh.

848
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:40,942
That's absurd.

849
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:43,194
I won't stand for it. Ha!

850
01:12:43,987 --> 01:12:46,239
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, sire.

851
01:12:48,116 --> 01:12:49,659
Shirkers.

852
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:50,827
Ingrates.

853
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:52,120
Rabble-rousers.

854
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:55,081
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

855
01:12:55,623 --> 01:12:57,000
Who would dare?

856
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,251
Who-?

857
01:13:03,172 --> 01:13:04,507
Bard.

858
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:06,926
You mark my words:

859
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:08,803
<i>That trouble-making bargeman...</i>

860
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:10,805
<i>...is behind all this.</i>

861
01:13:17,937 --> 01:13:19,022
Get your hands off me.

862
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:28,197
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

863
01:13:30,074 --> 01:13:31,659
The fish you can have for nothing.

864
01:13:34,454 --> 01:13:35,788
Follow me.

865
01:13:44,839 --> 01:13:45,923
Da!

866
01:13:46,424 --> 01:13:48,217
Our house, it's being watched.

867
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:25,963
You can tell the Master
I'm done...

868
01:14:26,214 --> 01:14:26,839
...for the day.

869
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:30,677
Da! Where have you been?

870
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:33,888
Father! There you are! I was worried.

871
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:35,640
Here, Sigrid.

872
01:14:36,224 --> 01:14:37,183
<i>Bah, get them'm.</i>

873
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:47,527
If you speak of this to anyone...

874
01:14:47,777 --> 01:14:49,237
...I'll rip your arms off.

875
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:53,574
Get off.

876
01:14:55,034 --> 01:14:56,119
Up there.

877
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:04,669
Da...

878
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:07,171
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

879
01:15:07,422 --> 01:15:08,756
Will they bring us luck?

880
01:15:13,344 --> 01:15:14,178
They may not be the best fit...

881
01:15:14,429 --> 01:15:16,180
...but they'll keep you warm.

882
01:15:16,848 --> 01:15:17,890
Thank you very much.

883
01:15:28,109 --> 01:15:30,194
A Dwarvish windlance.

884
01:15:30,486 --> 01:15:31,070
You look like...

885
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,613
...you've seen a ghost.

886
01:15:33,364 --> 01:15:34,532
He has.

887
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:36,325
The last time we saw...

888
01:15:36,576 --> 01:15:38,244
...such a weapon...

889
01:15:39,287 --> 01:15:40,163
...a city was on fire.

890
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:44,459
It was the day the dragon came.

891
01:15:47,712 --> 01:15:49,172
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

892
01:15:49,422 --> 01:15:50,548
<i>...destroyed Dale.</i>

893
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:55,219
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

894
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:56,220
...rallied his bowmen...

895
01:15:56,471 --> 01:15:57,597
<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

896
01:15:58,723 --> 01:16:00,475
But a dragon's hide is tough.

897
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:03,227
Tougher than the strongest armor.

898
01:16:03,478 --> 01:16:06,647
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

899
01:16:06,898 --> 01:16:08,483
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

900
01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:10,485
<i>And few of those...</i>

901
01:16:10,735 --> 01:16:12,528
<i>...arrows were ever made.</i>

902
01:16:17,867 --> 01:16:18,993
<i>The store was running low...</i>

903
01:16:19,494 --> 01:16:20,078
...when Girion...

904
01:16:20,328 --> 01:16:20,912
<i>...made his last stand.</i>

905
01:16:29,295 --> 01:16:32,715
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

906
01:16:33,299 --> 01:16:35,134
...much would have been different.

907
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:41,182
You speak as if you were there.

908
01:16:42,558 --> 01:16:44,644
All Dwarves know the tale.

909
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:47,188
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

910
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:49,315
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

911
01:16:49,565 --> 01:16:50,817
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

912
01:16:52,777 --> 01:16:54,654
That's a fairy story, lad.

913
01:16:54,904 --> 01:16:56,280
Nothing more.

914
01:16:57,281 --> 01:16:58,658
You took our money.

915
01:16:59,742 --> 01:17:01,035
Where are the weapons?

916
01:17:03,621 --> 01:17:04,831
Wait here.

917
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:20,012
Tomorrow begins...

918
01:17:20,263 --> 01:17:21,264
...the last days of autumn.

919
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:23,766
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.

920
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:25,935
We must reach the mountain before then.

921
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:27,520
And if we do not?

922
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:30,106
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

923
01:17:30,356 --> 01:17:31,649
Then this quest has been for nothing.

924
01:17:44,161 --> 01:17:45,371
What is this?

925
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:47,206
Pike hook.

926
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:48,624
Made from an old harpoon.

927
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:51,377
- And this?
A crowbill, we call it.

928
01:17:51,627 --> 01:17:53,171
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

929
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:54,922
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

930
01:17:55,172 --> 01:17:57,925
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

931
01:17:58,175 --> 01:17:58,926
We paid...

932
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:00,887
...you for weapons.

933
01:18:01,137 --> 01:18:02,680
Iron-forged swords...

934
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:03,931
...and axes!

935
01:18:04,182 --> 01:18:05,141
It's a joke!

936
01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:07,935
You won't find...

937
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:09,812
...better outside the city armory.

938
01:18:10,062 --> 01:18:11,439
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

939
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:12,899
...under lock and key.

940
01:18:13,149 --> 01:18:14,191
Thorin...

941
01:18:14,817 --> 01:18:15,526
...why not take what's...

942
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:16,694
...on offer and go?

943
01:18:16,944 --> 01:18:18,154
I've made do with less.

944
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:19,197
So have you.

945
01:18:21,532 --> 01:18:23,701
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

946
01:18:23,951 --> 01:18:24,869
What did you say?

947
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:26,370
There are spies watching this house...

948
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:29,290
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

949
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:30,541
You must wait...

950
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:31,709
...till nightfall.

951
01:18:48,184 --> 01:18:49,352
Thorin.

952
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:03,491
Da?

953
01:19:06,702 --> 01:19:08,120
Don't let them leave.

954
01:19:40,278 --> 01:19:41,278
Tauriel...

955
01:19:42,071 --> 01:19:44,115
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

956
01:19:44,365 --> 01:19:45,241
...on your own.

957
01:19:45,491 --> 01:19:47,368
But I'm not on my own.

958
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:49,495
You knew I would come.

959
01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:52,957
The king is angry...

960
01:19:53,207 --> 01:19:55,001
...Tauriel. For 600 years...

961
01:19:55,251 --> 01:19:56,961
...my father has protected you,
favored you.

962
01:19:58,087 --> 01:19:59,463
You defied his orders.

963
01:19:59,714 --> 01:20:01,090
You betrayed his trust.

964
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,643
The king has never let Orc filth...

965
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:13,853
...roam our lands.

966
01:20:14,103 --> 01:20:17,398
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

967
01:20:17,648 --> 01:20:18,941
It is not our fight.

968
01:20:19,191 --> 01:20:20,693
It is our fight.

969
01:20:21,235 --> 01:20:22,945
It will not end here.

970
01:20:23,195 --> 01:20:26,073
With every victory, this evil will grow.

971
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:29,076
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

972
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,412
We will hide within our walls...

973
01:20:31,662 --> 01:20:33,998
...live our lives away from the light...

974
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:35,791
...and let darkness descend.

975
01:20:37,668 --> 01:20:39,545
Are we not part of this world?

976
01:20:40,755 --> 01:20:41,922
Tell me, mellon.

977
01:20:42,173 --> 01:20:45,676
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

978
01:20:50,556 --> 01:20:53,267
Hello, Bard. What you after?

979
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,853
There was a tapestry!

980
01:20:56,562 --> 01:20:58,689
An old one! Where's it gone?

981
01:20:58,939 --> 01:20:59,607
What tapestry you talking about?

982
01:21:00,483 --> 01:21:01,067
This one.

983
01:21:02,068 --> 01:21:03,652
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...

984
01:21:03,903 --> 01:21:04,737
...out of nowhere.

985
01:21:04,987 --> 01:21:07,156
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

986
01:21:07,406 --> 01:21:09,033
I've never seen the like.

987
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:11,369
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

988
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:13,079
- It's the prophecy.
The prophecy?

989
01:21:13,454 --> 01:21:15,247
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

990
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,092
Prophecy.

991
01:21:29,845 --> 01:21:30,930
Prophecy.

992
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,473
The old tales will come true.

993
01:21:32,723 --> 01:21:34,975
Vast halls of treasure!

994
01:21:35,226 --> 01:21:36,394
Can it really be true?

995
01:21:36,644 --> 01:21:39,355
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

996
01:21:39,688 --> 01:21:42,233
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

997
01:21:42,483 --> 01:21:44,735
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

998
01:21:46,821 --> 01:21:48,572
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

999
01:21:49,782 --> 01:21:51,700
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

1000
01:21:53,035 --> 01:21:54,912
<i>BARB".
And the bell shall ring in gladness</i>

1001
01:21:55,162 --> 01:21:55,746
<i>At the Mountain</i>

1002
01:21:55,996 --> 01:21:57,498
<i>King's return</i>

1003
01:21:57,915 --> 01:22:00,459
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

1004
01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:03,796
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

1005
01:22:06,799 --> 01:22:07,758
Da, I tried to stop them.

1006
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:09,426
How long have they been gone?

1007
01:22:13,556 --> 01:22:15,224
Can you see anything?
Shh! Keep it down.

1008
01:22:15,474 --> 01:22:18,436
As soon as we have the
weapons, we make straight for the mountain.

1009
01:22:18,686 --> 01:22:19,854
GO, go!

1010
01:22:20,271 --> 01:22:21,438
Go, Nori.

1011
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:25,568
Next.

1012
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:40,040
You all right?

1013
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:41,584
I can manage.

1014
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:43,919
Let's just get out of here.

1015
01:22:57,933 --> 01:22:58,809
Run!

1016
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:00,186
Quickly! Move now!

1017
01:23:14,325 --> 01:23:15,534
Get off me! Get off!

1018
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:17,369
Move them along here.

1019
01:23:18,495 --> 01:23:19,496
Move on!

1020
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,590
What is the meaning of this?

1021
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:32,927
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.
Ah.

1022
01:23:33,427 --> 01:23:35,471
Enemies of the state, eh?

1023
01:23:35,721 --> 01:23:36,514
A desperate bunch of...

1024
01:23:36,764 --> 01:23:38,933
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

1025
01:23:39,183 --> 01:23:40,392
Hold your tongue!

1026
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,105
You do not know to whom you speak.

1027
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:47,566
This is no common criminal.

1028
01:23:47,858 --> 01:23:49,193
This is Thorin...

1029
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:52,571
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1030
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:57,826
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1031
01:24:00,538 --> 01:24:03,707
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1032
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:11,423
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

1033
01:24:12,716 --> 01:24:14,760
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1034
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,428
...filled with silks and fine gems.

1035
01:24:17,805 --> 01:24:20,015
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1036
01:24:21,058 --> 01:24:23,727
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

1037
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:26,146
I would...

1038
01:24:26,397 --> 01:24:27,606
...see those days return.

1039
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:30,359
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

1040
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:31,569
...and send wealth and riches...

1041
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:34,280
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

1042
01:24:37,283 --> 01:24:37,866
Death!

1043
01:24:39,076 --> 01:24:40,077
That is what you will...

1044
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:41,620
...bring upon us!

1045
01:24:42,496 --> 01:24:44,164
Dragon fire and ruin.

1046
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:48,544
If you waken that beast...

1047
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:50,754
...it will destroy us all.

1048
01:24:51,005 --> 01:24:52,840
You can listen to this naysayer...

1049
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:54,717
...but I promise you this:

1050
01:24:57,136 --> 01:24:58,554
If we succeed...

1051
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,433
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

1052
01:25:06,854 --> 01:25:09,898
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

1053
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:11,358
...10 times over!

1054
01:25:13,402 --> 01:25:14,570
All of you!

1055
01:25:14,903 --> 01:25:16,030
Listen to me!

1056
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,323
You must listen!

1057
01:25:17,573 --> 01:25:19,283
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

1058
01:25:21,118 --> 01:25:22,036
Have you forgotten those...

1059
01:25:22,286 --> 01:25:24,330
...who died in the firestorm?!

1060
01:25:26,624 --> 01:25:27,541
And for what purpose?

1061
01:25:29,043 --> 01:25:30,836
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1062
01:25:31,712 --> 01:25:33,714
...so riven by greed, he could not...

1063
01:25:33,964 --> 01:25:35,466
...see beyond his own desire!

1064
01:25:36,717 --> 01:25:38,344
Now, now!

1065
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:40,596
We must not, any of us...

1066
01:25:40,846 --> 01:25:43,223
...be too quick to lay blame.

1067
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:44,933
Let us...

1068
01:25:45,184 --> 01:25:46,894
...not forget that it was...

1069
01:25:47,144 --> 01:25:48,937
...Girion, Lord of Dale...

1070
01:25:49,188 --> 01:25:50,856
...your ancestor...

1071
01:25:51,106 --> 01:25:53,609
...who failed to kill the beast!

1072
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:58,113
It's true, sire.

1073
01:25:58,364 --> 01:25:59,573
We all know the story.

1074
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:02,826
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1075
01:26:03,077 --> 01:26:05,663
Each one missing its mark.

1076
01:26:12,419 --> 01:26:13,671
You have no right.

1077
01:26:15,381 --> 01:26:17,299
No right to enter that mountain.

1078
01:26:19,009 --> 01:26:21,136
I have the only right.

1079
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:28,852
I speak to the Master...

1080
01:26:29,103 --> 01:26:30,562
...of the Men of the Lake.

1081
01:26:30,813 --> 01:26:33,107
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1082
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:35,025
Will you...

1083
01:26:35,401 --> 01:26:39,154
...share in the great wealth
of our people?

1084
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,619
What say you?

1085
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:52,543
I say unto you...

1086
01:26:53,794 --> 01:26:54,795
Welcome!

1087
01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:56,004
Welcome!

1088
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,339
And thrice...

1089
01:26:57,589 --> 01:26:58,590
...welcome...

1090
01:26:58,841 --> 01:27:00,467
...King Under the Mountain!

1091
01:27:12,563 --> 01:27:15,065
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

1092
01:27:15,315 --> 01:27:17,943
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1093
01:27:18,193 --> 01:27:19,153
If we're to find the door before...

1094
01:27:19,403 --> 01:27:21,947
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1095
01:27:26,368 --> 01:27:27,119
Not you.

1096
01:27:27,953 --> 01:27:30,164
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1097
01:27:31,457 --> 01:27:33,250
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1098
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,418
Not now.

1099
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:41,800
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1100
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,136
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1101
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:46,638
Kili, stay here.

1102
01:27:47,264 --> 01:27:48,390
Rest.

1103
01:27:49,224 --> 01:27:50,642
Join us when you're healed.

1104
01:27:56,231 --> 01:27:57,566
I'll stay with the lad.

1105
01:27:57,816 --> 01:27:59,610
My duty lies with the wounded.

1106
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,819
Uncle.

1107
01:28:01,695 --> 01:28:03,405
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

1108
01:28:03,655 --> 01:28:04,907
Tales you told us.

1109
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:06,074
You cannot take that away...

1110
01:28:06,325 --> 01:28:07,326
- ... from him!
- Fili.

1111
01:28:07,576 --> 01:28:08,619
I will carry him if I must!

1112
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:11,288
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1113
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:15,334
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.

1114
01:28:16,627 --> 01:28:18,420
Not even my own kin.

1115
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:22,925
Fili, don't be a fool.

1116
01:28:23,926 --> 01:28:24,927
You belong with the company.

1117
01:28:25,177 --> 01:28:26,804
I belong with my brother.

1118
01:28:38,315 --> 01:28:42,152
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1119
01:28:43,237 --> 01:28:46,281
Go now with our goodwill...

1120
01:28:46,532 --> 01:28:47,908
...and good wishes.

1121
01:28:49,243 --> 01:28:52,037
- And may your return bring good fortune...
Wait!

1122
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:53,413
...to all!

1123
01:28:57,835 --> 01:28:58,877
Good bye.

1124
01:29:05,384 --> 01:29:05,968
Out of the way!

1125
01:29:06,218 --> 01:29:07,553
No! No!

1126
01:29:14,184 --> 01:29:16,186
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1127
01:29:16,853 --> 01:29:18,021
Kili? Kili!

1128
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:22,776
No.

1129
01:29:23,026 --> 01:29:24,653
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1130
01:29:24,903 --> 01:29:25,487
No, no...

1131
01:29:25,737 --> 01:29:26,530
...no! Please!

1132
01:29:26,822 --> 01:29:29,324
No one will help us. Kilt's sick.

1133
01:29:31,952 --> 01:29:33,036
He's very sick.

1134
01:30:13,368 --> 01:30:14,995
What is this place?

1135
01:30:15,245 --> 01:30:16,538
It was once the city of Dale.

1136
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,208
Now it is a ruin.

1137
01:30:20,959 --> 01:30:23,170
The desolation of Smaug.

1138
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,339
The sun will soon reach midday.

1139
01:30:25,589 --> 01:30:27,841
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1140
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:28,926
This way.

1141
01:30:29,176 --> 01:30:31,219
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1142
01:30:31,553 --> 01:30:32,888
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1143
01:30:33,138 --> 01:30:34,765
- On no account were we to-
- Do you see him?

1144
01:30:35,432 --> 01:30:36,099
We have no time...

1145
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,726
...to wait upon the Wizard.

1146
01:30:38,018 --> 01:30:39,770
We're on our own. Come!

1147
01:30:56,912 --> 01:30:58,664
Dol Guldur.

1148
01:30:58,914 --> 01:31:01,083
The Hill of Sorcery.

1149
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,585
It looks completely abandoned.

1150
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:05,295
As it is meant to.

1151
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:07,756
A spell of concealment...

1152
01:31:08,006 --> 01:31:11,093
...lies over this place, which means...

1153
01:31:11,343 --> 01:31:14,429
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.

1154
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:19,726
He has not regained his full strength.

1155
01:31:20,185 --> 01:31:23,522
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1156
01:31:23,772 --> 01:31:25,982
Tell her we must force his hand.

1157
01:31:26,233 --> 01:31:27,275
What do you mean?

1158
01:31:27,526 --> 01:31:29,111
I'm going in alone.

1159
01:31:29,444 --> 01:31:31,863
On no account come after me.

1160
01:31:37,995 --> 01:31:39,287
Do I have your word?

1161
01:31:39,538 --> 01:31:41,540
Yes, yes, yes!

1162
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,720
Wait, Gandalf!

1163
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:57,806
What if it's a trap?!

1164
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:02,644
Turn around and do not come back.

1165
01:32:07,524 --> 01:32:10,360
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1166
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:46,855
GANDALF

1167
01:33:16,968 --> 01:33:19,471
AZOG:

1168
01:33:33,068 --> 01:33:34,027
Anything?

1169
01:33:34,277 --> 01:33:35,779
Nothing!

1170
01:33:39,574 --> 01:33:40,909
If the map is true...

1171
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:44,204
...then the hidden door
lies directly above us.

1172
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,377
Up here!

1173
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,221
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

1174
01:34:33,086 --> 01:34:34,170
This must be it.

1175
01:34:36,381 --> 01:34:37,883
The hidden door.

1176
01:34:42,137 --> 01:34:43,889
Let all those who doubted us...

1177
01:34:45,056 --> 01:34:46,391
...rue this day!

1178
01:34:52,105 --> 01:34:54,566
Right, then. We have a key.

1179
01:34:56,276 --> 01:34:57,777
Which means that somewhere...

1180
01:34:58,904 --> 01:35:00,280
...there is a key-hole.

1181
01:35:00,989 --> 01:35:03,867
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1182
01:35:05,869 --> 01:35:06,703
...will shine upon...

1183
01:35:06,953 --> 01:35:08,371
...the key-hole. "

1184
01:35:17,505 --> 01:35:18,590
Nori.

1185
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:27,182
We're losing the light. Come on.

1186
01:35:33,688 --> 01:35:36,274
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping.

1187
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:37,317
I can't find it.

1188
01:35:38,777 --> 01:35:40,111
It's not here!

1189
01:35:40,362 --> 01:35:41,446
It's not here!

1190
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:44,282
Break it down!
Aye.

1191
01:35:46,284 --> 01:35:47,077
Come on!

1192
01:35:49,246 --> 01:35:49,996
Break!

1193
01:35:50,247 --> 01:35:51,248
It has to break.

1194
01:35:52,207 --> 01:35:53,541
It's no good.

1195
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:56,294
The door's sealed. Can't be opened by force.

1196
01:35:57,921 --> 01:35:59,047
There's a powerful magic on it.

1197
01:36:08,682 --> 01:36:09,808
No!

1198
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:17,440
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1199
01:36:19,317 --> 01:36:20,902
...will shine upon the key-hole. "

1200
01:36:25,323 --> 01:36:26,908
That is what it says.

1201
01:36:31,413 --> 01:36:32,831
What did we miss?

1202
01:36:36,793 --> 01:36:38,253
What did we miss?

1203
01:36:39,296 --> 01:36:40,255
Balin?

1204
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,590
We've lost the light.

1205
01:36:45,135 --> 01:36:46,970
There's no more to be done.

1206
01:36:48,513 --> 01:36:49,097
We had but...

1207
01:36:49,347 --> 01:36:50,598
...one chance.

1208
01:36:53,018 --> 01:36:54,269
Come away, lads.

1209
01:36:54,519 --> 01:36:56,313
It's over.

1210
01:36:57,397 --> 01:36:59,524
- Wait a minute.
We're too late.

1211
01:37:02,027 --> 01:37:03,445
Where are they going?

1212
01:37:05,238 --> 01:37:07,115
You can't give up now!

1213
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:23,214
Thorin.

1214
01:37:25,258 --> 01:37:26,926
You can't give up now.

1215
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,857
"Stand by the gray stone...

1216
01:37:42,734 --> 01:37:44,819
...when the thrush knocks. "

1217
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:46,946
The setting sun.

1218
01:37:47,989 --> 01:37:50,867
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine... "

1219
01:37:52,368 --> 01:37:53,828
The last light.

1220
01:37:56,372 --> 01:37:57,749
Last light.

1221
01:38:34,452 --> 01:38:35,703
The last light!

1222
01:38:45,922 --> 01:38:47,048
The key-hole!

1223
01:38:47,549 --> 01:38:48,133
Come back!

1224
01:38:48,925 --> 01:38:50,260
Come back!

1225
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:52,679
It's the light of the moon! The last...

1226
01:38:52,929 --> 01:38:56,015
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

1227
01:38:57,934 --> 01:39:00,311
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the-?

1228
01:39:00,562 --> 01:39:02,272
It was here.

1229
01:39:02,522 --> 01:39:04,315
Come on, it was- It was here.

1230
01:39:05,024 --> 01:39:05,859
It was just-

1231
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,335
Erebor.

1232
01:40:06,044 --> 01:40:07,170
Thorin.

1233
01:40:20,558 --> 01:40:22,435
I know these walls.

1234
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:27,732
These halls.

1235
01:40:30,735 --> 01:40:32,111
This stone.

1236
01:40:36,032 --> 01:40:36,658
You remember it...

1237
01:40:36,908 --> 01:40:38,034
...Balin.

1238
01:40:41,663 --> 01:40:44,165
Chambers filled with golden light.

1239
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:47,543
I remember.

1240
01:41:00,807 --> 01:41:02,141
"Herein lies...

1241
01:41:02,392 --> 01:41:04,269
...the Seventh Kingdom of...

1242
01:41:04,519 --> 01:41:05,687
...Durin's Folk.

1243
01:41:07,647 --> 01:41:10,733
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

1244
01:41:10,984 --> 01:41:14,570
...Dwarves in defense of this home. "

1245
01:41:16,281 --> 01:41:18,116
The Throne of the King.

1246
01:41:18,783 --> 01:41:20,118
Ah.

1247
01:41:21,828 --> 01:41:25,164
And what's that above it?

1248
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:30,461
The Arkenstone.

1249
01:41:31,754 --> 01:41:33,172
Arkenstone.

1250
01:41:37,093 --> 01:41:38,428
And what's that?

1251
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:41,723
That, Master Burglar...

1252
01:41:42,765 --> 01:41:44,809
...is why you are here.

1253
01:42:03,703 --> 01:42:05,413
Can you not do something?

1254
01:42:05,663 --> 01:42:07,874
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

1255
01:42:08,124 --> 01:42:10,501
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1256
01:42:10,752 --> 01:42:13,546
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1257
01:42:13,796 --> 01:42:15,798
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

1258
01:42:16,257 --> 01:42:17,383
Pigs?

1259
01:42:17,633 --> 01:42:18,760
Weed.

1260
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:20,636
Right.

1261
01:42:21,596 --> 01:42:22,764
Don't move.

1262
01:42:25,558 --> 01:42:29,103
You want me to find a jewel?

1263
01:42:30,647 --> 01:42:32,357
A large, white jewel.

1264
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:33,941
Yes.

1265
01:42:35,318 --> 01:42:37,904
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1266
01:42:38,237 --> 01:42:41,449
There is only one Arkenstone...

1267
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,285
...and you'll know it when you see it.

1268
01:42:45,411 --> 01:42:46,537
Right.

1269
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:50,875
In truth...

1270
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:52,001
...lad...

1271
01:42:52,794 --> 01:42:54,837
...I do not know...

1272
01:42:55,088 --> 01:42:57,173
...what you will find down there.

1273
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:02,428
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1274
01:43:02,678 --> 01:43:03,638
No, Balin.

1275
01:43:04,889 --> 01:43:06,933
I promised I would do this...

1276
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,310
...and I think I must try.

1277
01:43:14,023 --> 01:43:15,733
It never ceases to amaze me.

1278
01:43:15,983 --> 01:43:16,776
What's that?

1279
01:43:17,026 --> 01:43:18,736
The courage of Hobbits.

1280
01:43:21,114 --> 01:43:22,365
Go now...

1281
01:43:22,865 --> 01:43:26,869
...with as much luck as you can muster.

1282
01:43:34,085 --> 01:43:35,378
Oh, Bilbo?

1283
01:43:37,797 --> 01:43:40,091
If there is, in fact...

1284
01:43:41,592 --> 01:43:42,427
...a live dragon...

1285
01:43:42,677 --> 01:43:43,719
...down there...

1286
01:43:46,764 --> 01:43:48,182
...don't waken it.

1287
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,220
Where is your master?

1288
01:45:09,013 --> 01:45:10,097
Where is he?!

1289
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:13,726
AZOG:

1290
01:45:57,895 --> 01:45:58,771
NECROMANCER:

1291
01:47:23,564 --> 01:47:26,359
Sauron!

1292
01:47:49,048 --> 01:47:50,132
Hello?

1293
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:10,569
He's not at home.

1294
01:48:11,529 --> 01:48:13,197
Not at home. Ahem.

1295
01:48:14,031 --> 01:48:15,116
Good.

1296
01:48:16,909 --> 01:48:18,661
Good, good, good.

1297
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:13,424
What's that?

1298
01:49:17,511 --> 01:49:19,472
Shush. Shush.

1299
01:49:20,806 --> 01:49:22,099
Arkenstone.

1300
01:49:23,142 --> 01:49:24,518
Arkenstone.

1301
01:49:25,352 --> 01:49:27,396
A large, white jewel.

1302
01:49:29,607 --> 01:49:30,983
Very helpful.

1303
01:51:56,587 --> 01:51:57,963
Well...

1304
01:51:59,632 --> 01:52:00,925
...thief.

1305
01:52:02,927 --> 01:52:06,555
I smell you.

1306
01:52:06,931 --> 01:52:10,142
I hear your breath.

1307
01:52:11,435 --> 01:52:13,062
I feel...

1308
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,230
...your air.

1309
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:20,694
Where are you?

1310
01:52:22,154 --> 01:52:23,239
Where are you?

1311
01:52:43,384 --> 01:52:44,385
Come, now...

1312
01:52:45,135 --> 01:52:47,262
...don't be shy.

1313
01:52:47,513 --> 01:52:49,723
Step into the light.

1314
01:52:53,936 --> 01:52:54,520
<i>Hmm.</i>

1315
01:52:56,647 --> 01:52:59,858
There is something about you.

1316
01:53:03,237 --> 01:53:04,029
Something you...

1317
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,114
...carry.

1318
01:53:06,282 --> 01:53:09,159
Something made of gold.

1319
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:12,830
But far more...

1320
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,873
...precious.

1321
01:53:15,124 --> 01:53:17,459
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1322
01:53:20,254 --> 01:53:21,422
There you are...

1323
01:53:21,672 --> 01:53:23,215
...Thief in the...

1324
01:53:23,465 --> 01:53:25,300
...Shadows.

1325
01:53:27,136 --> 01:53:29,722
I did not come to steal from you...

1326
01:53:29,972 --> 01:53:30,764
...O Smaug...

1327
01:53:31,015 --> 01:53:34,268
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

1328
01:53:34,518 --> 01:53:36,145
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

1329
01:53:36,478 --> 01:53:37,312
To see...

1330
01:53:37,563 --> 01:53:40,524
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

1331
01:53:41,233 --> 01:53:42,985
I did not believe them.

1332
01:53:51,827 --> 01:53:55,748
And do you now'?!

1333
01:53:57,082 --> 01:53:58,334
Truly...

1334
01:53:59,668 --> 01:54:01,837
...the tales and songs...

1335
01:54:02,963 --> 01:54:05,674
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

1336
01:54:05,924 --> 01:54:08,886
...O Smaug the Stupendous.

1337
01:54:09,136 --> 01:54:12,014
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1338
01:54:12,514 --> 01:54:13,474
No, no.

1339
01:54:13,724 --> 01:54:15,225
No, indeed.

1340
01:54:17,478 --> 01:54:20,731
You seem familiar with my name...

1341
01:54:20,981 --> 01:54:23,859
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

1342
01:54:24,985 --> 01:54:26,570
Who are you...

1343
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:29,323
...and where do you come from...

1344
01:54:29,573 --> 01:54:31,909
...may I ask?

1345
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:43,128
I come from under the hill.

1346
01:54:43,504 --> 01:54:44,880
Underhill?

1347
01:54:48,592 --> 01:54:49,468
And under hills...

1348
01:54:49,718 --> 01:54:51,720
...and over hills my path has led.

1349
01:54:52,596 --> 01:54:53,430
And- And...

1350
01:54:54,223 --> 01:54:56,558
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1351
01:54:56,809 --> 01:54:58,519
Impressive.

1352
01:54:58,769 --> 01:55:00,813
What else do you claim to be?

1353
01:55:01,772 --> 01:55:02,564
I am-

1354
01:55:05,818 --> 01:55:07,277
Luck-wearer.

1355
01:55:08,737 --> 01:55:09,905
Riddle-maker.

1356
01:55:10,155 --> 01:55:11,824
Lovely titles.

1357
01:55:12,533 --> 01:55:13,700
Go on.

1358
01:55:13,951 --> 01:55:15,035
Barrel-rider.

1359
01:55:15,285 --> 01:55:18,705
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1360
01:55:20,165 --> 01:55:20,874
And what about...

1361
01:55:21,125 --> 01:55:24,086
...your little Dwarf friends?

1362
01:55:25,212 --> 01:55:26,463
Where are they hiding?

1363
01:55:29,341 --> 01:55:30,884
Dwarves?

1364
01:55:31,718 --> 01:55:32,803
No.

1365
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,013
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1366
01:55:35,264 --> 01:55:36,348
You've got that all wrong.

1367
01:55:36,598 --> 01:55:40,352
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1368
01:55:40,936 --> 01:55:42,187
They sent you in here...

1369
01:55:42,438 --> 01:55:44,398
...to do their dirty work while they...

1370
01:55:44,648 --> 01:55:46,608
...skulk about outside.

1371
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:49,027
Truly...

1372
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:50,988
...you are mistaken...

1373
01:55:51,238 --> 01:55:54,241
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

1374
01:55:54,491 --> 01:55:57,870
You have nice manners...

1375
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,080
...for a thief and...

1376
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,248
...a liar!

1377
01:56:02,624 --> 01:56:06,003
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1378
01:56:06,461 --> 01:56:07,629
No one better!

1379
01:56:09,381 --> 01:56:10,757
It is the gold!

1380
01:56:11,008 --> 01:56:11,758
They are drawn...

1381
01:56:12,009 --> 01:56:13,051
...to treasure like...

1382
01:56:13,302 --> 01:56:14,845
...flies to dead flesh.

1383
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,600
Did you think I did not know...

1384
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:21,560
...this day would come?!

1385
01:56:23,437 --> 01:56:24,730
That a pack of...

1386
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:26,273
...canting Dwarves...

1387
01:56:26,523 --> 01:56:28,859
...would come crawling back...

1388
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:30,652
...to the mountain?!

1389
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:36,408
Was that an earthquake?

1390
01:56:36,658 --> 01:56:38,785
That, my lad...

1391
01:56:41,997 --> 01:56:43,457
...was a dragon.

1392
01:56:51,757 --> 01:56:52,341
Da?

1393
01:56:52,841 --> 01:56:54,468
It's coming from the mountain.

1394
01:56:58,513 --> 01:56:59,765
You should leave us.

1395
01:57:00,057 --> 01:57:00,682
Take your children.

1396
01:57:00,933 --> 01:57:01,808
Get out of here.

1397
01:57:02,476 --> 01:57:03,769
And go where?

1398
01:57:04,853 --> 01:57:06,230
There is nowhere to go.

1399
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:09,733
Are we going to die, Da?

1400
01:57:11,777 --> 01:57:12,945
No, darling.

1401
01:57:13,195 --> 01:57:13,779
The dragon.

1402
01:57:14,029 --> 01:57:15,489
It's going to kill us.

1403
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:27,960
Not if I kill it first.

1404
01:57:29,419 --> 01:57:33,090
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

1405
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,008
I took his throne.

1406
01:57:35,384 --> 01:57:36,301
I ate his...

1407
01:57:36,551 --> 01:57:39,346
...people like a wolf among sheep.

1408
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,268
I kill where...

1409
01:57:44,518 --> 01:57:46,144
...I wish, when...

1410
01:57:46,395 --> 01:57:47,854
...I Wish.

1411
01:57:48,105 --> 01:57:51,400
My armor is iron.

1412
01:58:00,576 --> 01:58:02,995
No blade can pierce me.

1413
01:58:06,164 --> 01:58:07,416
All right.

1414
01:58:07,666 --> 01:58:10,002
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me'?

1415
01:58:10,252 --> 01:58:11,878
Because you did not need to know.

1416
01:58:19,469 --> 01:58:21,013
Listen to me carefully.

1417
01:58:21,388 --> 01:58:23,515
I need you to distract the guards.

1418
01:58:24,099 --> 01:58:24,683
Once I'm at the top of...

1419
01:58:24,933 --> 01:58:27,227
...the tower, I'll set the arrow to the bow.

1420
01:58:27,477 --> 01:58:28,061
There he is!

1421
01:58:28,312 --> 01:58:28,895
Bard!

1422
01:58:29,146 --> 01:58:31,315
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1423
01:58:31,565 --> 01:58:32,149
Stop him!

1424
01:58:39,615 --> 01:58:40,449
Stop him!

1425
01:58:41,325 --> 01:58:41,908
Stop!

1426
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:47,748
Bain! Bain.

1427
01:58:48,582 --> 01:58:52,252
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

1428
01:58:52,502 --> 01:58:54,212
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1429
01:58:58,175 --> 01:58:58,800
Braga.

1430
01:58:59,051 --> 01:58:59,676
You're under arrest.

1431
01:58:59,926 --> 01:59:02,804
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1432
01:59:32,793 --> 01:59:34,211
Where's he gone?

1433
01:59:45,472 --> 01:59:46,556
What about Bilbo?

1434
01:59:46,807 --> 01:59:47,808
Give him more time.

1435
01:59:48,058 --> 01:59:50,227
Time to do what? To be killed?

1436
01:59:52,687 --> 01:59:53,939
You're afraid.

1437
01:59:55,607 --> 01:59:57,901
Yes, I'm afraid.

1438
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:00,404
I fear for you.

1439
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:03,949
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1440
02:00:04,366 --> 02:00:05,158
A sickness which drove...

1441
02:00:05,409 --> 02:00:06,701
...your grandfather mad.

1442
02:00:06,952 --> 02:00:08,537
I am not my grandfather.

1443
02:00:08,787 --> 02:00:10,539
You're not yourself.

1444
02:00:11,415 --> 02:00:13,542
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there-

1445
02:00:13,792 --> 02:00:14,376
I will not risk...

1446
02:00:14,626 --> 02:00:18,422
...this quest for the life of one burglar.

1447
02:00:20,298 --> 02:00:21,717
Bilbo.

1448
02:00:22,092 --> 02:00:24,010
His name is Bilbo.

1449
02:00:27,764 --> 02:00:29,558
It's Oakenshield...

1450
02:00:29,850 --> 02:00:32,811
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1451
02:00:35,063 --> 02:00:37,190
He sent you in here...

1452
02:00:37,441 --> 02:00:40,193
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1453
02:00:40,444 --> 02:00:41,069
No. No...

1454
02:00:41,319 --> 02:00:44,197
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1455
02:00:44,448 --> 02:00:45,574
Don't bother denying it.

1456
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:48,785
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.

1457
02:00:51,455 --> 02:00:52,956
But it matters not.

1458
02:00:54,124 --> 02:00:56,501
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1459
02:00:58,503 --> 02:01:00,255
The darkness is coming.

1460
02:01:01,089 --> 02:01:05,093
<i>It will spread to every corner of the land.</i>

1461
02:01:47,677 --> 02:01:49,638
You are being used, Thief...

1462
02:01:49,888 --> 02:01:52,015
...in the Shadows.
You were only...

1463
02:01:52,265 --> 02:01:54,851
...ever a means to an end.

1464
02:01:55,685 --> 02:01:56,269
The coward...

1465
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,105
...Oakenshield has weighed...

1466
02:01:59,356 --> 02:02:00,941
...the value of your life...

1467
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:03,360
...and found it worth nothing.

1468
02:02:03,985 --> 02:02:05,153
No.

1469
02:02:05,904 --> 02:02:06,571
No.

1470
02:02:07,864 --> 02:02:08,824
No, you're lying.

1471
02:02:09,074 --> 02:02:10,242
What did he promise you?

1472
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:12,786
A share of the treasure?

1473
02:02:13,787 --> 02:02:14,913
As if it was his...

1474
02:02:15,163 --> 02:02:16,248
...to give.

1475
02:02:17,082 --> 02:02:18,833
I will not part with...

1476
02:02:19,084 --> 02:02:20,085
...a single coin.

1477
02:02:20,752 --> 02:02:23,296
Not one piece of it.

1478
02:02:27,175 --> 02:02:28,051
My teeth...

1479
02:02:28,301 --> 02:02:29,469
...are swords.

1480
02:02:30,387 --> 02:02:33,682
My claws are spears.

1481
02:02:35,809 --> 02:02:36,977
My Wings...

1482
02:02:37,602 --> 02:02:40,146
...are a hurricane.

1483
02:02:45,777 --> 02:02:47,612
So it is true.

1484
02:02:47,988 --> 02:02:50,115
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1485
02:02:50,365 --> 02:02:51,283
What did you say?

1486
02:02:52,117 --> 02:02:55,996
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

1487
02:02:56,246 --> 02:02:57,455
...the Tyrannical.

1488
02:02:58,039 --> 02:02:59,124
Truly.

1489
02:02:59,374 --> 02:03:01,334
You have no equal on this earth.

1490
02:03:05,755 --> 02:03:06,423
I am...

1491
02:03:06,673 --> 02:03:09,926
...almost tempted to let you take it.

1492
02:03:10,385 --> 02:03:12,387
If only to see Oakenshield...

1493
02:03:12,637 --> 02:03:13,597
...suffer.

1494
02:03:14,681 --> 02:03:15,765
Watch it...

1495
02:03:16,016 --> 02:03:17,517
...destroy him.

1496
02:03:18,018 --> 02:03:21,146
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1497
02:03:21,813 --> 02:03:24,190
...and drive him mad.

1498
02:03:27,402 --> 02:03:28,987
But I think not.

1499
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:31,823
I think our little game ends here.

1500
02:03:32,657 --> 02:03:33,909
So tell me...

1501
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:35,035
...thief...

1502
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:38,038
...how do you choose to die?

1503
02:04:21,498 --> 02:04:22,332
Nah.

1504
02:04:50,694 --> 02:04:52,737
Da? Is that you, Da?

1505
02:05:25,854 --> 02:05:27,188
- Aah!
Stay down!

1506
02:06:27,999 --> 02:06:28,666
Get down!

1507
02:06:41,012 --> 02:06:42,931
FIMBUL:

1508
02:07:05,203 --> 02:07:06,371
You killed them all.

1509
02:07:06,621 --> 02:07:07,705
There are others.

1510
02:07:08,122 --> 02:07:09,207
Tauriel.

1511
02:07:09,707 --> 02:07:10,792
Come.

1512
02:07:14,838 --> 02:07:15,797
We're losing him.

1513
02:07:19,717 --> 02:07:20,927
Tauriel.

1514
02:07:44,868 --> 02:07:45,869
<i>Athens.</i>

1515
02:07:48,705 --> 02:07:50,123
<i>Athens.</i>

1516
02:07:51,124 --> 02:07:52,208
What are you doing?

1517
02:07:55,211 --> 02:07:56,921
I'm going to save him.

1518
02:08:17,692 --> 02:08:18,985
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1519
02:08:19,235 --> 02:08:22,197
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.

1520
02:08:25,158 --> 02:08:26,743
Did you find it?

1521
02:08:32,248 --> 02:08:33,333
We have to get out.

1522
02:08:37,045 --> 02:08:38,046
Thorin.

1523
02:08:41,758 --> 02:08:42,884
Thorin.

1524
02:09:13,331 --> 02:09:15,458
You will burn!

1525
02:09:16,626 --> 02:09:17,460
- Run!
- Ah!

1526
02:09:24,592 --> 02:09:25,677
Come on, Bilbo!

1527
02:09:38,564 --> 02:09:39,607
Come on.

1528
02:09:56,749 --> 02:09:57,959
Hold him down.

1529
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:16,102
Unh! Tilda.

1530
02:11:08,988 --> 02:11:10,156
Shh, Shh, Shh!

1531
02:11:17,997 --> 02:11:19,457
We've given him the slip.

1532
02:11:19,707 --> 02:11:20,708
No.

1533
02:11:21,167 --> 02:11:23,377
He's too cunning for that.

1534
02:11:25,129 --> 02:11:26,255
So where to now?

1535
02:11:26,839 --> 02:11:28,174
The western guardroom.

1536
02:11:28,883 --> 02:11:30,426
There may be a way out.

1537
02:11:30,676 --> 02:11:32,678
It's too high. There's no chance...

1538
02:11:32,929 --> 02:11:35,014
- ... that way.
- It's our only chance.

1539
02:11:36,349 --> 02:11:37,809
We have to try.

1540
02:11:54,367 --> 02:11:55,535
Come on.

1541
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:46,794
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.

1542
02:12:47,044 --> 02:12:49,755
That was a privilege to witness.

1543
02:12:52,258 --> 02:12:53,426
Tauriel.

1544
02:12:57,722 --> 02:12:58,931
Lie still.

1545
02:13:06,147 --> 02:13:08,232
You cannot be her.

1546
02:13:11,736 --> 02:13:13,905
She is far away.

1547
02:13:18,075 --> 02:13:19,493
She is far...

1548
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:21,329
...far away from me.

1549
02:13:22,955 --> 02:13:25,082
She walks...

1550
02:13:25,333 --> 02:13:28,002
...in starlight in another world.

1551
02:13:33,341 --> 02:13:35,301
It was just a dream.

1552
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:49,190
Do you think she could've loved me?

1553
02:13:56,531 --> 02:13:57,156
Stay close.

1554
02:14:07,917 --> 02:14:08,668
That's it, then.

1555
02:14:09,961 --> 02:14:11,796
There's no way out.

1556
02:14:18,219 --> 02:14:20,429
The last of our kin.

1557
02:14:24,141 --> 02:14:26,227
They must have come here...

1558
02:14:26,894 --> 02:14:27,937
...hoping...

1559
02:14:28,187 --> 02:14:29,313
...beyond hope.

1560
02:14:39,073 --> 02:14:41,409
We could try to reach the mines.

1561
02:14:42,243 --> 02:14:44,495
We might last a few days.

1562
02:14:46,664 --> 02:14:47,707
No.

1563
02:14:50,668 --> 02:14:52,878
I will not die like this.

1564
02:14:54,255 --> 02:14:55,423
Cowering.

1565
02:14:56,299 --> 02:14:58,092
Clawing for breath.

1566
02:15:03,014 --> 02:15:04,140
We make for the forges.

1567
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:06,350
He'll see us, sure as death.

1568
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,852
Not if we split up.

1569
02:15:08,102 --> 02:15:08,686
Thorin...

1570
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:10,813
...we'll never make it.

1571
02:15:11,063 --> 02:15:12,565
Some of us might.

1572
02:15:12,982 --> 02:15:15,192
Lead him to the forges.

1573
02:15:15,985 --> 02:15:17,987
We kill the dragon.

1574
02:15:19,697 --> 02:15:21,949
If this is to end in fire...

1575
02:15:22,408 --> 02:15:24,827
...then we will all burn together.

1576
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:27,288
This way.

1577
02:15:31,751 --> 02:15:32,335
Flee.

1578
02:15:33,461 --> 02:15:34,378
Flee.

1579
02:15:35,379 --> 02:15:37,340
Run for your lives.

1580
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:38,966
There is...

1581
02:15:39,592 --> 02:15:41,802
...nowhere to hide.

1582
02:15:42,053 --> 02:15:43,012
Behind you!

1583
02:15:43,262 --> 02:15:44,138
Worm!

1584
02:15:45,264 --> 02:15:45,931
Come on!

1585
02:15:48,309 --> 02:15:49,310
Run!

1586
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:52,563
Hey, you!

1587
02:15:52,938 --> 02:15:53,606
Here!

1588
02:18:51,659 --> 02:18:53,619
This way. It's this way!

1589
02:18:53,869 --> 02:18:54,995
Come on!

1590
02:18:55,246 --> 02:18:55,829
Thofin!

1591
02:19:01,627 --> 02:19:02,711
Follow Balin!

1592
02:19:03,921 --> 02:19:05,172
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1593
02:19:21,021 --> 02:19:22,356
Thofin!

1594
02:19:31,448 --> 02:19:32,491
Hold on!

1595
02:20:06,317 --> 02:20:07,651
Thofin!

1596
02:20:10,529 --> 02:20:12,072
Go. Go!

1597
02:20:15,826 --> 02:20:19,496
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1598
02:20:19,747 --> 02:20:21,081
He's right. We've no...

1599
02:20:21,332 --> 02:20:23,667
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1600
02:20:26,211 --> 02:20:27,588
Have we not?

1601
02:20:29,131 --> 02:20:32,051
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted.

1602
02:20:36,013 --> 02:20:36,639
You have grown...

1603
02:20:36,889 --> 02:20:38,849
...slow and fat...

1604
02:20:39,683 --> 02:20:40,559
...in your dotage...

1605
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:44,188
...slug!

1606
02:20:45,564 --> 02:20:47,232
Take cover. Go!

1607
02:21:14,677 --> 02:21:15,386
Bombu r!

1608
02:21:15,678 --> 02:21:17,096
Get those bellows working.

1609
02:21:17,346 --> 02:21:18,430
Go!

1610
02:21:32,236 --> 02:21:32,820
Bilbo!

1611
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:34,822
Up there. On my mark...

1612
02:21:35,072 --> 02:21:36,365
...pull that lever.

1613
02:21:46,875 --> 02:21:49,211
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

1614
02:21:49,461 --> 02:21:51,839
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

1615
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:55,050
We don't have a jiffy.

1616
02:22:07,021 --> 02:22:08,147
Where's the sulfur?

1617
02:22:08,522 --> 02:22:09,356
You sure you know what...

1618
02:22:09,606 --> 02:22:10,274
...you're doing?

1619
02:22:22,036 --> 02:22:22,828
Come on!

1620
02:22:45,142 --> 02:22:45,809
NOW!

1621
02:24:42,551 --> 02:24:44,636
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1622
02:25:32,726 --> 02:25:33,852
Keep going, Bilbo!

1623
02:25:34,269 --> 02:25:35,354
Run!

1624
02:26:20,691 --> 02:26:21,692
You think you...

1625
02:26:21,942 --> 02:26:23,902
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1626
02:26:27,447 --> 02:26:30,450
You have come from Lake-town.

1627
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,453
This is some...

1628
02:26:33,704 --> 02:26:36,957
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

1629
02:26:37,207 --> 02:26:40,377
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1630
02:26:41,378 --> 02:26:43,296
Those sniveling cowards...

1631
02:26:43,547 --> 02:26:45,007
...with their long bows...

1632
02:26:45,257 --> 02:26:48,093
...and Black Arrows.

1633
02:26:48,468 --> 02:26:50,345
Perhaps it is time...

1634
02:26:50,595 --> 02:26:52,472
...I paid them a visit.

1635
02:26:53,015 --> 02:26:54,266
Oh, no.

1636
02:26:56,143 --> 02:26:57,602
This isn't their fault!

1637
02:26:57,853 --> 02:26:58,645
Wait!

1638
02:26:58,895 --> 02:27:00,480
You cannot go to Lake-town!

1639
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:04,568
You care about them...

1640
02:27:05,277 --> 02:27:06,528
you?

1641
02:27:06,778 --> 02:27:07,738
Good.

1642
02:27:08,447 --> 02:27:09,031
Then you can...

1643
02:27:09,281 --> 02:27:10,866
...watch them die.

1644
02:27:16,413 --> 02:27:17,539
Here!

1645
02:27:18,457 --> 02:27:19,374
You witless worm.

1646
02:27:26,298 --> 02:27:27,674
You.

1647
02:27:28,091 --> 02:27:30,552
I am taking back what you stole.

1648
02:27:34,598 --> 02:27:35,265
You...

1649
02:27:35,515 --> 02:27:37,100
...will take nothing...

1650
02:27:37,351 --> 02:27:39,019
...from me...

1651
02:27:39,269 --> 02:27:40,437
...Dwarf.

1652
02:27:40,937 --> 02:27:44,191
I laid low your warriors...

1653
02:27:44,441 --> 02:27:46,068
...of old.

1654
02:27:46,318 --> 02:27:48,695
I instilled terror in...

1655
02:27:48,945 --> 02:27:50,614
...the hearts of Men.

1656
02:27:51,782 --> 02:27:53,200
I am...

1657
02:27:53,450 --> 02:27:54,826
...King Under...

1658
02:27:55,327 --> 02:27:57,120
...the Mountain.

1659
02:27:57,579 --> 02:27:59,831
This is not your kingdom.

1660
02:28:00,082 --> 02:28:02,084
These are Dwarf lands.

1661
02:28:02,834 --> 02:28:03,710
This is Dwarf gold.

1662
02:28:06,171 --> 02:28:06,880
And we will...

1663
02:28:07,130 --> 02:28:09,299
...have our revenge.

1664
02:29:30,839 --> 02:29:31,631
Revenge?!

1665
02:29:33,508 --> 02:29:35,135
Revenge?!

1666
02:29:35,927 --> 02:29:39,848
I will show you revenge!

1667
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:18,386
Listen to me!

1668
02:30:18,929 --> 02:30:21,223
Do you not know what is coming?

1669
02:30:23,642 --> 02:30:27,354
I am fire.

1670
02:30:28,563 --> 02:30:31,066
I am...

1671
02:30:33,276 --> 02:30:34,611
...death.

1672
02:30:43,328 --> 02:30:45,539
What have we done?

1673
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,087
