Come on, boy.

3
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:38,938
Who's a good boy?

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,110

<i>Vagina Monologues.</i>

00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,419
Me and Faustino
are putting it up in class tonight.

10
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,897
<i>Vagina Monologues,
I thought that was for girls.</i>

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,334
It's a gender reversal exercise, bro.
That's what being a good actor's all about.

12
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,305
Sorry, Drama. I thought you already had
your gender reversed.

13
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:06,374
Funny, dick.

14
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:09,342
E., I decided we're going with the Benz.

15
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,913
You're sure?
You changed your mind 10 times already.

16
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:14,847
No, I'm set. I had a dream about it last night.

17
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,579
I dreamt about it last night, too, Vince.
We're cruising down Rodeo.

18
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,678
Suddenly two jerk-offs pull up and say:

19
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,654
"Chase brothers, fuck your mother!"

20
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,123
And then open fire.

21
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,251
It had to be a dream.
Somebody recognized you?

22
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:27,556
That's funny.

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,055
You're gonna love this. This is really good.

24
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:33,896
- You put soy milk in these again?
- You're lactose intolerant. Don't fight it.

25
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,733
Vince, they got the stains
out of your black Dolces.

26
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,806
Cool.

27
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,000
I only got you nine iPods. They ran out.

28
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:42,304
<i>- Did you get The Trades?
- Right here, boss.</i>

29
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,437
- I'm just warning you. It ain't pretty.
- Really?

30
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,708
Fucking prick called you a thespian.

31
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:50,184
Read it out loud, E.

32
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,448
You don't want to hear this, Vince.

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,387
Come on, man. I'm a big boy.

beyond a reasonable doubt:

36

"Vincent Chase is guilty of fraud."

37
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,358
That's fucked up.

38
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,303
<i>Fuck critics. Remember what they said
about me when Viking Quest aired?</i>

39
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:13,600
Who laughed their way through a full 22?

40
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,835
Keep reading.

- At least he said I was pretty.
- All the Chase men are pretty.

45
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,556
Yeah. You're a real beauty queen, Drama.

46
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,161
- You all right?
- Yeah. Whatever.

47
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,926
Good or bad, you can't let
what these people say affect you.

48
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:41,298
- That's right. 'Cause you're a fucking star.
- True knocking.

49
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:43,994
All right. We got Ari in 30 minutes. So...

50
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,541
Johnny, you still need some help
with that scene?

51
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:49,736
From a no-talent pretty boy like you?
I think I'll pass.

- Loretta, how you doing?
- Hi, beautiful.

53
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:04,385
How you doing?

54
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,687
Four o'clock.

55
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:22,166
- Who's that girl? She's cute as hell.
- That was fucking Justine Chapin, bro.

56
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:24,472
- The singer?
- No way that girl's a virgin.

57
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,740
That's what she's famous for.

58
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,146
She's saving it till marriage.
Everybody knows that.

Hey, you guys, I'm Emily,
Ari's new assistant.

61
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,948
- Hi.
- You are new, honey.

62
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:39,186
It's good to meet guys from Queens.
My dad's from Flushing.

63
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,353
- Yeah?
- Yeah? Where'd you grow up?

64
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:44,661
I grew up out here.
But don't hold that against me.

65
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,463
- Can I offer you anything to drink?
- I'll have a water.

66
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,127
Yeah, I'll have a water.

67
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:51,001
You got Welch's Grape Soda?

68
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,240
He's in a meeting.
Can he call you back, please?

69
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,401
Thank you.

70
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,380
Ari Gold's office. Please hold.

71
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:02,217
It's the girl's first day.
You really needed to hassle her?

72
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:05,514
You order something unusual,
people will never forget you.

73
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,220
I think E.'s got something for that Emily.

74
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,723
Seriously.
'Cause I'm always ordering weird shit...

75
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:13,226
and now, all of a sudden,
it's become a problem?

76
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,796
- You like Emily?
- I don't even know the girl.

77
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,422
- I'll hook it up.
- Don't do it.

78
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,296
Emily, you got a boyfriend?

79
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,935
'Cause my man, E., here
just got his heart broken.

80
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,368
He thinks you're kind of cute.

81
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:25,406
Oh, yeah? Which one's E?

82
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,837
How you doing?

83
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:33,837
Lay off the new girl.
She's not broken in yet. Come on in, boys.

84
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,184
- Hold everything for me, will you?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,353
Vince. Vince.

86
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,146
No representation. Just reminding you.

87
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:48,957
Do me a favor.

88
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,223
Make sure I'm off book, okay?

89
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,301
Okay.

"If your vagina could talk,

93
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,169
Give me that thing.

94
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,905
Look at the boy.

95
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,512
Wait for it.
Look at the ass on my next door neighbor.

96
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,450
See that? Four kids.
My wife says it's impossible to maintain.

97
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:12,918
You've a good-looking boy, Ari.

98
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:15,581
He likes chicks.
See the glance? Look at that.

99
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:19,218
What's up with this Justine Chapin chick?

100
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,929
Justine Chapin.

101
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,863
Every young actor in Hollywood wants
to be the first one in there. Take a number.

102
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,559
Come on. She's not a virgin.

103
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,135
Always the cynic, E.

104
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,495
Ari, should we be worried
about this review?

105
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:35,035
<i>No. It's not even a real paper, Vince.
It's Variety.</i>

106
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,408
I'm not worried. I think Eric's worried.

107
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:41,472
No, I'm not. I mean, it's a bad review.
I would've preferred a good one, but...

108
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,074
- What's your point?
- My point is, what're we doing?

109
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,175
- What are we doing?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:46,254
What are we doing?

111
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:50,382
<i>- What are we doing about Vince's next job?
- I got Vince his next job. It's Matterhorn!</i>

112
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:53,791
You passed on it, remember?
He passed on your next job, Vince.

113
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,228
The guy doesn't want to make money.
He's a communist.

114
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,060
Are you a communist or a socialist?

115
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,328
Or didn't you learn the difference
at Pepperoni U?

116
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:01,902
And what are you, a Rhodes scholar?

117
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm a lowly Harvard grad
with a J.D.IM.B.A. From Michigan. That's it.

118
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,668
- Michigan? Good football team.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,069
What'd they do at Harvard?

120
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,440
- They row.
- No, they crew.

121
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:11,535
- Crew.
- They crew.

122
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:14,343
Vince, we gotta get you a real manager.

123
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,880
Cash.
Where are those scripts we talked about?

124
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:22,320
Emily, scripts!
I pay my dog-walker $4,000 a month.

125
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:24,255
- Wanna play the Riv tomorrow?
- Yeah, let's hack it up.

126
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,348
You caddie?

127
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,655
I'll caddie for you the day you outdrive me.

128
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,357
Really? Then you're caddying.
Everybody wins.

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,126
Just call me if the pages
printed out too light or anything.

130
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,465
Okay. I will.

131
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,538
My brother needs an agent.

132
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,366
I got Billy in the mailroom.
He needs his first client.

133
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:43,808
We'll hook him up. I'm kidding.

134
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,745
We're golden. We're in great shape.
What're you talking about?

135
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:48,713
We're in great shape.
We're gonna open huge.

136
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,513
Hang back.
I want to bounce some scripts off your boy.

137
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,214
- Keep me posted.
- You got it. Keep your cell phone on.

138
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:56,018
Put those down. Come here.

139
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:04,462
Where's your bedside manner, dummy?
Why did you bring up a bad review?

140
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,693
- You said it didn't matter.
- It does matter.

141
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:08,497
Everyone in this town reads that thing.

142
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:12,665
I got more calls about this stupid-ass thing
than I did when my mother passed away.

143
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:16,733
We got 200 reviews coming out on Friday.
If they're like this, we're in deep shit.

144
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:20,303
That's why you book your next job
before the movie comes out.

145
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,605
Altoid?

146
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,625
Take him out, keep him happy, all right?

147
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:32,853
He's got meetings coming up,
scripts to read.

148
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,156
He must keep focused.
Have a good time with him.

149
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,256
- Keep his mind off that fucking review.
- Yeah. You're right.

150
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,699
We in this together? Are we in it together?

151
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:42,997
- Yeah. You're right.
- I'm kidding.

152
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,963
- Don't fucking mention that review again!
- I'm not.

153
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,537
You want to hug it out?

154
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,077
- No, not really.
- Let's hug it out, bitch.

155
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,213
Let's hug it out.

156
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,144
<i>You remember
The Orange County Register said...</i>

157
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,014
I was a functioning retard.

158
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:01,350
- Now, that was a bad review.
- I thought that was a compliment.

159
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:03,924
You should come and check out
this class with me.

160
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:07,018
You gotta audition to get in.
But since you're legacy...

161
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,892
You think I need an acting class?

162
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:12,057
You don't need an acting class, Vince.
Let's go get you a car.

163
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,759
What did Ari say?

164
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,838
Good stuff. I got a box of scripts to read.

165
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:20,106
- So it's all good?
- Yeah, it's all good.

166
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,371
- Let's go get you a Benz.
- Fuck the fucking Mercedes, Vince.

167
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:27,175
What are you, a soccer mom?
You want a car? I know what to get you.

168
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,086
Vincent Chase!

169
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:40,292
My daughter's a huge fan.

170
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:43,353
- What are we looking at today?
- The Phantom.

171
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,626
Excellent choice.

172
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:49,901
This is the ultimate luxury motorcar,
gentlemen.

173
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,333
Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z.

174
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,932
Queen Latifah purchased one
for her manager.

175
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,546
When you drive a Rolls-Royce,
you are making a statement.

176
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,008
And how expensive is this statement?

177
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,778
- $320,000.
- Not bad.

178
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:08,081
But if you sign a picture for my daughter,
I'll give it to you for $319,000.

179
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,851
How much if he bangs his daughter?

180
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,952
You don't buy this car, Vince. You lease it.

181
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,930
That's how all the broke jerk-offs
in this town drive 911s.

182
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,558
We have excellent terms on our lease.

183
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:21,693
What do you think, E?

184
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,135
I think it costs more than
the houses we grew up in.

185
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,140
A fucking Subaru costs more
than the houses we grew up in.

186
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,402
I don't know.

187
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:31,507
- Think I should buy this car?
- Come on, are you serious?

188
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:35,640
- You're gonna spend $320,000 on a car?
- So you don't think I should do it.

189
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,644
I didn't say you shouldn't do it.

190
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,589
- Lf you wanna do it, do it.
- So I'm gonna do it.

191
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,215
Do it, Vince. Do it, baby.

192
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,520
Do it, Vince.

193
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,824
Fuck it, do it.

194
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:52,990
What did you say
your daughter's name was again, Randy?

195
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,643
Yo, this car makes driving fun.

196
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,240
I might even get my license.

197
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:12,320
We should've had
one of these in high school.

198
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,480
Why? You think that
would've gotten you laid?

199
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,454
More than my yellow Fiero did.

200
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,959
Shit. I got crazy pussy in high school.
And I was driving a moped.

201
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:22,461
Roll down the windows.
We're stinking this beast up.

202
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:25,158
No, it's cool. I hate the smell of a new car.

203
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,672
Yo, check this out.

204
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,804
Nice car!

205
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,377
- Thanks.
- What do you do?

206
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:39,879
Me? I'm a lottery winner, sweetheart.
Powerball.

207
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,239
You girls wanna party?

208
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,409
You look familiar. How do I know you?

209
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,510
You watch Cinemax at 5:00 a. M?

210
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:49,152
Call two friends. Follow us.

211
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:51,052
- All right.
- Not too close.

212
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,369
Hello?

213
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,907
Marv, how you doing?

214
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,878
I can't hear you.
I got water in my ears. Talk to E.

215
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:14,675
It's Marvin.

216
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:15,909
Hey, Marvin.

217
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,749
Yeah. I guess so.

218
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,181
Okay. See you then. Bye.

219
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,091
He wants us to come up to his office.

220
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:29,095
No, I'm not gonna listen to him
tell me how to spend my money.

221
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,688
He's your business manager.
That's what you pay him for.

222
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,860
So you go listen to him.
That's what I'm paying you for.

223
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,336
So, what? Is he, like, your boss?

224
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:41,397
- Yeah. Something like that.
- E.'s got a boss!

225
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,468
And who's your boss, Turtle?

226
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,911
What'd you say? I can't hear you, dick.

227
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:50,548
Thank God I'm self-employed.

228
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:54,878
He must have been out of his mind
buying a $300,000 Rolls-Royce!

229
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,720
- He didn't buy it, Marvin. He leased it.
- That's even worse.

230
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:00,420
Because if he bought it,
in a pinch, we could sell it.

231
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,622
You're supposed to be
the one with some smarts.

232
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,325
- What's the matter with you?
- What am I supposed to do?

233
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:08,664
He wanted the car, he got it.
I can't tell him how to spend his money.

234
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,366
But you got enough balls to tell him
to pass on a $4 million fucking movie offer.

235
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,676
The script sucked, Marvin.

236
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,574
He wants artistic integrity?

237
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,703
Then, let him drive around in a Prius.

238
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:21,213
This isn't my fault. All right?

239
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:24,615
Ari's got my head fucked up.
He told me to get his mind off the review.

240
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,448
You guys are out of control.

241
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,956
$2,500 a month his brother spends
on vitamin supplements.

242
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:34,052
Nobody could take that many supplements
and still fucking live.

243
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,521
Turtle's got a $1,500 a month cell phone bill.

244
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:41,363
You can get an unlimited plan for $200.
Get him an unlimited plan!

245
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:42,834
I'll get him free weekends.

246
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:46,465
Don't be a wise guy.
Come on, get the fuck out of here. I'm busy.

247
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,134
And, Eric...

248
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,501
don't forget to get your parking validated.

249
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,479
Hey, asshole! Not so close to the Rolls.

250
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,146
All right. Relax, guy.

251
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:06,358
- I say we move to the 'Bu.
- The what?

252
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:10,261
- Malibu, baby. We'll learn to surf.
- I don't care where we move. Find a place...

253
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,526
where this clown
doesn't have to use my bathroom.

254
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:13,601
What's the problem?

255
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:16,296
The problem is you're filthy,
and you use all my products.

256
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:17,462
What products?

257
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:20,769
I found my Kiehl's open
next to one of your beat-off mags.

258
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:24,168
- So?
- So, A: Stop using my bathroom.

259
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,771
And B: Why do gotta use
$47 lotion to whack off with?

260
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,940
I got sensitive skin.

261
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:32,519
- What's up, fellows?
- We're looking at houses.

262
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,646
Houses?
What's wrong with the one we've got?

263
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,418
Car's too nice for our place.
We got to step it up a level.

264
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,958
Check out this one.

265
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:43,361
- It's $10 million.
- Yeah. But it's nice.

266
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:47,767
This is L.A. This year, it's worth $10 million,
next year, $20 million.

267
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:49,632
But it's this year, and it's $10 million.

268
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:52,832
Hack's got a mortgage broker, E.
Says money's real cheap now.

269
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,501
He's talking out of his ass.
Do you know what that means?

270
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,408
Not really.
But if Hack said it, it must be good.

271
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:00,977
Guess who?

272
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,419
Edward James Olmos.

273
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,387
Right! You didn't even say his name right.

274
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,621
- How are you?
- How you doing?

275
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:14,286
- Good. Nice to see you. Hey, boys.
- What's going on?

276
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,296
- Hi, Jessica.
- Nice to see you.

277
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,600
<i>I read the thing in the Variety.</i>

278
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,566
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:24,198
No. The guy was such an asshole.

280
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:25,636
- You were great.
- Really?

281
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,334
Yeah. You were fantastic. Wasn't he great?

282
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:31,173
- You were great.
- Thank you.

283
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,577
So what are you doing tonight?

284
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,741
Tonight? I don't know.
What do you have in mind?

285
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,819
I'm having a party for my friend, Justine.
She's going on tour.

286
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,411
Yeah, we saw her today.
Justine Chapin, right?

287
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,253
- Yeah.
- She's cute. What's her deal?

288
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:46,951
Not a chance. She's saving herself.

289
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:48,926
Come on. Is that really true?

290
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,558
Yeah. For this album, at least.
So, are you guys coming?

291
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:54,828
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

292
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:55,994
We'll be there.

293
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,072
I'll see you later. Glad I ran into you.

294
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:01,870
- Nice to see you. See you tonight.
- Bye.

295
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,707
Jessica Alba.

296
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,374
That's gonna be off the hook.

297
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,083
What about your class, Drama?

298
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:08,344
What about your class, Drama?

299
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:13,115
Fuck that class.
They ain't paying me to be there, bro.

300
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:17,389
You gotta pop the pop star's cherry.
It'd be great press.

301
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:21,189
- No. Virgins are too much responsibility.
- I'll do it. I could use the press.

302
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:24,094
- She's not a virgin.
- She is. I can tell by the way she sings.

303
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,167
That's right. Virgins do know virgins.

304
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,997
Look who's talking,
Mr. Beg-for-pussy-on-prom-night.

305
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:30,628
I was begging my girlfriend, Turtle.

306
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,833
Not a $40 hooker
who declined your mother's credit card.

307
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:35,767
Claudia, remember her?

308
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,085
So, who was your first, Drama?

309
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:49,015
Tracy Richter. It was a mess.

310
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:52,457
I always hoped I'd get to re-fuck her.
You know, do it right.

311
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,461
- How about you, Vince? Who was your first?
- I don't know.

312
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:56,791
You don't know?

313
00:16:56,898 --> 00:17:00,425
- Fuck that. Everybody remembers their first.
- Yeah? Well, I don't.

314
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:04,699
I remember your first. It was Cindy Davis,
behind the arcade at Nathan's.

315
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:08,464
- Yeah, you may be right.
- "Yeah, you may be right." Bullshit.

316
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,544
I don't believe for a second
you don't remember your first.

317
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,704
Like I don't believe
Justine Chapin's a virgin.

318
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,783
What kind of virgin has a snake tat
pointing down to her box?

319
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,749
You're both hiding something.

320
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,079
That's $253.

321
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:22,921
- $253. Nice bottle of wine.
- It's for Jessica Alba, E.

322
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,924
You can't give her Boone's Farm.

323
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,755
You want some of this?

324
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,292
Save that signature, baby.

325
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:56,747
Hey, guys!

326
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,655
- Jessica!
- How are you?

327
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:00,961
Hello, how are you?

328
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:04,225
Bar's here, bar's over there,
girls are everywhere...

329
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,995
bathroom's back there,
and I need to steal your friend for a second.

330
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,433
All right. See you later.

331
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,972
We're going to the bar, let's go to the bar.

332
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:15,838
Yeah. Save me a drink.
I'm heading to Silicon Valley.

333
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,935
- What are you drinking?
- Whiskey.

334
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,447
You girls seen the new Rolls?

335
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:26,615
- It's really nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

336
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:29,552
I'm gonna leave you two.

337
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:46,838
There she is. Snowcone, how are you?

338
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,333
- My dark angel! Hello, honey.
- Hey, Ari.

339
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,936
- Unbelievable party.
- Thanks.

340
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,980
Jason, right?
How you doing? Nice to see you.

341
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,573
I think that you could be doing a lot more.

342
00:18:56,684 --> 00:19:00,814
- No, I do. I think...
- You're really talking shop right now.

343
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,322
- I am talking shop.
- At my house.

344
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:05,517
- Indeed...
- At my party.

345
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,618
- Yes, yes.
- My agent isn't here.

346
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,096
I know. I slashed her tires. She's
on her hands and knees on Mulholland.

347
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:14,293
She won't make it, because you want
a statue. You deserve a statue.

348
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,426
Can you believe this guy?

349
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,629
You deserve it.
Because your natural energy...

350
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,400
the way you are hasn't been seen yet.

351
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:22,476
Someone needs to step up
and utilize you for the way you are.

352
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:26,673
You're a self-empowered, interesting woman
and you need to take it. Not an MTV award.

353
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:31,115
But a real one. And I want to be there.
"May I have the envelope?" Let me be there.

354
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:34,120
- Can I think about it?
- Thinking is bad for your complexion.

355
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:36,918
You shine,
I'll think and make it happen, okay?

356
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:39,357
Give me three months
to get you out of a leotard.

357
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,553
Warm up those vocal cords, Drama.

358
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:44,593
- They got karaoke here tonight.
- Yeah, I know.

359
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:47,964
Should I go with Sinatra
or something a little more poppy?

360
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,170
Yo, Drama. What are you doing here?

361
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,399
Me? Why aren't you in class?

362
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,373
'Cause I knew you'd fuck me, you prick!

363
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,138
Gender reversal exercise.
What are we, fags?

364
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,680
Yeah, I know. Come here. Meet my new girl.

365
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,382
Be right back, bro.

366
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,818
- What's up, Ari?
- You having a good time, man?

367
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,551
Yeah? It's not all fun and fucking games.
Thanks, bro.

368
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,058
What are you talking about?

369
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:17,188
You told Marvin that I said that it was okay
that Vince buys a fucking Rolls.

370
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,697
- Did not.
- You did, you said it.

371
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,597
You fucking said it. You kidding me?

372
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,432
Don't ever fucking talk about me
behind my back again.

373
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:27,030
Otherwise, I'll have to fucking kill you.
I got ears everywhere.

374
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:42,517
No, I respect that. If that's what you want.

375
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:46,322
- It's not totally true.
- Which part?

376
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,523
I'm not really saving myself for marriage.

377
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,428
So what are you saving yourself for?

378
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm saving myself for someone special.

379
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:02,975
- Have you ever been anyone's first?
- No. And I don't plan to be.

380
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:07,914
I don't want to be anyone's first,
and I don't want to be anyone's last.

381
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,550
That's too bad.

382
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:23,130
Doors fly open by itself. Heated back seats,
front seats. Unbelievable.

383
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:42,776
All right. It was your cousin.

384
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:45,582
What was my cousin?

385
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,176
My first time.

386
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,789
You fucked my cousin, Debbie?

387
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,188
Not Debbie. Sheryl.

388
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:53,852
I fucked Debbie, too, but not till years later.

389
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:57,192
You're an asshole. You got no shame.

390
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:58,993
What? You got hot cousins.

391
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,630
They had a good time.

392
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,202
Come on. Look at you. You're miserable.

393
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:07,971
You know what?

394
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,102
Maybe Ari's right.
Maybe you should get a real manager.

395
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,937
It was one review, E.

396
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:14,412
It's not just the review.

397
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:17,279
A million people out there
have more experience than I do.

398
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:22,288
Fuck experience.
Come on, I trust you. You got instincts.

399
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,358
But you know, you're the reason
why I moved out here in the first place.

400
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:31,296
- What are you talking about?
- Third grade. I was trying out for basketball.

401
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,993
You said, "Douche bag,
you're too pretty for basketball.

402
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,229
"You know, go try the school play."

403
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,302
- Did I say that really?
- Yeah.

404
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:43,741
- I was just an asshole kid, I guess.
- And a lot taller, too.

405
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,038
Look.

406
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,384
Take a look. Look where we are.

407
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,013
Did you ever think we'd have this?

408
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,115
Man, enjoy it. Have fun.

409
00:22:58,426 --> 00:22:59,586
Worst comes to worst...

410
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:02,356
we'll go tear it up in Queens,
like we always have.

411
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:05,057
Fucking Turtle's out front,
christening the Rolls.

412
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,930
Great. A day old,
it's already gotta be detailed.

413
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,067
You know what?
We look like assholes in that thing anyway.

414
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,536
Get rid of it. Return it tomorrow, E.

415
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:16,439
You took a three-year lease.

416
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,474
You'll figure it out.

417
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,143
What a view!

418
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:26,075
We're at a party
with some of the hottest girls in the world...

419
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,949
and we're staring
at a bunch of fucking lights.

420
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:33,020
- Let's go find you a girl, E.
- Yeah.

421
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,689
What about me?

422
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,664
I don't wanna go back to Queens, Vince.

423
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:48,503
- Who the fuck's going back to Queens?
- Nobody's going back to Queens.

424
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:03,624
It's Ari.

425
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,927
Yeah?

426
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:12,693
All right. I'll tell him.

427
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,671
<i>New York Times says
you're the next Johnny Depp.</i>

428
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:17,262
<i>New York Times says
you're the next Johnny Depp.</i>

429
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,007
Cool.

430
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:22,304
You guys wanna go look at houses today?

431
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,241
Yeah, baby.

432
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:27,405
Let's get one with an outdoor pool, though.
I'm getting all pasty.

433
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:30,348
- Indoor pool's overrated.
- Hurry up with that bone, man.

434
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:31,577
It's coming.

435
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,063
