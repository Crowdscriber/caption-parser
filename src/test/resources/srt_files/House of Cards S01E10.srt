1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,445
[Walker] The whole reason we
do these meetings, Frank,

2
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:09,405
is so I can get
accurate information from you.

3
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:11,365
I always said
it was going to be close.

4
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:13,075
Then why did every article
I read yesterday

5
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,869
say the leadership was
confident the bill would pass?

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,538
- Do you know Janine Skorsky?

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,206
- She used to be the Herald's
White House correspondent.

8
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:20,707
I remember Janine.

9
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,418
She wrote
an article for Slugline

10
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,336
reporting
a verified vote count.

11
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,380
Once the media got ahold of
that, it went everywhere.

12
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,840
I don't know where she got that number.
Maybe she made it up.

13
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,801
It doesn't matter
if she made it up.

14
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,220
The democrats seem divided. The
leadership looks incompetent.

15
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,680
But compared the the budget
and our education act,

16
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,224
why, this was
a minor bill, sir.

17
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:39,684
That happened to be
in the national spotlight,

18
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,103
which is what you wanted.

19
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:42,563
I got the count wrong.

20
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:45,399
It rarely happens,
but it happens.

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,359
What worries me is that
the White House's influence

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,111
isn't translating
into support on the hill.

23
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:51,238
Linda's involvement
had no effect?

24
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,865
[Francis] I wouldn't say
that that's the case, sir.

25
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:56,494
Did you sense any push-back, any
fallout from the education battle?

26
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:58,537
Sir, the truth is
I wasn't there.

27
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:01,248
I had to make a trip
to California

28
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,292
to meet the Provost of Stanford
for my son.

29
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:04,793
I told you about it last week.

30
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:07,004
It was my decision, sir.
I made a judgment call

31
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:09,006
that we could pass the bill
without her help.

32
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,008
But, look,
tight votes like this,

33
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,510
you can analyze them to death,

34
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,386
but at the end of the day,
we came up short.

35
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:17,306
That's my fault, no one else's.
Certainly not Linda's.

36
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,809
I shouldn't have gone.
The meeting didn't even work.

37
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,769
I thought you said
they were reconsidering.

38
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,396
No. I got an e-mail
this morning.

39
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:26,773
They decided not to overturn
the admissions decision.

40
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,567
Oh, Christ. I'm sorry, Linda.

41
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:29,943
Not a great day so far.

42
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:32,655
But I appreciate your covering
for me in there.

43
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:39,911
There may be a way to turn Linda's
bad luck into my good fortune.

44
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:42,956
But first I must deal
with treason within the ranks...

45
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:45,584
the two renegades
who voted against the bill.

46
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,670
I have zero tolerance
for betrayal,

47
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,881
which they will soon
indelibly learn.

48

Sync and correction by GeirDM
www.addic7ed.com

49
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,853
I know why you lost the vote.

50
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,188
[Chuckles]

51
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,065
Somebody got to Vanderburgh
and Abrams.

52
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,193
Remy Danton.

53
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,362
- Your wife.
- [Chuckles]

54
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,822
I've got contacts
on both their staffs.

55
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,116
There was a meeting
between the three of them.

56
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:47,993
I know. I arranged it.

57
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,372
- She told them to vote no.
- No, not true.

58
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:55,334
Sources on two different staffs
saying the exact same thing?

59
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,668
That makes no sense.

60
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,753
I'm not telling you
what makes sense,

61
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,714
I'm telling you facts.

62
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:05,593
This is a juicy story, Francis.

63
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,262
Carly will love it.

64
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:09,931
The majority whip's wife
stabs him in the back.

65
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,225
Be careful, Zoe.

66
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:14,811
I'm feeding you.
Now you have to feed me.

67
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,647
So give me something better.

68
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,861
[Francis] Are you going
to answer my question?

69
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,697
Did she or didn't she?

70
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,117
Tell me now, or so help me God,

71
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,744
I will make it
my mission in life

72
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,662
to not only
destroy your careers,

73
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,457
but to obliterate all hope
and happiness

74
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,419
that you manage to cling to.

75
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,670
- She said it would be okay...
- To backstab me?

76
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,506
To do what we thought
was right.

77
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:44,508
So she did tell you to vote no.

78
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,053
She said it wouldn't be the end
of the world if the bill failed.

79
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,431
Those were her exact words.

80
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:56,853
You discuss this with no one.
Is that understood?

81
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:01,900
Do you blame yourself
for not being

82
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,318
in Washington to
secure the votes?

83
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,487
A bill this size is a team effort.
There are a lot of sponsors.

84
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,760
- But you were the chief
sponsor and the bill manager.

85
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,031
- That's true.

86
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:10,200
So shouldn't you
have been in Washington?

87
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,577
I'm running for Governor.
I have a

88
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,953
commitment to the
people of my state.

89
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,580
Are you aware
that the swofford campaign

90
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,498
is putting out a new
commercial today that says,

91
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:19,167
quote, "if Peter Russo can't
follow through in congress",

92
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,586
can he follow through
with sobriety?"

93
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,087
That's all.
Thank you very much.

94
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,047
- Do you want to comment?
- Thanks, guys.

95
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:26,508
- Congressman!
- [Chattering]

96
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,177
All I said was what you always
say... to vote their conscience.

97
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,179
You encouraged them to defy me.

98
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,889
I met with them.
That's what you asked me...

99
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,766
no, that is not what you did.

100
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,978
I specifically told you I needed
them to vote yes on this bill.

101
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,021
There was no room
for interpretation.

102
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,483
It's a deliberate lie, so don't
try to sugarcoat it, Claire.

103
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:46,069
I needed Remy's help.
You wouldn't offer any.

104
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,030
Oh, wait.

105
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,116
You did this for Remy?

106
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,140
No. For myself. To get my
shipment out of Sudan.

107
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,162
He provided assistance.

108
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:57,498
In exchange
for defeating the bill.

109
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,958
No. In exchange
for not helping it succeed.

110
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,295
Which is the same goddamn thing.
Do you realize you have endangered

111
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,297
everything that we have
been working toward?

112
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,090
There was a timetable here,
Claire.

113
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,675
We needed strong momentum
right up until the last minute.

114
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,429
I can't operate based on plans
you haven't shared with me.

115
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,680
Then you should've
asked me first.

116
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,350
No, I'm not going to
ask for your blessing

117
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:18,018
on every decision
I make, Francis.

118
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,020
We make decisions together.

119
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,981
Yeah, well, it hasn't felt like that.
Not for the past six months.

120
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,568
I don't feel as though
I'm standing beside you.

121
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,700
Other people know, Claire.

122
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:39,414
This could become
a story about us.

123
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,458
- And that's something
you do not recover from.

124
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,500
- Who?

125
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,689
- That's something that
follows you for life.

126
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,877
- Who knows?

127
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,754
Zoe.

128
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:51,510
I thought you said
she could be trusted.

129
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,180
- What about our trust?
- You can't control her, can you, Francis?

130
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,516
She wouldn't have been a problem
if you hadn't lied.

131
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,684
No, she wouldn't
have been a problem

132
00:06:58,685 --> 00:06:59,851
if you hadn't
dropped your pants.

133
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,979
And you come in here,
to my office, and berate me

134
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,065
when you're the one
who's exposed us?

135
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,900
Don't you try
to turn this around on me.

136
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,611
I fired half of my staff for us.

137
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,655
I have turned down
donations for us.

138
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,281
I drafted Peter's bill for us.

139
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:16,660
I diverted time and energy
away from my goals for us.

140
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,620
Okay, I don't wanna
have to say this,

141
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,788
but maybe you need to hear it.

142
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:26,086
C.W.I. Is important, yes,

143
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:30,048
but it doesn't come close to what
we are trying to accomplish.

144
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,925
You must see that!

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,348
I'm just being honest.

146
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,392
Then be honest about
how you've been using me

147
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,060
just like you use
everybody else.

148
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,730
That was never part
of the bargain.

149
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,448
Is it the hot flashes?

150
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,331
[Quietly] Get out.

151
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,710
Get out.

152
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,715
[Clears throat]

153
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,552
I'll see you back at the house.

154
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,812
[Phone chiming]

155
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,773
I'm on my way to the office.

156
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,150
- Let me call you when I get there.
- No, no. We need to talk now.

157

- Excuse me?
- I promised my people jobs.

You promised me
you could get this bill passed.

- [Smoothing out sheet]
- Yes, it was.

637
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,605
Can you hand me that pillow?

638
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:32,692
So, why do you need
to get out of your apartment?

639
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:37,948
It just felt small.

640
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:41,034
Well, it can't
be smaller than my place.

641
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,703
No. I don't mean size.
I mean...

642
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,580
I felt trapped.

643
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:49,209
Like I was in a place
that I didn't actually live.

644
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:53,297
Does that make any sense?

645
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:57,009
I guess.

646
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:05,350
Okay.

647
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:08,687
There you go.

648
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:11,439
Um, anytime
you need to get up or...

649
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,151
um, I'll just set an alarm
on my phone.

650
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,444
All right.
Well, feel free to watch TV.

651
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:19,198
I can sleep through anything.

Hey, thank you, Lucas.

Hey, that's the last of it.

656
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:49,936
Better make it count, then.

00:40:00,446 --> 00:40:02,448
- Drink up.
- Mm.

Mmm.

660
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:15,170
Do I look familiar to you?

661
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,047
Familiar?

662
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,465
No.

663
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:23,136
- My face? My body?
- No.

664
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,473
How about my voice?

665
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:31,311
Have we...

666
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,688
No.

667
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:35,295
No. I was just
wondering if you had a

668
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:36,900
thing for brunettes
with blue eyes.

669

- Hey, where you going? Come back here.
- I wanna see you better.

Shit. The sun's up?

672
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:48,661
Has been for a while.

- Oh, fuck. What time is it?
- 7:15.

674
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:55,501
Fuck. I have an interview
in half an hour.

675
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:57,879
- Skip it.
- I can't. I gotta do it.

- Hello?
- [Stamper] I'm at your building.

683
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,876
The front desk keeps calling
up, but there's no answer.

684
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:40,713
- I'm not there.
- Then I'll come to you. Where are you?

685
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:43,925
I'm... I'm at
the Park Highmore hotel.

686
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,969
Are you okay? You sound drunk.

687
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,139
It was, uh... yeah. Yeah.
I'm... I'm all right.

688
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,017
- You have the interview.
- I know!

689
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:53,893
Have you been drinking, Peter?

690
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:57,730
Uh, what? No. Um, I just decided
to spend the night here.

691
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:00,692
What room are you in?

692
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:03,111
11, uh... 1121.

693
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:05,905
Stay there.
I'm coming right now.

694
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:06,758
Jesus, Peter. What happened?
You're drunk.

695
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:09,135
- I'm fine.
- I can smell it on you.

696
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:11,221
Okay, I had a drink or two.

697
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,306
It was nothing crazy.

698
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:19,438
We can't do this interview.

699
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:21,565
I'm sober. I can handle it.

700
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,567
You're slurring your words.

701
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,651
I'm good.

702
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:29,697
I think we should cancel.

703
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:31,950
I'm gonna do the interview.

704
00:43:31,951 --> 00:43:34,911
Just give me the talking points.

00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,053

Sorry. I...

It's all right.

708
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,227
The couch had a spring in it
or something, and my back...

709
00:43:59,228 --> 00:44:01,687
no.

710
00:44:01,688 --> 00:44:04,149
It's all right.

And?

716
00:44:35,348 --> 00:44:38,308
- She's in New York.
- What hotel?

717
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,269
Not a hotel, sir.

718
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,981
So she's not alone.

No, sir.

Yes, sir.

722
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,409
I have more information.

723
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,911
I don't need to know.

It's good to be here, Jim.

- [Man] It's mark.
- Sorry. Right. Mark.

730
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,183
That's okay, Congressman.
It happens all

731
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,184
the time this early
in the morning.

732
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,562
So, Congressman,
the watershed act.

733
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:26,523
Yes. Uh, I'm ashamed of the...

734
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:30,068
well, I'm not ashamed.
That's not the right, um...

735
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:33,821
I'm disappointed, um,
because, you know,

736
00:45:33,822 --> 00:45:35,699
the water...

737
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,577
It's, um... it's... actually,
what I'd like to discuss is...

738
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:41,371
we all know that natural gas...

739
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:45,458
that it's... it's a growing...
uh, in our state...

740
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,793
it's a... it's a big part
of, um...

741
00:45:47,794 --> 00:45:50,880
economically,
the way things are going.

742
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,551
And I'd like to say...
to announce...

743
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:58,263
in terms of, um... [Stammering]

744
00:45:58,264 --> 00:46:00,390
Are you familiar
with drilling regulations...

745
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,475
permitted use
versus conditional use?

746
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:04,936
[Mark] Are we still talking
about the watershed?

747
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:06,688
[Peter]
No. Drilling. Natural gas.

748
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:09,441
[Mark] Sir, you supported
increased regulation.

749
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:11,401
[Peter] Well, no. I... i...

750
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,570
it may have looked that way,
but, uh,

751
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:15,947
in fact, to be clear,
I'm for less...

752
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:19,534
Regulation.

753
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:22,912
Yes, sir. In the watershed bill,
the language clearly stated...

754
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,497
it didn't pass.

755
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:27,250
Well, right.
That's what I'm asking about.

756
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,420
- What about it?
- Why it didn't pass.

757
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,671
I just said.

758
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:34,549
No, sir. I don't think you did.

759
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:38,219
It just didn't.

760
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,845
Sir, three days ago,
you predicted...

761
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:41,556
I'm talking about
fucking natural gas.

762
00:46:41,557 --> 00:46:43,433
I'm sorry.

763
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,560
[Mark] Congressman, I have
to ask you a question,

764
00:46:45,561 --> 00:46:47,479
and it may come across
as indelicate,

765
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,314
but are you drunk right now?

766
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:52,442
[Peter] What? No. No.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

767
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:54,527
I'm just... I'm really tired,
you know?

768
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:57,405
I've been on the campaign trail
for a few weeks now,

769
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:59,115
and...

770
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,411
- [Mark] Congressman?
- [Dial tone]

771

[Buzzes]

773
00:47:15,923 --> 00:47:17,550
It's my fault.

774
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:19,678
I shouldn't have let you.

775
00:47:20,553 --> 00:47:22,555
I'm fucked.

776
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,808
Okay. Listen. We sober you up.

777
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:28,394
We'll make some kind of
announcement as soon as possible.

778
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:31,939
There's nothing I can say.

779
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,066
We'll figure this out.

780
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,360
Come on.

781
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:37,445
You're gonna take a shower.

782
00:47:37,446 --> 00:47:39,489
Come on.

783
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:45,286
There you go. Come on.

784

[Vasquez on phone]
How bad is it?

785
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:58,633
It all depends on whether it gets
picked up by the mainstream press.

786
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:01,344
- Well, shall I fill in the president?
- No. Hold off on that.

787
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,159
I need to speak to Peter,
coordinate with his campaign.

788
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,972
You'll be the first call I make.

789
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:07,642
Frank, before you go,
I got an e-mail this morning.

790
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:09,185
Stanford reversed
their decision.

791
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,729
That's wonderful.

The Provo said Gillian Cole
reached out to him.

793
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,108
I googled her.
She works for Claire.

794
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:18,902
- Thank you.
- No reason to thank me.

795
00:48:18,903 --> 00:48:22,073
Ruben was just ecstatic. I don't
know how I'm gonna repay you.

00:48:22,074 --> 00:48:24,283
The fact that your son is happy
is more than enough.

797
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:26,994
- You'll keep me posted on Peter?
- You bet.

798
00:48:26,995 --> 00:48:28,454
- Okay.

[Line ringing]

801
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:35,670
Hey, boss.

802
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:37,963
- Are you still with him?
- Yeah.

803
00:48:37,964 --> 00:48:40,383
- He's taking a shower.
- How're we looking?

It's already on
the New York times web site.

806
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:47,056
The kid is done.

807
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,434
Have Nancy set up a meeting
with the Vice President.

808
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:51,977
- Today if possible.
- Will do.

809
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:54,230
And keep an eye on Peter.
He's done his duty.

810
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,274
- Let's get him back on his feet.
- You got it.

- And now Jim Matthews comes to the fore,

812
00:48:59,194 --> 00:49:01,028
though he doesn't know it yet.

813
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:03,698
He will find solace
in his beloved Pennsylvania,

814
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:07,285
though Peter Russo
will find solace nowhere.

815
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:10,580
It only takes ten seconds
to crush a man's ambitions.

816
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:13,625
I need to take care
that I protect mine.

818
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:25,804
Peter.

819
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,974
Peter!

820
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,396
Peter?

821
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:37,106
Hey!

822
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:37,907
Peter?
