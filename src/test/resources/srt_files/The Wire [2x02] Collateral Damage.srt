00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Sync'd by Mothman

1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,601
Thirteen bodies, all female...

2
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,001
eleven White, two Asian-looking.

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:19,201
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.

4
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:21,001
From Eastern Europe probably.

5
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,302
So this is, what, an accident?

6
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:26,802
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,201
So, yeah, accidental probably.

8
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,702
But that's his call, right?

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,302
-Doctor.
-Frazier.

10
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,001
How're we doing here?

11
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,801
-How are we doing?
-I mean, what are we doing?

12
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,302
What's the plan with all this?

13
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,602
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?

14
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,602
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,402
You got 13 for the price of one.

16
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:57,901
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.

17
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,502
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.

18
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:02,801
What identification?

19
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:05,702
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.

20
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:09,002
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...

21
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:12,602
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.

22
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,402
Who's the investigating agency?

23
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:23,902
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean lmmigration.

24
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,903
-But they're dead, so they're cargo.
-Cargo, but no contraband.

25
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,302
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.

26
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:31,503
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?

27
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:33,502
-Yeah.
-That's a state thing.

28
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:35,402
We'll eat it.

29
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:39,703
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?

30
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,802
Good enough for me, brother.

31
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,002
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.

32
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:48,003
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?

33
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,202
No crime, no investigation.

34
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:54,403
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.

35
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:59,502
And then there was one.

36
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,905
-You don't have to do this.
-No?

37
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,205
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.

38
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,506
You called him a Greek asshole?

39
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,706
You think we wanted this?

40
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:35,206
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.

41
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:39,906
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.

42
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:43,606
-This was a mistake.
-A mistake?

43
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:45,906
They fucking died in that can...

44
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:49,206
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.

45
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:50,706
You know nothing.

46
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:55,006
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?

47
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:58,206
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.

48
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:01,906
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...

49
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,706
you know, no Customs.

50
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:06,405
-He did not come off the boat.
-Why the fuck not?

51
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,006
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.

52
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:12,706
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?

53
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,006
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!

54
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,906
I understand how you feel...

55
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:20,106
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.

56
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,006
Nobody here wanted this.

57
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:25,206
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.

58
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:31,506
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.

59
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:34,106
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...

60
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,607
in the stacks like I did, right?

61
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:38,507
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?

62
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:41,006
Now you want to know what's in the cans?

63
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,106
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.

64
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:46,307
Guns, okay?

65
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:51,607
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...

66
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:54,607
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.

67
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,907
-Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
-Boom.

68
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:03,306
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.

69
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,107
But you don't ask...

70
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,007
because you don't want to know.

71
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,707
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...

72
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,108
in one of them cans, I need to know it.

73
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:26,407
Give him a couple of days, you know?

74
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:02,208
So Roberto been caught?

75
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:05,008
Yep, DEA got him in New York.

76
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,608
Now the shit makes some sense.

77
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,308
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.

78
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:13,708
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?

79
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,008
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.

80
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:20,908
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.

81
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,309
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.

82
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,108
-They saying you only got seven years, so--
-So I'm a motherfucking snitch?

83
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,509
They ain't saying they think it.

84
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,408
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.

85
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:35,709
-So we on the outside.
-Yep.

86
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,708
Look...

87
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,308
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.

88
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:44,009
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.

89
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,609
A friend in Atlanta...

90
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,209
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.

91
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:54,309
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.

92
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,909
You seen D'Angelo lately?

93
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,709
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?

94
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:06,209
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?

95
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,010
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.

96
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:14,309
-I don't know what's what anymore.
-Now, what's up with Donette?

97
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,410
I leave messages, she ain't call back.

98
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,109
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.

99
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,509
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.

100
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,709
She should be bringing his son by
every week.

101
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,609
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.

102
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,209
After all he has done for us...

103
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,710
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.

104
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,310
-Promises were made.
-I know.

105
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,109
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.

106
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,510
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.

107
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,810
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.

108
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,410
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.

109
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,910
Adjustments?

110
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,710
Brianna...

111
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,909
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?

112
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,110
-You got these off the boat?
-What, in winter?

113
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,010
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.

114
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,510
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?

115
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,010
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...

116
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,710
every now and again.

117
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,510
-Need some air in here.
-Leave it.

118
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,011
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.

119
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,810
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?

120
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,311
-You're the special kind of asshole.
-I'm special, all right.

121
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,910
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...

122
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,810
took that girl over the county line?

123
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,311
-Three hours.
-Three hours...

124
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,011
with your little harbor maps...

125
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:45,411
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.

126
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:49,310
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.

127
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,911
-That's collateral damage.
-Yeah.

128
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,711
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?

129
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,210
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.

130
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,612
-We need Omar, Jimmy.
-You see this.

131
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,311
-Thirteen girls?
-Yeah, I heard about it.

132
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,611
-Who caught it?
-It ain't ours.

133
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,111
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.

134
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:35,411
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?

135
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,511
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...

136
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:42,312
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?

137
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,812
It's time you show Bunk the love.

138
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:50,112
-You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
-Shit.

139
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,012
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...

140
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,812
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.

141
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,312
Can you fucking believe that?

142
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,612
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.

143
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:08,012
Who got to it?

144
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:11,212
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.

145
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:13,812
-What was it?
-Vodka, I think.

146
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,212
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...

147
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,912
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.

148
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:26,213
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.

149
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:29,713
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...

150
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,813
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.

151
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:36,712
-A couple of cases?
-Yeah, it was four.

152
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:43,312
-What the fuck is up with the police?
-What?

153
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:46,312
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.

154
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,313
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"

155
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:06,013
You got the tow bar set high.

156
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,713
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?

157
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,714
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.

158
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,913
Come on, pal, what the fuck?

159
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:20,214
-It ain't me, it's my boss.
-Who's your boss?

160
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:23,514
-Valchek, Southeast district.
-Stan Valchek?

161
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,713
The district commander, yeah.

162
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:29,013
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?

163
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:32,013
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...

164
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:35,013
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...

165
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:38,313
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.

166
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:41,414
-You work for a gaping asshole.
-More than one actually.

167
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:44,713
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.

168
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:49,314
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.

169
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:52,614
It's chain of command.

170
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,414
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?

171
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:08,214
-You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
-You talk when I say you can.

172
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,614
Who told you to decorate, nigger?

173
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:31,615
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?

174
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:35,015
-Man, I ain't done shit.
-Don't say that to me, motherfucker!

175
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,815
Pets, too?

176
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:43,714
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.

177
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:49,415
Clean this shit before lock-down.

178
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,515
That's four in a row, bitch!

179
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,415
Wait here, this won't take long.

180
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:15,415
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."

181
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:18,615
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.

182
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:22,215
-There ain't no union without it, brother.
-Your sweetheart's out there.

183
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:23,516
Who?

184
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,316
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.

185
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:38,915
-Kind of empty in here.
-Everyone's working.

186
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:42,315
-You getting the message?
-The message?

187
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:46,715
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...

188
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,016
you know that?

189
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:50,616
I took money from half a dozen
different people...

190
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:52,616
told them where it was gonna go.

191
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:56,116
-You tell Father Lewandowski?
-I was gonna surprise him.

192
00:14:56,216 --> 00:15:00,216
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?

193
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,716
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...

194
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:06,716
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.

195
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,016
-Good for you.
-No, good for you, Frank.

196
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:14,716
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.

197
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,217
What's right?

198
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:22,416
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...

199
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:25,417
Iike a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.

200
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,116
But that's not you, it's not your way.

201
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,916
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...

202
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,616
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.

203
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:36,317
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...

204
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,517
where none of the girls
would even look at you.

205
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:41,617
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...

206
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:44,917
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.

207
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:48,516
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.

208
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:56,616
Fuck you! And your window!

209
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:13,417
Where are you gonna be?

210
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:16,517
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.

211
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,817
-Give me an hour, yeah?
-Yeah.

212
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,817
-What the fuck is this?
-A knot.

213
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:29,017
Why don't you just do bunny ears?

214
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,417
So what else we got?

215
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:37,117
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.

216
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:40,817
-Here's a letter, though.
-A letter? What language?

217
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,917
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.

218
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:47,117
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.

219
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:51,018
Can't figure the name or the address...

220
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,717
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.

221
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:57,118
-Where's Magyar?
-What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?

222
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,218
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?

223
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,518
Detectives? They're at the bar already.

224
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:04,818
These yours?

225
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:08,818
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.

226
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:11,218
She found them, she writes on it.

227
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:15,118
-I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
-Beatrice Russell.

228
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:19,219
-You got any IDs yet?
-No visas or passports.

229
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,118
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.

230
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:27,518
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?

231
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:29,019
-Yeah.
-Why?

232
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,619
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.

233
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,118
There's no missing person report on file.

234
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:41,919
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.

235
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:47,418
-Mine was a murder.
-A murder, you're kidding me?

236
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:50,418
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.

237
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,119
I called the morgue this morning...

238
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,919
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.

239
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:56,519
Overseas, they think.

240
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,519
Overseas, they think.

241
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,919
-Is that your girl?
-Think so.

242
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,319
Looks better here.

243
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,819
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?

244
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,619
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.

245
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,619
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...

246
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:14,419
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?

247
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,620
-What went wrong?
-Air pipe up top got crushed.

248
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,719
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.

249
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,519
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.

250
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,219
You had cartons stacked in front...

251
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,520
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...

252
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,520
opens from the outside only.

253
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
-They're in here the whole trip?
-Probably not.

254
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,720
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...

255
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.

256
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,719
He let's them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.

257
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,520
They were clawing at the wall for air.

258
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,119
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.

259
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,120
-Where's the air pipe?
-That's the hole. Pipe's up top.

260
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,320
You get a lot of stowaways?

261
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,821
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.

262
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,721
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.

263
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,220
-Not so much from Europe?
-A bit more since 9l1 1, actually.

264
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,020
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...

265
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,420
Iike they used to. There you go.

266
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,320
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...

267
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,020
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...

268
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,520
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.

269
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,420
Where was this one?

270
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,221
-Look.
-What?

271
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,620
-That look right to you?
-What do you mean?

272
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,721
-You said you were with the Marine Unit?
-Yeah.

273
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:55,420
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?

274
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,821
Not a thing.

275
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:01,021
What do you want me to do?

276
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:05,521
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.

277
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,121
Switch the windows, maybe.

278
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:10,521
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?

279
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,421
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.

280
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:15,021
I thought you had suction.

281
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,721
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.

282
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:21,721
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.

283
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,821
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?

284
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,022
Now, that's a good question.

285
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:31,221
I mean, the whole l.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...

286
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,822
and there ain't 100 checkers.

287
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:36,121
They got the car ships coming in...

288
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:39,321
the roll-onlroll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.

289
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,621
-That's all they got?
-Pretty much.

290
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,622
Past six months,
l.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...

291
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:48,822
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.

292
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:51,422
They've been good
with the political contributions.

293
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:53,222
They're throwing around a lot of cash.

294
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:55,222
-How can they?
-You tell me.

295
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:59,522
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.

296
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:02,121
You know what I think?

297
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:05,422
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.

298
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:08,922
You're the cop, not me.

299
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,523
The Grainery?

300
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:21,922
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.

301
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,822
Yeah, I've seen worse.

302
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:37,023
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...

303
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,722
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.

304
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:43,122
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.

305
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,322
See?

306
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:48,423
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.

307
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:51,523
But yeah, from the look of it...

308
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:56,423
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.

309
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:03,822
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?

310
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:07,723
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.

311
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:10,423
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.

312
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:14,023
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.

313
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:17,323
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.

314
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,623
-They're pushing Shipley.
-See, that's racist.

315
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:25,123
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...

316
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:28,923
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.

317
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:31,224
You know what I'm gonna do?

318
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:34,124
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.

319
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,723
That'll bring the First District in line.

320
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,223
That's very kind.

321
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,224
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?

322
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:46,223
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.

323
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,923
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.

324
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:52,024
What for?

325
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:56,023
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.

326
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,324
-Port guys, longshoremen.
-I.B.S.?

327
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,924
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.

328
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:03,524
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.

329
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:06,024
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.

330
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:09,424
-Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
-No.

331
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:13,124
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.

332
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,624
-What's he to you?
-To me?

333
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:19,925
He's an asshole.

334
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:26,525
Six men for six weeks.

335
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,724
Rawls will pick them.

336
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:34,024
You ordered more than you ate.

337
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:40,324
It's cold out here.

338
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:47,325
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:56,925
You're right. You're always right.

340
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,625
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.

341
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:04,024
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.

342
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:06,725
In the basement.

343
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,925
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.

344
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,325
Burrell won't be there forever.

345
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:18,526
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.

346
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,925
But you've got the law degree.

347
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:25,425
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.

348
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:27,225
You've got options.

349
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:31,326
-Just because they don't--
-You're right.

350
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,425
I'll put in my papers.

351
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,026
-Who wants breakfast?
-Christ, it's about time.

352
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:00,626
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.

353
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:04,926
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.

354
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:08,826
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.

355
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,726
-Who got them?
-New Charles works for Mutt.

356
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,326
Yo, Zig. You working today?

357
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:18,226
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.

358
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:21,026
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?

359
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:25,227
-Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
-That's right, I'm thirsty.

360
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,226
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.

361
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:46,227
-Nick.
-What's up?

362
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:48,727
Come here.

363
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:55,927
-I got a line on something.
-Oh, yeah?

364
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,827
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?

365
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:03,327
-He's gonna stake me to a package.
-A package?

366
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:08,127
Dope, Nicky, dope.

367
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:11,427
I got work today, Zig.

368
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:15,327
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?

369
00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:19,227
-So why the fuck you coming to me?
-I want you to come in on it with me.

370
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,027
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.

371
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:25,028
We turn it around, we both get paid.

372
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:27,427
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.

373
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,427
-Fuck that shit, Zig.
-Time to work!

374
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:34,127
-Nicky, come on, man.
-Can I ride with you?

375
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,828
Will you think about it?

376
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:43,028
Dolores, can I get another shot?

377
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,028
-What's up?
-DWI checkpoint.

378
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:15,528
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.

379
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:21,028
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.

380
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:24,928
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

381
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:33,928
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.

382
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:38,229
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.

383
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,929
-That's not in dispute here.
-Good.

384
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,328
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.

385
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,729
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.

386
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:49,129
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.

387
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:52,929
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...

388
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:55,329
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...

389
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:58,429
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.

390
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:01,029
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...

391
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,928
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?

392
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,429
-39.4%.
-Bill, like I told you--

393
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:10,930
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?

394
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:17,029
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.

395
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,430
The man is a god.

396
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,630
Big chief.

397
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,131
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?

398
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,130
Yeah. Come on in, man.

399
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,630
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.

400
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,330
-No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
-What?

401
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,131
You crazy, this is good shit, man.

402
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:42,330
-Better get in this.
-No.

403
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,030
Look, man...

404
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:50,831
if he tearing your room down, man...

405
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:52,931
we keep bringing more stuff in.

406
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:56,331
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?

407
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:58,330
He fucked with my fish though, I don't....

408
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,531
He ain't have to go there, man.

409
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:04,231
-What's up with this motherfucker?
-You remember Ladontay?

410
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,431
Burner from over the Poe Homes?

411
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:09,031
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?

412
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:10,731
We did that?

413
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:13,731
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.

414
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:17,331
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.

415
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:20,631
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.

416
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:23,932
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.

417
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,431
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.

418
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:29,731
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?

419
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:32,931
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?

420
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,331
-What's his name again?
-Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.

421
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:39,932
I seen him around.

422
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:42,832
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.

423
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,232
You got the guards bringing your meals in.

424
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:48,532
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...

425
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:51,832
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.

426
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:54,232
Don't fret. All right?

427
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:58,032
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.

428
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:00,732
The city won't take it?

429
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:04,032
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.

430
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:06,032
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.

431
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:08,332
Case needs real murder police.

432
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:11,232
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?

433
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:13,332
Absolutely. What can you give me?

434
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:18,132
-This is about fucking over your boss?
-If they don't eat the cases, then you will.

435
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,132
What do you need?

436
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,932
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?

437
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:28,432
13 by 7 by 7.

438
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:33,633
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...

439
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:40,533
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...

440
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,833
per victim.

441
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:45,533
-He's a doctor?
-A State Bureau of Mines.

442
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,833
-Minds?
-Mines.

443
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:05,133
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?

444
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:06,833
-Barksdale, right?
-Yeah.

445
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,133
-Listen, I want to know if you can help me--
-No.

446
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:13,833
-Pardon me?
-I said, no, motherfucker.

447
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:19,534
Off the steps.

448
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:47,034
What the fuck are you up to now?

449
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:57,034
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.

450
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,633
This is bullshit.

451
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,134
Those computations were checked...

452
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,434
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.

453
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:10,534
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.

454
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:11,934
Yeah, so you say.

455
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:15,034
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.

456
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:17,834
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...

457
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:20,534
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...

458
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,835
in American law enforcement.

459
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:26,334
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.

460
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:30,334
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...

461
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:32,034
then they were murdered on board ship.

462
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,735
That means Baltimore County...

463
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:36,134
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...

464
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:40,335
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.

465
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,535
This is not a city problem.

466
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:48,435
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.

467
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:49,635
No, Bill.

468
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,434
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...

469
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:55,535
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...

470
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,235
until 0600 hours, when it docked.

471
00:33:58,735 --> 00:34:03,035
-By the map, that's Baltimore city.
-And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...

472
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:06,235
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.

473
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:11,935
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.

474
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:00,236
Mikey.

475
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:01,836
-What's up?
-No.

476
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,436
No, what?

477
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,436
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.

478
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,736
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.

479
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:10,136
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.

480
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:12,636
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.

481
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,336
You got no money, go fuck yourself.

482
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:18,437
Mike, I thought we was friends.

483
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,136
Did you fuck up the last two packages?

484
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,236
-Sort of.
-Are you beat to shit?

485
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,236
-No.
-Take a walk, my friend.

486
00:35:57,137 --> 00:35:59,337
-What's up, man?
-What's up, playboy?

487
00:36:01,737 --> 00:36:04,737
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.

488
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,737
So we got that, you know.

489
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:09,337
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.

490
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:12,637
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.

491
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,637
-Who?
-Name is Tilghman.

492
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:18,338
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.

493
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:20,737
He can't let go of that shit, neither.

494
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:23,038
Tilghman? Right.

495
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:27,737
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.

496
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:29,438
I know, I heard.

497
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:36,537
You need to get with Dee's girl.

498
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:38,838
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.

499
00:36:38,938 --> 00:36:41,238
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.

500
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:42,638
All right.

501
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,637
How's Dee taking it?

502
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,837
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.

503
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:53,238
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.

504
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,638
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?

505
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:58,838
-No, nothing like that.
-You sure?

506
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:04,438
-He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
-Stringer, he's family, man.

507
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:07,338
All right? He's family.

508
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:13,338
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.

509
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:17,738
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.

510
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,738
That's it.

511
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:21,939
There it is.

512
00:37:23,638 --> 00:37:25,538
-One more, baby, come on.
-There you go.

513
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:27,638
-That's enough.
-No.

514
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,438
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...

515
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:33,938
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.

516
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:39,239
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.

517
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,538
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.

518
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,439
And Rawls!

519
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:53,739
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.

520
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,539
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.

521
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,739
-Careful, you're giving me an erection.
-Come on now.

522
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,339
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.

523
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:09,739
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.

524
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,839
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?

525
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:14,839
I'm riding the goddamn boat.

526
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:21,239
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.

527
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,139
All right.

528
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,840
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.

529
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.

530
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,740
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.

531
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:41,040
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.

532
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,740
And four months.

533
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Fuck it.

534
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,740
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.

535
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,540
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

536
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,939
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

537
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,340
Fuck.

538
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,240
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.

539
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,640
Go that way.

540
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,040
-Man, anybody still in there?
-They're keeping La-la.

541
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,640
He had an old warrant on him.

542
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,740
-For what?
-I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.

543
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,140
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.

544
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,140
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?

545
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,940
-Jerking us around on the way to work.
-It's a beef I got with a police boss.

546
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,040
-Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
-You gotta get that taken care of, man.

547
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,740
-I mean, this shit is out of hand.
-I'm gonna take care of it.

548
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,441
Yeah, y'all need a lift?

549
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:42,541
-I'll see you.
-All right, talk to you.

550
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,541
That runt wants a war, he's got one.

551
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:53,140
Not supposed to be talking anyway.

552
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,241
-Bunk, Lester.
-Yeah.

553
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:03,341
You two winners are on the Jane Does.

554
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,541
What? We're not up, Jay.

555
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:08,341
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.

556
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,141
Cole's gonna take the double.

557
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,541
-You two got pussy in a can.
-Jay, that ain't right.

558
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:15,842
You know what ain't right?

559
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:20,542
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.

560
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:31,241
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.

561
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:35,242
But I need those 14 cases to go black...

562
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,641
so I got my best people on it.

563
00:40:39,742 --> 00:40:40,741
Ray.

564
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:47,742
Lay it on them.

565
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:51,342
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.

566
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:56,842
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.

567
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:58,442
Motherfucker.

568
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,242
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?

569
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:14,042
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.

570
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:21,542
What's the most useless thing on a woman?

571
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:24,242
-What?
-A drunken lrishman.

572
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,042
But you're not really lrish, are you?

573
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:32,442
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?

574
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,442
You're green, all right.

575
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:38,443
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?

576
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,643
You're a child, McNulty.

577
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,743
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...

578
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,943
-I will call the cops.
-Why would you wanna do that?

579
00:41:58,643 --> 00:41:59,743
Jimmy.

580
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:07,843
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.

581
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:11,343
What the fuck am l, Jimmy?

582
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:13,943
We're good together.

583
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:23,043
Answer the question.

584
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,744
I've been pretty honest with you.

585
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:32,743
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?

586
00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:36,343
You know, what with the kids and all....

587
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:47,243
You got any aspirin?

588
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:51,644
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.

589
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:10,045
A real police department
would have an elevator.

590
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:16,645
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.

591
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:19,145
Lester Freamon.

592
00:44:19,546 --> 00:44:23,245
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.

593
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:24,645
What do we know?

594
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,846
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.

595
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:32,346
-I'm trying to get them to hold her.
-Anyone from your CID working this?

596
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:35,646
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...

597
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:37,945
and your colonel made everybody mad.

598
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:41,045
-All you get is me.
-Still on hold?

599
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:45,645
We can call this in from the road.

600
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:52,546
You're with City Homicide?

601
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:55,846
-You must know Jimmy McNulty.
-Yeah, he's dead to us.

602
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:19,547
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

603
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:20,846
I've seen worse.

604
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:24,347
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.

605
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:26,646
-Furnace work?
-It does.

606
00:45:26,746 --> 00:45:28,246
And the phone lines.

607
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:31,746
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...

608
00:45:31,846 --> 00:45:33,346
but somehow I got a feeling...

609
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:37,047
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.

610
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:38,947
Now, this here...

611
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:43,347
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.

612
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:48,047
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.

613
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:53,047
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...

614
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:55,947
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.

615
00:45:56,347 --> 00:45:59,647
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.

616
00:46:03,947 --> 00:46:06,247
So who signs the overtime slips?

617
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:15,147
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?

618
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:17,647
-This is where our taxes go.
-I do good work, don't l?

619
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:19,347
Let's get it on the fucking can now.

620
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:21,348
Horseface, you son of a bitch.

621
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:28,047
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.

622
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,947
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.

623
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:35,948
Finishing touch, boys.

624
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:53,848
Bon voyage.

625
00:47:01,848 --> 00:47:03,348
There she goes.

626
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:19,749
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.

627
00:47:41,548 --> 00:47:44,748
-Amir, why don't we sail?
-They're holding the ship.

628
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:46,849
-Who?
-Coast Guard, the Americans.

629
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:47,948
Why?

630
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,250
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.

631
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:21,350
Bring him up!

632
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:45,251
-Have a good day, Officer.
-Okay, I'll see you.

633
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:01,651
Now get up in there.

634
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,951
Last call before lock-down.

635
00:50:06,151 --> 00:50:08,051
Make it snappy now.

636
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:14,751
-How you like that?
-It's good, baby, it's beautiful.

637
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:17,551
Nice. Smooth.

638
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:19,051
Most def, man.

639
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:25,851
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.

640
00:50:28,352 --> 00:50:31,552
-What up, man?
-Yeah, he left that in here.

641
00:50:33,152 --> 00:50:34,352
It's his.

642
00:50:34,552 --> 00:50:38,152
-So how you doing?
-All right.

643
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:39,752
Yeah?

644
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,252
Me and you gonna need to talk.

645
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:25,353
-So who's on board?
-Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.

646
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:26,753
Eight are Sri Lankan.

647
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:30,752
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.

648
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:35,252
-Anybody speak English?
-What you're asking them about...

649
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:38,253
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.

650
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:43,552
-Where's your captain?
-At the Coast Guard office.

651
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:46,952
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.

652
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,452
You ain't gonna make it.

653
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:53,052
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.

654
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:57,453
-The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
-The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.

655
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:01,252
Don't try to play tough guy.

656
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,353
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

657
00:52:05,753 --> 00:52:07,053
Talk to me!

658
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:13,253
Tell me what I need to know.

659
00:52:17,953 --> 00:52:19,153
Get him up.

660
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:26,754
-Talk about the girls.
-No girls, nothing.

661
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:28,454
No English.

662
00:52:28,754 --> 00:52:31,754
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?

663
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:36,854
Why you run from ship?

664
00:52:40,054 --> 00:52:43,154
What the fuck that suppose to mean?

665
00:52:47,354 --> 00:52:48,754
They got him in Philadelphia.

666
00:52:48,854 --> 00:52:52,054
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.

667
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:56,054
-What is he?
-Sergei says he looks like an Arab.

668
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:09,554
He don't know nothing.

669
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,054
But you kept hitting him anyway.

670
00:53:13,654 --> 00:53:15,254
Get his clothes.

671
00:53:26,054 --> 00:53:28,555
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.

672
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:51,455
-Come on, let's talk.
-No English.

673
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:54,755
Tell me what happened to the girls?

674
00:53:58,555 --> 00:54:00,155
No speak.

675
00:54:00,355 --> 00:54:03,054
What then? What do you speak?

676
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:07,055
Come on, talk to me, friend.

677
00:54:25,155 --> 00:54:26,455
Turkish?

678
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:29,255
You got that little hook on your nose.

679
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:33,556
Don't worry, patrioti.

680
00:54:34,155 --> 00:54:38,556
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.

681
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:45,256
Sam.

682
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:49,356
-I don't know nothing about--
-You know.

683
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:54,156
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...

684
00:54:54,656 --> 00:54:56,956
you're done, I give you my word.

685
00:55:04,656 --> 00:55:07,456
We popped the can to let them take a bath.

686
00:55:08,156 --> 00:55:09,856
Get some fresh air.

687
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:16,556
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.

688
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,456
These girls, they looked pretty good.

689
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,356
-Katalavenis?
-Yes.

690
00:55:25,457 --> 00:55:27,457
The men had cash to spend.

691
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:32,057
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.

692
00:55:32,157 --> 00:55:33,657
What happened?

693
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,557
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.

694
00:55:38,757 --> 00:55:42,356
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.

695
00:55:43,457 --> 00:55:46,357
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.

696
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:51,357
-You kill one, then you kill them all.
-No, that was another man.

697
00:55:51,457 --> 00:55:53,357
Another man, what man?

698
00:55:54,257 --> 00:55:55,757
The one girl...

699
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:58,357
they saw, they knew.

700
00:56:08,057 --> 00:56:09,257
Relax.

701
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:12,357
I gave you my word.

702
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:37,957
-Watch your shoes.
-Goddamn Turko.

703
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:40,558
Bleeds like a lamb.

704
00:56:44,257 --> 00:56:47,457
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?

705
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,358
$4 million.

706
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:50,657
Gone.

707
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,758
Malaka.

708
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:56,658
Anyway, there will be other girls.

709
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:01,058
This one...

710
00:57:01,658 --> 00:57:03,158
no fingerprints.

711
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:07,058
-No face.
-That's not a problem.
