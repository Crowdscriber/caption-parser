(grunt, panting)

00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:34,202
(louder grunt, crackling)

5
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:51,152
BABY THOMAS: Daddy?

6
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,788
Daddy'll be there in a minute.

7
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,397
(children chattering indistinctly)

8
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:13,304
Spring is officially here.

9
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:14,972
The baby asparagus are out.

10
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,502
You know, I think
we should put in corn this year.

11
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,870
It'd be great for the kids.

12
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,604
They could play hide and seek

13
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,039
in the corn patch.

14
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,142
We could make a scarecrow.

15
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,909
GIRL: Mommy?

16
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,976
Julia!

17
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,580
Hey, Thomas, what are you...?

18
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,623
Um, Grace, can you save the...
the toilet paper?

19
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,007
Earth to Grace?

20
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:36,877
Does this look like the doctor?

21
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:38,779
I don't remember.

27
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,266
How you doing, baby?

28
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:55,168
(kissing)

29
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:58,439
How was your day?

30
00:02:58,507 --> 00:02:59,808
It was good.

31
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:01,477
This march is gonna be amazing!

32
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,608
These people are really inspiring.

33
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:05,208
They're so organized, and there's lots

34
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,617
of professors and college grads.

35
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,386
You wouldn't believe

36
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,320
the great people out there
fighting the good fight.

37
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,555
Two toddlers at the march.
Sounds like hell to me.

38
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:15,557
So we'll stick 'em in their strollers!

39
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,356
We're gonna march all the way
from Roxbury

40
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:19,521
to the Boston Common
as a family, and there'll be

41
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,682
thousands of people just like us.

42
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:25,028
Back me up here, Grace!

43
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,930
I can stay here with them.

44
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,495
Do you think those pictures
might be too much for the kids?

49
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:42,877
(grunts with effort)
I will say this, Grace.

50
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,379
You're really talented.

51
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,449
(Kit talking playfully to Baby Thomas)

52
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:04,328
(sighs)

53
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,331
I must be losing my touch.

54
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,839
No, you still got it.

55
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,276
(sighs)

56
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,679
What, is this about Grace?

57
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:24,381
In the last few weeks,

58
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,369
everything she draws is
aliens and the abduction.

59
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,185
She's obsessed... it's all
she ever talks about.

60
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,721
Something you never talk about at all.

61
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,428
Everybody processes things differently.

62
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:39,896
Grace is just trying to work through

63
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,665
what they did to her in her own way.

64
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,134
No. She's dwelling on the past

65
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,003
because she's unhappy in the present.

66
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,272
You need to spend more time with her.

67
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,674
We're not on a schedule, Alma.

68
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,776
I'm not punching a time clock.

69
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:54,011
We're just trying to
do what comes natural.

70
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,279
She needs you, Kit.

71
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:57,548
Go to her.

72
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:11,262
You're up late.

73
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,699
Had to get it down on paper

74
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,969
before it disappears from my head.

75
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:21,440
Is this how you remember it?

76
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,476
I guess so.

77
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,879
I'm not doing it for me.

78
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:28,881
It's for our children, Kit.

79
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,917
They need to know where they came from.

80
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:34,654
Alma's worried.

81
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:36,222
(sighs)

82
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,358
She wants to forget the past.

83
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,627
But those are not
the memories I'm scared of.

84
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:46,266
Memories of that black night.

85
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:47,400
(screaming)

86
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:52,303
Those feelings,
when I lost control of myself.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,441
That's what makes me afraid.

88
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:04,880
You're a different person now.

89
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,248
(sighs)

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,794
(both panting)

91
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:27,330
(moaning and panting)

92
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,935
(distant tapping)

93
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:33,403
Kit?

94
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,740
(screeching)

95
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:39,342
(gasps)

96
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,877
(electrical buzzing)
Kit?! Kit?!

97
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,045
Kit, it's them!
They've come for us!

98
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,180
(Alma groans)

99
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:47,282
Don't let them take us.
Help me with the babies!

100
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,984
(Alma groans)

101
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,319
(screeching)

102
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,119
(screaming)

103
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,519
Shit! You got it?

104
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:53,953
Yeah. MAN: Come on out!

105
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:56,422
(man shouts, tires squealing)

106
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:57,856
Those bastards!

107
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:04,661
(siren blaring, car door closing)

108
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,096
KIT: I know who tried
to burn down my house.

109
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,632
It was Billy and his friends.
Billy Marshall.

110
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,267
I thought you said you were
inside when it happened.

111
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:13,568
Did you see him?

112
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:14,902
KIT: Not exactly,

113
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,905
but it was his truck.

114
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:19,044
OFFICER WOODS: There are
lots of trucks, Mr. Walker.

115
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:21,279
(crying) KIT: I know he did it.

116
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,115
If you don't arrest him, I'm going to do

117
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,516
whatever it takes to protect my family.

118
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,285
I heard about your family.

119
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:28,621
You're the father of two children.

120
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:31,657
One Caucasian, one Negro.

121
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:33,025
What does that got to do with anything?

122
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,626
You know polygamy is illegal

123
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:36,495
in the state of Massachusetts.

124
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,197
(sobbing)

125
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,833
Police are going to be no help.

126
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,569
Where's Alma?

127
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:50,038
She's crying in her room.

128
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,608
She thought it was the creatures
coming back for her.

129
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:55,511
She's inconsolable.

130
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:58,646
You okay?

131
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:01,081
I'm strong, remember?

132
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,483
(Alma sobbing)

133
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,919
I better go to her.

134
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,522
That's what I was thinking. Go.

135
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:19,733
(speaking French):

136
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:24,105
<i>Oui!</i> Good!

137
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,643
(thudding, Baby Julia cries)

138
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:30,811
Don't worry about it.

139
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,113
("Eve of Destruction" playing)

140
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,549
Okay. Okay.

141
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,218
All right.

142
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,320
What's wrong with you?
Is it because.

143
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,655
Kit has been spending more time with me?
That was my idea, remember?

144
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:44,525
Ever since those boys attacked us...
I don't care about those boys.

145
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,427
So it's me.
I'm done with the alien talk.

146
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,396
It was the worst thing
that ever happened to me,

147
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:49,697
and you act like it was
a religious experience.

148
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:52,600
Because it was. Alma...

149
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,936
They brought me back to life.

150
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,804
They gave us these amazing children.

151
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:58,673
How can you not be grateful?
Grateful?!

152
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,409
They snatched me from this house,

153
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,776
stripped me down,
threw me on a metal slab

154
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:04,742
and stuck metal probes inside of me.

155
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,975
Hey, this is good.

156
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,775
You need to talk about it.

157
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,540
Maybe together,
we can understand what it meant.

158
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,042
It meant nothing, Grace!
It was senseless cruelty.

159
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,878
They were like little boys
plucking wings off a butterfly.

160
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,545
No, I don't believe that for a second.

161
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,547
They're so far ahead of us.

162
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,949
These children are our living proof.

163
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,917
Some day, they'll come back for them.

164
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,819
No. Listen, Grace.
I don't want them to come back.

165
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:28,287
And these children have nothing
to do with them.

166
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,322
If you do anything to try
and call them back here...

167
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,290
Of course they'll come back...
for Kit.

168
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,292
(train whistle blows)
They chose him because

169
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,160
his mind is so open,

170
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:39,062
because he has incredible
empathy for every living thing.

171
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,996
Do not talk to me about Kit.

172
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,130
I married him, remember?

173
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:44,958
Before all of this madness,
we lived together

174
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,235
in this house, as husband and wife.

175
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:50,806
You really think your life
was so much better before?

176
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,474
Before my husband brought home
an axe murderer? Yes.

177
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,443
They locked you away
for a reason, Grace.

178
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,647
Well, at least I wasn't the one
locking myself away.

179
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,717
Is this the way you
want Julia to grow up?

180
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,520
Ashamed of who she is?

181
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,523
Grace, I am so sorry.

182
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:08,757
I've never done that before.

183
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,460
(bowl clattering)

184
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,728
KIT: What's going on?

185
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,132
Let's have a family meeting.

186
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,635
I'm done. No more meetings.

187
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,604
♪ We're on the eve
of destruction... ♪

188
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,439
Mommy?

189
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:24,441
Yeah.

190
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:25,977
KIT: Grace?

191
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:38,555
(kissing gently)

192
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:48,199
(door creaking)

193
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:55,076
Do you ever sleep?

194
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:59,182
Not if I can help it.

195
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:03,187
I've spent my whole life
asleep and locked away.

196
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,392
So much time already wasted.

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,295
I won't waste another moment.

198
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,032
I understand.

199
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:14,602
I know you do.

200
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,277
I love you, Kit.

201
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,312
And Alma.

202
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,185
And our sweet, beautiful miracle babies.

203
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,154
(laughs)

204
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,823
Our life here has been more precious

205
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,327
than I could have dreamed.

206
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,565
But something's changed.

207
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:44,338
I won't live in fear and isolation.

208
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,240
Not anymore.

209
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:47,842
Not again.

210
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,413
The future is coming, Kit,

211
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,015
no matter what.

212
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,183
We can't hide from it.

213
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,353
We have to engage with it.

214
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,189
We have to embrace it.

215
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:59,559
Locked doors and shuttered
windows won't keep it out.

216
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,361
Alma needs to understand that.

217
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,495
We have to open...

218
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,199
(yells) Alma!

219
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,426
What are you doing?! (screams)

220
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,371
(grunts) Alma!

221
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:14,307
What have you done?! She wanted
to bring them back into our home!

222
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,543
I couldn't let her.
We have to... we have to hide.

223
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,213
We have to hide.
Kit, we have to hide.

224
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,550
(gasping weakly)

225
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,095
(Kit grunts, bones crackle)

226
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,941
BABY THOMAS: Daddy?

227
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:13,043
Daddy'll be there in a minute.

228
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:31,255
Your move, boss.

229
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,049
ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this
program to bring you

230
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,318
an emergency broadcast
from President Johnson.

231
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,594
Snake eyes.

232
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,957
Gum Drop Mountain is mine, chickens.

233
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,791
America is shocked and saddened

234
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,926
by the brutal slaying tonight

235
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,351
of Dr. Martin Luther King.

236
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,293
If you want to get through
Peppermint Stick Forest,

237
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,419
you got to go through me.

238
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,077
I ask every citizen

239
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:57,467
to reject the blind violence...

240
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,204
Percy! Knock it off!

241
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,706
...that has struck Dr. King,

242
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,140
who lived by non-violence.

243
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,372
His lithium levels are way too high.

244
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,011
Dr. Miller should
check them, okay?

245
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,479
Mm-hmm.
(over TV): I pray that his family...

246
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,082
can find comfort in the memory

247
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,018
of all he tried to do for the land...

248
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,587
Martha.

249
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,288
Your move.

250
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,227
Jude.

251
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,629
May I have a word, please?

252
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,632
Do you hear something?

253
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,634
Hmm? Hmph.

254
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,238
He couldn't mean me.

255
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,439
Jude is dead.

256
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:36,175
I was renamed...

257
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,145
what was it?

258
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,746
Betty Drake.

259
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:42,282
Yeah, Betty Drake.

260
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,917
Please, Jude, don't be childish.

261
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,385
Childish?

262
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:48,288
Hell, I'm the queen of Candy Land.

263
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:51,224
A short audience, Your Majesty.

264
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,395
You're leaving Briarcliff?

265
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,999
But you're not leaving the Church.

266
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,401
On the contrary.

267
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,337
I've been appointed Cardinal.

268
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,705
Of New York.

269
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,073
Well, good for you.

270
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,242
You had a dream, you made it come true.

271
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:14,712
You should also know that

272
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,114
the Church is relinquishing
ownership of Briarcliff.

273
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,716
We've donated it to the state.

274
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,119
They'll use it as an overflow facility.

275
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,322
Jude...

276
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,227
I cannot leave here knowing
I've left you behind to rot.

277
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,166
I'm arranging for your release.

278
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,167
I'm gonna get you out.

279
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,134
The cruelty ends here.

280
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:36,439
The cruelest thing of all, Timothy,

281
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:39,075
is false hope.

282
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,577
I promise.

283
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:42,112
I will make you a believer,

284
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,514
Jude.

285
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:50,021
It's your move, boss.

286
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,026
("All Along the Watchtower"
by Jimi Hendrix playing)

287
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:59,131
(indistinct shouting)

288
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:15,114
(slow, distorted): ♪ There must be
some kind of way out of here ♪

289
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:19,218
♪ Said the joker to the thief ♪

290

♪ There's too much
confusion... ♪

291
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,305
What are you doing here?

292
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,340
Me and my girls just got
transferred in from County.

293
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,610
I didn't call for you.

294
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:46,479
What? I need an appointment
to see Your Highness?

295
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,682
Get her.

296
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,150
Royalty.

297
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,187
Queen bee, or so I hear.

298
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:55,356
You don't belong here.

299
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,158
Yeah, that's what I told the judge.

300
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,859
He disagreed.

301
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,528
Hell...

302
00:17:00,596 --> 00:17:02,330
most of my so-called victims

303
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,532
were living off government
checks anyway... spongers.

304
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
They'd spend their dole
on liquor and gambling

305
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:09,770
before I'd ever see a rent check.

306
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:12,205
I thought I was doing
the taxpayer a service.

307
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:14,007
I know who you are.

308
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,840
My reputation precedes me.

309
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,907
Good.

310
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:22,343
Then you know how things
are going to go around here.

311
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:25,045
You get one chance

312
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,513
to be part of this with me.
What?

313
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,782
I hear you're the gal to talk to

314
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,951
when it comes to the way
things run around here.

315
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,987
You can either rule this roost with me,

316
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,723
or just be one more dumb cluck.

317
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,492
Think it over.

318
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,764
SISTER JUDE: Storm clouds
are gathering, Pepper.

319
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:51,367
I can see them coming on the horizon.

320
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:53,502
I hope the monsignor

321
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,804
is true to his promise and acts quickly.

322
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,540
You know you can't put stock
into his promises, Jude.

323
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:01,443
No, you're being too harsh.

324
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,444
I saw something in his eyes.

325
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,647
There's nothing there.

326
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,250
(Jude groans)

327
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:14,986
More souls to take care of.

328
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:19,489
God help us all.

329
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,690
I'll say a prayer for your mother's

330
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:22,825
speedy recovery, Jorge.

331
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,194
Yeah, but you should pray too.

332
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:28,831
Thanks, Betty; I'll do that.

333
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:31,033
Lights out in ten minutes.

334
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,301
Hello, gorgeous.

335
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,603
I'm on top.

336
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,238
What's she doing here?
She's your new roommate.

337
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:37,872
Everyone doubles up, Betty.

338
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:40,541
No!

339
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:46,079
No.

340
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:50,116
I don't know what song
was playing in your head,

341
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,817
but I don't want you here.

342
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:53,952
I'm not ready.

343
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,754
You lose something, honey?

344
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,423
Yeah.

345
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:59,159
My cigarettes.

346
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:01,161
(scoffs) You took them.

347
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,896
Everything in this cell belongs to me.

348
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:05,064
That includes you.

349
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,866
Why are you doing this?

350
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:09,335
Why now?

351
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:12,137
I'm so close to getting out.

352
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:14,006
What are you talking about?

353
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:17,776
Everyone knows there's only
one way out of Briarcliff,

354
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,713
and it ain't the front door.

355
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,715
You're toying with me.

356
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:27,786
Babycakes, I'm only
just starting to toy with you.

357
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:28,887
When I get going,

358
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:30,889
you'll be begging for more.

359
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:34,526
You'll be shaking and moaning.

360
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:36,595
(gasps) You stay away from me.

361
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:37,796
Aw...

362
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:39,230
don't be that way.

363
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:43,468
Here.

364
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:44,736
Drag.

365
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:47,706
Calm your frazzled nerves.

366
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:51,876
You stay away from me.

367
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,882
You just stay away from me!

368
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,685
I don't want anything to do with you.

369
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:04,856
You'll change your tune.

370
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:09,093
You okay, boss?

371
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,895
You look a little green
around the gills.

372
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,569
Trouble sleeping.

373
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,971
They gave me a roommate.

374
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,040
Stacking us up like cord wood.

375
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,108
(door creaks open)

376
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:31,783
My, my, my.

377
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,719
What you doing over here

378
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,054
all by your lonesome?

379
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,491
Don't go hopping off too far,

380
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,527
my little chocolate bunny.

381
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:44,495
Hey, rummy.

382
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:46,531
Marge here says

383
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,366
you ain't been cooperating.

384
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:51,169
She says you've been taking your meds.

385
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:52,637
My meds. Yes, I took them.

386
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,039
Down the hatch.

387
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,407
Just 12 pills.

388
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:56,808
12 pills a day...

389
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,110
keeps the doctor away.

390
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,745
No, see, you weren't supposed
to take them.

391
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:02,147
You were supposed to squirrel them away.

392
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:04,149
I told you how, remember, rummy?

393
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,019
I also told you what would happen

394
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,168
if you didn't do as I said.

395
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,291
Everyone can see

396
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:12,859
you're challenging me, rummy.

397
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,595
We can't have that. Ah! Ah!

398
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:17,401
(screaming)

399
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,637
(patients clamoring, screaming)

400
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,176
(groaning)

401
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,179
(groans)

402
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,629
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

403
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,167
No, get off of me.

404
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,902
I don't want to die.

405
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,837
(screaming)

406
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:57,910
(yelling, groaning)

407
00:21:57,978 --> 00:21:59,912
She tried to kiss me!

408
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,914
She's death!
I've seen her before!

409
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:04,584
I've seen her before!
Crazy goddamn bitch.

410
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:06,052
I ain't rooming with her.

411
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,654
She tried to kill me!

412
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:26,607
(gasps)

413
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:29,176
This is wrong.

414
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:31,211
It's all wrong.

415
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,848
(door opens)

416
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,917
WOMAN (distorted, distant):
Betty Drake.

417
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:39,286
What are we going to do with you?

418
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:41,021
(object clatters)

419
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,022
Betty...

420
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,091
(tapping)

421
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,926
Do you know where you are?

422
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:52,900
In my o...

423
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:59,841
In your office.

424
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:01,609
And do you know who I am?

425
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:05,113
Uh... Dr. Crump? Correct.

426
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:09,485
I hear you've had a bit of a
dustup with your new roommate.

427
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:12,121
I was... I...

428
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,356
(sighs)

429
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:16,558
I thought she...

430
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:22,929
I don't like her.

431
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:24,364
You haven't liked any of the women

432
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,498
you've roomed with.

433
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,567
That's five in two months.

434
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:30,170
What?
There are no single rooms here

435
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,472
at Briarcliff, Betty.
You know that.

436
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,842
Unless you want to go back to solitary.

437
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:37,278
I know you spent quite
a bit of time there

438
00:23:37,345 --> 00:23:39,179
when you first arrived,
but you don't want

439
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:42,283
to go back there, do you, Betty?

440
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,819
No.
Good. Then I can count on you

441
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,621
to make more of an effort

442
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:50,424
to get along with your roommate.

443
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:56,563
Has the monsignor left any word?

444
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:57,831
The monsignor?

445
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,299
I need to speak to him.

446
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,034
I need to speak to the monsignor.

447
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:02,402
You mean the hospital chaplain?

448
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,438
No. No.

449
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:07,208
No.

450
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:11,312
I mean Monsignor Timothy Howard.

451
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,948
I spoke to him right
before he left for New York.

452
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:15,850
He's working on my release.

453
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,517
I need to speak to him.

454
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:19,086
You mean <i>Cardinal</i>

455
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:22,222
Timothy Howard? Yeah.

456
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,290
Cardinal.

457
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,925
(chuckles)

458
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:29,163
He... he told me
that he had been...

459
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:32,066
appointed Cardinal of New York.
(laughs)

460
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,136
Two and a half years ago.

461
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:36,172
What?

462
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:39,441
Timothy Howard was appointed
Cardinal of New York

463
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,611
(distorted): shortly after the Church
donated Briarcliff to the State.

464
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,613
Two and a half years ago.

465
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,581
No.

466
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,249
No, I just... I...

467
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:50,318
I just talked to him on Monday.

468
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:52,352
You're confused, Betty.

469
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,822
I am not!

470
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:01,559
(whispers): I'm not confused.

471
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,862
Ask Pepper. She was there.

472
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,432
Pepper? Pepper. Yeah.

473
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:11,234
The pinhead.

474
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,336
She's a friend of mine.

475
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:15,706
Oh, yes, that poor
microcephalic creature.

476
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:18,175
You were very upset when she passed.

477
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:24,681
(ragged breathing)

478
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:27,050
Passed?

479
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:32,924
(Dr. Crump sighs)

480
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,592
(filing cabinet drawer rattles open)

481
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:43,167
Pepper died, Betty.

482
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:44,399
Winter of '66.

483
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,441
Shortly after we took over.

484
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:49,039
Don't you remember?

485
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:59,590
It's all right, Betty.

486
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,027
I'll talk to Dr. Crayden
about upping your

487
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:04,228
chlorpromazine levels.

488
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:08,118
Everything's going to be all right.

489
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:21,511
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my distinct honor

490
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:25,157
to welcome to Newman's Books
the writer of...

491
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:28,394
<i>Maniac: One Woman's</i>
<i>Story of Survival.</i>

492
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,962
It's been on <i>The New York Times</i>
Best Seller list

493
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,297
for...

494
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:33,632
ten weeks now.

495
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,267
The book is a sensation,

496
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:37,403
and after devouring it in one sitting,

497
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,939
I can honestly say...
she's my hero.

498
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,908
Please welcome my new favorite author,

499
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,843
Lana Winters.

500
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:45,845
(applause)

501
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:48,148
Thank you. Thank you.

502
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:56,656
I've been asked to do a small
reading before the signing.

503
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:58,558
So here goes.

504
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:03,530
"How long had it been?

505
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:07,501
"20 minutes? 20 hours?

506
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:11,771
"20 days? In a windowless room
without a clock,

507
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,575
"time felt like a luxury
I couldn't afford.

508
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:20,446
"I reminded myself, any moment
now, my time could end.

509
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,283
"And all the minutes
I extracted with my lies,

510
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,820
"with the show of affections
and empathy, could slip

511
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:30,623
"from my grasp like sand
through my fingers.

512
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,126
"Click, click, click.

513
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,695
"The fluorescent lights flickered on.

514
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,797
"Adrenaline coursed through my body.

515
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,232
"My muscles tensed.

516
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,735
"My heart pounded through my chest.

517
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:46,005
"His appearance was always unexpected.

518
00:27:46,073 --> 00:27:49,576
"I came to believe
he was always watching me,"

519
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,945
"waiting to catch me off guard."

520
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:54,081
"But this time, there was"

521
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,584
"more than one coming down
the basement steps."

522
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:59,886
"Another woman,"

523
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:03,590
"her hands tied behind her back,
staggered in front of him."

524
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:06,760
"She stumbled down the stairs,
landing hard on the tile floor."

525
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:09,263
"And she looked up at me,"

526
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:12,466
"and it was as if
I was looking in a mirror"

527
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:15,303
"and saw my own despair."

528
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:18,640
"That's when he turned to me and said,"

529
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:21,276
"'Say hi to our new toy.'."

530
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:22,811
MAN: That's bullshit.

531
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,979
That never happened.

532
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:27,149
You told me that that's
what you were going to do.

533
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:28,817
You tortured me with the idea,

534
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:31,552
that somehow I would be
responsible for another victim.

535
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,388
I suggested it... I never did it.

536
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,424
Because I escaped before you could.

537
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:37,025
It's still a lie, Lana.

538
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,560
You put it in your book
just so you could

539
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:40,996
sell more copies. You sold out.

540
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:42,731
I'm a writer.

541
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,834
It's my job to tell
the essence of truth.

542
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,635
WOMAN: Is that why you
called me your roommate?

543
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:51,071
I was your lover, but in your book,

544
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:53,307
I was covered in a cloak of asexuality.

545
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:55,409
Our life together disappeared.

546
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:57,745
That part of my life wasn't
pertinent to the book.

547
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:01,583
It would have distracted the
reader from the central theme.

548
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:03,084
THREDSON: Your theme?

549
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:04,418
Face it, Lana,

550
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:05,886
you're only interested in one thing:

551
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:07,755
Fame.

552
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,596
Miss Winters?

553
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,035
(audience murmuring)

554
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,710
I'm sorry.
I must have lost my place.

555
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:31,745
No.

556
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,847
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,916
I'm sorry you had to go
through that again.

558
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:39,419
You're so incredibly brave.

559
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:01,778
Thank you.

560
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,281
I couldn't find any snacks.

561
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:07,984
Didn't I ask you to pack almonds?

562
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,752
This Tab is warm.

563
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,021
Jesus.
Uh, they don't have any ice here.

564
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:14,357
So then hightail it to the
HoJo's across the street.

565
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:16,626
Okay.

566
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:20,564
So who do I make it out to?

567
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:21,865
Kit.

568
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,901
Kit Walker.

569
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:25,502
Oh, my God.

570
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:28,639
Kit... (laughs)

571
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:36,177
Oh, sweetheart.

572
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:38,980
I was so sorry to hear about Grace.

573
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,982
I wanted to write to you.

574
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,651
Well, would've been nice
to hear from you.

575
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,787
Can't lie.

576
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:48,824
No, yes, I know, it's just...

577
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,560
It's been so crazy.

578
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,396
I just sold the film rights
to Hollywood.

579
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,497
Can you believe it?

580
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,232
Wow. Yeah.

581
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,067
What do you think of Tuesday Weld as me?

582
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:02,971
(laughing)

583
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,439
Well, a girl can dream, right?

584
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:05,740
She'd be a great you.

585
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:07,008
Great you.

586
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:09,745
(inhales, clears throat)

587
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:14,249
So, uh, you got time
for a cup of coffee?

588
00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:15,985
Did you see me on <i>Cavett?</i>

589
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:18,855
I was so nervous,
but I think I did well.

590
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:21,524
He was very complimentary
during the commercials.

591
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,827
I'm sure you knocked 'em dead.

592
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:25,895
Anyway, you been back to Briarcliff?

593
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:27,797
Oh my God, Kit,
you are not gonna believe

594
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:29,231
what I'm doing next.

595
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:31,834
A book about Leigh Emerson
and his crime spree

596
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,702
after he escaped from Briarcliff.

597
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,838
That psycho who nailed the
monsignor to the cross?

598
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,273
Did you know killed seven nuns?

599
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,642
Seven.

600
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,880
I thought of calling it
"Santa and the Seven Nuns."

601
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:46,516
Too campy?
Why are you writing about him?!

602
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:47,483
Jesus!

603
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,418
He's just another maniac.

604
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:53,389
That's my canvas, Kit.

605
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:55,791
I've found my voice.

606
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:57,760
The way Capote did with <i>In Cold Blood.</i>

607
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:00,663
I have a perspective
on the stunted male psyche

608
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:02,498
that no one else has.

609
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:04,333
I lived it.

610
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:07,302
You swore you were
gonna take down Briarcliff.

611
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,504
Expose it to the world.

612
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:11,840
You promised Jude.

613
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,408
You were gonna be a reporter.

614
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:15,444
Not a cheap celebrity.

615
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:18,614
Things change.

616
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:20,382
People change.

617
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:24,486
I built a life for myself, Kit...

618
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:26,855
a really substantial life...

619
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:29,324
and I did it by spinning
straw into gold.

620
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:34,496
It could've gone very differently.

621
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:37,467
Hm, I would've thought you of all people

622
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:38,534
would understand that.

623
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:42,105
I do.

624
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:43,373
And I respect you.

625
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:45,375
But this is... Believe me...

626
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:48,613
I know all too well that
I could still be in there,

627
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:51,350
drooling in the bread dough
with all the other lunatics.

628
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:55,087
Careful when you talk
about those lunatics.

629
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,889
You're talking about my wife.

630
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:58,190
<i>Thomas, he loves</i>

631
00:32:58,258 --> 00:33:00,126
to build things... I bought him

632
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:02,595
a train set the other day
and next thing I know,

633
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:04,664
he put the track together
by himself. (Laughs)

634
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:08,602
Julia is a little dancer.

635
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,271
She loves to dance...
just like her mother.

636
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,374
I miss them so much.

637
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,842
They miss you, too.

638
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,878
No, they don't even know me.

639
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:20,014
(man laughing)

640
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,016
MAN (laughing):
Oh, it's so good!

641
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,018
Every night at dinner,

642
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:27,088
Julia makes me make
an extra plate in case

643
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,390
you come home hungry.

644
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,260
I'd give anything to see them again.

645
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:33,962
Could you bring them next time
even if only for a few minutes?

646
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,664
(clacking, woman moaning)

647
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,399
(moaning)

648
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,634
(groans)

649
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:40,069
No, forget it.

650
00:33:40,136 --> 00:33:41,804
You can't bring them here.

651
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:46,909
I'm so sorry, Alma.

652
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:49,078
I don't know how you
survived this place.

653
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:51,914
(guttural grunting)

654
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:54,316
Jesus.

655
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,885
I had no idea she was there.

656
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,188
Not anymore.

657
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:04,125
WOMAN: There was no warning.

658
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:06,394
No sign at all.
Her heart just stopped.

659
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:22,077
I'm sorry, Alma.

660
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,013
(sighs)

661
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,282
I'm such a fool.

662
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,720
All my crazy plans.

663
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:35,525
And look where that got us.

664
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:41,564
I completely failed you.

665
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,802
And Grace.

666
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,072
And those kids.

667
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,474
I'm going to try to make it right.

668
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,709
LANA: <i>My God.</i>

669
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:57,214
Everyone's gone but us.

670
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,651
Well, there is one person left.

671
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:03,620
Toughest one of all.

672
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:05,856
What do you mean? Jude.

673
00:35:05,924 --> 00:35:07,157
She's still there.

674
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:09,026
That's not possible.

675
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:10,727
I saw her death certificate.

676
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:11,895
And I saw <i>her.</i>

677
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:26,308
Any instructions on how you'd
like us to deal with her body?

678
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,077
I'm gonna take her home.
She'll be buried on our land.

679
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:32,213
(distant scream echoing)

680
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,482
(screaming)

681
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:40,354
(yelling and screaming)

682
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:49,897
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

683
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:52,499
(TV playing indistinctly)

684
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,903
Time for my story.

685
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,871
(static buzzing)

686
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:00,341
(TV announcer speaking indistinctly)

687
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,877
ANNOUNCER: ...ingredients than
any other leading brands.

688
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,079
(TV announcer continues indistinctly)

689
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,683
Sister Jude?

690
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,725
(firmly): Sister Jude.

691
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,894
It's me... Kit Walker.

692
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,000
They said you were dead.

693
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:29,336
I know they did.

694
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,805
Because they stole the rights.

695
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:36,210
The rights to my story.

696
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:40,982
It's based on my life,
every word of it...

697
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:42,950
I'll notify you the moment

698
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:45,320
that Sister Bertrille... lands.

699
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,288
(laughs)

700
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:49,590
Sister Bertrille.

701
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:53,428
She's got the Devil in her.

702
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:57,199
She stole my hat.

703
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:58,467
Your hat?

704
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,235
That's how she did it.

705
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,071
How she managed
to fly out of this place.

706
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,842
They don't know it,

707
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:09,110
but I don't need the hat.

708
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:13,749
(laughs)

709
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,984
I can fly without it.

710
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:18,086
One of these days,

711
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,556
I'm gonna fly my ass right out of here!

712
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:27,229
Watch and see.

713
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,938
I don't doubt it.

714
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,846
(man shouts indistinctly)

715
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:48,752
I didn't know.

716
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,187
I <i>couldn't</i> know.

717
00:37:50,254 --> 00:37:53,690
I went back there, Kit.
I did try.

718
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:56,558
The monsignor told me
she'd hanged herself.

719
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:58,860
He lied to you.
She's been there this whole time.

720
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:01,063
I don't know what you expect me
to do about that now.

721
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:04,033
What you said you'd do...
get the place shut down.

722
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,602
The world has to know what's
going on at Briarcliff.

723
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,704
The place is a snake pit.

724
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,706
And it always has been.

725
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:13,275
And I'm sorry to hear about Jude.

726
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:16,679
It's heartbreaking,
but let's be real here.

727
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:20,216
Every bed in that place, she made.

728
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,986
Her choice, not ours.

729
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:25,088
Can you really be that hard?

730
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,723
I'm as hard as I have to be.

731
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:29,793
It's what's kept me alive.
WOMAN: Sorry.

732
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:31,529
But there's a dozen more people

733
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:33,798
waiting to get their books signed.

734
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:38,136
(sighs)

735
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:44,977
It really was good
to see you again, Kit.

736
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:47,479
Yeah, sure.

737
00:38:47,547 --> 00:38:49,014
Good luck out there.

738
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:51,317
(door bell jangling)

739
00:38:53,954 --> 00:38:56,156
(birds singing)

740
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,569
(pop song plays on radio)

741
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:15,008
(rock music blaring)

742
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:33,793
Everything with a white dot is 25% off.

743
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:36,562
Books with orange dots, 50%.

744
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm not looking for bargains.

745
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:42,835
I'm looking for a particular title.

746
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:44,970
It's a really old book.

747
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:48,340
I'm a connoisseur of
the... first printing.

748
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,009
You mean first edition?

749
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:51,478
Yeah, that's it.

750
00:39:51,545 --> 00:39:52,445
First edition.

751
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,380
You're in the wrong place.

752
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:56,883
All we have left are the crap
we haven't sold

753
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,118
in the last 44 years.

754
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:01,721
If you noticed,
we're going out of business.

755
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:03,456
No, it's here.

756
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:05,558
The computer says that
you're the only store around

757
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:07,460
with an autographed copy.

758
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:10,730
<i>Maniac: One Woman's</i>
<i>Story of Survival.</i>

759
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,165
By Lana Winters?
That's not for sale.

760
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:16,202
I've been looking for
it for a long time.

761
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,272
It's my mother's personal copy.

762
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:22,575
She credited that book
with giving her enough courage

763
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:24,644
to finally leave my father.

764
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:26,146
(clears throat)

765
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:29,249
She said he was her own
version of Bloody Face.

766
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:32,319
Name your price.

767
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:34,422
I'm related to her.

768
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:35,856
The writer.

769
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:37,658
She's my mother.

770
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,394
Listen, I was a women's studies major.

771
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:42,663
I've read every one of her books.

772
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,233
The only baby she ever had was
by rape with Bloody Face,

773
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,669
and he died at birth.

774
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:53,606
Can I see it?

775
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:57,310
I just want to see her name.

776
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:13,294
That's her signature.

777
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:19,366
That's as close
as I ever got to her in person.

778
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:24,939
Okay. We're done.

779
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:26,841
Bye-bye.

780
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:29,777
I gave you a chance to name your price.

781
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:31,446
Now I'll tell you mine.

782
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:33,181
There's nothing you could say

783
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,782
to make me change my mind.

784
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,951
You're going to give me that book,

785
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:39,787
because it's my fate to have it.

786
00:41:39,855 --> 00:41:43,157
You see, I have a plan

787
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:44,792
to meet my mother.

788
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,194
And when I see her, I'm gonna greet her

789
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:48,762
with a polite,
"Hello, Ms. Winters.

790
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,397
Do you know who I am?"

791
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:53,701
And she'll shake her head in ignorance,

792
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:56,172
and then I'll present this book of lies.

793
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,207
And then I'll say,

794
00:41:58,275 --> 00:42:00,610
"I'm in your book,

795
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:03,513
except I didn't die."

796
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:09,387
"I'm the piece of trash
you threw away 48 years ago."

797
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,857
"I'm your son."

798
00:42:14,426 --> 00:42:16,127
And when she fully understands

799
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,463
who it is standing in front of her,

800
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,699
I'll take out
my nine-millimeter handgun,

801
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:24,569
point it at her face

802
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:26,304
and pull the trigger.

803
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:30,342
And finally...

804
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,479
I will have completed my father's work.

805
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:40,748
But first, I'm gonna need that book.
