1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:04,004
Is the Wall as big as they say?

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,071
Bigger.

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,285
- How much longer?
- A few more days.

4
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:09,691
I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

5
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:11,043
What does it do?

6
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:13,296
I'm not sure that
it does anything.

7
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:15,312
You're not supposed to be here.

8
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,047
- If your father knew--
- He said you're a traitor.

9
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:18,248
I am, child.

10
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:20,183
You must get bored down here.

11
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:21,517
I brought you
something to read.

12
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,086
My lady, I can't
read the words.

13
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:24,454
I wouldn't know where to start.

14
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,957
At the beginning.
This word is Aegon.

15
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:29,494
The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers.

16
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,230
- We can defeat them.
- But they won't meet us on the field.

17
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,366
<i>They have strong walls.</i>

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,517
_

19
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,108
Women in our position
must make the best

20
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:42,610
of our circumstances.

21
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,513
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

22
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,215
I have to marry him.

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,784
I didn't ask for this marriage.

24
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:51,754
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

25
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:54,924
My feelings for you
have not changed.

26
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,927
Listen to me, my lady.

27
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:59,830
I'm not your lady.
I'm your whore.

28
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:03,000
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

29
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,803
You are mad.
We have powerful friends.

30
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:09,007
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

31
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:11,310
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

32
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,347
He said he had
powerful friends.

33
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:16,648
Who was he talking about?

34
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:18,984
- I don't know.
- Find out.

35
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:21,420
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

36
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:24,090
- Your blood is noble.
- I'm just a bastard.

37
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,593
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon.

38
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,096
There is power
in a king's blood.

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,163
You're a liar!

40
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:31,832
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

41
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,167
Now--

42
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,402
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

43
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:42,244
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

44
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:44,680
Won't do you no good.

45
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:36,108

46
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,336
I'll give you one try, girl.

47
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:22,041
Kill me and you're free.

48
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:25,811
But if I live,
I'll break both your hands.

49
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,882
Go on, hit me.

50
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,618
<i>Hit me hard.</i>

51
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,562
Sulk all you want.

52
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:47,465
The truth is, you're lucky.

53
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,269
You don't want to be
alone out here, girl.

54
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:53,904
Someone worse than me
would find you.

55
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,486
There's no one worse than you.

56
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,810
Ha, you never knew my brother.

57
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,379
He once killed a man
for snoring.

58
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:02,949
There's plenty worse than me.

59
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,484
There's men who like
to beat little girls,

60
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,553
men who like to rape them.

61
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,689
I saved your sister
from some of them.

62
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:12,992
You're lying.

63
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:15,094
Ask her, if you
ever see her again.

64
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:16,829
Ask her who came back for her

65
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,699
when the mob
had her on her back.

66
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,136
They would have
taken her every which way

67
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,671
and left her there
with her throat cut open.

68
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,380
Is that the Blackwater?

69
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,849
The Blackwater?

70
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:38,217
Where do you think
I'm taking you?

71
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,956
Back to King's Landing
to Joffrey and the queen.

72
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,725
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the queen.

73
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,661
That's the Red Fork.

74
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,163
I'm taking you to the Twins.

75
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,400
But why?

76
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:56,103
Because your mother
and brother will be there

77
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:58,238
and they'll pay me for you.

78
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,743
Why would they be at the Twins?

79
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,648
Those outlaws you
love so much never told you?

80
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,317
The whole countryside
is yapping about it.

81
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,855
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

82
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,890
So quit trying
to bash my skull in

83
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,560
and we might just make it there
in time for the wedding.

84
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,412
Men who fight for gold have
neither honor nor loyalty.

85
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,014
<i>They cannot be trusted.</i>

86
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,683
<i>They can be trusted to
kill you if they're well paid.</i>

87
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:45,986
<i>The Yunkish</i>
<i>are paying them well.</i>

88
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,754
You know these men?

89
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:50,456
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

90
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:53,292
They're called the Second Sons.

91
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,228
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero,

92
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,897
"The Titan's Bastard."

93
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,299
Is he more titan or bastard?

94
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,602
He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

95
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,671
They all are.

96
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,008
How many?

97
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,611
<i>2,000, Your Grace.</i>

98
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,313
<i>Armored and mounted.</i>

99
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,549
Enough to make a difference?

100
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:22,188
It's hard to collect
wages from a corpse.

101
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,025
I'm sure the sellswords prefer
to fight for the winning side.

102
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:27,060
I imagine you're right.

103
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:31,331
I'd like to talk to the Titan's
Bastard about winning.

104
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,434
He may not agree to meet.

105
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:34,902
He will.

106
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:38,639
A man who fights for gold can't
afford to lose to a girl.

107
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:41,242
<i>Your Grace, allow me to present</i>

108
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:44,244
<i>the captains</i>
<i>of the Second Sons--</i>

109
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,280
Mero of Braavos,

110
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:50,383
Prendahl na Ghezn,

111
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,852
and...

112
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:54,387
Daario Naharis.

113
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:00,626
You are the Mother of Dragons?

114
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,564
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

115
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:07,333
- Mind your tongue.
<i>- Why?</i>

116
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,770
I didn't mind hers.

117
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:12,706
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

118
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:18,346
You, slave girl, bring wine.

119
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,682
We have no slaves here.

120
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,717
You'll all be slaves
after the battle

121
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,853
unless I save you.

122
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:29,291
Take your clothes off and
come and sit on Mero's lap

123
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,093
and I may give you
my Second Sons.

124
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,996
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

125
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,199
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

126
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,668
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

127
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,370
We have more, don't we?

128
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:43,939
<i>10,000 Unsullied.</i>

129
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:45,974
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

130
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,043
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

131
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:51,514
can explain to me how you
propose to defeat us.

132
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:54,383
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

133
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:57,387
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

134
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,758
You're very young
to be a captain.

135
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,394
He's not a captain.
He's a lieutenant.

136
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:06,463
Even if your numbers are right,

137
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,798
you must admit the odds
don't favor your side.

138
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,867
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

139
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:13,636
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

140
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:16,807
Or you could fight for me.

141
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,811
We've taken the slavers' gold.

142
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,580
We fight for Yunkai.

143
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,883
<i>I would pay</i>
<i>you as much and more.</i> -

144
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:30,053
Our contract is our bond.

145
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,587
If we break our bond,

146
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:33,790
no one will hire
the Second Sons again.

147
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,060
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

148
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:40,496
You'll have gold and castles
and lordships of your choosing

149
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:42,098
when I take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

150
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,634
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

151
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,336
You have no cavalry.

152
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,905
A fortnight ago, I had no army.

153
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,274
A year ago, I had no dragons.

154
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,878
You have two days to decide.

155
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,851
Show me your cunt. I want to see
if it's worth fighting for.

156
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,220
_

157
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,824
_

158
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:10,425
You seem to be
enjoying my wine.

159
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,961
Perhaps you'd like
a flagon to help you ponder.

160
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,796
Only a flagon?

161
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,864
And what are my brothers
in arms to drink?

162
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,533
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

163
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:23,003
The Titan's Bastard
does not drink alone.

164
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,709
In the Second Sons,
we share everything.

165
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:30,144
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

166
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,752
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

167
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:43,057
Ser Barristan,

168
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:47,028
if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

169
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,197
Gladly, Your Grace.

170
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,719
Half Robert, half lowborn.

171
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,256
Show the boy to his chambers.

172
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,560
<i>Have the maids draw him a bath and
find him some decent clothes.</i>

173
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,763
I'll come visit you soon.

174
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,273
What do you mean
to do with him?

175
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,942
You know what I mean
to do with him.

176
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,110
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

177
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,813
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

178
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:13,149
Have you ever slaughtered
a lamb, my king?

179
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,017
No.

180
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:18,120
If the lamb sees the knife,

181
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,222
she panics.

182
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:22,391
Her panic seeps into her meat,

183
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,660
darkens it, fouls the flavor.

184
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,062
You've slaughtered many lambs?

185
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:30,165
And none have seen the blade.

186
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:43,345
"And tho-- and thowg...

187
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,149

Vhag--"

192
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:00,862
Fuck me.

193
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:06,567
<i>"Visenya Targaryen</i>

194
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,936

to swallow

200
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,867
Your Grace.

201
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:42,769
They feeding you enough?

202
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,538
<i>Two meals a day.</i>

203
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:46,873
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper.

204
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,708
I cannot complain.

205
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,945
You don't belong
in a place like this.

206
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:55,081
Well, it's sad to say,
but I've seen worse.

207
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:57,717
Yeah.

208
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:02,856
I'm sorry about your son.

209
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,193
<i>Didn't get the chance</i>
<i>to tell you before.</i>

210
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:09,430
Good lad.
Loyal lad.

211
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,703
Melisandre's returned.

212
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:18,006
I didn't know she'd been gone.

213
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,175
Came back with a bastard boy.

214
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,679
Robert's bastard boy.

215
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,547
Why?

216
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,383
She says there's power
in king's blood.

217
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,486
She's going to kill him.

218
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:32,854
Sacrifice him.

219
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,423
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

220
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,692
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

221
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,461
The boy is your nephew.

222
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,963
What of it?
We're at war.

223
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,900
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

224
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,903
Robert bedded
one drunken night?

225
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,939
Because he has
your blood in his veins.

226
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,878
So did Renly.

227
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:57,147
Renly wronged you.

228
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:59,917
Renly declared himself king when
the throne belonged to you.

229
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:02,419
He raised an army,
stole your bannermen.

230
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:04,622
This boy has done you no harm.

231
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:07,325
- He's an innocent.
- How many boys live in Westeros?

232
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:10,929
How many girls? How many men?
How many women?

233
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,197
The darkness will devour
them all, she says.

234
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,133
The night that never ends.

235
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,102
Unless I triumph.

236
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,637
I never asked for this.

237
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:20,372
No more than I asked
to be king.

238
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:23,776
We do not choose our destiny,

239
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,345
but we must do our duty, no?

240
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:29,114
Great or small,
we must do our duty.

241
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:34,453
What's one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

242
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:39,792
Your Grace,

243
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,927
why did you come
to see me today?

244
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,696
I came to free you.

245
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:48,400
If you swear never to raise your
hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

246
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:51,602
I swear it.

247
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:53,905
I can't swear never
to speak against her.

248
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:55,974
You have little regard
for your own life.

249
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:58,076
Quite little, Your Grace.

250
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:00,478
Verging on none.

251
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:04,315
You could have freed me
yesterday or tomorrow,

252
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,985
but you came to me now before
this boy is put to the knife

253
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,822
because you knew
I'd counsel restraint.

254
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:15,159
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

255
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:17,628
You're not a man
who slaughters innocents

256
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,064
for gain or glory.

257
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:27,105
When my son was five
he said to me,

258
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,607
"I don't ever
want to die."

259
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:32,943
I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child.
You won't ever."

260
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:37,914
<i>I hated the idea of him lying
awake in the dark, afraid.</i>

261
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,620
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

262
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:46,823
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

263
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,860
I saw a vision in the flames.

264
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,965
A great battle in the snow.

265
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,801
I saw it.

266
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:04,007
And you saw whatever
she gave birth to.

267
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:07,845
<i>I never believed,</i>
<i>but when you see the truth,</i>

268
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:10,414
when it's right there
in front of you

269
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:13,016
as real as these iron bars,

270
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:16,086
how can you deny
her god is real?

271
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,577
Little dragon bitch.
She talks too much.

272
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,312
You talk too much.

273
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,915
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

274
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,617
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

275
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:49,420
My cock will find a way.

276
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:52,490
Tell him. Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

277
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:55,126
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

278
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,462
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

279
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:01,532
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

280
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:04,535
And I'm no whore, my friend.

281
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,871
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

282
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:09,373
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

283
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,908
For beauty?

284
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:12,509
We fight for gold.

285
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:16,881
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die--

286
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:19,817
the thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

287
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:23,187
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

288
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,722
You'll die young.

289
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:26,323
<i>What do we do</i>
<i>about the dragon girl?</i>

290
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:29,193
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

291
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,929
There won't be a battle. And we don't
have to deal with her eunuchs.

292
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:33,464
We only have to deal with her.

293
00:18:33,498 --> 00:18:36,066
- She's well guarded.
<i>- Tonight's a new moon.</i>

294
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:39,703
One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.

295
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:43,374
Which one of us?

296
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,343
Close your eyes, love.

297
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:54,918
Three coins.

298
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,820
A coin from Meereen,

299
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:59,089
a coin from Volantis,

300
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,691
and a coin from Braavos.

301
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,392
The Braavosi does the deed.

302
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,965
One for each of us, darling.

303
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,868
No peeking.

304
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,419
Do you hear me?

305
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,955
Follow my voice.
I'm right here.

306
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,325
You have something for me?

307
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,732
Valar morghulis.

308
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:06,489
Lady Sansa.

309
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,893
You look very handsome,
my lord.

310
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:11,494
Oh, yes.

311
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,930
The husband of your dreams.

312
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,599
But you do look glorious.

313
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:23,606
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone.

314
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,275
Do you mind?

315
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:30,480
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

316
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,000
My lady,

317
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:50,569
I want you to know

318
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,938
I didn't ask for this.

319
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:55,674
I hope I will not
disappoint you, my lord.

320
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,409
No, don't.

321
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,379
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

322
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,414
You won't be a prisoner
after today.

323
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,517
You'll be my wife.

324
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:08,922
I suppose that's a
different kind of prison.

325
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,593
I just wanted to say--

326
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:16,264
I'm just trying
to say very badly--

327
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,168
I just--

328
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:23,003
just want to say
I know how you feel.

329
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,241
I doubt that
very much, my lord.

330
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:31,711
You're right.

331
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:34,080
I have no idea how you feel.

332
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:36,382
And you have no idea
how I feel.

333
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:46,458
But I promise you
one thing, my lady.

334
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:50,162
I won't ever hurt you.

335
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,568
Do you drink wine?

336
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:59,138
When I have to.

337
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:02,408
Well, today you have to.

338
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,684
<i>You look radiant, Your Grace.</i>

339
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:14,320
Radiant?
Why radiant?

340
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:16,189
It's the word
that came to mind.

341
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,260
We're going to be sisters soon.

342
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:22,696
We should be friends.

343
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,265
You're a musical girl,
aren't you?

344
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,135
I imagine you have
a lovely voice.

345
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:31,105
A better dancer than a
singer, I'm afraid.

346
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:33,707
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

347
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:37,245
Of course. They play it
so often here at court.

348
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,248
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

349
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:42,750
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

350
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,918
House Reyne
was a powerful family.

351
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,353
Very wealthy.

352
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:48,922
The second wealthiest
in Westeros.

353
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:53,326
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

354
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:55,795
Of course, ambitious
climbers don't want to stop

355
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:58,130
on the second highest rung.

356
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:00,999
If only you could take
that final step,

357
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:03,902
you'd see further
than all the rest.

358
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:06,905
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

359
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,875
So Lord Reyne built a castle

360
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,877
as grand as Casterly Rock.

361
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:13,479
He gave his wife diamonds

362
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:16,048
larger than any
my mother ever wore.

363
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,417
And finally one day,

364
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,786
he rebelled against my father.

365
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:23,489
Do you know where
House Reyne is now?

366
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:25,057
Gone.

367
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,359
Gone.

368
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:29,629
A gentle word.

369
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:32,164
Why not say slaughtered?

370
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:35,067
Every man, woman, and child

371
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:37,570
put to the sword.

372
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,639
I remember seeing
their bodies hanging

373
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:42,308
high above the gates
of Casterly Rock.

374
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:45,245
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

375
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,680
It was a long summer.

376
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:51,350
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls,

377
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:53,452
and not a soul to hear."

378
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:00,659
If you ever
call me sister again,

379
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:03,328
I'll have you strangled
in your sleep.

380
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:36,761
What are you doing?

381
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:38,530
Your father's gone.

382
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:41,666
As the father of the realm,

383
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:45,103
it is my duty to give you
away to your husband.

384
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:09,624
You may now cloak the bride

385
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,727
and bring her
under your protection.

386
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,760
Could you...

387
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:51,669
Thank you.

388
00:26:57,276 --> 00:26:59,645
Your Grace, Your Grace,

389
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,247
<i>my lords, my ladies,</i>

390
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:05,451
<i>we stand here in the sight</i>
<i>of gods and men</i>

391
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:08,887
<i>to witness the union</i>
<i>of man and wife.</i>

392
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:12,791
<i>One flesh, one heart, one soul,</i>

393
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:15,728
now and forever.

394
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,045
Have you ever seen one like it?

395
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:38,014
I've never seen anything
like any of this.

396
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:39,715
Not in my life.

397
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,484
It's shocking, isn't it,

398
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:43,586
the first time
you encounter real wealth?

399
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,556
When I was your age, I lived
on one bowl of stew a day.

400
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:50,493
And stew is a kind word for it.

401
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:54,364
In Flea Bottom we called
them bowls of brown.

402
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,468
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

403
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,605
We knew it wasn't chicken.

404
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:16,354
Here, taste this.

405
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:18,924
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

406
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,612
That's good.

407
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,817
That's really good.

408
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,152
<i>Where do you think it's from?</i>

409
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,921
I couldn't even guess.

410
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:53,689
Doesn't matter, does it?

411
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:55,892
It's the real thing
or it's not.

412
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:59,095
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

413
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:03,466
Go on, have some more.

414
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:10,406
You still don't trust it.

415
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,008
You think this is all a mistake

416
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,744
and that you'll have to pay
somehow for every bite you take.

417
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:17,113
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

418
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,250
There are no mistakes.

419
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:23,219
Not for us.

420
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,822
I'm a mistake.

421
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:29,058
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

422
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:31,026
instead of the girl
next to her in the tavern.

423
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,763
Your father chose your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

424
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:37,566
He willed it so you
could be here right now

425
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,834
with a power inside you

426
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:42,870
you can't even begin
to understand.

427
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,976
And He brought me here
to draw it from you

428
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,978
and birth it into the world.

429
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:55,216
We're both a part of His plan.

430
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:57,885
He wants this for us.

431
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,755
No, He demands this of us.

432
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,095
I don't understand.
This--

433
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:08,930
this doesn't seem
very religious.

434
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:11,432
According to whom?

435
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,902
The Silent Sisters?

436
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,870
With their stern looks,

437
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:20,207
muzzled mouths,
and dried-up cunts?

438
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:24,177
What have their gods
done for you?

439
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:26,212
Hmm?

440
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:27,981
When you pray to them,

441
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:30,249
what's their answer?

442
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:32,852
A god is real or he's not.

443
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:36,722
You only need eyes to see.

444
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:44,396
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

445
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,399
A darkness that will
swallow the dawn.

446
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:52,271
And we can stop it, you and I.

447
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,568
Let me show you
what you have inside you.

448
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:24,637
Come fight death with me.

449
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,070
What are you doing?

450
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:01,175
You have to trust me.

451
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:25,900
What--?

452
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,336
Get it away.

453
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,737
Get it off me.

454
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:32,540
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

455
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,577
Why are you doing this?

456
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:39,581
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

457
00:32:39,616 --> 00:32:41,584
And you have so much blood.

458
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:44,653
No. No, no, no, no!

459
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,858
Not there.
Not there!

460
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,498
You can blame Ser Davos.

461
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:59,167
He didn't believe in
the power of king's blood.

462
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,438
He wanted a demonstration.

463
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:06,642
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, Your Grace.</i>

464
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:09,145
<i>My lord!</i>

465
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,248
The usurper Robb Stark.

466
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:52,954
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

467
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,661
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

468
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:21,481
So their son
will be your nephew.

469
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:24,117
After you're wed
to Cersei, of course.

470
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:28,456
And you will be
the king's stepfather

471
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,792
and brother-in-law.

472
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:32,693
When you marry the king,

473
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:36,597
<i>Joffrey's mother will</i>
<i>become his sister-in-law</i>

474
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:40,701
<i>and your son</i>
<i>will be Loras' nephew?</i>

475
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:44,471
Grandson?
I'm not sure.

476
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:47,041
But your brother will become
your father-in-law.

477
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,310
That much is beyond dispute.

478
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:12,332
Will you pardon me, my lord?

479
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:16,069
Of course. Of course.
En-- enjoy.

480
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:23,709
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

481
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,847
I've got a lifetime for that.

482
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:42,061
Stay.

483
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,905
You seem rather drunk.

484
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,742
Rather less than I plan to be.

485
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,645
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

486
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,246
This isn't about your wedding.

487
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:02,582
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

488
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:04,885
Your wife needs a child,

489
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:07,921
a Lannister child,
as soon as possible.

490
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:10,758
- And?
- If you're going to give her one,

491
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,793
you need to perform.

492
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:15,696
What did you once call me?

493
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:18,199
A drunken little
lust-filled beast.

494
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,802
- More than once.
- <i>There you have it.</i>

495
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,904
Nothing to worry about.

496
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:25,239
Drinking and lust,

497
00:36:25,274 --> 00:36:27,908
no man can match me
in these things.

498
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:31,211
I am the god of tits and wine.

499
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:34,681
I shall build
a shrine to myself

500
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:36,616
at the next brothel I visit.

501
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:40,053
You can drink, you can joke,

502
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:42,488
you can engage
in juvenile attempts

503
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:44,290
to make your father
uncomfortable,

504
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:47,126
but you will do your duty.

505
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:27,668
Well...

506
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,642
My father once told me--

507
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:36,912
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

508
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,505
Congratulations, my lady.

509
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:02,973
Thank you, Your Grace.

510
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:05,609
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

511
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:07,544
Soon you'll have
a Lannister baby.

512
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,781
It's a dream come true
for you, isn't it?

513
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:12,683
What a glorious day.

514
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:14,184
Yes, Your Grace.

515
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:16,620
I suppose it doesn't
really matter

516
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:19,156
which Lannister
puts the baby into you.

517
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,259
Maybe I'll pay you
a visit tonight

518
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,728
after my uncle passes out.

519
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,630
How'd you like that?

520
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:30,701
You wouldn't?

521
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:33,737
That's all right. Ser Meryn and
Ser Boros will hold you down.

522
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,044
Time for the bedding ceremony.

523
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:43,081
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

524
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:45,916
Where's your respect
for tradition, Uncle?

525
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,451
Come, everyone.

526
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:49,754
Pick her up and carry her
to her wedding bed.

527
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:53,524
Get rid of her gown. She won't
be needing it any longer.

528
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,461
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

529
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,329
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

530
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:01,566
There will be if I command it.

531
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:06,305
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride

532
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,442
with a wooden cock.

533
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:13,412
What did you say?

534
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,654
What did you say?!

535
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:25,324
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

536
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:29,828
<i>I'm sure Tyrion did not mean</i>
<i>to threaten the king.</i>

537
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,870
A bad joke, Your Grace.

538
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:43,474
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

539
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,378
Mine is so small.

540
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:50,248
My poor wife won't
even know I'm there.

541
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:53,618
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

542
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,054
<i>I am.</i>

543
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:58,289
Guilty.

544
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,192
But--

545
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,129
but it is my wedding night.

546
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:09,334
My tiny drunk cock
and I have a job to do.

547
00:40:12,104 --> 00:40:13,771
Come, wife.

548
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:19,610
I vomited on a girl once

549
00:40:19,644 --> 00:40:21,112
in the middle of the act.

550
00:40:21,146 --> 00:40:22,780
Not proud of it.

551
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:25,717
But I think honesty
is important

552
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:28,287
between a man and wife,
don't you agree?

553
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,790
Come, I'll tell you
all about it.

554
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:32,859
Put you in the mood.

555
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,060
Is that wise, my lord?

556
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:09,862
Tyrion, Sansa.

557
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:11,964
My name is Tyrion.

558
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:14,967
Is that wise, Tyrion?

559
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:22,207
Nothing was ever wiser.

560
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:36,620
Astoundingly long.

561
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:38,688
What?

562
00:41:38,723 --> 00:41:40,490
Neck.

563
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:42,325
You have one.

564
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,997
How old are you exactly?

565
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,266
14.

566
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:57,274
Well, talk won't
make you any older.

567
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:08,019
My lord father has commanded me

568
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,622
to consummate this marriage.

569
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:31,006
Stop.

570
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,443
I can't.

571
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,049
I could, I won't.

572
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,484
But your father--

573
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,086
If my father wants
someone to get fucked,

574
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,321
I know where he can start.

575
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:53,394
I won't share your bed.

576
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:59,066
Not until you want me to.

577
00:44:01,503 --> 00:44:04,405
What if I never want you to?

578
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:17,585
And so my watch begins.

579
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,173
19?

580
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,475
Yes, Your Grace.

581
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:17,444
How can anyone
speak 19 languages?

582
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:20,814
It only took Your Grace a year to
learn Dothraki reasonably well.

583
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:23,050
Yes, well, it was
either learn Dothraki

584
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:26,120
or grunt at my husband
and hope--

585
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:29,691
what do you mean
reasonably well?

586
00:45:31,127 --> 00:45:34,096
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

587
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,231
So guttural and harsh.

588
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,871
_

589
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:41,709
_

590
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:47,742
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

591
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:50,312
Athjahaka.

592
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:52,747
Ath-ja-hakar.

593
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:55,449
Athjahakar.

594
00:45:56,651 --> 00:46:00,254
Well, I suppose
I'm a bit out of practice.

595
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:03,557
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

596
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:07,027
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

597
00:46:07,062 --> 00:46:09,964
<i>It is the only proper</i>
<i>language for poetry.</i>

598
00:46:15,537 --> 00:46:18,339
No screaming or she dies.

599
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:33,054
What do you want?

600
00:46:34,556 --> 00:46:36,124
You.

601
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:37,692
Let her go.

602
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:39,961
Don't scream, lovely girl.

603
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:49,069
You were sent here to kill me?

604
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:52,939
So why haven't you?

605
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:54,474
I don't want to.

606
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:57,476
What do your captains
have to say about that?

607
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:59,745
You should ask them.

608
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:06,385
Why?

609
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:09,154
We had philosophical
differences.

610
00:47:09,189 --> 00:47:11,557
- Over what?
- Your beauty.

611
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:14,527
<i>It meant more to me</i>
<i>than it did to them.</i>

612
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:16,529
You're a strange man.

613
00:47:16,563 --> 00:47:18,564
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet.

614
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,099
I only do what I want to do.

615
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:22,035
And this is supposed
to impress me?

616
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,370
Yes.

617
00:47:26,006 --> 00:47:28,942
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

618
00:47:28,976 --> 00:47:31,378
They ordered me to murder you.

619
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:33,580
<i>I told them I preferred not to.</i>

620
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:35,982
<i>They told me I had no choice.</i>

621
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:38,085
I told them
I am Daario Naharis.

622
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,954
I always have a choice.

623
00:47:42,157 --> 00:47:44,859
They drew their swords

624
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:46,994
and I drew mine.

625
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,593
Will you fight for me?

626
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:29,370
Swear to me.

627
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:35,110
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

628
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:37,980
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

629
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:40,483
my heart is yours.

630
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:01,104
You really ought to knock.

631
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:03,407
I brought your breakfast.

632
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,950
It's getting dark.

633
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:25,152
We could stay here
for the night.

634
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,692
How hard can it be
to build a fire?

635
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:03,094
It doesn't matter.

636
00:51:03,129 --> 00:51:05,563
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

637
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:27,351
He winked at me before.

638
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:32,189
- I doubt it.
- I saw him wink at me.

639
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,591
He blinked.

640
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,427
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

641
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,562
between a wink and a blink.

642
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,098
A what?

643
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,737
Well, I mean,
there's no real difference.

644
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,809
A wink is on purpose.

645
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:57,481
You thought of a name yet?

646
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:04,355
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

647
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:07,558
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

648
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:10,261
What? No.

649
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,998
This is just the way I talk.

650
00:52:16,202 --> 00:52:18,337
I'll build that fire.

651
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:29,114
Don't you think
he should have a name?

652
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,419
I don't know many boys' names.

653
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,020
Let's see,

654
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:37,189
there's Duncan,

655
00:52:37,223 --> 00:52:40,192
Kevan, Jon...

656
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,127
Guymon,

657
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:44,395
Feldan, Tristifer.

658
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,131
Craster.

659
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,066
Uh, yes.

660
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:51,902
Maybe that's not--

661
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:53,937
Mormont.

662
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,406
That's a lovely idea,

663
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,374
but Mormont's a last name.

664
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,310
Why is it a last name?

665
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,047
Well, it's a family name.

666
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:08,718
For instance,
I'm Samwell Tarly.

667
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,021
Samwell is my birth name

668
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:14,424
and Tarly is my family name.

669
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:18,928
You see? So my father
is also a Tarly.

670
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:22,532
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

671
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,469
No, Randyll Tarly.

672
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,538
Randyll is a handsome name.

673
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,575
Please don't name him Randyll.

674
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,714
Is your father cruel like mine?

675
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:43,689
Different manner of cruel.

676
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,237
Not Randyll, then.

677
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:23,463
Don't.

678
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,298
Don't go out there.

679
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:27,266
I'll be back.

680
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:29,302
I just want to look.

681
00:55:04,604 --> 00:55:06,805
Go inside.

682
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,174
Go back inside.
I'll--

683
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:25,624
It's come for the baby.

684
00:55:40,807 --> 00:55:42,041
Stay back!

685
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,283
You stay back!

686
00:56:03,254 --> 00:56:06,030
No, you can't
have him! No!

687
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,234
No!

688
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:55,647
