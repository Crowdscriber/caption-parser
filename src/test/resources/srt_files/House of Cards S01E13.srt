00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,742
What was that?

3
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,702
The faucet.

4
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:10,788
It wouldn't shut up.

5
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,665
- Did you sleep last night?
- No.

6
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,752
I'll call Nancy
and tell her to call a plumber.

7
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,058
[Door closes]

8
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:35,896
Absolute discretion.
Can I count on that?

9
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:38,941
- Always.
- Raymond Tusk.

10
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:41,318
The President wants to tap him
as the new V.P.

11
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,947
- You and I cannot let that happen.
- Why not?

12
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:47,825
Because a third of his fortune
is tied up in nuclear energy.

13
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:52,496
Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear
businessman in the White House.

14
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,748
The market is shifting
toward natural gas anyway.

15
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:58,418
But Tusk wants to stall
that shift or reverse it.

16
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,504
Vice President doesn't have
that kind of influence.

17
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,047
This one would.
He and Walker are very close.

18
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,925
And it's in neither
of our best interests

19
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,213
to seep Sancorp's position
in the marketplace diminished.

20
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:09,638
- What's the ask?
- Tusk won't accept the nomination

21
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,222
if he thinks
his holdings are at risk.

22
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:14,142
Sancorp needs to initiate
a hostile takeover.

23
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:16,102
He's worth three times
what sancorp is.

24
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,313
I'm talking about
the subsidiaries.

25
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,983
We go after the companies that
refine and ship the uranium,

26
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,776
- the support system that...
- Come on, Frank.

27
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,778
There's stockholders
to take into account,

28
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,196
a huge financial exposure.

29
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:28,031
We just need to distract him.

30
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:31,075
Send a few token salvos and
intimate there's more to come.

31
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,495
All I'm asking
is that you speak to your client

32
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,206
and see if this is something they
might be willing to consider.

33
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:39,376
The President
announces Tusk on Friday,

34
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:41,018
so we don't have a lot of time.

35
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,009
- I'll make some calls.
- Thank you, Remy.

36
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:54,725
[Door opens, closes]

37
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:57,895
If he doesn't deliver,
I'm an invader without an army.

38
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:00,188
If he does,
I've got a fighting chance.

39
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:05,109
I just didn't feel that we could work
together constructively any longer.

40
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,278
I think that's
a perfectly legitimate reason...

41
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,906
Of course it is.

42
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:11,783
But what you can't do is
fire someone for being pregnant.

43
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,243
Is that what she's saying?

44
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:16,413
Ms. Cole claims
that you said,

45
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:19,041
quote,
"I need employees, not mothers,"

46
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:22,168
and, quote,
"go focus on your baby."

47
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,170
Can I see that?

48
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:28,050
That's completely false.
I...

49
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,176
- I never said that.
- She claims you did.

50
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:33,304
It's her word against mine,
right?

51
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:36,819
Well, juries are very sympathetic
with expecting mothers.

52
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,228
This is extortion.

53
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:41,939
We don't want this
going to trial, Claire.

54
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,482
You and your husband
are public figures.

55
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,860
This will result
in some very bad press.

56
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:51,281
I suggest we go back to them
with a settlement offer.

57
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,866
- We need the arrest record.
- There isn't any.

58
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,573
- They let him go.
- Then we need to know who got him off.

59
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,624
If Underwood was involved,

60
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,752
we are talking abuse of powers
and corruption.

61
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,128
I checked.

62
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,798
There's no files,
no mug shot, nothing.

63
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:10,842
Then we need to find the cop
who pulled him over,

64
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,012
or somebody who saw him
come into the station.

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,681
But D.C. cops...
they look after each other.

66
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,558
We need to be careful.

67
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,143
Do you have any sources
on the force?

68
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,437
Not that I would trust
with something like this.

69
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,522
You know, Lucas started out
on the crime beat.

70
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,441
I can see if he knows anyone.

71
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,485
- Would he help us?
- I don't know.

72
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:30,904
- Maybe.
- Help out a competitor?

73
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:33,939
We... stayed in touch.

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,453
[Scoffs]

75
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,999
You've gotta be kidding me.
[Chuckles]

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,626
This town is way too incestuous.

77
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,294
I know it's a lot to ask.

78
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,089
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around the affair, Zoe.

79
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,759
If you could just give me a
contact and maybe vouch for me...

80
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,469
Did you wait
to bring this up until now

81
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,387
because you thought
it'd be harder for me to say no?

82
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,683
- What do you mean?
- In bed, right after we...

83
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:02,477
You don't actually think
I would do something like...

84
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,480
- It sure seems that way.
- This is huge, Lucas.

85
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm trying to avoid
fucking up what we have...

86
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:09,901
Whatever that is... and you're
making it really hard for me.

87
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't know that I'll ever be the
kind of person that makes it easy.

88
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,197
I'm not looking for easy. But
I don't need to be reminded of him.

89
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:18,326
- I can't erase what I did.
- I know you can't.

90
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,181
But this is really
fucking manipulative.

91
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,339
Did you mean
what you said the other night?

92
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,899
That you probably...

93
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,050
I don't know what to do
when I hear something like that.

94
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:48,044
That's why I was so quiet when
you drove me to the airport.

95
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:54,654
I was angry.
I just blurted it out.

96
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,199
I wish I hadn't.
At least not like that.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,154
I'm not trying to take advantage
of you because you did.

98
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,332
- He hasn't said a word.
- And you haven't brought it up?

99
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,376
I just asked him if he was still
considering Tusk.

100
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,837
He said yes, but that he wanted
to speak to you first. That's it.

101
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,964
I wish we knew
if they'd spoken at all.

102
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,426
Well, he has a private line.
I can't track those calls.

103
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,970
- Frank.
- Mr. President.

104
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,847
Tell me about St. Louis.

105
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,517
He's a hard man to read.
I did my best to probe him,

106
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,978
but I don't think I left any
wiser to which way he's leaning.

107
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,067
I must say, though, I think he is
by far and away the best candidate.

108
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,111
Why do you say that?

109
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:38,500
Doesn't it make sense for you to
nominate someone you know so well?

110
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,825
I don't know him.
That's why I sent you to St. Louis.

111
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,869
Forgive me, Mr. President.
I didn't mean it that way.

112
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,622
I meant that the world
knows so well.

113
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,916
You, me, everyone
knows Raymond Tusk.

114
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,709
We don't need to convince anyone
of his worthiness.

115
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,502
But you said
he still seems ambivalent?

116
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,172
Which is why I think you should
make a personal overture.

117
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,133
Invite him to the White House.

118
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:57,534
Well, I don't want
to appear desperate.

119
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:58,635
I agree with Frank.

120
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:00,929
Inviting him
is a very good idea.

121
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,265
If you're serious about Tusk,
you should wine and dine him.

122
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,231
Make him feel very special.

123
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:07,060
I'm sure we can find time
in the schedule.

124
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:09,395
- Let's give him a few more days.
- We have less than a week, sir.

125
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:11,355
I wouldn't wait
any later than Friday.

126
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:14,234
We can make Friday work, sir.

127
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:16,569
All right. Well,
let's see if he's available.

128
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,822
[Knocking on door]

129
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:27,914
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

130
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,334
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

131
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:32,684
Just give it to me.

132
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:04,075
[Quietly] Have you noticed
anything weird in here?

133
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,743
Stuff moved around?
Anything missing?

134
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,912
- No.
- Anyone following you?

135
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,373
What did you find out?

136
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:12,334
This is serious, Zoe.

137
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,586
It goes way up,
as high as the commissioner.

138
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,464
I had to beg my contact at Metro
to give me this.

139
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:22,552
No record of Russo
getting pulled over,

140
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:25,013
but he remembers there was a
call girl brought in with Russo.

141
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:28,350
That's a file
on one of her previous arrests.

142
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,895
I've investigated
police cover-ups before.

143
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,480
I got death threats
for a year.

144
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:37,650
Are you willing to take
that risk?

145
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,943
Yeah.

146
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:41,029
[Frank]
How long?

147
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,198
[Remy] The next board of directors
meeting is three weeks from now.

148
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,908
That is too late.
Remy, look,

149
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,743
the President is gonna
nominate Tusk in a week or less.

150
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:48,245
I've urged Scott Cunningham
to call a special meeting,

151
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,413
but that doesn't happen
overnight.

152
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,916
There's a lot of machinery in
a corporate attack like this.

153
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,876
I want to meet
Scott Cunningham myself.

154
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:57,170
I'm not sitting you down with
Scott. You know the rules.

155
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:59,047
These are extraordinary
circumstances.

156
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,715
Frank, Sancorp's officers

157
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,300
do not meet with politicians,
period.

158
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,135
You talk to me,
I talk to Scott Cunningham,

159
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,720
and vice versa.
That's how it works.

160
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,138
All right, Remy.
Whatever you think best.

161
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,973
I'll call you
when I know more.

162
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,934
Nancy!

163
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:14,354
Of all the things I hold in high
regard, rules are not one of them.

164
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:17,190
I will not place my fate solely
in the hands of the middleman

165
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:19,483
if I can go directly
to the supplier.

166
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:22,195
Book a flight to Atlanta.
Tomorrow morning. Let Meechum know.

167
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,017
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,325
She grew up
in Lynchburg, Virginia,

169
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,286
went to Lorimer High School

170
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:31,329
until she dropped out
sophomore year,

171
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,373
and then after that,
there's no public record.

172
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:35,792
But all it says here
is that she was fined $300

173
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,420
for loitering on April 2012.

174
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,255
One of us
has to go to Lynchburg.

175
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:43,925
- Parents, classmates, teachers...
- I'll do it.

176
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:47,717
Okay. Well, then, you and I
have to call escort services.

177
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:50,932
I'm willing to lend a hand, but not
by making cold calls 12 hours a day

178
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,570
just to get hung up on
by hookers.

179
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,227
Where was she arrested?

180
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:56,604
- Connecticut ave.
- [Janine] 2460.

181
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,733
That's the address
of the district grand hotel.

182
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:19,252
[Man] I'm not a fan
of surprise visits, Frank.

183
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:20,795
[Frank]
Remy wouldn't arrange a meeting.

184
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,840
Remy Danton exists
so we don't have to meet.

185
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,343
I needed to speak with you.

186
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,345
There's a congressional
travel report

187
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,138
that puts you
on a trip to Atlanta

188
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,099
the same day I was pulled out
of an investors' briefing.

189
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,436
Those are the sort of
coincidences we want to avoid.

190
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,189
Were you briefing your investors
on Raymond Tusk?

191
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:42,775
Meechum can be trusted.

192
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,694
Why would I be speaking
to them about Tusk?

193
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,030
- I thought Remy filled you in.
- No.

194
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,073
He didn't say anything about the
vice presidential nomination?

195
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,076
He didn't. And I have a
feeling I'd rather not be told.

196
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:53,870
Trust me,
you want to know.

197
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,997
I've appeared in front of
grand juries before, Frank.

198
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,540
It's much easier
when you can tell the truth.

199
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,711
Please, don't put me in a
position where I have to lie.

200
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,587
If Tusk
has the President's ear,

201
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:05,882
you will see this administration
shift its support

202
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:08,592
toward nuclear energy
and away from natural gas.

203
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:11,095
His subsidiaries and his suppliers.
Go after them.

204
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,014
Frank, we should end
this conversation right now.

205
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,974
He will not accept
the nomination if his assets

206
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,185
are in a blind trust and he
can't fight off the threat.

207
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,608
- Okay, we're done.
- Scott...

208

I don't wanna
hear another word.

Go back to the airport.

needed to be in Atlanta today.

Hey.

You should head upstairs.

I was waiting for you.

- Yeah.

00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:53,246
Tell me what
you were dreaming.

Oh, it was so awful, Francis.

me sleep either.

Yeah. It's not him.
It's the kids.

237
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:09,131
I was playing with them
in the backyard,

238
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,342
and the girl
was climbing on the vines,

239
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:14,721
and I kept telling her
to stop and get down, and...

240
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:21,436
The vines just took hold of her,
and they wouldn't let go.

241
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:23,605
And she was screaming so loud,

242
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:26,482
and I just kept pulling
harder and harder,

243
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:29,026
and she just ripped in half.

244

He says you didn't
bring up Tusk.

You really think
he'd admit to that?

Well, now I'm in

It's not because
of what you taught me,

275
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,358
it's because I finally woke up
to what my value is

276
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,444
and how undervalued I was
slaving away for you.

This is business.

The message
was very clear.

She doesn't want a settlement,
no matter what the figure.

Even if we give her
worldwell back?

a formal summons next week.

- This is ludicrous.
- Her lawyers agree.

They'd much prefer a settlement
too, but she's not playing ball.

I'll keep pushing them.
But in the meantime,

against their own parent.

465

I'm trying to find
this woman.

466

If you make me
pull out my badge,

467

I have to take you in.

468

But I don't want
to do that.

469

Let's not make a scene.

470
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:17,355
I used to see her around.

471
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:19,940
She left the business, though.
We haven't really kept in touch.

472

Any idea where she might be?

473

A friend of mine
saw her waiting tables

474

at a restaurant
in Georgetown.

I guess the question
I'm trying to ask is, um...

Is it even worth that step?

477
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:41,616
The bottom line is that for a woman
your age, it's extremely hard.

478

Have you ever had a miscarriage?

Have you had any abortions?

483
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:56,256
Three.

484
00:28:57,423 --> 00:29:00,719
That can make it
more difficult.

485
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,638
I'm not trying to dissuade you,

486
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:07,351
but please make sure you think
long and hard before you decide.

487
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,477
But it's possible?

fit all the criteria?

489

Yes, it's possible.

- At the White House?

503

He decided to come in
a few hours early.

He had his own car pick him up.
I just found out.

00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:23,045
I'm in no mood for riddles.

622
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:26,214
Humor me a moment.

623
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:29,342
- Opium.
- It was bigger than opium, Frank.

624
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,553
That was simply the excuse.

625
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:34,305
Peking wanted to call the shots
instead of the west.

626
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:36,892
It's the same problem
we're facing now.

627
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:41,813
But nobody wants a trade war,
much less a military one.

628
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:44,440
And what's your opium?

629
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:48,195
Samarium-149.
I need it for my reactors.

630
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:52,365
China controls 95%
of the world's supply.

631
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:55,535
And you're worried about the imbalance
in our currency, our foreign debt...

632
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:58,872
- All of it.
- You already have the President's ear.

633
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:00,976
Trade tariffs
are controlled by congress.

634
00:39:00,977 --> 00:39:03,793
You have a lot more influence
there than Garrett does.

635
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:06,295
It's the reason I wanted you to
stay there in the first place.

636
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:09,112
And what exactly
would you want me to do?

637
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,198
Well, that part
I don't know yet.

638
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,950
We'll have to wait and see how
things play out with the Chinese.

639
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,112
I've already told you
I will not do a blank check.

640
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:22,250
I must say I'm surprised,
Frank.

641
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,585
You have a reputation
for pragmatism.

642
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:28,298
And I also have avoided a
reputation for indentured servitude.

643
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:32,010
I never make an offer
more than twice, Frank.

644
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:34,595
Tell me now if I can count
on your cooperation.

645
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:37,974
You're not offering cooperation,
you're demanding tutelage.

646
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:42,145
So let me make you
a proposal.

647
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:47,483
I am absolutely willing
to work together as equals.

648
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:51,071
I will take your opinions seriously,
just as the President does.

649
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:53,948
But I will not
bind myself to them in advance.

650
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:56,201
If that doesn't interest you,
fair enough.

651
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:59,704
Good luck finding a vice
President in the next four days

652
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:02,123
who will prove
as pragmatic as I.

653
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:04,584
You can't purchase loyalty,
Raymond.

654
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:06,253
Not the sort I have in mind.

655
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:09,089
If you want to earn
my loyalty,

656
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,549
then you have to offer
yours in return.

657
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,677
And if we can agree to that...

658
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:19,599
Well, you're a man
with imagination.

659
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:29,317
Wait.

660
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,706
If stamper was there himself,

661
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:47,543
this goes much deeper
than a lost arrest file.

662
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:54,134
Well, let's think about this.
What did Russo gain him?

663
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,718
A mansion in Harrisburg.

664
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,806
Uh-uh. Underwood
thinks bigger than that.

665
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,725
- Then what?
- I don't know.

666
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,352
He controls Pennsylvania.

667
00:41:04,353 --> 00:41:05,645
He has influence
in the White House.

668
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,230
Walker needs the state
for reelection...

669
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,733
No. No, it can't
just be Walker.

670
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,736
The President backstabbed him

671
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,989
for the secretary of state
nomination.

672
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,450
It has to be something else.

673
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:22,703
The President would owe him.

674
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:24,331
But what?

675
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:25,623
They already meet
once a week.

676
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:27,459
The education bill?
I mean, what?

677
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,793
What specifically?

678
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:30,253
He could be after
the V.P. nomination.

679
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,255
That doesn't make sense,
though.

680
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:36,009
The V.P. slot is on the table
because Russo tanked.

681
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,635
Underwood wanted him to win.

682
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,308
Unless he didn't.

683
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:45,977
Maybe he wanted Russo
to self-destruct.

684
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:47,561
To force Matthews to run.

685
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:50,564
Exactly. And then next week,
when Matthews wins...

686
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:52,233
The President taps Underwood.

687
00:41:57,822 --> 00:42:01,075
Mr. President.

688
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:02,743
Mr. Tusk.

689
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:04,412
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

690
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:08,833
Have a seat, Frank.

691
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,710
I have a confession to make.

692
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,087
Raymond and I
have known each other for years.

693
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:17,050
We don't publicize it, but he's
been a trusted advisor to me.

694
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:20,803
And I sent you to St. Louis
so he could spend time with you,

695
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,431
give me his two cents.

696
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:26,393
On what, sir, if I may ask?

697
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:29,562
Offering you
the vice presidency.

698
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:35,609
I told the President that,
uh, in my humble opinion,

699
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,654
both he and the country
would be well served

700
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:45,328
by a man as experienced,
intelligent, and loyal as you.

701
00:42:47,955 --> 00:42:51,016
So I'm officially asking,
Frank.

702
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,134
Sir, I... I don't know
what to say.

703
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,224
Say yes.

704
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:08,476
Yes.

705
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:11,521
It would be a great honor,
Mr. President.

706
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:31,791
Meechum.

707
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,293
I take care of my own,

708
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:36,463
and you've proved yourself
to be very valuable.

709
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:39,048
I would like you to be
part of my security detail

710
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,633
once I get confirmed.

711
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:42,176
That's the Secret Service, sir.

712
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:43,761
I'm capitol police.

713
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:46,931
Then I'll put you
on the Secret Service.

714
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:49,601
If you're interested.

715
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:51,978
I'd be more than interested,
sir.

716
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:53,813
Good.

717
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:56,483
And I'm extremely grateful.

718
00:43:56,484 --> 00:43:57,900
Keep being valuable.

719
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,153
That's the best way
to show your gratitude.

720
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:03,948
I will,
Mr. Vice President.

721
00:44:08,995 --> 00:44:11,747
Did the plumber finally come?

722
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:15,627
No. I fixed it.

723
00:44:15,628 --> 00:44:17,878
Francis.

724
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:24,511
So proud of you, Francis.

725
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:26,471
I didn't do it alone.

726
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,725
I got here
as quickly as I could.

727
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,978
Is something wrong?

728
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,440
I need you to be completely
honest with me, Christina.

729
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,942
About what?

730
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:49,944
The other day, when I said
that you should tell me

731
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,530
if anyone from the press
started harassing you...

732
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,412
Zoe Barnes?

733
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:01,789
You said you wanted to talk
about something on the phone.

734
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,124
Oh, no. That can wait.

735
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,627
No. Come on. Tell me.

736
00:45:05,628 --> 00:45:09,839
I, um... earlier today...

737
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,673
The rowing machine,
I saw, is broken.

738
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:13,968
Oh, it's my fault.
The cable broke.

739
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:16,387
I haven't been able
to replace it yet.

740
00:45:16,388 --> 00:45:19,807
What about going
for a run with me?

741
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:24,396
She's trying to smear
congressman Underwood.

742
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:29,233
It's a coordinated campaign
by everyone at Slugline.

743
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:36,407
But she knew things.

744
00:45:36,408 --> 00:45:37,575
Like what?

745
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:39,076
About Peter.

746
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:43,122
Something to do with Kern
losing the nomination.

747
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:45,916
And?

748
00:45:50,921 --> 00:45:52,590
Want me to drive
alongside you, sir?

749
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:54,050
No. You stay here.

750
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,427
Yes, sir.

751
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:57,970
You ready?

752
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:00,682
Yes.

753
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:52,830
