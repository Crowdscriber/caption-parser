1
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:22,143
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:25,478
What happened?

3
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:26,745
You nearly died.

4
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:28,715
Your brain was almost out of oxygen.

5
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:31,220
You'll be seeing black spots
for the next few days.

6
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,288
The rest of your senses
will recover naturally.

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,022
Did it work?

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,594
Did they come?

9
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:41,329
No, Mr. Walker.

10
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:50,237
There was no visitation.

11
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,627
<i>I waited as long as I could,</i>

12
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:05,828
but finally, I had to revive you.

13
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,135
They seem to have repaired
the damage done by the bullet.

14
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,404
How did you get in here?

15
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:21,839
I go where Grace goes.

16
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,306
I've been charged to protect her.

17
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,041
Have you?

18
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,810
You can't even protect yourself.

19
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,179
They may have given you speech, Pepper;

20
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:32,981
Even a parrot can be taught to mimic.

21
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,517
But did they give you
the capacity to think?

22
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,219
I sincerely doubt it.

23
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:42,055
Tell me, Polly,
what did they put inside her?

24
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:44,123
I won't tell you anything.

25
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,891
If you're not going to tell me,

26
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,494
then I'll just have to find out
for myself, won't I?

27
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:51,964
X rays will harm the life
growing inside of her.

28
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:54,233
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

29
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,568
Stupid man.

30
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:57,202
You think they'd allow you

31
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,737
to continue your barbaric practice?

32
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:00,438
She's protected.

33
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,207
Your X rays won't penetrate her body.

34
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:03,708
You'll see nothing,

35
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,443
but they've been watching you.

36
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:07,445
You think you're like them,

37
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:09,881
with your clumsy experiments.

38
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:11,228
But they laugh at you,
Dr. Arden.

39
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:12,850
They make jokes.

40
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,219
Here's a good one.

41
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:16,353
Knock, knock. Who's there?

42
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,088
Arden. Arden who?

43
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:20,157
Arden you the quack
who'd make a better duck?

44
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,826
Huh.

45
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,028
Well, if taking X rays won't work,

46
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:27,396
perhaps more invasive observation will.

47
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,198
I think her condition calls

48
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,200
for an emergency C-section,
don't you?

49
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,702
You can't do that.

50
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,105
Watch me.

51
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:42,544
Dr. Arden, you still see me
as microcephalic.

52
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,246
No one takes a pinhead seriously.

53
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:46,549
When my sister's husband
drowned her baby

54
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:49,151
and sliced his ears off,
he told everyone I did it.

55
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,820
They tied me up and paraded me
in front of a judge.

56
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:54,223
He took one look
at the shape of my head,

57
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,859
and I was locked up for good.

58
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,460
That's how it works for us freaks.

59
00:02:58,528 --> 00:02:59,828
We get blamed for everything.

60
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,064
But if something happens
to Grace in here

61
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,532
and she's harmed in any way,

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,368
there won't be anyone else to blame.

63
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,036
They'll take you,

64
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,306
open up your head,
and stir your brain with a fork.

65
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,642
And when you're returned,

66
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,812
you'll experience firsthand
how people treat us freaks.

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,114
I'll take care of Grace.

68
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,951
Why don't you go to your whore nun

69
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:24,553
and have her soothe your deflated ego?

70
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm haunted by the idea that
Leigh Emerson is still at large.

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,731
Believe me, Monsignor,
finding Leigh Emerson

72
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,652
is a top priority.

73
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,887
They're searching for him
in five different states.

74
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,656
It's a huge manhunt.

75
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,226
I'm filled with remorse
at my blindness about him.

76
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,161
You are not to blame.

77
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,541
I'll be sleeping right there,

78
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,410
if you need something during the night.

79
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,426
<i>Have you come for me?</i>

80
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,487
Why are you here?

81
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,189
You have more work to do.

82
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:29,294
The Devil lives at Briarcliff
in your favorite young nun.

83
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,229
You must cast her out.

84
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,035
<i>I'm too weak.</i>

85
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,369
God will help you.

86
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,672
She'll know.

87
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,774
Guard your thoughts.

88
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,042
Use your rosary,

89
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:46,911
<i>each bead is His Name.</i>

90
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,717
This is your moment, Timothy.

91
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,021
Thank you for everything, Sister.

92
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,391
I'll be back later.

93
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,495
I have to oversee a delivery.

94
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,597
Exciting new things
are happening around here.

95
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,472
She's doing this to taunt me.

96
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,786
People!

97
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,621
I have an announcement to make.

98
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,957
As most of you know,
recently our beloved recording

99
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:33,394
of "Dominique" was smashed
to pieces by someone

100
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:34,728
who shall remain nameless.

101
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,363
In fact, I'll just call her

102
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:38,965
patient number G2573.

103
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,935
But rather than allow one

104
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,171
bitter woman's actions
ruin things for everyone,

105
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,106
I've decided to take

106
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:48,642
this opportunity to bring Briarcliff

107
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,544
into the 20th century.

108
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:54,381
I dug into our rainy day fund and bought

109
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,418
this beautiful used jukebox.

110
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,287
I'm sure there's something
in there that can

111
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,855
appeal to everyone's taste.

112
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:02,089
Camels?

113
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,458
Pack of Camels?

114
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:04,759
No, Gerard.

115
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:07,528
It's not a cigarette machine.

116
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:09,329
It's a great big music box!

117
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:11,898
And for our maiden number,

118
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,700
I would like to dedicate this one

119
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,938
to our newest resident,
patient number G2573,

120
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,674
Miss Judy Martin.

121
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,843
Enjoy.

00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:33,344
the three of us sitting
around like civilized people?

147
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:37,982
That's a wise move.

148
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,450
I was about to bash your face in.

149
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:41,451
Hmm.

150
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,853
I know you were.

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,021
I admire your pluck.

152
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,656
It's a quality I hope

153
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:47,224
you'll pass on to our child.

154
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:50,227
Oh, she not tell you either?

155
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,729
Her attempts to self-abort
proved fruitless.

156
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:55,165
Our baby's strong, Lana.

157
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,433
A survivor.

158
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,768
And he's the only thing

159
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,637
that's keeping you alive right now.

160
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,339
As long as he's growing inside
of your womb, you're safe.

161
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,440
Then what happens?

162
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,109
You murder me?

163
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,411
Oh, no. I'll have
to keep you around

164
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,559
to breast-feed that baby
for at least the first year.

165
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,715
The health benefits are myriad.

166
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,218
You are one sick twist.

167
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,854
And you're a wanted man.

168
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,190
I wonder if they're offering a reward.

169
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,692
Find out. Turn me in.

170
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,727
Hmm. You'd like
that, wouldn't you?

171
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,261
Go to the police,

172
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,329
and your illegally obtained

173
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,664
taped confession goes with you.

174
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,899
We can discuss that

175
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,836
and other issues tomorrow,
when we resume your treatment.

176
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,771
That's right.

177
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,007
Sister Mary Eunice has offered me

178
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,242
a full-time position
here at Briarcliff.

179
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,846
She's a remarkably forward-
thinking administrator

180
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,013
for a nun, and surprisingly adept

181
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,783
at untying slipknots.

182
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,919
♪ You're mine ♪

183
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,354
♪ <i>Spell...</i> ♪

184
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,160
Everybody up and out now!

185
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,967
Step out.

186
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,301
Open those doors.

187
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,671
Get out here.

188
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,210
Open your door.

189
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,885
Room search, ladies.

190
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,588
We find it keeps our charges honest.

191
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,690
Are you mocking me?

192
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,292
I don't have time to mock you,
Judy; I have work to do.

193
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,080
A lot of work,
given your epic failure here.

194
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,863
You gave him a job?

195
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,831
Are you insane? Guards!

196
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,461
Dr. Thredson is on the cutting
edge of psychiatric medicine.

197
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,738
We need a guy like him around here

198
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,407
to whip this place into shape.

199
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,374
Yeah, well, he's here for me,

200
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,775
and you know it.

201
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,844
And when he murders me, which he will,

202
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,146
you will be responsible.

203
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,347
Oh.

204
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,481
Quite the contrary,

205
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,849
Miss Winters.

206
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,785
Dr. Thredson is
concerned for you

207
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,353
and for your unborn child.

208
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,456
Take her to hydrotherapy.

209
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,925
Strip her down and boil
her for 20 minutes.

210
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,527
No!

211
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,964
Anyone else have

212
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,165
a bone to pick with me?

213
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,000
I do.

214
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,104
I bet you do, Judy.

215
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,440
Let's have a look in your room.

216
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:16,409
Fine, there's nothing in there.

217
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,715
Judy, Judy, Judy...

218
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,786
Did you steal this from the kitchen?

219
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,488
I bet you got the idea from Shelley.

220
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,790
Very funny.

221
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,027
Do you think about the monsignor?

222
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,829
Vile thing.

223
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,465
This is awkward for me.

224
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,467
Given our prior relationship.

225
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,872
But I can't have you diddling
yourself all night long.

226
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,407
So punish me.

227
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,148
No, goddamn you... let me go.

228
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,116
This is sadism.

229
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,351
Quite the contrary...
you've exhibited clear-cut signs

230
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,386
of manic depression,

231
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,287
for which

232
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:02,688
electroshock therapy

233
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,190
is the prescribed treatment.
No!

234
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,391
Just look at Miss Winters.

235
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,327
It completely cured her gynephilia.

236
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,461
Sister,

237
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,496
Sister, I know somewhere in there

238
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,164
you can hear me.

239
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,867
This is wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong.

240
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,969
You know it's wrong!

241
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,275
Aw, Jude...
we're gonna burn those

242
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,577
bad memories right out of you.

243
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,479
That runaway groom,
those drunken blackouts,

244
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:30,316
all of it gone in a wisp of smoke.

245
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,552
She's right, you know.

246
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,223
Most patients experience a sense
of euphoria after the treatment.

247
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,490
May I, Doctor?

248
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,948
Yes, you may...
no higher than 50%.

249
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,912
She's one tough cookie.

250
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,624
She may need a little extra.

251
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,688
On?

252
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,894
Ow.

253
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:20,992
Oh, it's healing quite well.

254
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,963
Too well if you ask me.

255
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,764
What could you mean by that?

256
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:30,001
After showing such kindness to a
guttersnipe like Leigh Emerson,

257
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,872
you deserved to be canonized.

258
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:36,048
But these marks will fit
a future saint like you.

259
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,841
I command you, unclean spirit

260
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:40,410
now attacking this servant
of God, to obey me

261
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,546
to the letter... I, who
am a minister of God...

262
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,214
Good one, Father.

263
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,350
You want to hear mine?

264
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,987
There was a priest, the dirty
beast whose name was Alexander.

265
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,789
His mighty dick was inches thick.

266
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:54,224
He called it Salamander.

267
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,592
In Jesus' name

268
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I command...

269
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,899
Is yours inches thick?

270
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,168
Father.

271
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,706
Stop it, please.

272
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,409
Your body disagrees with you.

273
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,245
I...

274
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,481
I took a vow.

275
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:19,109
You don't say that with much conviction.

276
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:20,250
Please...

277
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,851
don't do this to me.

278
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,954
The Church means...

279
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:28,025
everything to me.

280
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:30,528
It's okay...
we're like Adam and Eve.

281
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,730
Two innocent children

282
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:35,433
discovering each other's bodies
for the first time.

283
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,906
This is your first time, isn't it?

284
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:43,642
Yes.

285
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:44,709
I...

286
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,145
gave my body to...

287
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,380
Christ!

288
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:50,082
What has he given to you?

289
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,986
Oh, come on.

290
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:56,589
Don't you want to feel what it's like?

291
00:14:56,657 --> 00:15:00,961
At least once...
before you die?

292
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:06,733
Does it feel like a warm,

293
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,936
wet... hug?

294
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,637
God...

295
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,240
you... have to...

296
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:14,975
stop.

297
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,309
Are you sure?

298
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:17,043
Yes...

299
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:18,645
No!

300
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:21,481
No, no.

301
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:23,450

Your name is Judy Martin.

368
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:41,212
Dr. Arden!

369
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,449
Dr. Arden, what are you doing?

370
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,284
An afternoon feeding, Hans?

371
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,385
That's unusual, isn't it?

372
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,120
I asked you not to call me that.

373
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,490
Oh, Hans, it's just us here after all.

374
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,759
There is no "us."

375
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,995
Ooh, don't tell me you're jealous?

376
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,866
He didn't mean anything to me.

377
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,668
That I believe.

378
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,304
You know what I was thinking?

379
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,640
Wouldn't it be fun

380
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,608
and, uh, therapeutically beneficial

381
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,576
if we gave her a transorbital lobotomy?

382
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,045
Crack that thick skull
open like a walnut?

383
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,448
No.

384
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:19,482
Why not?

385
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,517
Because you wish it.

386
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:36,631
The experiment is over.

387
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:52,146
My...

388
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:54,482
Quite a tantrum, Arthur.

389
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,887
It's a farce.

390
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:03,158
<i>Finita la commedia.</i>

391
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,241
You...

392
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,045
have no idea what
it means to have lost you.

393
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,053
Jesus Christ.

394
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,722
You're being pitiful, Arthur.

395
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,992
Then...

396
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,813
have pity on me.

397
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,399
Everyone, I'd like you all
to stop what you're doing

398
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,420
and go to the common room.

399
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:09,889
Hang up your aprons
and line up over here.

400
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:12,192
We'll all go together.

401
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:18,864
Jude,

402
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,099
will you remain here,

403
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,834
please?

404
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:24,970
The medication

405
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:28,273
they give you is strong, I know.

406
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:32,377
It affects your motor skills.

407
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:33,678
Here.

408
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:36,681
Take your loaf

409
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:38,550
and push it with the heel of your hand.

410
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,452
Like that.

411
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:51,396
I'm all right.

412
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:53,365
Yes, my hands

413
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:54,833
are all right.

414
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,835
I came

415
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:59,104
to talk to you.

416
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:04,009
It seems I don't know who else
I can unburden myself to.

417
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:07,980
You've always been a
loyal and honest friend.

418
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:11,850
You've always had the
gift of moral clarity.

419
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:14,687
I owe you an apology, Jude.

420
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:17,356
More than an apology.

421
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:19,758
There are no words for my regret.

422
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,166
The Devil...

423
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,202
lives inside Sister Mary Eunice.

424
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:30,670
You were right.

425
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:34,374
I tried to cast it out, but I failed.

426
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:37,477
In truth, it was an epic failure.

427
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:40,312
She'll destroy everything.

428
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,915
Why didn't I listen to you?

429
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:46,117
Why was I so stubborn?

430
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,887
She's destroyed you.

431
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:51,790
And now she's destroyed me.

432
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,830
My virtue is gone, Jude.

433
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,432
She took it from me,

434
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,268
violated me.

435
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:04,038
I tried to resist, but...

436
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,375
I don't know where else to turn.

437
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:11,079
I'm struggling with whether
I should renounce my vows.

438
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,285
I need your counsel.

439
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:19,787
Should I confess

440
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:24,492
and walk away from my beloved Church

441
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,394
and my dream?

442
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:35,670
What should I do?

443
00:24:35,738 --> 00:24:38,907
Kill her.

444
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:46,881
And have Kit Walker brought
to my office at 3:00 today.

445
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:48,249
Yes, Doctor.

446
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:49,751
Oh, and I think for this session,

447
00:24:49,818 --> 00:24:51,719
we'll want to secure him
in a straitjacket.

448
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:54,255
Will do. That's Dr. Arden's
office around the corner.

449
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:56,157
Thank you, Carl.

450
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:58,426
I can take it from here.

451
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:04,566
Dr. Arden?

452
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,402
It's Oliver Thredson.
Are you in?

453
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:11,640
Dr. Arden?

454
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,915
Are you here?

455
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:22,720
Now, where would you keep
your sodium pentothal?

456
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,941
Dr. Arden?

457
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,156
She's crowning.

458
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,194
"Be strong in the Lord

459
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:06,696
"and in the power of his might.

460
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,398
"Put on the whole armor of God

461
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:10,000
"that ye may be able to stand

462
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,935
against the wiles
of the Devil..."

463
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,938
"For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood..."

464
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,676
"But against principalities,

465
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,646
"against powers,

466
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,216
"against rulers of the darkness
of this world,

467
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,251
"against spiritual wickedness

468
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,353
in high places."

469
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,591
Are we having regrets, Father?

470
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,159
Did our little tryst

471
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:35,861
turn your stomach into knots?

472
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:39,864
Or are we ready for round two?

473
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,433
I have to admit,

474
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:43,268
I found your innocence...

475
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,370
quite intoxicating.

476
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,239
Don't touch me.

477
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,207
We will never repeat
our indiscretion again.

478
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,076
No.

479
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:52,611
It's not what you want.

480
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,913
You don't want

481
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,281
to lay me on the ground.

482
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,516
You want to bury me beneath it.

483
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,285
That's why you're praying for strength.

484
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:01,987
How will you kill me?

485
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,422
A letter opener?

486
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,057
No, I don't think so.

487
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,560
Unless you hit pay dirt
on the first strike,

488
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:09,628
it'll be messy.

489
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,463
What else?

490
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:14,333
You could bludgeon me
with the statue of St. Francis.

491
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,035
That would be ironic,

492
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,570
considering that he renounced

493
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:19,706
his debauchery before becoming a saint,

494
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,140
and you, Father, living your life

495
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,076
in complete reversal.

496
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:26,145
Could you wrap your fingers
around my throat

497
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,247
and squeeze?

498
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,616
Hmm?

499
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:36,489
Or will you use your rosary
like you did with Shelley?

500
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:37,824
I don't know what you're talking about.

501
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,659
Oh, you have

502
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,795
no secrets from me.

503
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:43,731
Especially not

504
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,933
after what we shared.
I know it all.

505
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,102
Don't worry, Father.

506
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,104
Your little fantasy
about killing me...

507
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:52,606
it hasn't put me off.

508
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,442
Quite the opposite.

509
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,845
I'm gonna make all
of your dreams come true.

510
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:03,483
We will rise in the hierarchy
of the Church together.

511
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:06,486
Bishop,

512
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:09,457
cardinal,

513
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,192
dare we even say...

514
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,494
pope?

515
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,099
I know it's what you want,
isn't it, Monsignor?

516
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,301
The desires of the
flesh, they're nothing

517
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:24,439
compared to the rewards of power

518
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:26,140
and ambition.

519
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:30,679
You don't know me.

520
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:32,814
I know you're weak.

521
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:35,851
But I'm strong enough for both of us.

522
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:38,753
You're mine now.

523
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:41,356
Body and soul.

524
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,599
I'm not yours.

525
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,467
I never will be.

526
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,770
I'd rather die than allow you
to defile the Church.

527
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:56,205
Are you talking?

528
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:57,712
You've suddenly grown quite tiresome.

529
00:28:57,774 --> 00:28:59,374
You'll not win.

530
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:00,809
You couldn't even defeat
Sister Mary Eunice.

531
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:01,944
Her purity remains alive

532
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,979
inside, I know it.

533
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:07,516
Don't make me reconsider
my largess, Timothy.

534
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,551
I will cast you out
and return Mary Eunice

535
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:10,853
to her state of grace.

536
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,759
I gave you a chance, Timothy,
but you've just

537
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:17,793
pissed it away!

538
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:21,163
I'm done with you.

539
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:23,432
And with your sweet nun,
I'm about to devour

540
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,534
the last morsel of her soul.

541
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:36,746
I'm sorry, Monsignor.

542
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:40,383
I'm tired of fighting.

543
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:45,622
I want to let go.

544
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:49,492
Then let go of me, Sister.

545
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,770
Take me.

546
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:37,608
I'll take both of you.

547
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:53,708
We beseech thee,
oh, Lord, in thy mercy,

548
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,913
to have pity on the
soul of thy handmaid.

549
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:59,614
Restore to her that portion
of everlasting salvation

550
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:02,050
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

551
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,688
She's been released

552
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:06,989
from Satan's grip.

553
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:09,425
Satan's or yours?

554
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,760
I was told

555
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,413
she fell from the third floor.

556
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,543
Evidently it was your grip
that failed her.

557
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:17,467
Her everlasting soul has been set free.

558
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:20,971
Now we must help it find rest.

559
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,307
It's time to prepare her for burial.

560
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,976
No.

561
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:28,212
She needs to be cremated.

562
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,780
Cremation is

563
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,015
a pagan practice

564
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:32,249
and a denial

565
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:33,650
of the Doctrine of Resurrection.

566
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:34,884
Monsignor,

567
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:36,386
the very cells of her body

568
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:37,587
were corrupted by the Devil.

569
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:40,023
No.

570
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:42,726
She has to be cremated.

571
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:44,795
The crematorium here at Briarcliff?

572
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,497
Is still fully functional.

573
00:31:46,564 --> 00:31:48,198
Very well.

574
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,500
I will assist.

575
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,769
That won't be necessary.

576
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:56,874
I want to do it myself.

577
00:31:59,712 --> 00:32:03,281
As a sign of sanctity,

578
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:06,886
sometimes God permits the dead body

579
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:09,822
to admit an odor of sweet perfume.

580
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,493
It was said

581
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,495
than when Santa Theresa de Avila died,

582
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,463
the smell of roses lingered

583
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:19,633
in the convent for days.

584
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:21,969
What do you smell now, Monsignor?

585
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:26,140
Nothing but decay.

586
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:51,099
3:00, right on time.

587
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,468
Want me to stick around?

588
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,736
He's got some attitude today.

589
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:54,904
We'll be just fine, Carl.

590
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,138
Thank you.

591
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,908
There's nothing you can do

592
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,944
to me to make me tell you
where that tape's at.

593
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,212
Oh, I'm well aware of that.

594
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,746
I diagnosed you long ago, Kit.

595
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:06,883
I know you'd rather die
than give me what I want.

596
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,987
But there's an impulse in you
that runs even deeper

597
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,256
than your martyr complex,
and that's your savior complex.

598
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:16,526
Particularly when it comes to women.

599
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:20,329
And, one would assume...

600
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:22,699
children.

601
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,970
Kit.

602
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:28,571
Grace?

603
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:31,508
No.

604
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:33,443
That's close enough.

605
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,813
It's not possible.

606
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,616
You were... Dead?

607
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:40,850
At least according to.

608
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,518
Dr. Arden's postmortem report.

609
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:45,154
Now, given Grace's condition,

610
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:46,723
one would either have to, A)

611
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,157
judge Arden as guilty of

612
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:49,793
one of the most egregious misdiagnoses

613
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,595
in the history of modern medicine,

614
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,932
or conclude that he's
been up to something

615
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,134
quite extraordinary in
that laboratory of his.

616
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,236
Grace...

617
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,539
says that's your son.

618
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,279
Now, what are we to make of that?

619
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:11,783
Is it true?

620
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:14,786
It's true.

621
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:20,258
You believe her, don't you, Kit?

622
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,728
What are you gonna do?

623
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:25,397
That's entirely up to you.

624
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,153
I don't want to ruin it

625
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:48,388
for you, but...

626
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:50,089
Spot jumps.

627
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:52,458
Where is the tape, you bitch?

628
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:54,427
Oliver, is that any way to speak to

629
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:55,795
the mother of your unborn child?

630
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,797
I'm the only one
who knows where it is now.

631
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,066
Kit's not going to find out.

632
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,602
And if you do anything to him,
anything at all,

633
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,037
or anyone else for that matter,

634
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:06,306
I'll find a way to get it to the police.

635
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:09,009
You know I can do it, Oliver.

636
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,745
I'm goddamn plucky, remember?

637
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:23,856
Margaret.

638
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:29,695
Kevin.

639
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,664
And, uh...

640
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:32,765
Milton.

641
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:36,569
Doris... Dor...

642
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,162
Dor...

643
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:40,439
No, Dolly. Dolly.

644
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:42,708
Clyde.

645
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,543
Uh...

646
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,615
Mother?

647
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,309
Hello, Jude.

648
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,820
Mother... Superior.

649
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,856
Claudia. Mother Claudia.

650
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:03,827
The monsignor said
you were speaking my name.

651
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,397
Wanted to say good-bye.

652
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,265
Good-bye?

653
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,267
I'm going to Rome.

654
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,436
The monsignor...

655
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,872
taking me to Rome.

656
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:18,907
We're going to be Pope.

657
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:21,244
We're getting married.

658
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,914
He likes my cooking.

659
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,052
I'm a rare bird.

660
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,136
Is it warm in Rome now?

661
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:37,827
She tried to steal... him away.

662
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,128
She rubbed her

663
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:40,963
naked body on him.

664
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,834
Ravish Me Red. Ravish Me Red.

665
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,469
Jude.

666
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,305
He killed her.

667
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,704
He had to.

668
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:53,142
We're getting married in the Vatican.

669
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,145
The Devil was jealous.

670
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,280
Try and rest your mind.

671
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,464
You're a little confused.

672
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,855
Do you see that woman
over there, smoking a cigarette?

673
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:15,433
Yes.

674
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,374
Her name is Lana Winters.

675
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,337
She doesn't belong here.

676
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,539
I put her here.

677
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:25,377
Help her...

678
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:27,312
get out.
