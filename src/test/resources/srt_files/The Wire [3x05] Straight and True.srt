1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,740
No, Bubs. I mean, there's gotta be rules,
or else things get fucked up.

2
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,647
Ain't no rules with dope fiends.

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,753
When the police got you shackled up,
you make a move, right?

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,048
You help yourself out.

5
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,783
But you just start snitching for no reason,
that doesn't make no...

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,882
Whoa, whoa! Let me track this.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,085
You hypopulating that you can tattletale
when you locked up...

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,221
but you can't do it
straight up for the money?

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,699
I mean, no offense, son,
but that's some weak-ass thinking.

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,270
You equivocating like a motherfuck.

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,670
Okay, so a snitch is a snitch, right?

12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,902
- There you go.
- So why be one, man?

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,875
I mean, we're getting by with our capers.

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,277
We getting by out here every damn day
ripping and running...

15
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,474
and ain't got shit to show for it.

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,949
It's part of being a soldier. I mean,
that's you, right, that's what you says.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,319
Yeah, that's why I put all this mileage
on these feet.

18
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,483
You wait.
You wait till you ain't a pup no more.

19
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,790
See if you ain't looking for something
a little more steady for your own self.

20
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,233
What the fuck? You ill already?

21
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,327
It's not even past morning.

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,306
I'm cool, man. I'm fine, I'm fine.

23
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,572
Look, we hook up with my girl Kima,
we get paid, you gonna be better.

24
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,580
Fuck that, Bubs, all right?
I'm not a fucking snitch.

25
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,651
You know I could argue the other side.

26
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,186
Say that if you drop dime
to duck a charge, then you a snitch.

27
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,257
You do it as a living, you a professional.

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,828
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
You see that ladder right there?

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,061
Just like old times, man.
I'll be the bad guy, you be the Lone Ranger.

30
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,763
Leave that man be.
We get paid more hooking up to my girl.

31
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,168
But that's cash money right there.

32
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,480
With the white man, I best be the bad guy.
That way he ain't confused.

33
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,646
All right, meet me in the alley.

34
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,148
Fuck.

35
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,329
- Yo, mister.
- Yo.

36
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,025
Throw down your wallet,
or I'm gonna jerk this ladder right out.

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,193
- What? No, no.
- I'm a poor man who ain't playing.

38
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,066
- Throw down the goddamn money.
- No, please. Help!

39
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,567
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey! Leave that man alone.

40
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,181
Oh, thank you.

41
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,821
It's crazy, man.

42
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,585
- What's that guy doing?
- Shit.

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,756
- Here, here.
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

44
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,123
No, you saved my ass.

45
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,197
It's appreciated, you know.

46
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,435
Yo, Bubs, you won't fucking believe this.

47
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,344
<i>Bubs...</i>

48
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,789
Dennis, you up? Dennis!

49
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,555
Mee-maw, hey.

50
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,331
- Guess you're not working today, huh?
- I'm working nights now.

51
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,802
At a bar. Working the door.

52
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,739
You know, it's <i>just...</i>

53
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,842
- Just till I find something a little bit better.
- Yeah, huh?

54
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,081
Reminds me.
Your friend called again this morning.

55
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,346
She said for you to remember
your appointment.

56
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,221
Says there's a job in it, if you still looking.

57
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,404
So Marlo, right?

58
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,950
He got this one boy watching his back,
name be Chris Partlow.

59
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,313
Bartlow with a "B"?

60
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,580
"Part," like white people got in their hair.

61
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,657
- And "low," like a low-bottom dope fiend.
- Partlow.

62
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,727
- Yeah, what I said.
- So he's Marlo's muscle.

63
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,890
They say...

64
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,430
- How much is that worth?
- $5, if I can work up a photo ID.

65
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,476
The boy, Fruit, he used that.

66
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,706
Fruit who runs one of Marlo's corners?

67
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,612
- Careful, it's got prints.
- Prints, huh? Look at you...

68
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,378
getting all <i>CSI</i> on me and shit.

69
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,683
Now, a burner with prints,
that's gotta mean cash money, right?

70
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,918
If I could pull a print, get Fruit ID'd,
I can go to $10.

71
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,691
And if I show you
where Marlo hides his Mercedes?

72
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,562
Benz would go for $15.

73
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,997
I mean, you don't know it,
but these are hard times in a hard land.

74
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,731
You killing me out here, girl.

75
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,932
All right. $25 for the Benz.

76
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,773
You good peoples.

77
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,742
So let's total up. We at $40, right?

78
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,551
- Here, bank that for me.
- Bank it? For what?

79
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,558
Got me a plan, girl.

80
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,891
The hoppers out here, they only be
wearing them big, white T-shirts...

81
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,589
a couple of times before they chuck them.

82
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,156
So I'm thinking, while I'm out here
working for y'all, I get my ends up...

83
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,898
sell them shirts on the corner.
I'll make my nut coming and going.

84
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,324
Truthfully, I don't know what more
you could have done.

85
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,161
Charlie's right, boss.

86
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,461
- You tried.
- Fucking hoodleheads won't cooperate.

87
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,534
Here you are
giving them their own block or two...

88
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,831
offering them a place to sell drugs
in peace, and do they even fucking listen?

89
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,963
It's a damn shame, too,
'cause if it worked...

90
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,871
you might have had a positive effect
on the community.

91
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,911
<i>Shift commander, call the front desk.</i>

92
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,845
You guys are some lying sacks of shit.

93
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,146
- I'm saying, sir...
- I'm guessing...

94
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,152
that you have some thoughts
on where we should go from here.

95
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,191
Well, sir, we were thinking
a modified zebra operation.

96
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,128
Jump-outs rotating from sector to sector,
combined with a zero-tolerance approach.

97
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,599
We detail a couple of men from each shift,
build a flex unit...

98
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,863
double up on the head-knocking
and corner-clearing.

99
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,599
- More of the same, you mean.
- But better.

100
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,799
Better?

101
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,532
Better than nothing.

102
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,367
Fuck this bullshit already.

103
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,463
Man, they gave us 15 cases of legal...

104
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,533
but they shorted us on the colored bonds.
What's going on there?

105
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,614
I got this.

106
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,390
- Officer.
- Detective, String.

107
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,891
You remember. Bird trial.
Detective McNulty.

108
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:26,226
You want something copied, man?
Search warrant, court papers?

109
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,200
- Anything I can do to help, you know.
- I ain't seen you around the way.

110
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,864
I'm not around the way no more.
You wanna find me, I'm right here.

111
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,007
Right here, huh?

112
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,705
This and some real estate
I'm working on is all.

113
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,508
You know, more than enough
to occupy me, really.

114
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,348
- Say, where you living, man?
- Where am I living?

115
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,584
Well, if you thinking of coming downtown...

116
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,254
I got some condos
about to come on the line in eight months.

117
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,196
You say the word, I'm gonna hook you up
something nice down there...

118
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,167
by the Hippodrome. Loft apartments.
Real nice.

119
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,872
You disappoint me, String.
I had such fucking hopes for us.

120
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,971
Have a nice day, Officer.

121
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,751
You see this shit?

122
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,787
Remember that kid
who got shot in the parking lot...

123
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,728
- in Lake Clifton a couple months back?
- Drug feud, right? What about it?

124
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,760
Well, last night,
they just found the only eyewitness...

125
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,099
- in an alleyway, bunch of holes in him.
- And?

126
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,073
What do you mean, "And?"
You're talking about a state's witness.

127
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,440
You let a witness get killed
in a high-profile case like this, it says...

128
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,140
"The city's broke and can't be fixed."

129
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,041
- Sounds like we found an issue.
- No, fuck the politics for a minute.

130
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,816
You know, this is something
we all need to be on the same page with.

131
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,355
I'm serious, Tony.

132
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,155
You let shit like this stand,
pretty soon you got nothing left.

133
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,060
You gonna go public
and bang the Mayor with it?

134
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,232
You gonna bang Burrell
and the state's attorney then?

135
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,301
I ain't gonna bang nobody.

136
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,339
Like I said, fuck the politics for once.

137
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,500
But there is a problem here,
and I'm gonna do something to fix it.

138
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,443
You want your cape
and the little red underpants...

139
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,077
or you stash that shit in the phone booth?

140
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,552
I always wondered about that.

141
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,990
- Man, I'd like a piece of that.
- You'd like any piece at all.

142
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,931
- Nigga, I'd like a piece of your mother.
- Yo, stop fucking around.

143
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,899
I ain't started that shit.

144
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,632
Yo, now she got our boy
with his nose wide open.

145
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,438
He's stealing from us,
and she most likely the reason for it.

146
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,174
Y'all stay with the girl.
She'll soon enough show us the money.

147
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,509
Hey, where you going?

148
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,380
Yo, I got something I got to do.

149
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,786
You supposed to be here
on this shit with us.

150
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,791
Y'all stay with the girl.
I'll get back with y'all down the way.

151
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,761
- Say what?
- Yo, I made a date a while back...

152
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,388
got to keep.

153
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,801
Man made a date, got to keep.

154
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,870
Hey, we find out he pussy-whipped
like this motherfucker over here.

155
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,937
Now, once again, from the data...

156
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,743
- when are most cars stolen?
- Sir, at night.

157
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,981
And your unit, which I believe...

158
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,519
is charged with deterring
the theft of autos...

159
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,314
when do you work?

160
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,914
The day shift, 8:00 to 4:00.
But, sir, as I tried to <i>explain...</i>

161
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,829
Your position is clear.
You effect more arrests of car thieves...

162
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,298
during the daylight than at night.

163
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,768
You see, our ears work. We heard you.

164
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,672
But the question becomes,
why the fuck can't you hear us?

165
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,800
Sir, I don't...

166
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,899
The Commissioner is attempting...

167
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,071
to move this department
from the Dark Ages into the 21st century.

168
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,481
That means preventing crime
by relying on computer-generated data...

169
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,349
not on your
fly-by-your-fucked-up-ass instinct.

170
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,426
Give me the auto-theft numbers
for downtown parking lots...

171
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,494
on Friday nights.

172
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,194
Sir, I have to check that.

173
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,797
Where are we with the gun?

174
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,802
Colonel, I was made to understand...

175
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,070
that recovering Officer Dozerman's
lost weapon was a priority.

176
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,874
The gun, yes, we're on it, sir.
Making progress as we speak.

177
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,707
Lieutenant?

178
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,980
Sir, I now understand
that prevention is the way to go...

179
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,613
and we'll immediately
change our hours to reflect the data.

180
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,588
All right, Lieutenant.

181
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,022
Fecal gravity.

182
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,262
You beat on the right people
and the shit rolls down the hill.

183
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,385
- Dennis, is it?
- Cutty works for me.

184
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,544
Cutty then.

185
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,556
So it's just gonna be us here?

186
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,097
- You know, I mean, Grace...
- Sister Grace called on your behalf...

187
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,167
but to my knowledge,
she didn't plan to be here.

188
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,334
She's a beautiful woman.

189
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:36,268
A man might say things he didn't mean
to stand closer to a woman like that.

190
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,035
You're in the job market though,
I understand.

191
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,273
A couple of questions.

192
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,044
You got a high-school diploma, GED?

193
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,481
Any work experience?

194
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,853
I worked in a warehouse
for a couple of months...

195
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,950
back in, like, '86.

196
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,995
How do you see the church helping you?

197
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,967
Maybe get me some jobs
or put my name on a list or something.

198
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,093
I don't know.

199
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,331
I should tell you up front,
we don't do like that here.

200
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,600
You want a job,
you're gonna have to work to get it.

201
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,176
We'll help, but it's gonna be your sweat.

202
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,476
With that said, then, the first thing
is to get you enrolled in a GED program.

203
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,750
Look, I don't mean to put you out,
but <i>this...</i>

204
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,815
This ain't how I thought it was gonna play.

205
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,962
Me, Oscar, a bunch of the guys...

206
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,968
we seen it.

207
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,699
Couldn't help it.

208
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,473
They practically ran right past us.

209
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,266
And the victim, the girl, had a gun.

210
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,907
Whose side was she on?

211
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,449
Couldn't tell.
They weren't doing slow motion.

212
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,348
Did any of them have a big scar?

213
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,290
Do you think you'd be able to recognize
any of them again if you saw them?

214
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,552
- Just Omar.
- So you know Omar?

215
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,855
Omar came up around here.

216
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,359
That's good, Bruiser, very good.

217
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,561
- You do know Omar has a scar, right?
- He do?

218
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,101
I think we better go to my office,
put this down on paper. Come on.

219
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,440
Officer. Excuse me, Officer.

220
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,713
Is this North and Pulaski?

221
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,124
'Cause I could fucking swear Dozerman
was shot up at North and Pulaski.

222
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,851
No, no, wait, wait, let me guess.

223
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,894
The pursuit of your fellow officer's
service weapon...

224
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,554
has led you to this fine citizen.

225
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,665
Tell me, kind sir, do you know
the whereabouts of said officer's weapon?

226
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,360
I didn't think so.

227
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,802
Calls from the detention center.

228
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,298
Some kind souls begging to assist you...

229
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,008
in your foundering investigation.

230
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,775
Let me just grand-jury my man here,
lock in his story.

231
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:04,117
Now for the gun. Later for his story.
And that's your sergeant talking.

232
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,608
Yo, wipe your nose, yo.

233
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,607
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

234
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,275
Motherfucker, you scared the shit
out of us coming up like that.

235
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,513
This shit do make you paranoid, yo.

236
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,524
- Go on, nigga, hit this shit.
- No, man, I gotta drop urine tomorrow.

237
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,225
Yo, you worried about that?

238
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,455
Go ahead, nigga. We got that covered.

239
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,259
Oh, you got that covered?

240
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,563
What, you think
you're the only motherfucker on parole?

241
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,763
- Yo, nigga, give me that shit.
- There you go.

242
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,646
All right. What was her day?

243
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,154
She caught a hack
up to Towson Town Mall.

244
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,589
Hit two jewelry stores
and came back with bags from both.

245
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,957
By the time she caught up with our boy...

246
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,758
she was wearing one of them shits
around her neck.

247
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,357
- Gave the other one to him.
- You know, his and hers, like.

248
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,531
Yeah, Cutty. She was on that shit, man.

249
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,540
It's been a week, McNulty.

250
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,081
Either you got something on Stringer
or you don't.

251
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,312
He tried to sell me a condo.

252
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,714
Cocksucker.

253
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,451
Might as well join the Rotary
and take up golf or some shit.

254
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,963
He's running with the hounds,
though I'll bet his heart is still with the fox.

255
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,092
Stringer's out of the game?

256
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,466
Mr. Bell has become the bank.

257
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,328
The bank?

258
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,877
The bank plays it legit.
He generates a good bit of honest income.

259
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,446
But at the same time,
his money finances packages...

260
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,879
that he himself will never touch.

261
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,473
He won't go near the street.

262
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,815
He's insulated
from the everyday operations of the corner.

263
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,354
The money that comes back
is then laundered through...

264
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,426
enough straight business investments
that there's no way to trace it.

265
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,690
A player gets to that point,
there ain't no way in hell...

266
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,526
a working police
is going to tie a can to his tail.

267
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,759
Oh, man.

268
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,303
So, Kintel Williamson,
the prince of Pimlico.

269
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,298
- Where we at on this mope?
- DNRs on a couple of payphones.

270
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,858
That got it?

271
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,630
All right.

272
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,308
You gonna help or what, boy?

273
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,310
Might as well not even take a whistle...

274
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,540
if all I'm doing
is standing in the fucking alley.

275
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,673
Back's where you belong.

276
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,878
Thataway I ain't got to be worrying
about getting my damn head blown off...

277
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,320
- 'cause you all scared and shit.
- Enough.

278
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,858
Y'all hear me? I said enough.

279
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,955
Come over here and put some pumpkin
balls in this shotgun, man. Kimmy!

280
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,496
Both of y'all learn to live with it,
or y'all out, man.

281
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,780
Now, this time we gonna do it right.
Y'all feel me?

282
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,812
Boss, you gotta let this go.
It ain't gonna work.

283
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,014
You said in COMSTAT shit rolls down.

284
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,581
Now, we tried to talk to all the hoppers.
What the hell can they do about anything?

285
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,957
We need to bring it to the dealers.

286
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,124
Sergeant...

287
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,900
I need a list of names of all
the mid-level dealers running my corners.

288
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,296
Sir?

289
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,534
You are my DEU, Sergeant, right?
I need a list of names.

290
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,079
Maybe Narcotics downtown
has something like that. I don't know.

291
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,977
We're knocking heads, taking bodies.

292
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,017
I didn't know I was supposed
to be doing a census or nothing.

293
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:37,089
Hey, yo, miss.
Miss, where the pee-pot at? Thanks.

294
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,822
Come on, this way.

295
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,025
- Yo, my man need to drop a negative.
- Yeah.

296
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,569
- $5.
- Motherfucker, they was just $2.

297
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,941
You try finding clean piss in Baltimore.
$5 a go.

298
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,310
- Yo, how I know it's clean?
- I get mine from daycare.

299
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,725
I need you to put the chicken
in the oven at 375.

300
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,093
Yes, and after you're done that, I need you
to help me put your sister down...

301
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,530
Excuse me, miss.

302
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,499
Put your thumb on the scanner.

303
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,330
Hold on a second.

304
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,067
- What's your name?
- Wise, Dennis Wise.

305
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,411
Take one of those.
Go around the corner to the second door.

306
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,109
No, you cannot go outside.

307
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,653
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

308
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,711
That's all we got on the Westside dealers.

309
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,018
George. I'm looking
at a sprinkling of rap sheets here.

310
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,093
Well, you telling me
nobody in this department know...

311
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,854
who controls
West Baltimore corners anymore?

312
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,658
Hey, Rawls has my people doing street rips.

313
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,757
You want up-to-date info,
you should try the intelligence unit.

314
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,598
- Shit, they sent me to you, George.
- What the fuck can I tell you?

315
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:29,765
With all the street work, ain't nobody
left doing the high-end drug stuff.

316
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,842
From what I'm hearing,
the guy comes in of his own accord...

317
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,416
and he gets betrayed by us.

318
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,787
Protection in this city amounts
to nothing more than getting dumped...

319
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,585
in a fleabag joint on Route 40
and calling it a plan.

320
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,522
No monitoring, no assistance.

321
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,154
Nothing. Just a bundle of clothes
and a toothbrush.

322
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,425
- Jesus.
- No way to treat a cooperator.

323
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,332
I know someone could get
a lot of mileage out of this with the press.

324
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,234
But fuck that, right,
because if I go that way...

325
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,806
then everybody gets defensive
and nothing gets fixed.

326
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,672
- I'm coming to you with this, straight up.
- Agreed.

327
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,969
Where do we stand on this?

328
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,173
You've already called for a meeting
on this with the state's attorney...

329
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,310
and the Police Commissioner.
It's penciled in for next Wednesday.

330
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,446
No, no, Tommy's right on this.
We need to act quickly.

331
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,323
I'm glad you came to us with this.
I'll light a fire, believe me.

332
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,623
All right, thanks.

333
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:32,435
- You will keep me in the loop on this?
- Yeah, absolutely. Councilman.

334
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,850
Hey, slow up, girlfriend,
we need to talk for a minute.

335
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,479
- Yeah, sweet thing.
- We met before?

336
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,117
- No, baby, but that can happen.
- We ain't met, excuse me.

337
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,752
- Hey, it's just talk, baby.
- Get the fuck out the way.

338
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,728
Look, girl,
all we need for you to do is talk...

339
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,560
Is you deaf or just stone stupid?

340
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,601
- Look, hold on, girl, all we wanna do...
- Whoa!

341
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,670
Damn.

342
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,064
Now, we gonna talk.

343
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,275
How the fuck is this little runt of a unit...

344
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,080
holding all this drug intelligence?

345
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,781
I made the rounds down at headquarters
and came up with jack...

346
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,323
and y'all holding all this.

347
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:30,326
Well, you run a couple of wiretaps,
you fill up a file cabinet pretty fast.

348
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,797
This is great. Thanks.

349
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,270
Oh, shit! God damn it!

350
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,507
I heard this was where you landed.

351
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,203
This pretty boy, I broke his ass in.

352
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,043
I wrote more on ID complaints
on Bushy-top here...

353
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,482
than on the whole goddamn squad.
That is, till he scuffed himself up.

354
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,213
Now where you at, McNulty?

355
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,721
1911 South Clinton Street, first floor.

356
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,347
There you go.

357
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,589
Yeah. I know you got to keep him close...

358
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,896
but still,
that's a good goddamn police right here.

359
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,438
So what brings you to our shop?

360
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,371
I'm trying to find out
who running my corners.

361
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:22,378
My own DEU is just about street rips,
and headquarters wasn't no help, neither.

362
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,380
- Y'all saved my ass, though.
- You tell him about your boy Marlo?

363
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:31,546
It's in the files, along with
every other mid-level player we know.

364
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:35,319
You don't mind me asking,
what are you gonna do with all that, Major?

365
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,392
Well...

366
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,063
we'll round up these young men...

367
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,964
and put a little COMSTAT on their ass.

368
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,563
Gentlemen. Ma'am. Bushy-top.

369
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,606
Bushy-top?

370
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,720
Uh, point of order and shit.

371
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,882
Chair recognize the esteemed rep
of the Veronica Avenue boys.

372
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,359
All right, look,
we done talked this shit to death, all right?

373
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,095
- When we gonna vote?
- Rick do have a point.

374
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,963
All right, then.
All those in favor of going together...

375
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,368
so we can get the best discount
on a New York package, raise up.

376
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,350
- All right, then.
- There it is.

377
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,113
Look like we gonna make
more money, together.

378
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,887
Got to say I'm proud of y'all
for putting aside petty grievances...

379
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,894
and putting this thing together.

380
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,932
For a cold-ass crew of gangsters,
y'all carried it like Republicans and shit.

381
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,470
Yo, remember, man,
talk this shit up when you hit them bricks.

382
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,061
Best way to get more involved
is to tell people...

383
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,073
about the benefits of this here thing.

384
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,837
No beefing, no drama, just business.

385
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,708
Anybody got problems
with anybody else here...

386
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,580
we bring it to the group.
We ain't gotta take it to the streets.

387
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,987
All right. Let's do it.

388
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,024
- All right.
- Yo.

389
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,155
Motherfucker, what is that?

390
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,995
The Robert Rules say we gotta have
minutes for a meeting, right?

391
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,398
These the minutes.

392
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,461
Nigga, is you taking notes
on a criminal fucking conspiracy?

393
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,803
What the fuck is you thinking, man?

394
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,083
- That's cool.
- Dad, he's cheating.

395
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,745
Michael, take it easy on your brother.

396
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,756
How are you two getting along
with Mom's new friend?

397
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,955
- We call him Dennis. He's not new.
- Okay, how are you doing with him?

398
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,691
Mom says we can't talk to you
about family stuff.

399
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,892
Dad, you going to the open house?

400
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,599
Yeah, I'll try.
I've been real busy at work though.

401
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:05,403
- New case and all.
- Mom says you have to go, Dad.

402
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,310
Yeah, all the other kids' fathers
are gonna be there.

403
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,749
Get his legs.

404
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:39,400
- Steal from us, motherfucker, huh?
- Get the ring, too, yo.

405
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:45,072
- Shit won't come off, yo.
- Drop him.

406
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,117
You know the man works for us.

407
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,051
You keep going at him like that...

408
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,528
ain't gonna be nothing left of him
to make right what he owes.

409
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,643
Bitch got to pay.

410
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,250
- Hey, yo, check his pockets, yo.
- Right.

411
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,884
- That dog's mine, yo.
- Fuck off! Get the fuck off!

412
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,864
What's up, baby?

413
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:47,937
Yo, man, I been in here for 26 months...

414
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,843
you come pick me up
in a motherfucking Ford?

415
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm just fucking with you. What's up, baby?

416
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,779
What up, man?

417
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,916
Man, I'm feeling real good to be out
of this motherfucker. You know what?

418
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,257
There's a sign on the other side
of this gate that say, "Never again."

419
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,662
And that's the only fucking thing
I'm gonna take with me from this place.

420
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,427
First things first, man.
Let's get you looking right.

421
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,524
You know what I mean?

422
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:16,072
You got my shit. Oh, yes. Yes.
Good looking, baby.

423
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,648
Start with Sector One.

424
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,282
Bring as many as you can down to the
Vincent Street area by the end of the shift.

425
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,587
Don't use your wagons.

426
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,889
Bring as many as you can in your cars.

427
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,558
The hoppers wouldn't listen.
What makes you think these guys will?

428
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,769
These are lieutenants running the corners...

429
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,963
and I personally feel their pain.

430
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:55,237
Now, middle-management means
that you have just enough responsibility...

431
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,576
that you got to listen when people talk...

432
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,673
and not so much...

433
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,719
that you can tell anybody
to go fuck themselves.

434
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:33,444
Look, my major just wants to talk.
That's all, I promise.

435
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,987
- We'll bring you right back.
- That ain't gonna happen.

436
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,385
What the fuck you say?

437
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,655
What the fuck you mean,
it ain't gonna happen?

438
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:48,095
Let me tell you something, motherfucker.
We got orders to bring your sorry ass...

439
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,167
down the way for a sit down with our boss.

440
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,566
Now we're prepared
to take you with us right now.

441
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,833
- We can either do this the easy <i>way...</i>
- Brain-dead fucks.

442
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,771
It's up to you.

443
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,207
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Prez, it's me.

444
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:04,304
I think we got a little situation here.
Stay with me. 10-6.

445
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,009
Major wants the dickhead, you gotta go.

446
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,245
I think he gets a pass this time.

447
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,757
You sure? I mean, you want, he goes.

448
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,292
Another time, Herc.

449
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,353
We're on the Major's clock here.

450
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,001
Don't forget the face, cocksucker.
It's gonna be here tomorrow.

451
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,743
<i>- You need me to call dispatch?</i>
- No, it's okay. I'll tell you later.

452
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,284
I say we get the troops
and fuck these assholes up.

453
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,196
- Come on, let's go again.
- Come on, Tommy, it's just a game.

454
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:05,074
Look, sounds like you got what
you want, anyway. From the Mayor, I mean.

455
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,043
Yeah, well, he's played me before.

456
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,704
But so help me...

457
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,078
if he farts around on this...

458
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,651
I'm going after him. Big time.

459
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,648
- For real?
- Trust me on this.

460
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,493
He keeps ducking me,
I'm gonna fuck him good.

461
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,252
That's the good part.

462
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,729
It's what I call the carrot.

463
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,394
Now you move your people
into any designated area I told you about...

464
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,404
and you'll have immunity
from arrest and prosecution.

465
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,634
You're free to make your drops,
collect what need collecting...

466
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,076
won't nobody bother you.
You got my word on it.

467
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:47,243
- What do you get out of this?
- That's a fair question.

468
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,180
I want to salvage
what's still worth salvaging in my district.

469
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,950
And I can't do that with a bunch
of young hoppers running around...

470
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,025
scaring the hell out of decent people.

471
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,220
Now, these kids ain't gonna listen to me,
but they will listen to y'all.

472
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,457
Now, you tell them to move down here,
set up a shop, and they will.

473
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,899
So the way I got it figured, I motivate you...

474
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,171
- and you motivate them.
- No, this is a trap.

475
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,400
No, you check out the spot.

476
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,343
There ain't no cameras,
ain't no microphones, nothing.

477
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,438
Any cops you see
going to be down right on the perimeter.

478
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,417
Just to make sure there's no violence.
And you watch.

479
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,454
You see if it don't work out the way I say.

480
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,616
Nothing personal against you, Chief...

481
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,863
- but what happens if we buck?
- You remember the carrot, right?

482
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,469
Well, you choose the stick instead...

483
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,800
you gonna feel that stick
like you ain't never felt before.

484
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,870
We gonna indict every corner, every day.

485
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,606
I got over 200 sworn personnel,
and I plan to free up every one of them...

486
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,512
to knock every one of y'all down they can.

487
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,212
You're on a corner in my district,
it ain't gonna be about no humble...

488
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,756
it ain't gonna be about no loitering charge,
nothing like that.

489
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,619
There gonna be some biblical shit
happening to you on the way...

490
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,888
to that motherfucking jail wagon.
You understand me?

491
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,090
And while you're bucking the new system,
the smart ones among you...

492
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,659
gonna be down here,
making money hand over fist.

493
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,133
So think it over.

494
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,873
But I swear to God, come Monday...

495
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,706
your world and mine
ain't gonna be the same.

496
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,313
I thought you said
these goddamn houses were vacant.

497
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,223
- We must have missed her.
- There's one more thing I gotta do then.

498
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,114
Little man, up on B tier,
one of his boys in the dormitory...

499
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:03,453
his brother's tight with the girlfriend
of the boy that shot that police.

500
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,517
Little man saying,
"If you sprung the three of us...

501
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,391
"we can get her talking."
You know, find the gun.

502
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,755
Yo, I'm hearing the boy, Dink,
got that man's gun.

503
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,835
Now, I ain't sure yet if that Dink be...

504
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,871
Dink Dink or Inky Dink or maybe Fat Dink.

505
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,009
Then again, it might be Flatnose Dink.
No, wait.

506
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,208
Nah, nah, that can't be him, that Dink dead.

507
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,509
Look, man, I can help you.

508
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,642
But first you gotta get me out
from under these murder beefs.

509
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,084
Yeah. How many murders are we talking?

510
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,292
Look, man, do it have to be the cop's gun?

511
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,990
'Cause if it's guns you want,
I can get you guns.

512
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,600
I remember this. Sixth grade.

513
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,943
Mrs. Holley's science class. Box lunches.
Taste like shit.

514
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,748
You got something so important, man,
you can't go through the proper channels?

515
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,913
Well, no. I don't know.

516
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:17,485
I just figured if I told anybody but you,
you might think I'm riding the rock.

517
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,324
What makes me think you ain't?

518
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,960
Yeah, right. That's a good point.

519
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:26,196
Look, today, me, Tuckie, Little Mikey...

520
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,603
man, we all, a bunch of us
got scooped up by the police.

521
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,634
Well, you shouldn't sell drugs.

522
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,644
All right, all right.

523
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,717
Nah, see, they didn't take us to the station.

524
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,791
They took us down to the bottom
of Vincent Street...

525
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,827
where all the houses is boarded up,
and they let us out.

526
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,193
And then, on top of all of that, like,
the whole while they was being...

527
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:58,462
all like decent and shit,
and you know that fucked me up.

528
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,462
And then, like,
the police chief, he come out...

529
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,403
and this is the crazy part...

530
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,205
he say that he got it set up
so where we could sell stuff...

531
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,748
in certain spots,
and the police won't bother us.

532
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,748
I know, I know. It's fucked up...

533
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,947
but I just thought you should know.

534
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:25,217
- That's it?
- Yeah, just that and the boy Marlo.

535
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,531
Yeah, I'm on it.

536
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,069
Yep.

537
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,116
23-03 to KGA.

538
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,456
Have Foxtrot meet me on six, Adam.

539
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,293
<i>- Foxtrot, 10-4.</i>
- 23-03 to Foxtrot.

540
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,029
<i>- Foxtrot, standing by.</i>
- It's a black Mercedes, pulling out the lot.

541
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,298
<i>Copy that, we got the eyeball.</i>

542
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,523
This here the spot? 'Cause Tuckie says
we supposed to set up shop here.

543
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,556
- Hamsterdam.
- Yeah, this is it.

544
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,633
Set up anywhere inside
where we got the white flags.

545
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,572
- Yo, I'm getting ready to roll out.
- You just got here. What's wrong?

546
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,440
Ain't nobody around to buy.

547
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,880
Good point.

548
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,018
- Man needs customers.
- I'm saying...

549
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,023
No. I mean, you can't make me.
I'm a sworn fucking police officer.

550
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,334
What's up, man?
You got that Body Bag still? Two.

551
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,172
Narco.

552
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,314
- Give it up, motherfucker.
- Money comes back, right now.

553
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,027
Boss, you fucking up, man.

554
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,323
You didn't let me cop
before you snatch me up.

555
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,126
Is that some fucking rule?

556
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,066
You call, we haul. You clean?

557
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,832
Yeah, of course I'm clean.

558
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,134
Stupid-ass rookie
didn't even give me a chance to cop.

559
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,502
This corner's indicted.

560
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,239
You move over to Vincent Street,
or we come back with the bracelets.

561
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,041
<i>Anybody available for...</i>

562
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,704
<i>- What you got?</i>
- 10-11 me at Riggs and Calhoun.

563
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,903
<i>Despite unforeseen delays...</i>

564
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,211
<i>we will begin an academy class</i>
<i>this January...</i>

565
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,445
<i>which leaves us in good shape</i>
<i>for the coming year.</i>

566
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,015
<i>Thank you, Commissioner.</i>

567
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,058
<i>The chair pleases,</i>
<i>I have a couple of questions.</i>

568
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,954
<i>Commissioner, I know that you are aware</i>
<i>that a state witness...</i>

569
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,827
<i>in a recent city homicide prosecution</i>
<i>was killed.</i>

570
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,098
<i>We are treating that incident</i>
<i>with the highest priority.</i>

571
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,172
<i>Homicide has set up a task force...</i>

572
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,798
<i>and Narcotics is working</i>
<i>the informant angle.</i>

573
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,871
<i>We have also asked both the FBI</i>
<i>and DEA for support.</i>

574
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,040
<i>It sounds like a full-court press,</i>
<i>but you must admit...</i>

575
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,381
<i>it's a bit like closing the barn door</i>
<i>after the horse is out.</i>

576
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,455
<i>I mean, the shooting of the boy</i>
<i>on a lot at Lake Clifton High School...</i>

577
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,252
<i>was a high-profile case,</i>
<i>wasn't it, Commissioner?</i>

578
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,222
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

579
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,991
<i>And yet a key witness in the case</i>
<i>was allowed... One moment.</i>

580
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,767
<i>Excuse me, Commissioner, but the chair</i>
<i>was good enough to remind me...</i>

581
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,806
<i>that you have a pressing engagement.</i>

582
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,309
<i>So if it's all right with you,</i>
<i>we can continue this at a later date.</i>

583
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,742
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

584
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,016
Did you see Burrell sweat?

585
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,612
- The man's collar almost melted.
- What the hell got into you?

586
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,522
You did, old buddy. You did.

587
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,905
End of the line, all out.

588
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,114
We got that Rockefeller, yo.
We got that Rockefeller over here, yo.

589
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:17,551
- Over here we got that Rockefeller, yo.
- What the fuck?

590
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,624
Yo, yo, we got that Rockefeller, yo.

591
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,820
We got that WMD. Right here, right here.

592
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:29,330
- I hear the WMD is the bomb.
- WMD. Right here.

593
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,807
WMD.

594
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,344
Give me two, yo.

595
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,208
WMD. Right here.

596
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,910
WMD, right here. Right here.

597
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,582
Right here.

598
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,752
- We got that Rockefeller over here.
- Yo.

599
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,122
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

600
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:08,293
- What do we got?
- There's binoculars on the floor.

601
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,975
- Marlo making a move?
- Just watch.

602
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,240
Forget everything the boy Bodie told you.

603
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,450
Forget the beating, it ain't about that.

604
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,520
You smart, man, I can see that.

605
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,123
I wanted you to choose somewhere safe
for us to speak.

606
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,628
But God damn...

607
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,598
only bugs in this motherfucker
gonna have legs.

608
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,862
Now, I appreciate smart...

609
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,099
but you gotta know in this game, man,
it ain't enough.

610
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,603
You a student of history?

611
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,237
You know this town had its share
of smart players, man?

612
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:55,649
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.

613
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,485
All real smart, man, real smart.

614
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,252
But you know,
soon as their names rang out...

615
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,521
the feds was on them.
You know what I mean?

616
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,031
Government ain't want you to be organized.
No, they want you...

617
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:14,127
scrimping and scraping, killing each other
on the corner on some bullshit.

618
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,296
Not me.

619
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:19,068
That's why me and Prop Joe,
we getting ready to put this co-op together.

620
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,441
Different crews, one package.
Best dope, best coke.

621
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,078
Share and share alike.

622
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,945
- Been hearing about that.
- You been hearing about that?

623
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,281
That's good. That's a start, right?

624
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,517
You know that Mercedes
you got riding out there, man...

625
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,957
you got that titled in your aunt's name
or some shit?

626
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,559
Now, when they come get you,
that straw purchase out there...

627
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:45,726
gonna come bite you in the ass, boy.
That's what they do.

628
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,327
They turn your money against you.

629
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,865
Now, you,
I'm thinking with the corners that you got...

630
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,174
- you close to $1 mil, right?
- I'm doing all right.

631
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,849
You doing all right, but all right
ain't got your name on a crib, right?

632
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,421
Ain't got you a little spot for you
to wash that dirty money.

633
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,821
That what I'm offering you, man.

634
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,696
- Come on, who's he in there with?
- I told you, keep watching.

635
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,426
Bunk put you up to this?

636
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,734
Tell you what, how about a case
of that PBR piss you drink...

637
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,571
against a touch of the Irish
that he went out the back...

638
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,145
and you're watching that house
for nothing.

639
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,244
Here comes your nothing.

640
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:35,976
Whoa!

641
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,613
I like my piss in bottles.

642
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,989
Anyway you like, darling.

643
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:52,260
Chris. Tell our people to tool up.

644
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,096
I'm on it.

645
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:04,815
I got that WMD. Got that WMD.

646
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,477
I got that WMD. Got that WMD.

647
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,549
They get comfortable with it pretty quick.

648
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:19,322
- Yeah, it's like we ain't even standing here.
- The hoppers call it Hamsterdam.

649
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,425
Like from Amsterdam.

650
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,894
Hamsterdam.

651
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,770
...by the use of integrated math concepts
such as algebraic reasoning...

652
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,902
and number sense,
geometry and probability.

653
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,446
Very impressive.

654
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,744
Now what we try to do is keep
the class size under 10, 12 at the very most.

655
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,115
- And there are three levels?
- Yes, so that if...

656
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,986
Sorry, I'm Jim McNulty. I'm a little late,
'cause of developments at work.

657
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,421
Mr. McNulty.

658
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,983
I have some concerns
about the integrated math program.

659
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,690
In their previous schools,
Michael took introductory algebra...

660
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,323
but I understand that this school
is doing something different.

661
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,995
- We are. The integrated math program...
- Excuse me, I'm thirsty.

662
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,538
Can I get either of you something to drink?

663
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,733
The integrated math program here
<i>consists...</i>

664
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:16,445
Not much of a spread,
but you can't go wrong with <i>crudit�s.</i>

665
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,077
Crudity?

666
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,490
I'm sorry. You know, I came straight
from work, or I'd have changed.

667
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,925
No need to call names, right?

668
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:30,091
- What do you do, <i>Mr...</i>
- I'm on the board at Legg Mason.

669
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,327
- Jim McNulty.
- Legg Mason?

670
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,432
Either that or I'm a cop in the city.
I keep forgetting.

671
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,943
Terri D'Agostino.

672
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:45,947
I'm an alumni and one of the school's
dreaded fundraisers.

673
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,276
The math program
offers tutoring possibilities.

674
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,685
So if Michael finds it difficult adjusting...

675
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,656
we can have classes
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

676
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,160
- So how do you find the school?
- It's good.

677
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:00,229
Good.

678
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,924
My ex and I are thinking
of sending our boys here.

679
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,101
- Any problems, difficulties?
- No, not really.

680
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,663
I mean, there's the math integration class
for my oldest.

681
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,004
He's in sixth, seventh, and...

682
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:17,578
I'm just not sure he's ready, you know,
for all that math.

683
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,239
- Careful, I'm only a country boy.
- Shut up.

684
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,060
- Hey, sweetie, welcome home.
- How's it going?

685
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,293
- What's up, man?
- How you doing?

686
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,037
Welcome back.

687
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,235
Hey, sis.

688
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:29,045
Man, I just wish I wasn't the only one
coming home, you know.

689
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:31,916
I know.

690
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,054
Enjoy tonight. We'll talk later.

691
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,353
- Welcome home.
- What up, Prop? How you doing, man?

692
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,658
All right. You looking fit.

693
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,928
Hell, yeah, I've been working out in there.
That's all you gonna do, is work out.

694
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:48,471
Might be a good place
for a fat man to find his inner self.

695
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:20,530
Yo. I got some downtown suits
who wanna holler at you real quick.

696
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,601
Take me to see suits,
I'm trying to see some skirts.

697
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,711
So what do you do?

698
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,949
You should get dressed.

699
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,723
I got a lot of work here.
It's a long day for me tomorrow.

700
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,358
I'll be really quiet.

701
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,598
You never know,
you might get bored working.

702
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,704
I gotta work.

703
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,314
You gotta go.

704
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:17,453
What Stringer has done
with all that property downtown, Avon...

705
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,325
I cannot tell the kind of profit
you're looking at...

706
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,625
once all the federal redevelopment
money lands.

707
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,666
That whole Howard Street thing
is gonna take off...

708
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,236
and you're gonna be right there
to cut the pie yourself.

709
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,272
Any dollar you spend now
is gonna come back to you 10 times.

710
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:34,104
And the thing is, I know
you don't wanna go back to them streets.

711
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,475
Not after what you been through.

712
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,242
I know, 'cause I'm from them same streets.

713
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,681
And once I had the chance
to play a different game...

714
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,912
it wasn't a question in my mind how to go.

715
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,511
The government is going
to be looking at you hard, too.

716
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,784
No sense in giving them
what they're looking for.

717
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,450
You take what you have, you build on it.

718
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,686
It's all good.

719
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,593
Just put it up on the calendar.
We should meet.

720
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,065
Yo, Slim.
You see them two niggas right there?

721
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,840
They over there getting high
in the middle of all this.

722
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,206
Now where the fucking discipline at, yo?

723
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,372
Fuck, toss them niggas.

724
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,594
Can I talk to you for a second?
Don't you know not to stare at me like that?

725
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:36,706
Hey, yo.

726
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,071
I gotta show you something.
Pardon me, sweetie.

727
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,543
Yo, man.
You know I've been locked down, man.

728
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,741
You gonna love this. Trust me.

729
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,583
Okay.

730
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,054
Yeah.

731
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,731
Shit, this ain't my little place
down in Jessup.

732
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,167
But you know what I mean,
what the fuck is, right?

733
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:13,538
This is all you, B.
All you, in your name, too.

734
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:18,108
You know what I mean?
This piece of paper right here make it legit.

735
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,208
Keys to the Navigator in the basement.

736
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,481
It's just a rental
until you pick out something nice.

737
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,350
Damn, all this, huh?

738
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,652
You did good.

739
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,454
Yeah, I mean we're making
so much straight money, man...

740
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:35,156
we can carry shit like this out in the open,
in our own names.

741
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,261
Yo, you remember when we used to sit
on the top of 734 building, man...

742
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,032
Iooking at the city,
used to talk about what we gonna do?

743
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,006
And you was all heavy
into that black pride bullshit...

744
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,806
talking like you gonna get you two
grocery stores, make motherfuckers proud.

745
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:54,373
Sure was, man,
you was out hunting on a AK-47...

746
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,453
talking about "I'm gonna go get warrin'."

747
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,089
Man.

748
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,391
Yeah.

749
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,891
- We brothers, B.
- Always, baby.

750
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:09,860
Always.

751
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,629
And just one more thing, though, man.
You know...

752
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,206
I don't mean to be picky with you
about this...

753
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,673
especially not after you did
all this shit for me...

754
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,574
but, look, man, I've been locked down.
You know what I mean?

755
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,170
Yeah, you know what?
I got to take this meet.

756
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,648
- You <i>know...</i>
- I'm gonna get at you. Welcome home, man.

757
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:42,261
Yo, it's me, man. I left something.

758
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,574
Shit. My man.
