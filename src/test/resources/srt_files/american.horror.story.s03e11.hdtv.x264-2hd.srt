00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,347
Why I had to leave Paris,

3
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,967
the jewel of civilization,

4
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:14,986
return to this shit hole,
I'll never understand.

5
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:18,690
Boy, don't set those down.

6
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,309
They go upstairs.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,237
No. The yellow one.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,148
Brown. Brown
like your skin.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,219
Well, Father had to
attend to his business.

10
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:35,222
They have no inner light.

11
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:36,444
Look at them.

12
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:40,111
They have no intellect
to engage with.

13
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:44,282
I fear my restless mind
will become feeble.

14
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:49,737
You have us, your daughters.

15
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:53,875
You have just made my point
abundantly clear.

16
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:56,794
I need inspiration.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,466
I'm sure you'll find
your métier, Mother.

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,385
I hear crochet is
popular in New Orleans.

19
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,471
Oh.

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,444
Wha...?

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,765
Mother?!

22
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:26,824
Do I have to bother
with this... thing?

23
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,210
Till the kitchen help arrive
tomorrow,

24
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:31,546
we gonna have to cook
if we want to eat.

25
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:35,282
Do I have to kill it?

26
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,885
Put the bird down here.

27
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:40,788
Shh.

28
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,130
Oh, I can't.
Please don't make me.

29
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:51,766
Give me that cleaver.

30
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:54,068
How hard can it be
to chop the head off a chicken?

31
00:01:57,072 --> 00:01:58,552
You've never done it
yourself, Mother.

32
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:00,992
You've always had the cooks
do your dirty work.

33
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,804
What the hell is going on?

34
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,889
I'm sorry, ma'am.

35
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:35,142
I tried to stack
the boxes up myself.

36
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:36,944
I'm hurt bad.

37
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,863
Let me see what we can do here.

38
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:43,067
Oh!

39
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:11,395
Should I run and find a doctor?

40
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,981
No. I can handle this.

41
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,018
You go on downstairs
and cook up that chicken.

42
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,355
Let me... let me see

43
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:23,390
if maybe we have
some rags up here.

44
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:28,000
Here you are.
Here, bind this up

45
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,713
right quick.

46
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,093
We want to stop that blood.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,452
Come on.

48
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,981
I think
I'm going to like it here.

49
00:04:56,468 --> 00:05:07,110

50
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:11,158
Our coven mourns.

51
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,128
After facing so many trials,

52
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:17,247
defending ourselves
against onslaught.

53
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:20,167
Forging enemies into friends.

54
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:23,337
The witches
of Miss Robichaux's Academy

55
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,305
have fought for their lives,

56
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,040
and won.

57
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,560
And so, it is
with great sadness

58
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:32,513
we must say good-bye to Nan

59
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,714
who fell in the tub.

60
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,734
Amen!

61
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:40,404
If only Misty Day were here
to bring the poor girl back.

62
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,739
I have to do something

63
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:44,158
before one more
of our girls dies.

64
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:46,693
Your mother's
Pol Pot in Givenchy.

65
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,530
What can be done?
Whatever is necessary.

66
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,082
Misty's probably twirled her
way to the Everglades by now.

67
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,200
Don't bother.

68
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,836
Now!

69
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:06,096
The gardener said you'd be here.
You're alive?

70
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:07,965
Bitch, you left me for dead.

71
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,800
Oh, girl, I thought you were.

72
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,385
Oh, get your ass over here.

73
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:14,552
That's for dismembering me.

74
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,941
And that's for coming back.

75
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:21,645
I thought I told you to put
her white head in the trash.

76
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,480
I had my own ideas.

77
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,932
Queenie.

78
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,934
You put her back together.
No scars.

79
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,319
If I'd have done you,
you wouldn't look

80
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:30,571
like you'd been jammed
through a blender.

81
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,771
The most important thing is

82
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:32,956
that you're safe.

83
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,875
None of us are safe!

84
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,627
Why can't you understand that?

85
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:40,998
You are coming with us.

86
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:43,617
Okay, the funeral's over.

87
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:45,502
Say your prayers as you exit.

88
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:49,223
I'm not going anywhere
with any of y'all.

89
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,791
I've been suffering the
tortures of the damned.

90
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,293
I'm not taking another step!

91
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,596
Oh!

92
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,755
The man in the Cornrow City
shooting will be identified

93
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,791
as Jack Murphy, a homeless
veteran with PTSD.

94
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,094
When the Orleans Police finish
with their investigation,

95
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,482
that'll be the name
on the report.

96
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:33,050
So, my son will have
no eulogy, then?

97
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:38,272
He'll have no funeral, no wake,
no... fond remembrance?

98
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,774
What Hank did was foolhardy.

99
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,693
But his purpose was righteous.

100
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,228
What he did was
set off a storm.

101
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:48,181
Those witches used a spell,
I'm sure of it.

102
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,850
We need those witches to get
the government off our backs.

103
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:53,520
I'll pay them if I have to, more
money than they ever imagined.

104
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,489
When we're healthy again,

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,857
they'll pay us back

106
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,693
with their lives.

107
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:01,745
I'll set a meeting.

108
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,540
<i>History will tell you--</i>

109
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:16,760
<i>not that anyone today gives</i>
<i>a royal you-know-what--</i>

110
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,146
<i>that I was born</i>
<i>to two prominent members</i>

111
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:20,981
<i>of New Orleans society.</i>

112
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:23,850
A sit-down at a neutral

113
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,319
location of our choosing.

114
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:26,353
Ow! Jesus!

115
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:27,821
No, the meeting has

116
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:31,108
to take place here
in New Orleans.

117
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:35,862
You know they gonna
try to kill us.

118
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,531
That's what I'm counting on.

119
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,899
<i>Although my mother's</i>

120
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,752
<i>maiden name was Lovable...</i>

121
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:45,455
<i>she did not pass that quality</i>
<i>along to me, her daughter.</i>

122
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,458
<i>I suppose</i>
<i>I was an unhappy child.</i>

123
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,178
<i>Not very nice, either.</i>

124
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,263
<i>I kept to myself,</i>

125
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:56,099
<i>communing with rodents</i>
<i>and small animals.</i>

126
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:59,803
<i>Cutting parts off to see how</i>
<i>they'd fare, or if they'd die.</i>

127
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,389
You left your dirt
in the commode.

128
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,757
Why don't you flush it?

129
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,527
You flush my shit, bitch.

130
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,947
<i>No one thought
I'd amount to much,</i>

131
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,982
<i>but I surprised them all.</i>

132
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,900
<i>I married well.</i>

133
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:17,237
<i>My lavish soirées became</i>
<i>a coveted invitation.</i>

134
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,282
Cumin.

135
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,618
Coconut.

136
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,971
Cardamom.

137
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:35,922
Mulligatawny soup!

138
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,758
Mmm.

139
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,593
I've been transported
to Rajasthan!

140
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,127
Oh. Oh good.

141
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,397
Bravo, Delphine!

142
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,148
<i>Magnifique!</i>

143
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:48,235
It goes perfectly
with the wine. Mmm.

144
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,937
<i>How the mighty have fallen</i>

145
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,106
<i>does not begin</i>
<i>to describe my torment.</i>

146
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:56,910
Oh, yeah. How
you doing, love?

147
00:09:56,977 --> 00:10:00,998
I've been giving plenty thought
to how I'm gonna deal with you.

148
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:03,500
Here, clean little Ceci.

149
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,837
Shh.

150
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,339
Thinking this time,

151
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,157
I'll finish what I started.

152
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:15,178
Scatter your parts
all around town.

153
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:19,332
Stick that head of yours in
a construction site shit hole.

154
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:24,354
Oh, your days
are numbered, woman.

155
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,191
Just when you least
expect it...

156
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:34,848
<i>When I'm not
cleaning their filthy commodes</i>

157
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,201
<i>or putting food in front</i>
<i>of their greedy faces,</i>

158
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:40,037
<i>washing their</i>
<i>sex-stained sheets,</i>

159
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:42,072
<i>cleaning up</i>
<i>their general filth,</i>

160
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:46,159
<i>I pass desperately long</i>
<i>and lonely days and nights,</i>

161
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,462
<i>fretting over the deterioration</i>

162
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,998
<i>of my troubled mistress'</i>
<i>body and soul.</i>

163
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,052
<i>Watching her leave the house</i>
<i>each evening</i>

164
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:58,472
<i>without her undergarment,</i>

165
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:01,725
<i>not to return</i>
<i>till the wee hours.</i>

166
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,983
Light as a goofer feather.

167
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,985
It's all about the lard,
isn't it?

168
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,240
You seem half mad, dear.

169
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,860
I had the sight once.

170
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,828
I know it's still in me.

171
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,730
It has to be.

172
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,833
I think this could amplify it.

173
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,925
Sorry to intrude, Cordelia.

174
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,910
I was pruning your fig trees.

175
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,912
Ah, figs, ah, figs,

176
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,914
Mother Nature's brown diamonds.

177
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,916
In the fall, the rotting leaves

178
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,018
smell like
an Olympian's ejaculate.

179
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,104
<i>And then I realized</i>

180
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,422
<i>what was missing in my life.</i>

181
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,892
Figgy pudding cures
the blues and banishes acne.

182
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,143
I'm mad for it.

183
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:55,312
<i>Lately, I've been asking myself</i>

184
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:58,315
<i>just what was it</i>
<i>that fed my soul back then.</i>

185
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,600
What did you do
to your hand, James?

186
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:02,736
Cut myself with the shears.

187
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:07,374
Miss Cordelia, why don't you go
and finish your breakfast,

188
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,743
and I'll see to...
James, was it?

189
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:12,913
Yes, ma'am.
Mm-hmm.

190
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,616
Because being a
hostess was never enough

191
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,668
for my restless mind,

192
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:22,973
and I realized it was
my childlike curiosity

193
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:26,893
about how my niggers ticked.

194
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:30,147
Much like when I was a child
and I used to carve up

195
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,233
a possum or a stray cat.

196
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,603
I just... developed
a scientific fascination

197
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,972
for their... their body parts

198
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:40,991
and their... their organs...

199
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:44,244
and their cries of agony.

200
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,646
They made a strange...

201
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,698
almost comforting sound.

202
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:51,034
Almost like...

203
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,869
a <i>musical</i> background.

204
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,155
And their thick African blood

205
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,041
just...

206
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,511
satisfied a desire that
was deep inside me.

207
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,098
And then you appeared.

208
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,837
Like an old friend...

209
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:13,190
from the past.

210
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,846
I'll get to the fingers later.

211
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,532
But let's start with your toes.

212
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:25,368
This little piggy went to market.

213
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:28,989
This little piggy...

214
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,907
stayed home.

215
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:34,744
This little piggy right here
had roast beef.

216
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:35,829
And <i>this</i> little piggy

217
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,747
had none.

218
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,250
And this little piggy cried

219
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:42,535
whee...!

220
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,205
Oh, yeah!

221
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,480
<i>Elementum recolligo</i>

222
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:54,764
<i>huic locus.</i>

223
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,850
<i>Commodo mihi vestri vox.</i>

224
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:05,525
<i>Elementum recolligo huic locus.</i>

225
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,444
<i>Commodo mihi vestri vox.</i>

226
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,068
Fiona.

227
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,070
I knew it.

228
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,039
I knew it.

229
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:22,959
My God, it was the both of them.

230
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,268
They drowned her.
Why would they kill Nan?

231
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:36,189
Oh, what have we here,
a romantic bubble bath?

232
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:38,257
I was trying to figure out
what happened to Nan.

233
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,394
Don't you care at all?

234
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,279
Have you met me?

235
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,732
Misty was right.

236
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,033
We should have let you rot.

237
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,292
Here. Zoe and I need to talk.

238
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,627
What's the deal, Zoe?
We were supposed to share him,

239
00:14:57,712 --> 00:15:01,464
then you had to go fall in love with him.
No, I didn't.

240
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:03,333
So it wouldn't bother you

241
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,469
if I got on my knee pads
and blew him, right here,

242
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:09,422
right now.
If he wants it, be my guest.

243
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,057
Thanks.
You're a peach.

244
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,464
No!

245
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:19,816
Not anymore.

246
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,152
I love Zoe.

247
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:24,821
You think
you can just throw me away

248
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:27,240
for some junior
varsity mall rat?

249
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:30,327
I made you, Kyle,
not her. You owe <i>me.</i>

250
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,829
No, he doesn't.
He's not your slave.

251
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,167
God, you're such a brat!

252
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,674
Hey! No!

253
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,010
What is all that racket?!

254
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:52,549
Oh, Madison, you are the worst kind

255
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,667
of Hollywood cliché:
a bobble head

256
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,770
with crotchless panties!

257
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,723
And you're a dried-up old
Hot Pocket, but I don't judge.

258
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,776
You can't speak to me that
way-- I am your elder.

259
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:04,844
Welcome to the Revolution,
Carrot Top.

260
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:06,529
As the next Supreme,

261
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:09,282
I'm gonna drive this coven
out of the Dark Ages.

262
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:10,867
Crotchless panties for everyone.

263
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:13,036
And as for you,

264
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,288
Ken doll...

265
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:18,658
well, putting you
together was fun...

266
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,911
but taking you apart's
gonna be even more fun.

267
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:35,957
Ah, go slow with that.

268
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,063
Baby.

269
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,332
My granddaddy,

270
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,789
he had this farm in,
uh, Covington.

271
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,748
We used to go there
every summer.

272
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:09,368
It was the only...
ray of light in my dark world.

273
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,872
I want to take you there.

274
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,910
Fix it up.

275
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:21,964
We'll spend out
the rest of our days...

276
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,351
...drinking gin rickeys

277
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,052
on this porch.

278
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:35,260
What's so funny?
Oh, imagine me...

279
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,429
a farm wife.

280
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,065
Milking the cows.

281
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:44,269
Well, you've lived a big life.

282
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,906
You went everywhere, you've
met everyone, you've...

283
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:51,877
done everything that your
stormy little heart desired.

284
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:54,580
But you were never,
ever truly happy, huh?

285
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,050
Now, for strictly,

286
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:00,252
uh, curative reasons,
we got to kill

287
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,554
this young Supreme,
whoever she is.

288
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,790
But she could be our last.

289
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,342
I'll give up the axe, and, uh...

290
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:08,844
you give up the coven.

291
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:10,295
We could live like, uh...

292
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,798
like normal folk for a change.

293
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,350
What do you say?

294
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,319
Deal?

295
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:36,872
Yes, it's a deal.

296
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:39,491
But first you have to
do something for me.

297
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,293
One little thing.

298
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:42,961
Uh-uh.

299
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:51,186
Not very robust, were you?

300
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,357
Feel better?

301
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:57,476
Butler.

302
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,445
I thought you'd run off.

303
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,514
No, ma'am.

304
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:04,366
Been here

305
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:06,535
all along.

306
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:10,689
I can explain. I...
No.

307
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,041
One doesn't explain art.

308
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,860
One simply...

309
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,329
admires it.

310
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,967
You can talk.

311
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,035
I thought you were tongueless.

312
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,804
I was when I was alive.

313
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,843
Are you saying you're dead?

314
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:33,345
Murdered.

315
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,264
Right here, in this room.

316
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,601
That's true, isn't it?
I spent enough time

317
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:42,271
in the grave to know a spirit
when I encounter one.

318
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:47,276
I've been watching you.

319
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,729
A life without purpose...

320
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,916
is no life at all.

321
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,238
I thought I'd found my purpose.

322
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,541
Or at least a hobby.

323
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,011
Mostly I think
I just made a mess.

324
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:09,298
Guess who gets to clean it up.

325
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,383
Me, the goddamn maid.

326
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:14,753
You long for release.

327
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:18,190
I know how you can achieve it.

328
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:20,192
Oh,

329
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,560
it can't be achieved.

330
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:22,594
I've been cursed.

331
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:23,929
Yes.

332
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,564
The black devil

333
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:28,283
who is responsible for
your unending torment

334
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,819
is sheltered right under
this very roof,

335
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:33,705
treated like an honored guest.
Don't I know it.

336
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:36,575
They got me waiting
on her hand and foot.

337
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,911
It's wrong.
It's more than wrong.

338
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,580
It's a violation
of the natural order.

339
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,665
But there's nothing for it.

340
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,251
I drank that potion.

341
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:49,621
One moment of weakness,

342
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,640
of vanity.

343
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:58,647
Now I'm doomed
to scrub out her chamber pots

344
00:20:58,731 --> 00:20:59,982
for all eternity.

345
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,817
Not if she dies.

346
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:04,653
Why do you care?

347
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:08,740
I care about this coven.

348
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:09,775
About preserving

349
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:11,443
the ancient line of Salem.

350
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:13,245
Everything is at risk because

351
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:16,281
Fiona has become confused,
reckless.

352
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:18,584
She's forgotten that
Marie Laveau has been

353
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:20,452
and always will be
her sworn enemy.

354
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,170
Marie Laveau must die.

355
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:24,623
She can't die.

356
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,291
The bitch is immortal.

357
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:28,343
By magic.

358
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:31,129
And by magic,

359
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,099
she can be undone.

360
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:36,635
What are you talking about?

361
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,973
Even a voodoo queen

362
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:43,308
can be rendered vulnerable,

363
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,527
if only for an instant.

364
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:52,234
Are you saying I can kill her?

365
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:56,071
I can provide you
with the means.

366
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,994
But you have to do
something for me first.

367
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,712
What?

368
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:05,196
Venture out into the world

369
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:08,417
and retrieve an item.

370
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,335
It won't be cheap.

371
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:16,892
Dirty hippie can kiss my ass.

372
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:18,477
Queenie?

373
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,984
I thought that we should talk.

374
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,055
First of all,

375
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,057
I'm very glad you're back.

376
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:34,576
Yeah? Then why'd you give
my room away?

377
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:38,747
You left us.

378
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,616
And you went across town

379
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:43,835
to our sworn enemy.
Who is right now

380
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,954
in your guest room
smoking a hookah.

381
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,406
Things around here
change fast, but damn.

382
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:52,094
A lot has happened...
Yeah, your husband shot me in the stomach.

383
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,249
To say I'm sorry
doesn't begin...

384
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:00,052
It really doesn't.

385
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,189
Queenie.

386
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,423
You...

387
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:07,726
are a very strong and powerful

388
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:08,777
young woman.

389
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:10,529
But how did you survive?

390
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,731
Turns out I got some new powers.

391
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:14,649
<i>I shot him</i>
<i>right through my skull.</i>

392
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:26,461
He shot you with this?

393
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:27,746
Yes.

394
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:30,048
And I survived.

395
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,084
I'm starting to think I
might be the next Supreme.

396
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:34,386
Not even a silver
bullet can stop me.

397
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:35,637
Thank you.

398
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,089
Don't touch me.

399
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,677
My eyes are open.

400
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:45,797
And I promise I'm going to
prove that to you and the girls.

401
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:47,265
No offense,

402
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,151
but since I left,
one witch is dead

403
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:50,852
and another one is missing.

404
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:54,189
You are just as weak
as you've ever been.

405
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:58,193
Might want to take
one long-ass vacation.

406
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:00,328
Let somebody else
run this joint for a while.

407
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,447
Now, get out.

408
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:04,332
Now!

409
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:02,166
Cordelia.

410
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,169
Delia?

411
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,789
Cordel...

412
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:14,928
Is it true?

413
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:17,334
Your daughter's
resting comfortably.

414
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:20,300
I threw a little analgesic
spell her way to help the pain.

415
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:21,501
Searing, don't you know.

416
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:24,097
She's taken out both eyes?

417
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:26,723
The blue eye, the brown eye.

418
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:29,810
Some of my best work,
between us pigeons, all gone.

419
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,478
Why?

420
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,530
Because your daughter
has become something

421
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:35,849
you will never
understand, Fiona.

422
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,951
She's a hero.

423
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:40,420
Your girl has
ripped her own eyes

424
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:42,505
straight out of her skull
for one reason only:

425
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,173
to protect the coven.

426
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:45,991
From what?

427
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:48,961
Huh? I'll take care
of the Witch Hunters.

428
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:51,163
And when I do...

429
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:53,633
this coven will have
no more enemies.

430
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,134
No enemies
on the outside perhaps,

431
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:56,519
but danger lurks
within these blanched walls.

432
00:26:56,603 --> 00:26:58,221
Everyone knows it.

433
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:01,507
She sacrificed her eyes
to regain the second sight.

434
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:04,527
And woe to those among us
who harbor bad thoughts.

435
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:07,396
I have no secrets.

436
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:10,683
Then, by all means, go to her.

437
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,285
Comfort her.

438
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:13,703
Put motherly hands

439
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:17,123
upon your wounded
daughter's flesh

440
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,358
and watch your filthy secrets

441
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,694
be brought to light, laid bare.

442
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:23,195
"No secrets."

443
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:24,747
Shame on you, Fiona.

444
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:26,749
I deserve
better lies than that.

445
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,468
You are an enemy to this coven

446
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,202
and will be
so long as you live.

447
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,422
But Cordelia
has your number, Slim.

448
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:37,543
Go to hell, Myrtle Snow.

449
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:38,811
For what?

450
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:41,147
Allowing you
to see your daughter?

451
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:50,022
I'll be back.

452
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:51,657
I just need a drink.

453
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,195
Steady my nerves.

454
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:58,080
See you soon.

455
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,758
Butler?

456
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:15,097
Butler.

457
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:17,082
I've done what you asked.

458
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:18,267
You got it?

459
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:23,222
Paid a king's ransom
for it, too.

460
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:30,262
Oh.

461
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:32,031
Whoa.

462
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:36,101
An authentic 1895
Armand Marseille

463
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:38,270
Dream Baby.

464
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,740
You're sure this
is the original gown?

465
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,708
There's a certificate
of authenticity

466
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,877
in there somewhere.

467
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:50,716
This was a very limited run,
you know.

468
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:53,886
Dieter Hoffbonner designed
the gowns himself.

469
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:56,055
Grown man, taking pleasure
in a doll baby.

470
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,290
It's unsavory.

471
00:28:58,342 --> 00:28:59,308
All right,

472
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:00,676
I did my part.

473
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,228
Now, before somebody notices

474
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:04,180
that half the silver's
gone missing,

475
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:05,765
you give me what
you promised me.

476
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:10,019
Yes.

477
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:12,738
The potion that will render
the voodoo queen mortal

478
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:15,107
and allow you to end her life.

479
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:24,283
A few capsules,
dissolved in her drink.

480
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,253
Few capsules...

481
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:31,156
"Ben..."
Shhh! No.

482
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,593
Never speak it aloud.

483
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,012
It's that powerful?
You have no idea.

484
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,473
You wanted to see me?
Come in, Zoe.

485
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:48,474
Sit down.

486
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,942
I have something for you.

487
00:29:53,563 --> 00:29:55,531
Good God, chickie,
don't look at it!

488
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:57,376
You'll be blinded
by the sheer craftsmanship.

489
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,119
Um... okay.
What is it?

490
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:02,187
My only possession of value.

491
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:05,458
A sapphire and topaz
harvester ant

492
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:08,077
made for me by
Joel Arthur Rosenthal,

493
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:10,162
the Fabergé of our time.

494
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:12,381
The Harvester ant

495
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:14,667
is one of <i>the</i> most
venomous creatures

496
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:16,302
in the world, along with Fiona,

497
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:19,555
and JAR-- as the world
knows my dear Joel--

498
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,373
toiled on it for months.

499
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,725
Do you want me to wear it?

500
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:24,143
You could never
pull it off, darling.

501
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,227
Only Lee Radziwill

502
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:26,762
or myself could do it justice.

503
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:28,931
Now listen to me carefully:

504
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:32,435
I want you to hock it
in case of emergency.

505
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:35,988
I'm completely lost here.

506
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:37,222
You're leaving this coven, Zoe.

507
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:38,741
And you're taking Kyle with you.

508
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,526
I do love Kyle,

509
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:41,861
Myrtle.

510
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:43,696
But I'm not leaving.

511
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:45,948
I watched you and Kyle
together at Nan's funeral.

512
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,733
Such a pair.

513
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,234
So much in love.

514
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:51,504
As the great Keats would say,

515
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:53,289
"More happy love!

516
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,741
"More happy, happy love!

517
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:58,678
"Forever warm and
still to be enjoyed.

518
00:30:58,745 --> 00:31:00,513
"Forever panting and...

519
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,681
and forever young."

520
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:06,435
I had a love like that once.

521
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,421
Egon von Furstenberg.

522
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:11,757
He dumped me,

523
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:14,443
but everything worked out
all right in the end.

524
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:16,261
You know why?

525
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:17,980
Because he went on

526
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:19,982
to marry the divine Diane.

527
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:22,434
And without Egon's support,

528
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:25,287
Diane von Furstenberg
never would have created

529
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,740
the greatest invention
of the century,

530
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:30,292
the wrap dress!

531
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:36,132
If you stay here,

532
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,084
your life is in grave danger.

533
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:40,720
I can handle Madison.

534
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:43,222
She'd slit your throat,
then sleep like a baby.

535
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:45,591
I understand Madison.

536
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,292
The depth of her cynicism.

537
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:49,294
Go. You and Kyle.

538
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,764
Run away together
and start your life over.

539
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,265
I'm committed to this coven.

540
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:55,151
So was I, and I burned
at the stake for it.

541
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:56,769
What if I'm the next Supreme?

542
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,137
All the more reason to run.

543
00:31:58,188 --> 00:31:59,522
If Madison doesn't end you,

544
00:31:59,606 --> 00:32:00,773
Fiona will.

545
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:02,324
Zoe...

546
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:03,609
you have a boy that loves you.

547
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,694
Because he's damaged goods.

548
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:06,946
How dare you

549
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:08,480
be so unromantic

550
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:11,483
and so very, very selfish.

551
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:12,818
Our dear Cordelia

552
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,003
plucked her eyes out

553
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:15,320
to protect this coven,

554
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:16,872
and you have the gall

555
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,657
to ignore my words
of warning and support?

556
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:21,210
Now...

557
00:32:21,294 --> 00:32:23,596
take these tickets to Epcot

558
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:25,347
and my JAR jewels

559
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:28,300
and pack your bags.

560
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,192
Be ready for anything,

561
00:32:53,243 --> 00:32:55,294
but keep the dogs at bay.

562
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:58,497
Those bitches have to walk out
of here untouched.

563
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:08,474
I guess we are first.

564
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,049
Well, good
afternoon, gentlemen.

565
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,885
Thank you for being on time.

566
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:21,904
Emeril has invited us to a...

567
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:23,939
a little tasting this evening.

568
00:33:24,024 --> 00:33:25,891
We don't want to miss it.

569
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:27,409
Please, everyone...

570
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:28,994
No security?

571
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:30,896
Don't you want to
check us for weapons?

572
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:36,068
<i>Cher,</i> I took down
your entire company

573
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,003
with about as much effort

574
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:40,739
as it takes for me
to mix myself a Rob Roy.

575
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,342
And Marie...

576
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,846
Marie is immortal,
for Christ's sake.

577
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:48,274
You think we're
worried about guns?

578
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:49,915
Which reminds me...

579
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:52,584
I need a drink.

580
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:53,802
Waiter.

581
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:55,054
Martini, please.

582
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:56,355
Filthy.

583
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:57,822
Do you want something?

584
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,725
Oh...
Sprite.

585
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:00,726
And a Sprite.

586
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,945
Uh, Diet Sprite.

587
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:05,614
All right.

588
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,784
In every negotiation...

589
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:10,269
A negotiation?

590
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Listen up, white devil.

591
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:12,788
Now, we sittin' here

592
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:14,456
out of kindness and generosity,

593
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:16,661
which is more than your son
showed the innocent people

594
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,494
that he gunned down in my shop.

595
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,996
Collateral damage.

596
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,998
You know, my new
friend is right.

597
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,416
We are doing you a favor.

598
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,885
We are willing to make...

599
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:28,053
Marie Laveau whole
for any damage

600
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:30,890
done to her shop.
We have only one request:

601
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:32,791
you have to restore our company.

602
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:37,963
There are thousands of good,
innocent people out of jobs,

603
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,965
and this has nothing
to do with them.

604
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,151
Thank you.

605
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:44,486
Collateral damage.

606
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:47,072
Look...

607
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,491
here's the truth.

608
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,493
This war,

609
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:53,579
it's a thing of the past.

610
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:55,998
Sometimes I feel
like I'm trying

611
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:59,285
to rid the State Department
of Communists.

612
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:04,373
This document

613
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:07,293
is signed by every director
in this room.

614
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:11,180
It calls for a 100-year truce.

615
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:14,350
No witch hunting of any kind

616
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,302
until all of us who <i>can</i> die

617
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:18,020
are long dead.

618
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:20,389
This is the end.

619
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:25,177
We give up.

620
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:27,980
Mm-hmm.

621
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:29,565
Okay.

622
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,350
Now, this is my offer to you.

623
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:33,652
You disband

624
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:36,572
this little merry troupe
of assholes,

625
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,540
vowing never to harm

626
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,877
another witch from now
until the end of time.

627
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:44,213
I would also like you

628
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:47,049
to sign over your house
in Berkeley Square to me.

629
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:48,384
But paint it first.

630
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:50,369
God knows all the money
in the world

631
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,870
can't buy good taste.

632
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:53,889
Well, now, I'd like

633
00:35:53,974 --> 00:35:55,374
the private jet.
Mmm.

634
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:57,209
And Marie...

635
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,710
wants a private jet.

636
00:35:58,762 --> 00:36:00,346
Okay,

637
00:36:00,397 --> 00:36:02,047
this is insanity.

638
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:04,099
We came here to negotiate.

639
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:05,234
In good faith.

640
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:07,219
Too much?

641
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,721
Well, I don't know.

642
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:12,858
Maybe you're right.

643
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,027
Then here's my other offer.

644
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,252
You can all just die.

645
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:22,678
Well played.

646
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,684
You Harvard men,

647
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:30,652
charming to the end.

648
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:37,993
Yale... actually.
Mmm.

649
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,915
You know... killing us,

650
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:46,535
it's not gonna put
an end to this war.

651
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,171
Maybe, baby.

652
00:37:49,255 --> 00:37:52,341
But it's gonna be so much fun
just to watch it happen.

653
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:57,596
You got any last words?

654
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:07,005
Go to hell,

655
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:08,307
witch bitch.

656
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,384
Well,

657
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:37,386
killing him was easier
than I thought.

658
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:43,892
Mmm.

659
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:46,711
You make a hell
of a martini, mister.

660
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:49,502
I love you more than jazz,
baby doll.

661
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:58,849
To the beginning
of a long, long friendship.

662
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,021
Mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm.

663
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:07,574
Mmm.

664
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:11,286
Where do you
think you're going?

665
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:14,584
To hail the conquering hero.

666
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,759
My man swung a mighty axe.

667
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:20,929
I have to go reward him.

668
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:28,386
Don't wait up.

669
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:33,841
Damn, Delphine.

670
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,443
You know, girl,

671
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,512
you may be rotten to the core,

672
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:41,900
but you do make a sweet French 75.

673
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:46,538
Thank you, ma'am.

674
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,194
Leave it!

675
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:54,329
And get out.

676
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,631
Only thing that could

677
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,500
ruin this moment
is to have to look

678
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:59,634
at your...

679
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:01,753
fugly face.

680
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:07,509
I'll leave when I'm finished.

681
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:12,847
Oh...

682
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:16,217
you will obey me, servant.

683
00:40:18,237 --> 00:40:20,605
I told you.

684
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:23,992
I'm not finished.

685
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:26,745
But you are.

686
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:33,084
Stupid cow!

687
00:40:36,122 --> 00:40:38,757
Thinking you could...

688
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:41,743
But...

689
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,628
Yeah, I...

690
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:45,463
The m... the magic

691
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,465
takes time to work.

692
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,250
Your fate is sealed.

693
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:53,921
Oh, you stupid rube!

694
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:55,557
That ain't magic.

695
00:40:55,608 --> 00:40:57,942
It's an antihistamine.

696
00:40:58,027 --> 00:40:59,778
And the only thing

697
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:03,431
I'm allergic to is you.

698
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:06,879
Damn you. Damn you!

699
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:25,136
Is she dead?

700
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:28,506
She cannot die.

701
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:29,924
What?

702
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:31,676
She's immortal.

703
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:34,262
But you said...
I just wanted her out

704
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:36,564
of my hair.

705
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:37,953
You were most likely
to cooperate.

706
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:41,636
Well, turds on that.

707
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,772
What am I supposed to do
with her now?

708
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:45,657
I don't know. Bury her.

709
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:47,525
She'd just dig her way out!

710
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,529
Make sure she can't.

711
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:49,053
Shh...

712
00:42:49,138 --> 00:42:51,673
Finally.

713
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:54,709
A living doll.

714
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,812
All my own.

715
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:07,238
Don't forget your toothbrush.

716
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:18,082
Kyle, the bus leaves
in, like, an hour.

717
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,034
You have to finish packing.

718
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:25,924
Do you want me to do it?

719
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:30,011
I'm not going.

720
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:32,547
What are you talking about?

721
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:37,418
I'm afraid.

722
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:39,437
Of what? Me?

723
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:42,423
Of me.

724
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:43,808
Of me...

725
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:47,562
hurting you or somebody else.

726
00:43:47,613 --> 00:43:50,565
I have these feelings
inside that I can't...

727
00:43:50,616 --> 00:43:54,118
I can't control.

728
00:44:00,543 --> 00:44:05,296
I'm not scared of you.

729
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:07,749
I'm not...

730
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,051
scared of you.

731
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,224
Put the rest of your things

732
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,226
in my bag and-and
put your shoes on.

733
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:19,573
We're leaving,
just like planned.

734
00:44:19,595 --> 00:44:22,096
I love you, Zoe...

735
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:24,465
but it's not your decision.

736
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,148
"More happy love.

737
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:44,151
"More happy,

738
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,287
happy love.

739
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:49,924
More happy love."

740
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:32,267
