1
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:09,005
It's there for leverage

2
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,051
so that we can lock down
performance standards.

3
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,810
You don't toss around their
right to collective bargaining

4
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,025
like a poker chip.

5
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,880
If we don't, they won't budge.

6
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,767
Has Marty Spinella seen this?

7
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,365
Not the version I showed him.

8
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,740
So you lied to his face.

9
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,362
No. I revised the parameters of my promise.

10
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:24,322
Which is lying.

11
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:25,537
Which is politics...

12
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:27,807
the sort you're well versed in, Bob.

13
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,214
Here's some politics for you.

14
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,941
I allow this to go to the floor,

15
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,892
I get murdered next election.

16
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,810
This is coming from the President.

17
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,345
Last time I checked,

18
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:37,944
I was still a Democrat, Frank,

19
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,287
and you were too.

20
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,429
Are you telling me the President isn't?

21
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:44,179
Because he's acting a hell
of a lot like a Republican.

22
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:45,778
I thought Bob was on our team.

23
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:48,113
Just sit him down with
the President ten minutes.

24
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,871
We won't touch collective bargaining.

25
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,598
Are you interested in my advice on this,

26
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:53,037
or do you just want me
to deliver the message?

27
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,796
I'm always interested
in your advice, Frank.

28
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:57,130
Birch is right. You're going
to burn a lot of bridges.

29
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,697
The President should at
least sit down with him

30
00:02:58,697 --> 00:02:59,880
and let him make his case.

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,479
You tell Bob

32
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,462
I'm happy to schedule a
meeting with the President

33
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:05,860
once he's set a date to
put this bill on the floor.

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,395
The President can fuck himself.

35
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,761
This is the platform. It's what he ran on.

36
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,520
I don't give a shit what he ran on.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,046
He can't steamroll the house.

38
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,133
And don't forget,

39
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,444
you work for me, Frank, not him.

40
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:17,819
If he wants something on the floor,

41
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,026
he's gonna have to talk to me directly.

42
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,680
I know you take a lot of
pride in your manhood, Bob,

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,183
and it's impressive,

44
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,462
but as big as it is,

45
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:27,348
Linda can still shut the door on it.

46
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,441
Tell Vasquez the bill is dead.

47
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,886
That's not the first time

48
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:37,389
he's pulled that stunt on me.

49
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,700
Probably should have held my tongue,

50
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,171
but I just couldn't resist the chance

51
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,386
to see him shrivel.

52
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:45,927
Good morning.

53
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,078
Frank.

54
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:49,349
Mr. President.

55
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,011
Linda.

56
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,314
Let's strike the anti-collective
bargaining provision

57
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:54,433
from the bill.

58
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,680
Linda and I have talked it over,

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,151
and I think she's right on this.

60
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,910
Tell Bob he can come by tomorrow afternoon.

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,636
Sir, respectfully, I do not think

62
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:02,395
you should give him the satisfaction.

63
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:03,450
Well, give me a reason.

64
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,793
Makes us appear weak.

65
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,168
There's an opportunity for you

66
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:07,479
to establish your supremacy.

67
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,791
We should seize it.

68
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,070
But without Birch's cooperation,

69
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,445
we're fighting an uphill battle

70
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,171
before we even get the bill to the floor.

71
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,195
Frank, we discussed this.

72
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,442
Sir, if you give in now,

73
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,232
Birch will walk all over you

74
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,703
for the next four years.

75
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,134
I can get this bill on
the house floor as is.

76
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:22,541
I promise you.

77
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:27,721
All right, Frank. Show me what you can do.

78
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,936
Thank you, Mr. President.

79
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,363
That was her trying to
take credit for my idea.

80
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:38,049
Advice she wouldn't take
from me... unacceptable.

81
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:39,776
I will not allow her to sell my goods

82
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,759
when she cuts me out of the profits.

83
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,613
I specifically told her no interviews.

84
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,893
She disobeyed me...

85
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,204
not just once.

86
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,611
At least eight times in the past month.

87
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:48,986
She stays, Tom.

88
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,352
She has no respect for
my authority, Margaret.

89
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,334
I said she stays.

90
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,645
There are rules.

91
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:55,829
There's a way of doing things.

92
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,820
If I have a reporter...

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,163
two freshmen girls

94
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,986
are moving into their dorm room together.

95
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,233
One of them's from Georgia,

96
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,896
one of them's from Connecticut.

97
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,686
The girl from Connecticut's
helping her mother

98
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:05,901
put up curtains.

99
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,340
The girl from Georgia turns to them

100
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,291
and says, "hi. Where y'all from?"

101
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,529
The girl from Connecticut
says, "we're from a place

102
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:14,087
where we know not to end a
sentence with a preposition."

103
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:17,861
The girl from Georgia
says, "oh, beg my pardon.

104
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,076
Where y'all from...

105
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,035
Cunt?"

106
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,858
You heard that one before?

107
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:25,631
A version of it. With softer language.

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,390
Tom, we don't need people
who follow the rules.

109
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,021
We need people with personality.

110
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,442
We want Zoe's face, her energy.

111
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,457
We want to get her on
TV as much as possible.

112
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,951
It helps us cut through the noise.

113
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:38,294
See what I'm saying?

114
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,204
I hear you, Margaret.

115
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:43,346
Thank you, Tom.

116
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,471
Thank you.

117
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:53,579
Come in.

118
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:58,152
Oh. I, uh, thought...

119
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:01,158
I wanted to say hi to Evelyn.

120
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,012
Evelyn?

121
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,323
This was her office.

122
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,274
I don't think she works here anymore.

123
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:08,001
- Oh.
- Gillian Cole.

124
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,599
I came on board a couple of weeks ago.

125
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,038
Gillian. World well.

126
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,637
Yeah.

127
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:13,788
I've heard great things.

128
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:14,844
Remy Danton.

129
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,730
You work with Claire?

130
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,722
In a way.

131
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,193
Hello, Remy.

132
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,568
Claire.

133
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,007
I see you've met Gillian.

134
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,254
Yes, just now.

135
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:24,916
She's doing fantastic work for us,

136
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,164
as you can see.

137
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,635
Red is completed wells,

138
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:30,289
green, uh, potential sites,

139
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,568
yellow approved sites,

140
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,966
and blue are the filtration centers.

141
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,460
Nice. So you liking it here?

142
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,411
Yeah. My staff and I are loving it.

143
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,882
Claire's opened a lot of doors for us.

144
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,289
Sounds like Claire.

145
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,175
Shall we head to my office?

146
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:44,646
Gillian, nice to meet you.

147
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,245
Nice to meet you.

148
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,396
What happened?

149
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,922
Things got complicated.

150
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,896
San corp was in a difficult situation.

151
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,335
I would have thought you'd step up

152
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:55,678
when things were difficult,

153
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:57,437
not hold the donation hostage.

154
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:59,292
Well, things are less complicated now.

155
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,306
The donation is back on the table.

156
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,655
I had to fire half my staff.

157
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:06,838
Now you can hire them back.

158
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,181
San corp is prepared

159
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:09,684
to double its initial commitment...

160
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,466
1.5 million, lump sum, this quarter.

161
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,545
- Why?
- Public relations. Same as before.

162
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,623
And what do they want from Francis?

163
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,053
Things are square with Frank.

164
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,333
We're only talking about the C.W.I.

165
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,420
But why double it?

166
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,699
Because I said they should.

167
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,426
The more they give, the more you can do.

168
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,568
The more you can do, the better they look.

169
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,551
And that's why they hired Glendon Hill...

170
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,574
to make them look good.

171
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,693
And they also hired you

172
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:31,812
to get traction in congress.

173
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,091
Not in this case.

174
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:35,234
We want a long-term partnership, Claire.

175
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,376
This is an investment in the future.

176
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,231
We're not attaching strings.

177
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,333
I'll think about it.

178
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,059
They'd really love to move quickly on this.

179
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:46,618
I said I'll think about it.

180
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:48,856
Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.

181
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,135
I need it in writing.

182
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,917
And with more than an hour's notice.

183
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,028
Yeah, I know that, but
you have to understand

184
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,307
we... we have a plan.

185
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:57,873
We have a way that we do this,

186
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:59,025
and when you...

187
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,725
okay.

188
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,228
Fine.

189
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:08,106
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

190
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,967
Madeleine has decided to have

191
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,981
a spur-of-the-moment trip to Orlando

192
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:16,900
with her latest eharmony catch.

193
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,923
No heads-up, no warning.

194
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:18,946
The kids?

195
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,641
They get out of school at 2:30.

196
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,624
I can do the shipbuilders meeting.

197
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:24,286
You sure?

198
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,269
Yeah, it's just a public affairs team.

199
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,284
I'll brief you, and then
you can call them tomorrow.

200
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:29,595
Go get your kids.

201
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,208
Hey.

202
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,554
Remy came by this morning. To the office.

203
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:53,769
What does he want?

204
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,240
The donation's back on the table.

205
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,990
They've doubled it to 1.5 million.

206
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,420
- You said no, right?
- I didn't.

207
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,330
He doesn't want anything from you, Francis.

208
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,281
Come on, Claire. You know better than that.

209
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:06,880
I specifically asked.

210
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,159
Maybe not right now,

211
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,717
but look, I invented this guy, all right?

212
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,092
It's a slippery slope. You open the...

213
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,819
Think of what I can do with this money.

214
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,322
I can hire back the people I let go.

215
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,729
I can help accelerate the funding

216
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,647
for the projects that
Gillian has brought in.

217
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,502
Let's find another way to raise the money.

218
00:09:20,502 --> 00:09:22,101
But it's right there at my feet.

219
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,531
Claire, I have too much
on my plate right now.

220
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,610
I can't have San corp
breathing down my neck again.

221
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,144
I can't have Remy...

222
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:29,456
look, it is Remy.

223
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,502
He knows me too well. It's dangerous.

224
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:34,668
Look at the bigger picture here.

225
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:37,802
I'm asking.

226
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,848
No. You're not.

227
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,531
Claire.

228
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,866
I'll tell you what I told him.

229
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,145
Which was?

230
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,424
I'll think about it.

231
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:01,656
I know there's been some tension,

232
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:04,310
and I'm probably more
to blame than you are.

233
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,037
But I'd like to put that behind us.

234
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:08,308
Zoe,

235
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,514
you're going to be our new
White House correspondent.

236
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:12,784
What about Janine?

237
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:14,959
I promoted her to Midwest Bureau chief.

238
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,334
She's okay with that?

239
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:17,677
She wants to give up the White House?

240
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,180
It's the decision I've made.

241
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,633
It's just that Janine
has so much experience.

242
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,360
I thought you'd be more excited about this.

243
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,677
I'm sorry. I... I just
thought you brought me in here

244
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,595
to... I don't know.

245
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:32,162
To fire you.

246
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,273
Maybe.

247
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:36,799
Water under the bridge.

248
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,982
We're starting over.

249
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,075
So are you ready to take this on?

250
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:44,953
Can I think about it?

251
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:47,831
People usually don't have to think about it

252
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,302
when they're offered the White House, Zoe.

253
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,581
Just a day or two.

254
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,116
Janine is booked for a flight

255
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,235
to Chicago on Friday.

256
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,546
I'll let you know before then.

257
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:56,785
I just need to...

258
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:59,087
thank you. Thank you, Tom.

259
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,392
David Rasmussen is the majority leader,

260
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:09,831
which means he's one step above me

261
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,270
and one below Birch,

262
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,253
which is akin to being
between a very hungry wolf

263
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:14,596
and a very quarrelsome sheep.

264
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,195
Let's see if he stays with the herd

265
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,538
or joins the pack.

266
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,360
David. You mind if I join you?

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,599
Please. A salad, huh?

268
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,837
Yes. I'm trying to take
better care of myself.

269
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,116
Good man. Diet?

270
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:27,323
Diet, exercise, everything.

271
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:31,703
You ought to take better
care of yourself too.

272
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,878
Well, they should stop
serving such good pizza.

273
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:36,276
Oh, I'm not talking about the food.

274
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:38,003
I'm talking about Birch.

275
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,936
You are never going to be speaker

276
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,279
unless you do something about it.

277
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,102
I'm very satisfied where I am.

278
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:47,052
- Oh, come on.
- For the time being, yeah.

279
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,140
Time being never.

280
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,643
The only way you become speaker

281
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,561
is if Birch loses his district or retires,

282
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,904
neither of which is going to happen

283
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,567
before you and I have dentures.

284
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,134
I'm not happy where this
conversation is going, Frank.

285
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:58,372
If you want it, and I know you do,

286
00:11:58,372 --> 00:11:59,683
there's a way.

287
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:01,378
Okay. Right. I can't...

288
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:04,096
all you need is a simple
majority... 218 votes.

289
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:06,430
We're going to get at
least 205 out of the G.O.P.,

290
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,093
and after that, all you
need is 13 Democrats.

291
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,724
You and I make two.

292
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:10,939
Are you out of your mind?

293
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:15,704
Just consider it for a moment.

294
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,390
You want to collude with the Republicans?

295
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,733
I don't want to, but I would

296
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,428
if you become speaker in the process.

297
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:22,579
Never been done before.

298
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,625
There's a first time for everything.

299
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,872
This is ridiculous.

300
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,152
The Republicans would love a chance

301
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,974
to knock Bob down a peg or two.

302
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:30,157
And you want to help them.

303
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:31,596
I want to help us.

304
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,922
Bob will not play ball
with the White House.

305
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,224
Now, you're a reasonable
man, David, and he's not.

306
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,669
You know what I am?

307
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,364
I'm a discreet man.

308
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,579
You're lucky for that.

309
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,338
I'm not going to mention this to Bob,

310
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,160
but if you ever bring it up again,

311
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,079
I won't have a choice.

312
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:55,099
Looks like he opted for the herd.

313
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:04,117
Claire. I'd like to put an
order for the water filters

314
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,643
and the well-digging equipment
for the South Sudan project.

315
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:07,730
Can we talk about the budget?

316
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,809
- How much?
- 200,000.

317
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:10,960
For one project?

318
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,751
I know it's a lot, but it'll be

319
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,605
our flagship project in Africa,

320
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,492
and we would be the
first organization there

321
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:17,803
to work on this scale.

322
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:20,105
I'd like to go over the specifics first.

323
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,448
I have the budget right here.

324
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:22,568
Let me just grab my messages,

325
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,719
and then I'll come in to you.

326
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,117
Okay. I'll be in my office.

327
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:27,684
Any calls while I was out?

328
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:30,914
They're on the desk, and
this came by messenger.

329
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,821
Adam. It's Claire.

330
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:16,321
Yes. I know. It has.

331
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,414
No reason. I was just thinking about you.

332
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:24,859
You're right. It is a lie.

333
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,873
I do have a reason.

334
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,952
I need to use you.

335
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,647
The White House is where news goes to die.

336
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,149
Everything's canned.

337
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,588
These perfectly prepared statements...

338
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:34,867
it's a prestigious job, Zoe.

339
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,106
Used to be, when I was in ninth grade.

340
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,577
Now it's a graveyard.

341
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,751
The only halfway interesting thing they do

342
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:42,542
is throw a big dinner party once a year

343
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,949
where they pat themselves on the back

344
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,900
and rub shoulders with movie stars.

345
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,051
Who needs that?

346
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,490
Every day since you started here,

347
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,057
you've begged me to move you up, and now...

348
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,272
my goal in life is not

349
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:52,998
to climb up the herald's ladder

350
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:55,013
one rung at a time until
I've got my own stationery.

351
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,379
Some of us value a career
at a paper like this.

352
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,873
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for that to come off...

353
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,176
well, it did, and you skipped
a few rungs, by the way.

354
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,455
Do what you want to do, Zoe,

355
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,150
but if you want me to be your cheerleader

356
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,781
and say, "yeah, turn it down," I won't.

357
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,443
I would have killed for that job

358
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:09,754
when I first started here.

359
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:18,836
Put Fichtner in the "leaning yes" column.

360
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,435
Don't you think he's a neutral?

361
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:21,522
He hates Birch.

362
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:22,641
Yeah, but he owes Birch

363
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,824
for the ways and means appointment.

364
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,231
Put him in "neutral." Who else?

365
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,877
Ramirez is a neutral?

366
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,987
Oh, this list is so shaky.

367
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:32,682
Any one of them leaks it to Bob...

368
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,153
no, what we need is one name,

369
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,478
one person who can deliver 12.

370
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,037
The black caucus.

371
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:43,906
Womack.

372
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:45,025
What can we offer him?

373
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:46,112
What does he need?

374
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,679
Let me pull up his file.

375
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,051
Here we go.

376
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,490
McCudden air force base

377
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,217
employs 3,000 people in his district.

378
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:57,848
It's on the D.O.D.'s
chopping block this year.

379
00:15:57,848 --> 00:15:59,351
Who do we know on the Brack commission?

380
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:01,109
That's dangerous.

381
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,484
The trail leads back to us

382
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:04,019
trying to influence
the D.O.D. or the Brack.

383
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,098
No, no, no. What we do
is we close another base.

384
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,920
We leave enough money
in the D.O.D.'s budget

385
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,999
to keep Womack's base off the list.

386
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,374
What we need...

387
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:18,473
Is someone we own.

388
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,205
Dad, I'm hungry.

389
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:24,293
Coming, buddy.

390
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:26,531
Here we go.

391
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,801
With cheese.

392
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,857
Without cheese.

393
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,767
Um, dad?

394
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,918
Yeah.

395
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,028
That looks pretty disgusting.

396
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,778
Yeah, it looks disgusting.

397
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,464
It's not how it looks, it's how it tastes.

398
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:43,383
And a fork would be nice.

399
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,461
Shit. Okay. Hold on.

400
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:50,578
Hello.

401
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:52,113
Good evening, Mr. Russo.

402
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:53,584
There's a Mr. Underwood here to see you.

403
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,493
Uh... Okay. Send him up.

404
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:10,979
Hi, there.

405
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,930
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,784
This is Kevin, this is Sara.

407
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,831
Hi. I'm Frank. Nice to meet you both.

408
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:18,494
- Do you work with dad?
- I do.

409
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:20,412
Congressman Underwood is daddy's boss.

410
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:23,130
I thought you didn't have a boss.

411
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:24,186
Everybody has a boss, sweetheart,

412
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:25,816
even congressmen.

413
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:27,159
Why don't you take your
dinner and go into the bedroom?

414
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,174
- But I wanted to watch TV.
- Go now.

415
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:31,348
Cute kids.

416
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,627
Yeah, I like them.

417
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:33,747
Can I get you a drink?

418
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,665
No, I won't be here long.

419
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,776
Yeah. Have a seat.

420
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:38,991
Oh, thanks.

421
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,877
Is that a ps vita?

422
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:41,965
Uh...

423
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:46,026
Which games does he have?

424
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,465
All of them.

425
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:48,648
I have a console at home.

426
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,087
I play sometimes to relax.

427
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,165
I ought to get one of these for the car.

428
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,825
So, Peter, we need to close the shipyard

429
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,008
in your district.

430
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,319
The Brack hearing is tomorrow.

431
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,758
You won't put up your usual fight.

432
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,805
You have zero testimony to add.

433
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:06,907
I can't do that.

434
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:08,122
Yes, you can, Peter.

435
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,593
I spent months on that testimony.

436
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,927
I lobbied the commission.
My entire office...

437
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,558
I'm sure you've done splendid work,

438
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,413
but unfortunately it
can't come to fruition.

439
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,331
- Why?
- Politics.

440
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,410
There's forces bigger than
either of us at play here.

441
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,689
It's 12,000 jobs.

442
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,160
I know. It's a shame.

443
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,238
Keeping that shipyard open
is what got me elected.

444
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:25,677
Those people are my friends.

445
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,724
I'm not here to debate this, Peter.

446
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,802
The base will close.

447
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,337
The only question is, will you make it

448
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,032
a swift death or a painful one?

449
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,805
No way. I won't sit on my hands.

450
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,555
I sympathize that this is
gonna be difficult for you.

451
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,250
And I don't know how yet,

452
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,128
but I will make it up to you, Peter.

453
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:47,198
I'm a powerful friend to have right now,

454
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:49,116
perhaps your only friend,

455
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,738
so don't defy me.

456
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:05,329
Love of family.

457
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:07,407
Most politicians are permanently chained

458
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,093
to that slogan... family values.

459
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,820
But when you cozy up to hookers

460
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,907
and I find out,

461
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,497
I will make that hypocrisy hurt.

462
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,253
Did you get the present I sent you?

463
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:25,026
You wouldn't really call it a present.

464
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:28,256
Well, more of a gentle reminder, maybe.

465
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,622
Mm, more heavy-handed than gentle,

466
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:31,838
which surprised me.

467
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,532
It's not really your style, Francis.

468
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,666
But, yes. I got it.

469
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,064
I like that one.

470
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:40,184
I do too.

471
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:41,495
But the first one's better.

472
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,093
You think?

473
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:44,916
Something special tomorrow?

474
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,995
Adam Galloway's coming down from New York.

475
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,178
What for?

476
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:49,873
Because I need some of his photographs

477
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:52,623
for the silent auction
at the gala next month.

478
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,876
You speak to Remy yet?

479
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,826
I haven't.

480
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,751
If you want to look
inviting, wear the black one.

481
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,155
Hello.

482
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:12,864
Oh. Okay. Great. Thanks.

483
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:20,986
Adam?

484
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,068
How is it the world keeps spinning

485
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:31,730
and you manage to stay ahead of it?

486
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,079
David's on board with this?

487
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,294
It was his idea.

488
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:38,478
Then why isn't he here?

489
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:39,565
Well, we have to be careful

490
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:40,588
until it's a done deal.

491
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:41,803
I don't know, Frank.

492
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:42,794
Think about it, Terry.

493
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,074
You could become the first

494
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,576
African-American majority leader

495
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,047
in the United States congress.

496
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,669
Let's make some history.

497
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,739
You don't care about history.

498
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,074
You just wanted me because
I can round up the votes.

499
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:57,632
I need the votes, and
I do care about history,

500
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,039
but most importantly, Terry,

501
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,893
you know how to lead.

502
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,196
You're the head of the
black caucus for a reason.

503
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:06,681
So David becomes speaker,
I become majority leader...

504
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,216
and I stay on as whip.

505
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:10,774
Why don't you want majority
leader for yourself?

506
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,405
I'm satisfied where I am.

507
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,876
Maybe one day, when you become speaker,

508
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,699
you'll bump me up.

509
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,777
This is the sort of thing
that there's no turning back.

510
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,815
I can throw a cherry on top.

511
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:24,045
McCudden stays open.

512
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:26,539
How?

513
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,202
You don't want to know how.

514
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:29,481
You just want the headline

515
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:31,751
when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.

516
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,219
- 12 votes?
- 12 votes.

517
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,010
I can get you 10, probably 11.

518
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,504
It's so refreshing to work with someone

519
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,231
who will throw a saddle on a gift horse

520
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:44,862
rather than look it in the mouth.

521
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,934
That's nice.

522
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,394
Wow.

523
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:04,623
I found her in a village outside Amravati.

524
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,158
Her name was Tiala.

525
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,301
She died three weeks
after I took that picture.

526
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,772
Oh, that's awful.

527
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:11,882
You can have them all if you like.

528
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,176
I love your hair short.

529
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:19,908
Do you have plans tonight?

530
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:23,394
No.

531
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:25,696
Is Frank expecting you home?

532
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:27,743
I'm sure he'll be home late.

533
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:29,725
Get dinner with me.

534
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:32,028
What time is your train?

535
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:34,266
I don't book round-trip tickets.

536
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,191
It's going to be a
while before I can leave.

537
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,662
What time will you be done?

538
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:44,946
Probably around 8:00.

539
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:48,208
I'll pick a place,

540
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,743
let you know.

541
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,557
Ah. David.

542
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,604
How are you, Joe?

543
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:08,577
I'm behind you. Let's do this.

544
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:09,601
Do what?

545
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,607
Keep your cards close.

546
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:14,077
I like that.

547
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,589
Hi. Yeah. This is room 1214.

548
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:02,874
I'd like a bottle of the Weinbach, please.

549
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,575
Yeah. Actually, could
you make that two bottles?

550
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,069
Thank you.

551
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:11,956
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

552
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:21,197
- You still smoke?
- From time to time, yes.

553
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,569
I quit. These are an illusion.

554
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:29,159
You want?

555
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,470
Sure.

556
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,642
What?

557
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,073
Not now.

558
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,215
Okay.

559
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:38,198
I should go.

560
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:41,044
- I just... it seemed...
- I know.

561
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,241
We can't start this again.

562
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:46,959
When I end something, I end it.

563
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:50,765
So why'd you have me come all
the way down from New York?

564
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,779
It was a mistake.

565
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:55,721
I'm sorry, Adam.

566
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,480
I should've kept it business.

567
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:01,125
Side of you I like the least.

568
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,003
There are no mistakes, Claire.

569
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:33,550
- Hi.
- Hello.

570
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,108
- More wine?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,649
How was your day?

572
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:44,390
- Good.
- Adam well?

573
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,309
He is.

574
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:48,931
We just had dinner.

575
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:51,553
Hmm.

576
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,942
I e-mailed Remy on the way home.

577
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:57,021
I told him I'm not taking the money.

578
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,384
Thank you.

579
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:05,431
I appreciate that this was not easy.

580
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:07,637
Well, we don't like easy, do we?

581
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:10,899
Oh, the evidence would suggest it.

582
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:13,905
Is it all right if the Holburns
come over for dinner Wednesday night?

583
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,367
I want Felicity to buy
some tables for the gala.

584
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,701
Yeah, of course.

585
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:20,940
I'm going to need congressmen
and senators there.

586
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,274
- You need to call in favors.
- Done.

587
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,809
Not a few, a lot.

588
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,079
I'll start making calls in the morning.

589
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:30,501
Adam donated ten photographs.

590
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,547
That was generous of him.

591
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:38,367
He's staying at the mandarin.

592
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:42,108
And you?

593
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:44,123
Here.

594
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,492
But the proving grounds' importance

595
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:56,338
stems far beyond it's
strategic geographic value.

596
00:27:56,338 --> 00:28:00,175
A.P.G.'s research and
development of military materiel

597
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:03,597
is central to our nation's
counter-terrorism efforts.

598
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:05,643
The base houses research laboratories

599
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,178
for preventative medicine

600
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,577
as well as a wide variety
of training grounds

601
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:11,335
for military personnel.

602
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:14,181
A.P.G. is also a job creator.

603
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:18,114
It provides 400 million
dollars in payroll annually,

604
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,056
and nearly half a billion
dollars in contracts.

605
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,998
Thank you for the opportunity
to testify before you today.

606
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:27,292
Any questions for the
congresswoman from Maryland?

607
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,146
No.

608
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:32,344
Those in favor of removing
the aberdeen proving ground

609
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,263
from the list of closures?

610
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:35,702
Aye.

611
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,429
So noted and removed.

612
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,530
Okay, we'll next consider

613
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,545
the Philadelphia naval shipyard.

614
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,295
Would the congressman from
Pennsylvania's first district

615
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:47,341
like to offer testimony?

616
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:57,222
I have no testimony to offer.

617
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,856
Yeah, but the difference
that we're gonna make...

618
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:08,318
Uh, Terry, let me call you right back.

619
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,013
Terry Womack?

620
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:11,836
Possibly.

621
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:13,786
I've had three members of
the Black Caucus tell me

622
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,897
they're backing my play
for the speakership.

623
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,464
- Interesting.
- I have a sense

624
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,734
you've been disseminating
some misinformation.

625
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,068
No. I'm afraid it's you
who are misinformed, David.

626
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:24,754
You don't have three members
backing you. You have ten.

627
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:27,856
I made it very clear I
didn't want any part of this.

628
00:29:27,856 --> 00:29:29,359
Yes, you made it crystal clear.

629
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,862
Then why are you telling people?

630
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:33,068
Because they don't know
you made it crystal clear.

631
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:34,443
I have to go to Bob with this.

632
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:36,554
He'll think you organized a coup,

633
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:40,199
got cold feet, and are
making me the scapegoat.

634
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,342
David, if I pick up this phone right now

635
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,260
and leak this story,

636
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,403
Bob will have no choice but to drop you,

637
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:49,792
even if he believes your version of events.

638
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,685
You wanna take a seat?

639
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,993
- Uh, Freddy?
- Yeah, Frank?

640
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:02,967
You better make it a half order.
I got a big dinner tonight.

641
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,438
Sure thing.

642
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:06,292
Slaw?

643
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,883
- Always.
- You got it.

644
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:14,287
Here you go.

645
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:16,493
- Oh...
- Ohh!

646
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:17,964
So, what's the latest?

647
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,563
Oh, you know, Frank. Same old shit.

648
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,897
Almost got killed last weekend.

649
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,560
- Here?
- No.

650
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,191
State fair down in Virginia.

651
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,781
Me and my brother hauling
this smoker down there,

652
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:30,819
and this fucking minivan
had a fridge strapped on top.

653
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:33,793
A fridge strapped on
top of a minivan, Frank.

654
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,296
That's stupid.

655
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:36,799
Well, that fridge slipped loose.

656
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,717
Boom! Right in front of us.

657
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,700
I had to swerve to the
left. Barely missed it.

658
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,778
But now that smoker is fishtailing,

659
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:44,729
almost hit a hatchback in the next lane.

660
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:46,807
Swerved to the right.
Barely missed that too.

661
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:48,662
- Jesus.
- Oh, man, it was real.

662
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:50,836
But, you know, that's
why God gave us reflexes.

663
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:53,938
So we can move the fuck
out of the way when a fridge

664
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,921
come out of nowhere.

665
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,639
- How them ribs?
- You know how they are.

666
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:02,092
- You know I like to hear it.
- Perfection, Freddy.

667
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:04,011
Perfection.

668
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,537
- You go on ahead, Frank.
- Thank you, Freddy.

669
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:07,912
Mm-hmm.

670
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:09,543
Well, this is a surprise.

671
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:11,781
- You usually text.
- Where are you?

672
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:13,348
On the other side of the tracks

673
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,267
trying to find the meaning of life.

674
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,834
Did you find anything for me?

675
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,433
You mean anything newsworthy?

676
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:21,342
Uh, I actually didn't call to badger you.

677
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:23,197
Yes, you did, but that's
part of your charm.

678
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:24,668
No.

679
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:28,537
I wanted to tell you
that I've been promoted

680
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,616
to White House correspondent.

681
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:38,258
I'll have to travel with the
press corps, be at briefings,

682
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:41,040
but I can work around all that.

683
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,279
If you need me. It won't change anything.

684
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,877
Oh, on the contrary.

685
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:46,348
This changes everything.

686
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:47,819
No. I can be flexible.

687
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,154
I'm not interested in
someone who's flexible,

688
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm interested in someone who's available.

689
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,511
So you think I should turn it down?

690
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,142
That's entirely up to you.

691
00:31:55,142 --> 00:31:57,604
Well, I mean, it's not official yet.

692
00:31:57,604 --> 00:31:59,619
- I could...
- Oh, look, I've got to go,

693
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,721
but call me, you know, if you
find yourself available again.

694
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:11,354
You see, Freddy believes that
if a fridge falls off a minivan,

695
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:12,985
you better swerve out of its way.

696
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:16,119
I believe it's the fridge's
job to swerve out of mine.

697
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,288
Hey, Janine...

698
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:29,230
Keep walking, Zoe. I really don't
want to talk to you right now.

699
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,052
It's not like I asked him for it.

700
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:33,035
- He just called me into his office, and...
- Oh, please.

701
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,689
You've been gunning for my job
since the day you bounced in here

702
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,096
with a lollipop in your mouth.

703
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:38,279
Congratulations.

704
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,294
I'll send you a bottle of champagne

705
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,212
from the Middle West,
wherever the fuck that is.

706
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,122
I'm gonna turn it down.
You don't have to leave.

707
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:46,817
Are you trying to rub this in or something?

708
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:49,151
Please believe me. You
should be in the White House.

709
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:51,581
I don't want it. I never did.

710
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:55,259
I was hoping we could go see Tom together.

711
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:58,073
- I want him to know that we both...
- Get the fuck out of my face.

712
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,343
I'm asking. For real. I don't want the job.

713
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:02,965
Then you're an even bigger
idiot than I thought you were.

714
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:04,596
Go. Before I get violent.

715
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,180
Peter?

716
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:32,000
- Hello?
- But the Bering Sea

717
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,143
is a violent and unpredictable force.

718
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,445
Hi. Uh, my name is Christina.

719
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,588
- I work with your dad.
- He's not here.

720
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:40,250
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

721
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,073
He said he'd be back in a little while.

722
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:44,375
Uh, when was that?

723
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,021
When he dropped us home from school.

724
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,099
He left his phone here.

725
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,768
Are you dad's girlfriend?

726
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,303
No. No. I, uh...

727
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:57,838
I just... I... I work for your dad.

728
00:33:57,838 --> 00:33:59,948
Then why do you have the
keys to his apartment?

729
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,617
Will you make us pop-tarts?

730
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:07,783
An enormous 60-foot rogue
wave struck the Aleutian...

731
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:09,797
It was just sublime, Claire.

732
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,003
- Thank you.
- I don't think I'll eat for a week.

733
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:14,434
Does that mean no room for dessert?

734
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:16,512
I'd love to, but, uh, none for me.

735
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,335
Why don't you and I head downstairs

736
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,222
for a little Brandy and some cigars?

737
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:23,323
- Cubans?
- You don't think I smoke anything legal, do you?

738
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:27,256
- Dessert for you?
- No. No, thanks.

739
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,079
But I will take a refill
of this Chardonnay, though.

740
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:32,085
Of course. Oh, this is
almost out. I'll grab another.

741
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:49,385
I hate how they just hit you like that

742
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:51,431
with no warning.

743
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:53,414
You get night sweats too?

744
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:58,146
I, uh...

745
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,928
This is very new to me.

746
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:02,911
Does Frank know?

747
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:06,524
I haven't... we haven't... no.

748
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:09,210
I'm sorry. We don't
have to talk about this.

749
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,920
No. It's fine. I'm just, uh...

750
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,606
It's fine. I feel better now.

751
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:17,684
- Could I have a little bit more?
- Sure.

752
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,219
Just say when.

753
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:22,289
Charles is driving tonight, so...

754
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,655
And when.

755
00:35:25,455 --> 00:35:27,373
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

756
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,344
So, you mentioned, when
you invited me, the C.W.I.

757
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:37,478
You're having a gala
and launching some new...

758
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:39,013
Yes, that's right.

759
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,899
We just brought on this
brilliant young woman

760
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:43,490
who's going to help us
expand our efforts overseas.

761
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,440
- Claire, I will save you the trouble.
- So we'll...

762
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,446
Charles and I would be
delighted to contribute.

763
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,588
Well, that's very
generous of you, Felicity.

764
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:53,466
Well, you were such a darling, getting
us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

765
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:56,088
- Oh, that was nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

766
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:57,687
It was...

767
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:00,214
People in this town
don't go out of their way

768
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:02,068
to be nice to each other.

769
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:05,330
Fourteen years Charles and
I have been here, and...

770
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,408
Anyway, um,

771
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:09,966
I'm grateful to have a friend.

772
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:13,996
How much do you need?

773
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:26,914
Christina, what the
fuck are you doing here?

774
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:29,121
Shh. They're sleeping.

775
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,106
Peter.

776
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:27,255
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, kiddo.

777
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,173
Would you take your brother downstairs?

778
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:31,955
- I'll be there in a second.
- Okay. Bye, dad.

779
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:35,057
- Bye.
- Bye? Where they going?

780
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:37,647
I'm taking them to their grandmother's.

781
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:39,982
I was able to get a hold of
Madeleine, and I told her...

782
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:41,900
Oh, fuck. You didn't tell her?

783
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,450
No, I didn't. But I should have.

784
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,528
I told her that you had to travel for work,

785
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:50,086
which is the last time I ever lie for you.

786
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,220
Look...

787
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,427
what happened, Peter?

788
00:37:55,427 --> 00:37:58,209
I'm... I'm sorry about the Brack hearing.

789
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,319
- I was...
- Fuck the Brack hearing.

790
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,397
What about your kids?

791
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,267
After I drop them off, I'm done.

792
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:08,825
I am no longer your girlfriend.
I no longer work for you.

793
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:10,520
No... hey, Christina...

794
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,334
I don't want to hear it, Peter.
There's no excuse this time.

795
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:23,055
- I don't have much time, Frank.
- I'll make it short.

796
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:25,005
- The President?
- No. The speakership.

797
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,572
David's making a play.

798
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:28,906
- What?
- He came to me for support.

799
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,825
My first thought was
to tell you right away,

800
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,031
but then my second thought
was to ignore my first thought,

801
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,302
because we have the votes, Bob.

802
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:37,572
If there had been a party
revolt, I would've known about it.

803
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:40,034
We don't need the whole
party to revolt. We need 13...

804
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:42,944
13 Democrats, plus the
other side of the aisle.

805
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,415
Are you out of your mind?

806
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:46,302
People have been asking
me that a lot lately.

807
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:47,869
I'm inclined to start saying yes.

808
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:49,979
Who are they... the 13?

809
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,962
David and I are two, Terry Womack,

810
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,424
and ten members of the
black caucus make another 11.

811
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:56,119
Is the President behind this?

812
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,462
No. He doesn't have a clue.

813
00:38:57,462 --> 00:39:00,180
This was David's plan executed by me.

814
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,098
But there is an out for you, Bob.

815
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,401
I can sway Womack either way

816
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:08,142
as long as you make him
the next majority leader.

817
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:10,061
And...

818
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:12,427
- The education bill.
- Now we're on the same page.

819
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:14,506
I can't do that. You know I can't.

820
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:17,479
You're the speaker, Bob. You
can do anything you'd like.

821
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:22,564
And I have to say, appointing the first
African-American majority leader...

822
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:25,602
why, that isn't a bad legacy to have.

823
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:28,991
I'm sorry. I changed my mind.

824
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,590
I thought about it, and...

825
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,148
Thinking about it was what
those two days were for.

826
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:35,610
And then I thought about it
some more, and I realized I...

827
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,945
Jesus Christ, you're fucking unbelievable.

828
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:41,494
Look, Tom, I appreciate the fact
that you took a chance on me, but...

829
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:42,773
No, I don't think you do.

830
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:45,203
I don't think you appreciate anything.

831
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:47,858
I think you're an ungrateful,
self-entitled little c...

832
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:49,712
Little what?

833
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:52,526
Little what, Tom? Say it.

834
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:55,468
Cunt. You're a cunt.

835
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:01,831
What are you doing?

836
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,494
Don't you dare...

837
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:05,765
you don't even know what I'm typing.

838
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:07,715
- Get out, Zoe.
- Just a second. I'm almost done.

839
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:10,529
Get out. You're fired.

840
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:13,343
Whatever you have to tell yourself, Tom.

841
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:14,462
Get out!

842
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:17,884
So should I press "send"?

843
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:19,962
I think I should.

844
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:24,983
Call me whatever you want,

845
00:40:24,983 --> 00:40:26,965
but you should remember, these days,

846
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:30,163
when you're talking to one person,
you're talking to a thousand.

847
00:40:45,384 --> 00:40:48,102
Well, you'll say you
wanted to spend more time

848
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,829
focusing on your home district.

849
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:52,611
You'll say Womack is the
right man to fill your shoes.

850
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:55,617
You won't make waves.
You won't do interviews.

851
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:58,047
You'll suck it up and be a team player.

852
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,413
This was Frank's idea.

853
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:02,588
I told you he was gonna
try to blame me on it.

854
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,155
Ask around. Talk to Womack.

855
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:05,657
I did. He said you came to him.

856
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:08,471
He's fucking lying, Bob! I would never...

857
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,878
shut up, David.

858
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:12,820
Do you understand how you're to behave

859
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,387
when we make the announcement?

860
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:16,114
And if I don't play along?

861
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:19,056
Then the D-triple-C will
pour everything it's got

862
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:21,998
into your primary opponent's
campaign next cycle.

863
00:41:21,998 --> 00:41:23,916
We'll cleave you from the herd

864
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,506
and watch you die in the wilderness.

865
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:30,600
Tell us now, David.

866
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:40,033
If you think it's best, Robert.

867
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:42,751
And just think, he could have been a wolf.

868
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,486
You made yourself available.

869
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,597
I quit.

870
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:20,420
Fuck that place.

871
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,138
It was a prison. I'm free now.

872
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:24,800
Congratulations.

873
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,207
Where are you?

874
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:28,158
- In a car.
- So am I.

875
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:29,597
Where you headed?

876
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:32,443
- Home.
- So am I.

877
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:34,170
To your home or mine?

878
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,609
Is that an invitation?

879
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,847
It's whatever you want it to be.

880
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,341
- You sound tipsy.
- I am.

881
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:43,507
I just spent the last two hours
drinking Long Island Iced Teas.

882
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:47,440
What's your address?

883
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,865
Do your parents know you live like this?

884
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,542
No. They haven't visited.

885
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,228
Are you cared for?

886
00:43:59,228 --> 00:44:00,987
How do you mean?

887
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:04,601
Do you have a man who cares for you?

888
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,223
- An older man.
- No.

889
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,868
But you've been with older men before?

890
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:12,787
Yes.

891
00:44:12,787 --> 00:44:15,121
Then you know they hurt you,

892
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,359
and after they hurt you,

893
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,790
they discard you.

894
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,955
You can't hurt me.

895
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,793
Take your heels off.
