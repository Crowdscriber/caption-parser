1
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,307
WMD. Got that WMD.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,607
You got to move it on down.

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,650
- It ain't pretty.
- Doesn't have to be.

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,946
Just needs to pull them
from the places still worth salvaging.

5
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,626
All right, I told the other shifts...

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,726
now I'm telling you.

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,767
When I ride my district
at the end of this week...

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,201
I want to see empty corners.

9
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,931
They bring it here,
or the other two free zones...

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,839
or you bang them senseless.

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,274
Anything you need to do, you do.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,508
Up to a body that can't walk itself up
out of the emergency room...

13
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,381
I'll back up you and your men.
You understand me?

14
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,582
Now, I've detailed our I.I.D. Representative
to the range for the entire week.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,420
All citizen complaints will be handled
by Lieutenant Mello here.

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,763
Whatever it takes.

17
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,096
Man, I ain't even dirty. I got rights and shit.

18
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,431
Go with the one about staying silent.

19
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,111
Shit like this don't happen in Hamsterdam.

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,079
I'm up for just standing somewhere?

21
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,175
Fuck y'all. We in America!

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,719
West Baltimore.

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,122
I swear to God,
Officer Herc, you unhook Babycakes...

24
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,629
and my peoples be down
where you want us. Swear to God.

25
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,431
Fuck with a man's ride,
you're gonna get his attention.

26
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,564
- Babycakes?
- Yo, yo, yo, hold up!

27
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,942
Motherfuckers gonna hear
from my motherfucking lawyer.

28
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,347
- This right here is some outrageous shit.
- You think?

29
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,411
Fuck y'all, lying motherfuckers!

30
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,487
Gentlemen.

31
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,638
That is outrageous.

32
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,075
That's right.

33
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,238
Come on, sweetheart.

34
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,412
Bust your ass out of there.

35
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,048
It's still Maryland.

36
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,155
But if you all don't take that shit down
to Hamsterdam tomorrow...

37
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,249
next time it's gonna be West Virginia.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,387
That little star right there,
across from the Dipper? That's north.

39
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,891
You wanna go the other way.

40
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,311
Assholes.

41
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,170
WMD. Got that WMD.

42
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,741
Landfill, got Landfill, yo.

43
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,558
WMD. Got that WMD.

44
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,662
They all here, man. Landfill.

45
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,960
We'll start the interior construction
within the week.

46
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,865
Which means we need
to readdress the budget.

47
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,130
Readdress how?

48
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,103
Well, for one,
the price of steel has doubled.

49
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,572
It'll triple if we don't buy it now.

50
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,905
- Ain't the steel bought already?
- Not the bulk of it, no.

51
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,808
Then there are the gutting costs.
They exceeded our original expectations.

52
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:25,043
You, know, he needs to wear that hat
when he's on site. Code, you know.

53
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,309
Gutting costs went up, huh?

54
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,820
Well, that was due to your modifications.

55
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,719
The changes you asked for
in those loft units.

56
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,553
- Necessitating new permits.
- Which means another delay.

57
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,288
Unless we expedite.
Bring the architect and his people back in...

58
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,490
over the weekend and get something
to the city on Monday.

59
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,898
- Whoa, ain't that part of his original fee?
- No, this was unanticipated.

60
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,994
Look, y'all fucked up.
So y'all supposed to take the hit, right?

61
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,129
Excuse me?

62
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,333
I mean, my man here don't know shit
about no gutting costs.

63
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,376
He don't know nothing
about no price of no steel.

64
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,804
He just trying to get some shit built.

65
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,245
And y'all supposed to have the expertise
behind this.

66
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,178
Only what I'm saying is, it seem like
the expertise ain't where it supposed to be.

67
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,847
Unfortunately, Mr. Barksdale, cost overruns
are the nature of the business.

68
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,719
And, well,
we should discuss this over lunch.

69
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,293
Hell no, man, I got elsewhere to be.

70
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,094
And this is the Marlo kid.
He's fresh blood for the organization.

71
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,167
Bell's given him the best real estate.

72
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,932
The Barksdale people
took what they needed...

73
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,939
when the Towers came down, no problem.

74
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,804
Stringer hasn't missed a step.

75
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,401
- They're still selling drugs?
- Lot of drugs.

76
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,944
He's not dropping bodies.

77
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,505
No, he doesn't need to.
He's got all the corners he needs.

78
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,141
And I'm supposed to give a shit?

79
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,585
Lieutenant, two weeks,
Bell looked insulated...

80
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,056
like he had enough legitimate front
to be able to be just the bank.

81
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,026
What Kima's found out is
he's still directly involved with the drugs.

82
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,359
Otherwise, why the face-to-face
with the Stanfield kid?

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,161
He's still connected to the day-to-day.

84
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,769
We come back six, eight months...

85
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,972
you won't even get him in a room
talking drugs, much less handling any.

86
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,064
It's now or never, Lieutenant.

87
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,414
Stringer Bell is quiet.

88
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,519
And if he's quiet, I don't give a fuck
if we come back a year from now...

89
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,148
and find out
he's on the Greater Baltimore Committee.

90
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,454
This unit is about the bodies.

91
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,534
<i>Major Foerster, call 2462. Major Foerster.</i>

92
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,414
What the fuck is this?

93
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,387
Ten-page report
on the heroic police work...

94
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,551
undertaken to retrieve
Officer Dozerman's service weapon.

95
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,196
Send that upstairs,
keep the bosses out of your ass for a while.

96
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,593
You actually did all this?

97
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,337
Would it matter if I had?

98
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,574
Jay, I'm a murder police...

99
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,682
I got a double on my plate.
I'm gonna work it.

100
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,361
We ain't got Fayette and Poppleton neither,
what the fuck?

101
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,589
I'm working on it, man.
The avenue corners, too.

102
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,098
What you mean you working on it, man?

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,794
Why we ain't at least got a shop set up
down the block?

104
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,804
- We did.
- There was a setback.

105
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,568
- Ran our boys off.
- Who?

106
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,541
- Just some player, man...
- Listen.

107
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,610
Let him tell me. We hired him for muscle.

108
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,207
- The boy, Marlo.
- Marlo. Who the fuck is Marlo?

109
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,884
He tied to one of the mobs?

110
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,547
Young boy. Running it on his own, too.

111
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:54,558
Got maybe 15 spots along here
and the avenue.

112
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,323
An independent with no fucking support...

113
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,889
got all the prime real estate
and we doing what exactly?

114
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,634
Young boy ran us off the corner?

115
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm losing my motherfucking mind, man.

116
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,239
And I sincerely mean your girl
no disrespect...

117
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,278
but Tosha wasn't killed
because she just happened by that mess.

118
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,821
I think we all know that, right?

119
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,582
She was a player. We know that much.

120
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,592
Look, we got the science that says
she fired a gun when it all went down.

121
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,892
Gun wasn't there for us to find...

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,833
but that just means
somebody grabbed it up, right?

123
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:41,396
I mean, your girl,
she definitely had her say...

124
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,733
when everybody else
on that street was talking.

125
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,444
Am I wrong?

126
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,674
Well, I got witnesses on the scene
that said she was there...

127
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,445
right in the middle of a drug robbery.

128
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,350
Boy by the name of Omar was in on it, too.

129
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,187
Nobody saying Tosha was an angel.

130
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,486
Nobody saying that.

131
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,632
But what are they saying?

132
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,799
The crew Tosha was running with...

133
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,563
maybe they didn't throw the shot
that killed her...

134
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,105
but, if they don't come to me early
and tell the true story...

135
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,834
I guarantee they won't breathe
a free breath...

136
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,069
until them cicadas come back.

137
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,682
You all get the word to the right people.

138
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,353
And you've spoken
to the medical examiner, correct?

139
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,057
What's he say?

140
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,531
- He says it's lumpy.
- Lumpy?

141
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,063
He says that if an investigation
can come up with a credible scenario...

142
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,574
he's willing to change the cause of death
to homicide.

143
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,940
Do you even have a suspect here?

144
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,238
No.

145
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,410
Look, I don't know
how you city guys do it...

146
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,314
but down here in Annapolis
we try to duck a punch or two.

147
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,580
Not lean into every last one.

148
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,582
My county doesn't need another murder.

149
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,940
I'm glad you could come.

150
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,711
Ladies, Reverend Wright,
I'd like you to meet my husband...

151
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,082
- Cedric Daniels.
- Nice to meet you.

152
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,418
- Not that I've seen, no.
- She was invited, right?

153
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,493
Oh, of course. Eunetta doesn't
make it too much nowadays.

154
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,255
Not even Council meetings.

155
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,196
I think Eunetta's gonna have her hands full,
come the primary.

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,093
Mayor will pull her through.

157
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,069
- He still have coattails?
- Shit, boy.

158
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,504
You look up "incumbent"
in the damn dictionary...

159
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,509
and you'll see Clarence Royce
smiling back at you.

160
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,476
He gets his whole ticket through.

161
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,841
The Mayor's got a new poll...

162
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,906
showing his negatives
have really jumped in the last year.

163
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,283
Not that he's gonna be putting
a press release out about that.

164
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,825
I hear you took a swipe at His Honor
the other day on that witness murder.

165
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,450
Well, not at the Mayor directly.

166
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:19,053
But we had the police brass
in front of the subcommittee...

167
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,963
and, I don't know,
there's just no excuse for what happened.

168
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,728
You keep on it, Councilman.

169
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,237
A little smack here and there
does this administration a world of good.

170
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,005
That's why we need new blood
on the Council.

171
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,477
Keep everybody honest.

172
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,240
Yeah.

173
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,816
Yeah. Give me a Coors Light.

174
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,664
Don't embarrass yourself.

175
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,895
So.

176
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,005
Your murder's never gonna be a murder...

177
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,438
and Daniels' got his head all up
in another case.

178
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,600
I know.

179
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,077
You know what the hardest part
about being a police is?

180
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,175
Yeah. Explaining to your wife
why she has to take antibiotics...

181
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,114
for your kidney infection.

182
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,480
I was gonna say
trying to make the job actually matter.

183
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,854
That, too.

184
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,497
- Speaking of your ex-wife, what's up there?
- Nothing.

185
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,761
She got her hooks in some lawyer.
Money guy.

186
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,966
Fuck it and fuck her.

187
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,470
So what, you moving on?

188
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,572
Yeah, I might have some fresh hope,
now that you mention it.

189
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,773
Yeah?

190
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,216
Yeah, there was this woman
at this thing for my kids.

191
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,549
She, like, raises money for the school
and all that, you know?

192
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,254
She's got a face, a body, and a brain
all working together.

193
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,356
And she looks like the kind
who might tell me when my shit stinks...

194
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,628
which is probably what I need.

195
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,761
She's kind of like Freamon with tits.

196
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,639
- So what, you get her number?
- No, not exactly.

197
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,371
Hey, what kind of detective would I be...

198
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,812
if I couldn't track a white woman
in Baltimore, right?

199
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,752
There you go.

200
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,784
See what she wants, okay?

201
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,424
You were so smooth tonight.

202
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,562
You had them
eating right out of your hand.

203
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,535
It's what you need from me, right?

204
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:44,072
Anyway, it wasn't too bad.
I'm getting better at it, I guess.

205
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,937
You are.

206
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,052
Cedric, maybe we <i>could...</i>

207
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,957
I don't know.

208
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,230
Right now, you tell me
where you need me...

209
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,966
and whether you want the Class A
or the Class B uniform, and I'm there.

210
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,508
More than that, I just don't know.

211
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,577
So?

212
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,047
So?

213
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,883
I'm saying, what the fuck?

214
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,931
Take a deep breath, man.

215
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,899
I mean, take a long deep breath.

216
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,495
Know that if you call the shot, we at war.
We at war.

217
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,904
I'm there like I always been.

218
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,482
Thing about turf, man, it ain't like it was.

219
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,509
I mean, you ain't gotta pay no price
of buying no corners.

220
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,751
Since when do we buy corners?

221
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,091
We take corners.

222
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,891
Man, you gonna buy one way or another.

223
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,526
Whether it's with the bodies we done lost
or you're gonna lose...

224
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,002
time in the joint
that's behind us or ahead of us...

225
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,734
I mean, you gonna get some shit
in this game, but it ain't shit for free.

226
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,647
I mean, how many corners do we need?

227
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,118
- How much money can a nigga make?
- More than a nigga can spend.

228
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,983
And then we ain't gonna be around
to spend what we done made already.

229
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,354
Shit, I didn't think
I was gonna be around this long.

230
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,918
Yeah. Well, we here now.

231
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,264
The fact is we got every mob in town,
East Side, West Side...

232
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,826
ready to pull together,
share territory on that good shit...

233
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,371
that Prop Joe putting out there.

234
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,873
We take that shit downtown
and we get in the money game and that...

235
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,840
niggas ain't going to jail.

236
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,443
I mean, we past
that run-and-gun shit, man...

237
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,644
like, we find us a package
and we ain't got to see nothing but bank.

238
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,350
Nothing but cash.
No corners, no territory, nothing.

239
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,454
We make so much
goddamn straight money, man...

240
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,823
the government come after us, man,
ain't shit they can say.

241
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,222
Businessmen, huh?

242
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,496
Let the young'uns worry
about how to retail...

243
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,565
where to wholesale.

244
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,175
I mean, who gives a fuck
who's standing on what corner...

245
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,040
if we're taking that shit off the top...

246
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,113
putting that shit to good use,
making that shit work for us.

247
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,752
We can run more than corners, B. Period.

248
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,357
We could do like Little Willie, man...

249
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,154
back in the day,
with all that number money...

250
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,252
and run this goddamn city.

251
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,397
Like businessmen.

252
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,045
Man, just let me talk to the boy, Marlo.
See if I can't smooth this shit out.

253
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,547
I mean, it ain't gonna be overnight...

254
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,584
'cause the nigga
only knows what he knows.

255
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,145
But I think I could talk some sense
in his head.

256
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,752
Yeah, I ain't no suit-wearing
businessman like you.

257
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,328
You know, I'm just a gangster, I suppose.

258
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,602
And I want my corners.

259
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,104
<i>I gotta tell you, I'm having a tough time...</i>

260
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,149
<i>wrapping my head around</i>
<i>the reality of you being paroled.</i>

261
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,209
<i>Trust me, I won't fully comprehend it</i>
<i>until I'm sipping my first martini.</i>

262
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,385
Homicide police went to Tosha people.

263
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,986
Talking about how they know
she was in the mix.

264
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:03,090
Saying they got witnesses and shit.
They called your name on it, too.

265
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,306
- So what they say?
- They called me.

266
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,044
- Hey, yo, I know this cop, man.
- Yeah?

267
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,444
Maybe we should help him out.
Tell him who did what.

268
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,106
Man, stop wilding, Kimmy.

269
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,775
All right, now I said I got this.

270
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,874
Tosha's people want to know from me...

271
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,977
exactly what happened that day.
That's all I'm saying.

272
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,352
Well, tell them she caught one
trying to take them boys down, man.

273
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,891
Ain't no need
to involve the police in none of this.

274
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,120
Sound to me like he involved already.

275
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,424
Kimmy, I told you, I got this.

276
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,039
My husband worked for Mr. Cooper
at the American Can.

277
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,177
He made good money.

278
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,718
We saved up and bought this house.

279
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,921
There were some white families
still living in the neighborhood then.

280
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,720
The neighborhood
has changed, Mrs. Hazel.

281
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,755
This is a picture of the house.

282
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,830
Oh.

283
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,262
City-owned, taxes paid and all.

284
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,101
It is very nice.

285
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,642
But I can't afford that.

286
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,646
You don't have to worry about the money.
It's all taken care of.

287
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,679
It's a special program we have.

288
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,885
It's for people who are living...

289
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,313
in really bad situations...

290
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,722
you know,
with the drug trafficking you see outside.

291
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,889
And this is a good neighborhood.

292
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,931
It's safe and it's on the number 19 line.

293
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,164
And it's walking distance from your church.

294
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:51,572
Officer, this is the only home I know.

295
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,574
It's all I've got.

296
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,139
Now, you say you have a program
that can place me somewhere else.

297
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,777
But you ain't got no program
for what's outside my door?

298
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,027
You weren't lying.

299
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,733
Yeah, I told you. And I've been
all over these blocks like you said.

300
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,807
I haven't seen any cameras,
nobody peeking.

301
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,306
And Monk Man and his crew been here
for grinding for days...

302
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,211
and narcos ain't even blink.

303
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,011
I'll tell you what.

304
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,110
Put some of my people on it. Not too many.
Just them young'uns.

305
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,755
Make the package real small,
just in case this a trap.

306
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,623
- I wanna hear directly from you on this.
- I'm on it.

307
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,065
This shit is just bugged out, you know?

308
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,272
String called, said to tell you
he gonna be late.

309
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,368
Behind something he need to see
down the way.

310
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,785
- So, what you telling me, we weak?
- Boss, I reached out to Black Donnie.

311
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:15,124
Okay, spit it out, man.
Listen, stop fucking double-talking me.

312
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,057
Black Donnie say he ain't having any of it.

313
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,996
Say Brother Mouzone put a hex on all of us.

314
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,195
What about Peacock?

315
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,327
Peacock went
and hired out with some Dominicans.

316
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,304
What about Eggy Mule?

317
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,070
Eggy locked up.
Caught a nickel with the Feds for a pistol.

318
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,575
What about Shorty Boyd?

319
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,572
Shorty Boyd went
and cleaned his whole act up.

320
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,682
Yeah, I know. Fucked us all up.

321
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,154
What we got?

322
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:49,188
The soldier you sent at us, Cutty,
he gonna work out...

323
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,092
but the rest of them dudes, I don't know.

324
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,828
All right, listen, big man, you about to earn
your fucking keep around here, right now.

325
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,733
You go out, you get Cutty
and get the best of the rest...

326
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,807
and you put a hurting on Marlo.
I want my corners.

327
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,071
What the fuck?

328
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,281
- What now?
- Problems, Mr. Bell.

329
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,717
No, this ain't the time for problems, man.
I got places to be.

330
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,220
We're being told
it may take weeks before...

331
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,553
we get the city inspectors back down here
to approve these site changes.

332
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,752
- Weeks?
- Every day we wait, you lose money.

333
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,850
Man, what the fuck?

334
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,896
How does anybody make any money
in this game, man?

335
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:29,455
Every time I think we good,
you back in my pockets.

336
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,408
- You need to make a call.
- Again?

337
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,500
He's the consultant, right?

338
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,047
You're paying him a nice chunk of change
to consult, right?

339
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,549
This is why we have a politically-connected
guy like that on the payroll.

340
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,519
He goes downtown and does for us
what we can't do for ourselves.

341
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,820
Democracy in action, Mr. Bell.

342
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,627
All right, look. Me and Slim,
we're gonna work through the alleys...

343
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,598
and hit them from the side.

344
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,603
I want you to come through here.

345
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,042
- Slow down, through the intersection.
- Oh.

346
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,076
Why don't we just come up this way?

347
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,578
Then we ain't got to worry
about crossing no intersection.

348
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,978
Come that way? You putting
your driver in the line of fire, man.

349
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:24,979
Think on it. He getting taken out.
Car gonna crash.

350
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,552
Now, where that put you at?

351
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,560
Besides you don't wanna be shooting
across your driver, do you?

352
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,653
All right, so come in easy.

353
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,995
They ain't gonna be looking for you
'cause we gonna have they full attention.

354
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,559
And, look, pick your targets,
drop them and move out quick.

355
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,668
- Who driving?
- I'm under the wheel.

356
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,241
All right, you make sure you slow down
at the end of the block...

357
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,434
and toss your weapons.

358
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,002
And get rid of any shell casings
that kick back in the car.

359
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,604
Police can trace them shits.

360
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,445
- Toss the gloves, too, right?
- No, hold on to them.

361
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,952
They're gonna have that DNA shit
all on them.

362
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,989
All right, look, it's gonna take us some time
to get set up...

363
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,184
so we need y'all to lay back
about four or five blocks.

364
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,956
And when we ready,
we're gonna hit you on the burner...

365
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,930
but y'all hold tight till I call you.
You got it?

366
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,625
We gonna handle our end.

367
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,862
You just make sure there's some
fucking work left out there for us...

368
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,531
'cause I don't wanna feel
like I'm just some damn decoy.

369
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,403
Damn right about that.

370
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:21,538
It's just to relocate, no big deal.

371
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:23,506
I'm not asking for
round-the-clock protection...

372
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:26,544
- or anything like that.
- No big deal? Come on, Bunny...

373
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:28,773
where the fuck am I gonna find a house
for this old broad?

374
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,610
I got one already.

375
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,411
It's a foreclosure up on the Harford Road.

376
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:34,543
All you gotta do
is file the emergency petition...

377
00:26:34,654 --> 00:26:36,622
my boys'll move her in.

378
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:40,952
And she's witnessing against
a violent drug crew.

379
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,426
Without her cooperation,
I doubt if it'll go forward.

380
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,156
She's 73 years old.

381
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,299
Brave old broad to be doing this,
I guess, but...

382
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,663
Come on, Ray.

383
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:52,067
Look, we just lost a witness in a drug case.

384
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:54,833
We don't wanna lose another one so quick.

385
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:01,374
If Rawls gets wind of this,
you forged my signature.

386
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,849
Where is she living now, anyway?

387
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:07,078
She's on Vincent Street, Sector Two.

388
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:10,417
- It's a bad location, huh?
- You wouldn't believe it.

389
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:18,587
We should wait for the call.

390
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:20,325
Man, what if that crew got lookouts?

391
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:23,527
Motherfucker, if we wait,
it'll be all over time we get there.

392
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:27,402
Man, plus, look, man, I'm saying
how's that gonna play with Avon, man?

393
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:29,532
They taking all the credit.

394
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,684
Yo, fellas, strap up.

395
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:59,193
There go that motherfucker Nay-Nay, man.
I say we take him.

396
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:02,968
- We should wait for the call.
- Man, we wait, he gonna get away, man.

397
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:08,477
Go, go, go!

398
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:17,917
Get out, get out!

399
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:19,491
Motherfucker!

400
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,807
What the fuck?

401
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:47,415
Didn't I say something
about waiting for a fucking phone call?

402
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:04,230
You know how you blow off half
the invitations you get to be somewhere?

403
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:07,135
Ribbon cuttings, playground clean-ups
and shit?

404
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,206
I got to. No choice.

405
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:09,865
I was gonna cut out on one the other day.

406
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,568
It was a fundraiser for the Delta Phis,
you know?

407
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:13,838
But I drag-ass over to the Forum
to show the flag.

408
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,311
And who was there in his ironsides
but old Odell Watkins.

409
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:18,777
The rainmaker himself.

410
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:23,048
Yeah, talking in public about being
kind of disappointed in the Mayor.

411
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:26,457
Disappointed. Yeah?

412
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:30,392
- Like how?
- Like sincerely disappointed.

413
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,130
The way you'd be with one of your kids.

414
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:35,462
Like he really wanted
to see the Mayor pressed, you know?

415
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:36,865
Got me thinking.

416
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:39,460
Maybe somebody can take a run at Royce
in next year's primary.

417
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:42,006
Like who? Madam Council President?

418
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,869
Well, Mickey Pepper
would give him a fight.

419
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:48,913
No, Mick's already said he doesn't want
to leave the legislature. He won't risk it.

420
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:51,381
Well, you gotta have someone with balls.

421
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:53,179
And somebody black.

422
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:56,412
This being Baltimore and all.

423
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,192
- How many y'all take?
- Two.

424
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,624
Didn't get nearly a shot off.

425
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:12,029
Speak to the quality of Barksdale people.

426
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,402
He's gonna have to come back at you.

427
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:16,099
You know it ain't gonna stop at this.

428
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,675
I don't want it to stop.

429
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:19,472
Barksdale weak today.

430
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,941
And he ain't working
with the ammunition I got.

431
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,348
No doubt, you carrying a full clip.

432
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:30,183
But what you gonna do
when you sitting at the head of the table?

433
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,190
Once you there, you got to hold it down.

434
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:37,919
Sound like one of them good problems.

435
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,054
Yeah.

436
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,429
Prison and graveyards...

437
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:43,664
full of boys who wore the crown.

438
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,498
Point is, they wore it.

439
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:47,595
It's my turn to wear it now.

440
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:51,800
We're gonna do this, right, Chris?

441
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:55,074
- Gonna do this, son.
- It's ready like yesterday, dawg.

442
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,049
Want a white T's, man?

443
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,945
Need to get yourself a white T, dawg.

444
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:05,691
So you working your plan, huh, Bubs?

445
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:08,055
Dollar here, dollar there, Kima.

446
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:10,527
So, what's up? Why you call?

447
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:12,028
Was just checking in.

448
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:15,066
You're still interested
in that boy, Marlo, right?

449
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:16,725
No?

450
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:20,095
You wanna keep getting paid, you need
to get your ass up to Park Heights...

451
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:23,869
school yourself on that Jamaican
named Kintel got them corners.

452
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,442
Kintel, huh?

453
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:29,841
My bosses don't give a fuck about Marlo.
Stringer's people neither.

454
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,110
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

455
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,114
'Cause now we got a whole lot of drama.

456
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,209
What happened?

457
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:37,255
That young buck, Marlo,
ain't getting runned off.

458
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,450
He just dropped two of Barksdale soldiers
on the corner of Mount and Fayette.

459
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,459
- Two hours past.
- What?

460
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:44,529
Corners is all jumping bad.

461
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,224
I thought Marlo had them corners
for Stringer. We saw them meet.

462
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,493
I don't know what you saw.

463
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:51,069
All I know is Marlo is flying his own colors.

464
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,502
West Side's about to be
all Baghdad and shit.

465
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,670
But y'all looking for Jake,
what's his name? Kintel?

466
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:00,610
Y'all are too fickle with Bubs, man. I swear.

467
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:04,040
A little gift for you and your boys.

468
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,378
Call me.

469
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,486
Whitey sale! Whitey sale!

470
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:13,390
Deputy, I am aware of the incident
and my men are on it.

471
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:15,653
We called in the 7-to-3 flex squad early...

472
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,388
and my DEU is out canvassing.

473
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:19,191
<i>And what do we know?</i>

474
00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:23,598
Only that it seems to be rival gangs.
But, what does homicide have?

475
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,101
<i>Fuck homicide.</i>

476
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,263
<i>I'm asking you</i>
<i>for answers right now, Major.</i>

477
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:29,637
- Sir, my men...
<i>- And you damn sure have none.</i>

478
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,266
My men are out there...

479
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:38,683
What do we know
that we can actually tell the man?

480
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:40,445
It's like you said. Rival gangs.

481
00:32:40,553 --> 00:32:42,077
No, which gangs?

482
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,621
Gangs. Assholes who don't like each other.

483
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:53,496
I'm sorry, Major, but we got nothing on it.

484
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:07,268
Play it. It don't make me no never mind.

485
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:08,971
It's all about trumps.

486
00:33:14,353 --> 00:33:15,786
Evening, Omar.

487
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:19,549
Evening, Bruiser.

488
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,923
Speaking of them trumps now.

489
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:35,640
Hey, everybody.

490
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,308
What's for dinner, Jen? I'm starving.

491
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:41,879
It's working.

492
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,811
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing, beautiful?

493
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:52,090
Daddy, we shared with you.

494
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,354
That's nice.

495
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:56,551
Hey, Jen, you seen that tape
I was watching last night?

496
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,596
I don't know what you're talking about.

497
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:00,164
You gotta see this.

498
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:02,734
Videotape from last Monday night's
Council meeting.

499
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:05,668
Keiffer tried to block my resolution,
but I laid him out good.

500
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,705
I was in rare form, baby.

501
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,371
- You seen that tape?
- Maybe you left it in the VCR?

502
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:16,347
What? Son of a bitch!

503
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:20,582
- Who the hell...
- Daddy, Franky shared...

504
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,313
his sandwich with you.

505
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:26,084
We hid it so no one else could eat it
before you came home.

506
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:37,694
Can I get some chips
and pickles with that, too?

507
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:43,070
I don't want to disrespect you.

508
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,971
String been good to me, you know?

509
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,603
Not just my bills.

510
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:51,512
Him and Avon
probably think they owe me that much.

511
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:55,317
And it ain't what people might be thinking
or saying, either.

512
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:57,150
What they saying, honey?

513
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:59,349
It ain't like I don't miss D.

514
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,285
I do.

515
00:35:02,428 --> 00:35:05,124
Yeah, well, I miss him, too.

516
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:09,263
- But he's been gone a while now.
- More than a year.

517
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,462
Stringer's fine.

518
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,898
No denying that.

519
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:20,175
I feel safe around him.

520
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:25,113
You asking to get with String...

521
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:28,179
I'm okay with that.

522
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:31,314
Thought you was gonna be mad.

523
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,793
I mean, everything with D
is so messed up, you know?

524
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,658
I mean, every time I think about <i>it...</i>

525
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,359
And you know this one police...

526
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:46,302
he came by here
and brought it all up again.

527
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,572
- Who did?
- Police detective from the city.

528
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:54,134
The one tried to turn D on Avon
when he got pulled up in Jersey.

529
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:55,774
White boy?

530
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,878
- Bushy hair?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,475
What'd he say?

532
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,654
What'd he say?

533
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,987
He said...

534
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:09,584
maybe D'Angelo didn't <i>take...</i>

535
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,026
You know.

536
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:13,956
Take his own life.

537
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:17,468
He said maybe it was something else.

538
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,996
And he came to you with that?

539
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,334
Left his card here one day...

540
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:25,433
but I didn't say nothing to the man.

541
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:27,569
Just told Stringer, is all.

542
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:36,980
She's gonna run for Council?

543
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:38,549
She is.

544
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,723
Probably win, too, if I know her.

545
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,122
And you're the proud husband?

546
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:53,368
Not sure how that makes me feel.

547
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,699
It's just for show
until the election next year.

548
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:02,171
A city police lieutenant looks good
on her arm.

549
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:04,539
Who even cares anymore?

550
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,049
Half the country are separated.

551
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:08,517
The other half are getting divorced
for the second time.

552
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,645
This is a favor. For her.

553
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,255
It's hard to explain.

554
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,767
Look, I disappointed her.

555
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:31,305
She lived through me for a lot of years...

556
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:34,310
telling herself I was tracked
for Deputy Commissioner at worst...

557
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:37,109
and past the police department,
who knows?

558
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:39,314
And there were some things that
happened a long time ago...

559
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:41,215
when I was in Eastern.

560
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:44,790
I guess she wanted more out of me.

561
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,449
I guess she wanted more out of me.

562
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:48,693
And after a lot of years and a lot of plans...

563
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:51,355
it turns out I have a better head
for police work...

564
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:53,363
than I do for climbing the ladder.

565
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:57,561
She hung in there thinking my career was
going to turn into some kind of big deal.

566
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:00,968
And I probably let her believe it
just to keep peace.

567
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:04,639
Now she wants to be the big deal.

568
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:08,738
What do you want?

569
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,214
I just don't want to disappoint her anymore.

570
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:18,721
And right now...

571
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:21,190
I'm more help
showing up at some chicken dinner...

572
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:23,124
in my wedding ring and dress blues...

573
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:25,093
than being
the not-even-divorced-yet husband...

574
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,427
with the white woman on his arm.

575
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:41,469
I'm going to do what I can to see
she gets what she wants this time around.

576
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,104
Nothing more than that.

577
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,086
Last seen Gerard, man,
he was racing bullets up on Fayette Street.

578
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:50,678
He appeared to be winning, too.

579
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,757
Look, man, till he shows back up here...

580
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:54,519
we ain't gonna know
what happened out there.

581
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:57,322
I damn sure know one fucking thing
for sure.

582
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:00,193
Two of our people chalked
and we ain't got shit to show for it.

583
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,496
Man, police gonna be real heavy
on this, man. I say we slow down...

584
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,194
take our time to build our muscle...

585
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,670
No, I ain't got no more
motherfucking time, man!

586
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:11,265
When the word come out this boy, Marlo,
punking me, what I'm gonna look like?

587
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:13,003
I'm gonna go do this shit my damn self.

588
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,908
No, man, you just this minute got home.

589
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:17,777
Your name come up in a murder beef, man,
they gonna pull your parole.

590
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:18,872
Let me take care of this.

591
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,349
We was thinking, man, me and Cutty...

592
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:22,443
you know what I'm saying,
we could hit at them ourselves, man.

593
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:24,385
That way there won't be no fuck-ups.

594
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,287
Look, you two niggas get on it, man.

595
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:30,384
And get it right.

596
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,560
You see how shit have to be handled, man?

597
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:39,296
The game is the fucking game. Period.

598
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:41,468
Same as it ever was.

599
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:45,032
I don't know though, man. I <i>mean...</i>

600
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:51,909
I <i>mean...</i>

601
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,645
I don't know, I was just down the way
with one of our young'uns...

602
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:58,917
on Vincent Street where they got the,
you know, the empty houses over there.

603
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,992
And they got crews over there...

604
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:04,085
twirling dope and coke
like the shit was candy.

605
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,090
Kids with a lemonade stand.
It's a different world down there.

606
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,636
Like the cops was just standing around
like that shit was...

607
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:13,029
legal.

608
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:14,433
I mean...

609
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,334
every day.

610
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:18,975
Now, that shit was business.

611
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,147
What you saying, man? What's up?

612
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:32,321
Nothing, man.

613
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,526
Nothing at all.

614
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,265
Our CI tells us those are Stringer's people.

615
00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:42,629
You want us to be about bodies,
now we are.

616
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,531
We had this kid, Marlo,
working for Stringer...

617
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:45,796
but that might be wrong.

618
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:48,600
He might be going to war for those corners.

619
00:40:58,317 --> 00:40:59,841
Let me be clear.

620
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,685
This is no longer about Stringer Bell...

621
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:05,484
or Kintel fucking Williamson
or any of them.

622
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,923
What is my rank, Detective Greggs?

623
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,555
- My rank!
- Lieutenant, sir.

624
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:15,866
What is my rank, Detective McNulty?

625
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:24,574
If you can't remember that much,
then you can go the hell back to narcotics.

626
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:28,305
And you can go to whatever the hell unit
will still have you.

627
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:30,745
Now get the fuck out of my office.

628
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:01,375
Your message said you'd be here.

629
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:07,508
Still, kind of thought it'd be one of
your minions showed up in the flesh.

630
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:10,582
You called on some of my people's people.

631
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,053
I was just working.

632
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,894
Doing what a man is supposed to do.

633
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,221
Well, I know you been busy.

634
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:25,059
Caught some talk from them young men
you rousted over there on the West Side.

635
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:29,002
That was about a gun belonged to a police.

636
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,403
Yeah, caught some talk about that, too.

637
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:37,381
This here, it's about something else.

638
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,280
Girl by the name of Tosha
who got her head blown off in a firefight.

639
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:50,258
If you're not here to cooperate,
then why are you here?

640
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:57,027
Okay, I could just pull up
that other girl from your squad.

641
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:59,333
She ain't gonna talk to you.

642
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:01,269
Ain't nobody gonna talk to you.

643
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,307
I just came here to make that clear, man.

644
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:04,875
Ain't no thing.

645
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:07,575
'Cause I already got me an eyeball wit.

646
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:08,839
You do?

647
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:10,881
I don't know about that.

648
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:14,713
Old Bruiser, he be blind
behind that fortified half the time.

649
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,085
Shit, you gonna have to dry him out
just to get him on the stand.

650
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,159
Besides, he done had a change of heart
to that story.

651
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:23,022
That's what I heard anyway.

652
00:43:23,128 --> 00:43:26,131
Shit, past that, y'all gonna have to call
this one of them...

653
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:27,063
Shit, past that, y'all gonna have to call
this one of them...

654
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:30,892
cost-of-doing-business things
y'all police be talking about all the time.

655
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:32,264
You feel me?

656
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,769
No taxpayers.

657
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:37,308
Shoot, the way y'all look on things,
ain't no victim to even speak on.

658
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,138
Bullshit, boy. No victim?

659
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,235
I just came
from Tosha's people, remember?

660
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:43,280
All this death,
you don't think that ripples out?

661
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:46,441
You don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

662
00:43:49,488 --> 00:43:51,456
I was a few years ahead of you
at Edmondson.

663
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:54,855
But I know you remember
the neighborhood, how it was.

664
00:43:57,229 --> 00:43:59,424
We had some bad boys for real.

665
00:44:01,132 --> 00:44:02,929
Wasn't about guns...

666
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:06,068
so much as knowing
what to do with your hands.

667
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:08,435
Those boys could really rag.

668
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:15,343
My father...

669
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:18,913
had me on the straight.

670
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:23,880
But, like any young man,
I wanted to be hard, too.

671
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:28,081
So I'd turn up at all the house parties
where the tough boys hung.

672
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,451
Shit, they knew I wasn't one of them.

673
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,429
Them hard cases
would come up to me and say...

674
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:39,402
"Go home, schoolboy,
you don't belong here."

675
00:44:42,507 --> 00:44:45,908
Didn't realize at the time
what they were doing for me.

676
00:44:50,215 --> 00:44:52,877
As rough as that neighborhood could be...

677
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,386
we had us a community.

678
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:59,013
Nobody, no victim, who didn't matter.

679
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:02,290
And now all we got is bodies...

680
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,019
and predatory motherfuckers like you.

681
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,294
And, out where that girl fell,
I saw kids acting like Omar.

682
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:12,799
Calling you by name. Glorifying your ass.

683
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:16,598
Makes me sick, motherfucker,
how far we done fell.

684
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:41,897
$25,000. You don't need more than that
to get it done.

685
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,259
The fuck you say?

686
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:46,496
I'm just telling you
how they do down at zoning and permits.

687
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:48,539
They know you got a general contractor...

688
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,403
and his people out there
sitting on they ass.

689
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:52,772
They know you paying twice that
every week they sit.

690
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:54,936
$25,000 gets me the permits?

691
00:45:55,747 --> 00:45:57,806
$20,000 gets you the permits.

692
00:45:58,116 --> 00:46:01,608
$5,000 is for me
for bribing these downtown motherfuckers.

693
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,221
I mean, I'm the one got to risk
walking up to these thieving bitches...

694
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:07,314
with cash in hand, right?

695
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:09,491
I'm telling you, String...

696
00:46:09,594 --> 00:46:11,619
the people running the city nowadays...

697
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,290
they make the last bunch look sanctified.

698
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,697
I mean, this some shameful shit.

699
00:46:27,445 --> 00:46:29,072
Permits come when?

700
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:31,540
Monday. Latest.

701
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:44,495
Spider bags! Green tops.

702
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:45,993
Spider bags!

703
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,395
Cut, that's him.

704
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:49,993
Fool.

705
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,103
Spider bags! Green tops.

706
00:46:53,204 --> 00:46:55,604
- Yo, I know that nigga, man.
- Yeah?

707
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,642
- Owe me money, actually.
- Yeah?

708
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,611
Spider bags. Green tops.

709
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,910
- She ain't say it like that.
- Spider bags. Green tops.

710
00:47:07,018 --> 00:47:10,181
No, she say it like she wanna
get pregnant and shit. Hold on.

711
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,550
You all right?

712
00:47:38,717 --> 00:47:39,775
Damn!

713
00:47:39,951 --> 00:47:43,182
I opened up too early, man.
I stepped on your shot.

714
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:45,384
Come on, let's roll.

715
00:47:49,027 --> 00:47:51,860
Hey, yo, there go five-o right there, yo.

716
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,721
- Yeah, I know. It's nothing.
- Huh?

717
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:57,063
The cops be letting niggas
grind down here.

718
00:47:57,168 --> 00:48:00,194
It's all...
Get the fuck out of here, little hoppers.

719
00:48:00,305 --> 00:48:01,636
Get the fuck out of here, son.

720
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,367
Who are these little niggas?

721
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:05,705
Hey, yo, what if they lock us up?

722
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:08,069
I hope y'all got toothbrushes.

723
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:09,441
'Cause down in Boys' Village...

724
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,276
you know what I'm saying,
if you don't have no toothbrush...

725
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:13,213
you gonna be using
some other boy's brush...

726
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:15,513
or rubbing your teeth
with your damn finger.

727
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,481
If you don't get locked up...

728
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:20,183
y'all can keep
an extra $20 each off the pack.

729
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:22,988
All right.

730
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,294
- Who got that fire, baby? That fire.
- WMD!

731
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:33,636
Come on, Tommy, give it up already.

732
00:48:33,738 --> 00:48:36,434
Look, Terri, you gotta do this for me.

733
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:40,303
Tell me why you wanna be mayor.
And why should I vote for you over Royce?

734
00:48:40,411 --> 00:48:43,471
'Cause something is wrong in that city
and I think I can fix it.

735
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:46,880
This guy, he don't give a shit
about tackling the problems.

736
00:48:46,985 --> 00:48:49,146
Crime is out of fucking control.

737
00:48:49,254 --> 00:48:51,722
Last week, a kid witness in a drug case...

738
00:48:51,823 --> 00:48:53,757
turns up shot dead
because of flaws in the system.

739
00:48:53,858 --> 00:48:55,621
I go to the Mayor who promises action.

740
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,958
And then Mr. "Reform is more than
the watchword of my administration"...

741
00:48:59,063 --> 00:49:01,531
pats me on the ass,
thanks me for my concern...

742
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:03,362
points me out the door. The end.

743
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:05,993
So, with crime as the issue...

744
00:49:06,104 --> 00:49:08,732
the great white father rides to the rescue...

745
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,742
against a black incumbent mayor,
in a city that's 65% black?

746
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:15,472
Black, white, green, people are pissed off.

747
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,445
What makes you think this is doable?

748
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:21,451
One, I hear the Mayor's got problems
in his base and with key supporters.

749
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:23,678
Two, I got the Police Commissioner...

750
00:49:23,788 --> 00:49:27,349
Royce's own man, telling me all kinds
of stuff about his fucked-up department...

751
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,925
and about Royce's inner circle.

752
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:31,518
And three, Tony Gray,
from the Fifth District...

753
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:34,757
comes pretty close to telling me
he's thinking about a run for mayor.

754
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,891
That'd split the black vote.

755
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
You'd still need a player
who gives the black middle class...

756
00:49:40,205 --> 00:49:42,230
permission to vote
against one of their own.

757
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,035
You got one of those in your pocket?

758
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:46,110
Not many of those around.

759
00:49:47,045 --> 00:49:48,213
Elijah?

760
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:51,513
Congressional Black Caucus
ain't gonna save your skinny white ass.

761
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:54,380
What about Odell Watkins?

762
00:49:54,485 --> 00:49:56,009
Well, it's funny you should mention him...

763
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,283
'cause I don't think he's too happy
with the Mayor right now.

764
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,587
I don't know. I hear a new poll
shows Royce's negatives pretty high.

765
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:05,162
You'd have to raise a load of dough.

766
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:15,605
He has to see it. I know he sees it.

767
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:20,042
It's past that now.
It's about us showing some respect.

768
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:21,771
Oh, fuck respect.

769
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:24,774
- He ain't right.
- No, he ain't.

770
00:50:24,883 --> 00:50:29,149
But at this point, with you on the other side
of the argument, he'd rather be wrong.

771
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:31,984
Maybe if the word came down
from on high...

772
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:34,414
it might change his mind.

773
00:50:37,562 --> 00:50:38,790
I mean...

774
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:42,399
if your friend Bunny Colvin's up to his ass
in bodies...

775
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,094
I bet he'd take all the help he can get.

776
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,401
Not that you'd ever go behind
anybody's back or anything like that.

777
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:55,038
Right?

778
00:50:58,116 --> 00:50:59,276
No way.

779
00:51:00,151 --> 00:51:02,210
Two more murders yesterday.

780
00:51:02,587 --> 00:51:04,782
Another three today...

781
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:07,257
including a 14-year-old.

782
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:09,019
We're doing all we can.

783
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:11,755
You're at 260 for the year...

784
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:13,262
and it's barely October.

785
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:17,095
You promised me 275 or under, Erv.
I had that as a promise.

786
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:19,999
- Sir...
- We see 300 before the New Year...

787
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:23,562
and I'm not sure that I can justify
a full term for you.

788
00:51:23,741 --> 00:51:26,107
Now, I hate to say it, but there it is.

789
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,109
Barksdale's people and who?

790
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:36,912
Marlo Stanfield. It's the new kid.

791
00:51:37,288 --> 00:51:39,586
We've been on him a couple weeks.

792
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:42,722
I thought Daniels' people
are up in the Northwest.

793
00:51:43,328 --> 00:51:45,990
Look, your war's
only gonna get worse, Major.

794
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:50,360
Northwest has been quiet for weeks.

795
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:56,407
You willing to backdoor your lieutenant
like this, huh?

796
00:51:57,909 --> 00:51:59,877
You ain't changed, Jimmy.

797
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:02,570
Shit.

798
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:05,979
It's always about your case, huh?

799
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:08,980
Do what you can.

800
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:16,490
Keep my name out of it.

801
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:34,273
How'd it go?

802
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:36,813
We got one of the two
of them motherfuckers, you know?

803
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:39,747
You mean, you motherfuckers come
strolling in here all walking tall and shit...

804
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:41,409
Yo, B, man, I'm saying, man...

805
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,044
we was blazing on them dudes.
Man, you know what I'm saying?

806
00:52:44,155 --> 00:52:46,385
Just got in the heat, man.
We was blazing, though.

807
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:48,254
- It was like...
- All right, all right. Relax, man.

808
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:50,190
I already heard. Go sit down.

809
00:52:50,294 --> 00:52:51,693
I'm not tweaking behind none of this.

810
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:54,321
That's one less motherfucker
that's breathing than was yesterday.

811
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:56,093
You know what I'm saying? So we all good.

812
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,159
But I'm surprised at you, though, man.
Shit didn't get by you back when.

813
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:04,367
Wasn't my man's fault, man.
I unloaded on the young'un too soon, man.

814
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:06,734
Gave him enough room
to buck and run, man.

815
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:09,904
- I fucked that shit up myself, you know.
- Hold on.

816
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:14,848
It's on me.

817
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:18,048
I had that kid in my sights...

818
00:53:18,356 --> 00:53:22,122
close enough to take off his Kangol
and half his dome with it.

819
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:25,622
Couldn't squeeze the trigger.

820
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:28,658
Couldn't do it, man.

821
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:32,862
Why not?

822
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:37,870
Wasn't in me, I guess.

823
00:53:39,977 --> 00:53:42,775
You know, whatever it is in you...

824
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:46,709
that lets you flow like you flowing...

825
00:53:47,518 --> 00:53:48,951
do that thing.

826
00:53:49,754 --> 00:53:51,619
It ain't in me no more.

827
00:53:59,397 --> 00:54:00,625
All right.

828
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:03,626
So you done soldiering, but you ain't done.

829
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:05,497
Could use you
for what you got in your head.

830
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:07,571
We're gonna put you on a corner,
you could be inside...

831
00:54:07,672 --> 00:54:08,866
No, man.

832
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:11,434
I ain't making myself clear.

833
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:14,873
The game ain't in me no more. None of it.

834
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:29,117
But you ain't done shit else.

835
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:31,488
You know what I'm saying?
So what you gonna do?

836
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:32,927
I don't know.

837
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,293
But it can't be this.

838
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:41,364
All right then. We straight.

839
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:49,912
- See you.
- See you.

840
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:02,785
B, he was a man in his time, you know?

841
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:04,952
Yeah.

842
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:07,263
He a man today.

843
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,028
He a man.

844
00:55:21,546 --> 00:55:23,571
Any idea what this is about?

845
00:55:28,386 --> 00:55:29,717
Lieutenant.

846
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:41,256
What's he got in his head, right?

847
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:46,159
Here he is, Bunny.

848
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:51,334
Cedric Daniels to the rescue.

849
00:55:53,244 --> 00:55:54,802
Man of the hour.
